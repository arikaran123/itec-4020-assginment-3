Compile the classes:
Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where your Java files are saved. Use the javac command to compile the Indexer.java and SearchIndex.java classes. To do this, run the following commands:

**javac itec4020assg3/Indexer.java
javac itec4020assg3/SearchIndex.java**
These commands will create the .class files for both classes, which can then be run.

Index the documents:
To index the documents, you need to run the Indexer class. To do this, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

**java itec4020assg3.Indexer**
This will start the indexing process and create an index of the documents.

Search the indexed documents:
To search the indexed documents, you need to run the SearchIndex class. To do this, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

**java itec4020assg3.SearchIndex**
This will start the search process and allow you to enter search queries to retrieve relevant documents.

Note: If the file paths used in the code do not match the location of your files on your computer, you will need to update them accordingly.
