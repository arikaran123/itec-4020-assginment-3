(MP).- After longdiscussions, a blue southern cross with a green under stroke on aclear background was finally chosen as the seal of the Mercosurtrade block and officially inaugurated during the presidentialsummit held in the north of Brazil on December 17th. Argentinedelegates objected the seal because the southern cross hasbasically four stars and could be interpreted as a closedorganisation with only its four original members (Argentina,Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay), leaving aside new associatemembers such as Chile and from next May, Bolivia. Uruguayan andBrazilian delegates on the other hand argued that the southerncross is a constellation of stars with the four brightestrepresenting the original country members. Finally it was agreedthat the seal, "if necessary could be modernised in thefuture", as more stars (countries) are definitivelyincorporated to the group. The seal was chosen by a jury of eight(two for each member country) among 1.412 presentations with a10.000 US dollars prize for the winner, an Argentine artist. BOLIVIA BECOMES AN ASSOCIATE MEMBER FORTALEZA.(MP).- Bolivia became an associate member of Mercosurand the official integration will take place as of next May oncethe different parliaments ratify the agreements reached in thepresidential summit held in the Brazilian city of Fortaleza. Lastminute negotiations opened the doors to an understanding which inthe previous days seemed hard to reach because of the differenceswith Argentina over a long list of products the Bolivians wantedto privilege with a long term reduction of tariffs such astextiles and agricultural commodities. "We're happy withwhat was agreed, otherwise we wouldn't have signed",said Bolivian president Gonzalo S�nchez de Lozada, in spite ofhaving to step back in many of his country's original demands.After Chile last October, and Bolivia in May, the next candidatefor an association with Mercosur is oil rich Venezuela, which hasalready requested to become a member and is quiet advanced in thenegotiations. Brasilia is particularly interested in Venezuelasince Mercosur so far has only benefited the southern states ofBrazil next to Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. With Venezuela,(in the north of South America), many of the poor states ofnorth-east Brazil could have direct access to an important marketfor industrial goods. Brazil is aggressively promoting industrialinvestments in the area to combat poverty and also wants todiversify its oil dependency by increasing imports fromVenezuela.

Aid for the new bank has beenpromised by the World Bank, the Interamerican Development Bankand the Japanese government. Deregulation of regional flights wasdecided to promote direct links between medium and small citiesof the six countries which at present can only be reached by stepflying through the main international airports of the area innever ending trips. Direct scheduling between regional airportswill not interfere the main bilateral agreements. FinallyMontevideo was confirmed as the permanent location for theMercosur Secretariat, which will have an initial budget of 1,2million US dollars and will be headed until 1999 by UruguayanAmbassador Jorge Fern�ndez Reyes. TRADE UNIONS COORDINATE FIRST EVERSTOPPAGE IN THE REGION BRASILIA. (MP).-Integration spirit is not only limited to government and businessdecisions: trade unions of the six Mercosur countries have asupranational co-ordinating committee and coinciding with theFortaleza presidential summit they organised a relativelysuccessful general stoppage of several hours.

During the presidential summit,representatives of the main eight Mercosur workers unions, plusan American representative for the American Workers Federationand the Congress of Industrial Organisations, held a meeting inFortaleza and released a document with a list of common demands.Top of the list was the creation of mechanisms for collectivenegotiations on working conditions and salaries at Mercosurlevel, plus more legal space in the block's decision makingprocess, for social organisations including non governmentorganisations (NGO).

(MP).- The"omb�", the magnificent tree which grows andoutstands solitarily in the pampas and Southamerican grasslands,has been selected as the symbol of cultural integration forMercosur. The Education and Culture Ministers of the fourfounding countries agreed on the omb� sketch during a meeting inUruguay and decided it will be used to identify all culturalassets, facilitating their circulation through Customs and PostOffices of the different country members. The cultural logotypeincludes two "omb�" outlines, one blue andred, another green and yellow, which overlap, on a whitebackground and with the inscription Mercosur Cultural in black.The novelty of the symbol is that when the two outlines areoverlapped into a single figure the inscription can becomeMercosul, which is the Portuguese translation of Mercosur. So thenew cultural symbol includes several integration factors such asthe colour of the banners and the two languages, Spanish andPortuguese.

Theannouncement was made by Andrew Gurr, CEO of the islands, whosaid the decision followed a recommendation by a team of Britishexperts who made a special report on the terms and employmentconditions of the Civil Service. The program already has the support fromall the elected members of the Legislative Council, and consistsof three consecutive annual vouchers of � 315 which will then beexchanged for a round fare, equivalent to � 940, which is thecost of traveling to Britain via Ascension Island on the RAF TriStar. To fly through Punta Arenas/Santiago on DAP/British Airwayscosts an additional � 25, but islanders will be able to choose. The Hay report describes the vacationsinitiative as a necessary "cultural opening",while Andrew Gurr considered it the best way to distribute wealthamong islanders. "We can't enforce a negativeincome tax system, but we can make a fair distribution of thegrowing income from fishing, both among those who work for thegovernment and those who don't", said Gurr. Since the enforcement of the fishingexclusion zone round the islands in 1985, the Falklands have hadannual budget surplus and reserves invested in Britain exceed 180million US dollars for a population of just 2.300 islanders. But both Mr. Gurr and several Councilors,as well as the Hay report, do not deny a political motive alsobehind the decision: to increase and perpetuate the strong linkswith Britain. Nor surprisingly the decision was takenwhen the islands are in the threshold of a possible oil bonanzaand when the Foreign Office is pressing the islands for a gradual"normalization" of links with Argentina.

Since early ageAlexander had to make a living carrying peat to help his parents,but not Terry who suffered constant health problems. In 1982 Alexander was working for theArgentine air link and left the islands with the defeated troops.He established in C�rdoba and married a local girl. Terryremained in the Falklands, took advantage of the fishing boom andnow is a very prosperous businessman. They never met again until 1987 in theUnited Nations, in New York but in opposite sides: Terry as aCouncillor and member of the British delegation before theDecolonization Committee, Alexander attacking British colonialismand exploitation of the Falklands. Nine years later Terry was present inArgentina for the annual Argentine British Conference held inSalta, and both brothers were able to meet again, this time inBuenos Aires. The motive: their father's recent death andAlexander's birthday. Alexander still has a similar job andcomplained bitterly about the hard living conditions now a daysin Argentina. But he remains as convinced as ever of Argentina'smore legitimate rights over the islands, while Terry insists thatrights belong to those living in the Falklands for the last 163years. What was the final score? Both shareddrinks to celebrate Alexander's birthday, but also agreed topolitely disagree on the Falklands issue.

(MP).- Great Britainand Argentina will be launching the oil exploration licensinground in the special joint cooperation area in the South Atlanticduring 1997. Seismic surveying licenses will be extended to allthose companies interested before the end of 1996. The agreement was reached during anunscheduled meeting of Argentine Foreign Affairs Minister, GuidoDi Tella with Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind in London, duringthe second week of November. According to a spokesperson from theForeign Office a coming meeting of the Hydrocarbons JointCommittee of the South Atlantic to be held in early December inLondon, will "be crucial for the discussions over thelicensing terms which are making great progress". Thespecial cooperation refers to the area where waters of theFalklands and Argentina overlap. But contrary to oil, in fisheries there wasno advance. Nevertheless both sides agreed to continue addressingthe issue: Britain insisting on a long term agreement, Argentinaon including South Georgia to the Falklands conservation andmonitoring discussions. And even if the Foreign Office spokespersonunderlined that the "moment is not right for apresidential visit", in reference to the long announcedvisit of the Argentine President to Britain, both ForeignSecretaries did agree on two visits of next of kin relatives tothe Argentine cemetery in Darwin, before next February.

(MP).- A future ofindependence, or leading to some form of autonomy to be decidedby the islanders, having both Great Britain and Argentina asguarantors, is the essence of the paper which is being informallycirculated in Argentina, Great Britain and the Falklands. The man responsible for the draft proposalis Alistair Forsyth, a merchant banker, member of the ArgentineBritish Conference, who has taken to heart the South Atlanticdispute. One of the basic arguments of the paper isthat the 163 years old conflict won't be solved to completesatisfaction of any of the sides involved. Another the growingsense of identity and confidence developed by the noweconomically autonomous islanders which could convince them tobreak away from the motherly protection of Britain. "A strong, brave politicalleadership from both Argentina and Britain could help find a wayto overcome with honour for all parts, the ever present potentialfor crisis", says Forsyth. During a transition period of ten to twentyyears both Argentina and Britain would have a presence in theislands helping to preserve a very unique way of life andcollaborating with the preparations for independence. At a pre-established date both guarantorswould leave the islands, meaning the end of the colony, and thelocal population can then decide and strongly develop their ownfuture. Forsyth believes links and trade with thecontinent would be normalized and the islands would benefit fromall that the Argentines have to offer them. "Argentina during these last yearshas shown pragmatism, political maturity and unequal boldness toreform the society and change long established beliefs; whyshould they not accept the Forsyth paper for discussion?".

(MP).- A 30 pagespaper titled "Future of agriculture in the Falklands",which is a summary on the many reports on farming, a mostcontroversial issue in the islands, was finally released by theLegislative Council. The paper written by CEO Andrew Gurrunderlines the idea that agriculture is the "long termprize for the islands" since once fishing and oil areover, farming will be the only resource available. From this basic idea the report describes asignificant list of recommendations to develop an alternativeagriculture, taking advantage of new technologies, such asimprovement of pastures, crops, trees, legumes, cattle breeding,wool classification, fertilizers, genetic engineering, etc.. But also taking into account livingconditions in the Camp to ensure a balanced development in allthe islands, and that consumer prices, for example, are nothigher than in Port Stanley like at present.

An American nine seats, twin engined LearJet made a 36 hours flight from Jacksonville, Florida to theFalklands and back to pick up an 82 years old American who brokehis hip on a cruise ship. The "Society Explorer"sailing for the South Georgia islands was surprised by a stormand fierce seas in the middle of the South Atlantic leavingseveral people injured and forced to divert to the Falklands.

Rumours had been anticipating what was considered incredible but it so happened, and officials in the islands, Britain and from YPF (the Argentine oil company which is now private) were quick in disactivating any wrong interpretation of the event. "We're a private company and we make our own decisions on the basis of efficiency and commercial criteria, certainly not politicial. Under no way can this be interpreted as a discriminatory action against Argentina", emphasized Nells Le�n YPF's president, as well as Roberto Monti who will be succeding him next April. Anyhow YPF made it quiet clear that if there's a new licencing round to the north of the islands, the company will bid again and obviously will also partipate when the joint bidding of the so called Special Area is convened. The special cooperation area is to the west of the islands where border lines with Argentina overlap, and is the result of last year's September Oil Understanding agreed in the United Nations between Prime Minister John Major and President Carlos Menem. The area will be jointly explored and exploited between both countries. Both Governor Ralph and CEO Andrew Gurr pointed out that the Argentine-British consortium lost because they didn't meet the requirements and concentrated their interest in the two most popular tranches, but added that they expect an Argentine participation in future rounds. A similar message came from the British Ambassador in Buenos Aires Peter Hall who said that: "our policy and the islands policy is of open doors to Argentine companies, but that will depend on the commercial and technical level of the bids". The Argentine Foreign Office also received the consortium's exclusion calmly, in spite of the setback that this could mean for the present approachment policy towards the islands and islanders. "The British government gave us assurances that commercial reasons exclusively were decisive and that no political circumstances influenced the non allocation of a licence". Nevertheless the Argentine press revealed that in two occasions British diplomacy warned the Argentines that the YPF/British Gas was not sufficient. There was a first attempt to improve it, but on the second time, YPF allegedly simply replied, "this is as far as we'll go". According to the Argentine press reports, "frustration" over YPF/British Gas exclusion was shared by both Foreign Offices. ECONOMIC BONANZA AND DRILLING IN EARLY '98 The population of the Falklands/Malvinas is preparing for what they consider unexpected years of economic bonanza following the very successfull first ever allocation of off shore hydrocarbons exploration licences with the involvement of the some main oil companies of the world. It is estimated that towards the end of the '97 austral summer the first groups of oil industry experts and officials will begin arriving in the islands, and possibly in early '98, the first exploratory drilling could be starting. In this first five years exploratory stage, the licenced companies have promised to invest several hundred millions of dollars which although mostly will be in sophisticated equipment and services, and in the high seas, there will be ample margin for the business talent and capacities of the 2.300 islanders. Several local industries such as construction, hotel and lodging, and supply services are already anticipating a boom while in the camp farmers are offering land on lease next to deep shores for the oil companies to set up their operational bases. Richard Ralph, Governor of the islands said that with the successfull allocation of licences a "potentially momentous day" and far-reaching time begins for the future of the Falklands. The CEO of the islands, Andrew Gurr underlined that the 28th October will become the second most important date in the recent history of the Falklands after the liberation of the islands by British troops on June 14th. 1982. John Martin, former British Petroleum official and one of the main oil experts on contract for the local government indicated that "the enthusiastic response to the Falklands Islands government offer has been most satisfactory, and ensures a vigorous entry of the islands into the oil exploration industry". Phyllis Rendell who was making her official international d�but as Director of the Oil Department explained that at this stage licence revenue will produce very little since companies will be paying an annual fee of 30 US dollars per square kilometer. "But even if hydrocarbons are found, and in interesting volumes, it would take several years before commercial production actually gets rolling, we're looking at the year 2003", said Mrs. Rendell. The Oil Department Director also remembered that between 50 to 60 wells were drilled in the North Sea before oil was discovered. Mrs. Rendell underlined that the islands government will be closely monitoring activity in the licenced tranches with particular emphasis on the protection of the unique natural environment. "Some areas of the blocks will have restricted access at times in order to preserve and protect the marine resources". COMPANIES AWARDED LICENCES TO EXPLORE FOR OIL OFF SHORE On October 28th., early morning, first from Stanley and a few hours later from London, the Falklands/Malvinas government announced the list of companies awarded licences to explore for hydrocarbons off shore the islands. Of the 19 tranches offered, consortiums concentrated their interest in twelve of them, all to the north of the islands, while no bids were made for the other seven to the south. All the company consortiums which participated in the original July 1996 oil round were allocated tranches with the only exception of YPF/British Gas. In the first five years stage of the oil industry development in the islands activity will be concentrated in compiling further and improved information on the allocated basins and the drilling of at least one exploratory well. What follows is how the licences were awarded and their tranches which add upto 12.800 square kilometres, the equivalent of approximately 58 North Sea blocks. TRANCHE A AMERADA HESS Ltd. (Operator).

CONFERENCE IN SALTA RECOMMENDS LIFTING TRAVELL BAN TO ARGENTINES With a consensus recommendation for the normalisation of links between Falklands/Malvinas and Argentina, and an end to the ban on Argentine passports, which the islands' government strongly upholds, concluded the VI Argentine-British Conference, (ABC), which took place in Salta, in the north of Argentina during the last week of October. The ABC meeting, a non government organization created for the improvement of understanding between both countries, had a numerous and distinguished participation. The Argentine delegation was headed by Senator Eduardo Menem while the British included several members of Parliament and influential personalities of politics, business and finance, and academics. With the British delegation came three islanders which were in constant demand and became the central figures of the meeting: Lewis Clifton and Terry Betts, both former Councillors and now in the fishing and oil business, and journalist Graham Bound, founder of the Penguin News and actually Director of the BBC "Calling the Falklands" program. "It's only natural that discussions should turn on to the Falklands/Malvinas issue since this is the one remaining problem in the framework of exellent relations British-Argentine relations", said Barney Miller member of the committee responsible for the organisation of the events. Surprisingly, considering his "hard line" approach contrary to the present "seduction" policy of Foreign Secretary Guido Di Tella, Senator Eduardo Menem admitted feeling he has friends in the islands and in gentle terms said that "it is most important that contacts are made at a cultural, academic and even sporting level, because that is the only way people can really get to know each other". DIFFERENCES OVER LOCATION FOR THE ANTARTIC TREATY SECRETARIAT Britain and Argentina have differences over the location for the new headquarters or permanent Secretariat for the Antartic Treaty Organisation. Member states, which include Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Britain among others have agreed that a central Secretariat is necessary if the organisation is to continue to be effectively managed as well as to coordinate the enriching multilateral scientific research. Saying that they have the support of the majority of the other signatory nations, Argentina has moved quickly to claim such honour for Buenos Aires. But Britain does not agree with Argentina. According to a senior British Foreign Office source, the British believe that the Secretariat should not be located in any of three nations that have disputed claims on the icy continent. These countries with overlapping interests are Argentina, Chile and Britain, but all have agreed to suspend the claims as long as the treaty survives. Unofficially the British believe that Argentina wants to host the Treaty headquarters because this would add prestige to the country's "Antartic condition". Montevideo has been suggested as an appropiate and suitable compromise home for the organisation, but it is believed Buenos Aires would not back the idea if formally proposed. But it was a British delegate Professor from the University of London, Victor Bulmer-Thomas who was really critical of the islanders and said that " British/Argentine relations are being held hostage by 2.000 islanders". British Labour MP Ton Dalyell anticipated that if his party wins the coming elections the next Labour government: "will be less tolerant and will bring pressure on islanders to commence normal relations with Argentina". But the islanders even outnumbered, and moderate compared to the hard-liners back in the islands, reminded the delegations that Argentines with passports of other countries can now visit the islands and visits by families of Argentines killed in the war are welcomed. Furthermore, islanders are regularly meeting to discuss issues of mutual interest such as oil and fisheries with their Argentine counterparts. Reactions from the islands didn't have to wait. Councillors Bill Luxton and Eric Goss said that so long as Argentina does not drop its sovereignty claims over the islands, "we've nothing to talk about". "These are the only sanctions we can apply on them and we know it hurts them"... insisted Luxton. The ABC also decided to leave for further discussions a private non-official paper by businessman Alastair Forsyth which proposes that Britain and Argentina work together to establish and mantain an eventual independence and special role for the islands in Mercosur. Some concrete plans which emerged from the conference include linking schools in Britain, the islands and Patagonia through Internet; seeking funds for joint scientific projects and introducing in Argentina a British scheme for funding businesses owned and run by unemployed and deprived young people which has beeen very successfull in Britain. MIKE SUMMERS ELECTED LEGISLATIVE COUNCILLOR Mike Summers formally joined the Legislative Council of the islands after winning by a clear majority in the Stanley by election held on October 17th. The election was convened to replace the unexpected death of Conuncillor John Cheek, who was considered one of the outstanding political leaders of the islands. Michael Summers, 44, has a BA degree in Business Studies, a long experience in the private and public sectors where until a few months ago he held the post of General Manager of the Falkland Islands Development Corporation. He was decisive in helping to establish the air jet link with Chile and presently works as a private consultant. He is a supporter of the present Council's policy regarding Argentine nationals visiting the islands, accepting they come under passports of alternative countries. He favours allowing a limited number of Argentine journalists to help in communicating the real facts about the islands. In his political manifesto Summers emphasized in the need for government long term planning concerning capital investments and targets, so "that the oil industry does not end dictating terms to us". Summers also proposed new legislation which makes it compulsory for elected members and high officials of government to declare their interests, in closed envelopes and only for the Governor's eyes, as a way of avoiding possible clash of interests. Concerning the recent allocation of oil licences and the absence of YPF/British Gas, Summers said the "concerns of expression are misplaced. I think people who are entitled to be concerned about their failure to get a licence are their shareholders. If I was a shareholder of either of those companies I think I would be very cross with the failure to properly approach the issue. It serves them right for relying on a nod and a wink fro their ministers". Summers also thanked the citizens who participated in the Salta conference and expressed he is a supporter of taking every possible advantage in strongly explaining the islands position to others, "who otherwise will make up their own minds". Finally concerning fisheries, Summers underlined the need to abide by the international regulations recently agreed in the UN for high seas fishing and conservation beyond the 200 miles zone. However the new Councillor also pointed out that "we must be careful that we don't disadvantage those vessels that are flagged in the Falklands and stop them from fishing when every other vessel in the world are fishing stocks that otherwise would have been taken, had they not chosen to transfer to our flag and connect their futures to our fishery".

(MP).- Innot a too distant future Argentine and Brazilian troops could beoperating under an only joint command since both countries do notconsider each other "conflict hypothesis" andnow have common strategic targets. "Economic integration willnecessarily lead to a defence integration and the first steps areself evident", said Argentine Foreign UnderSecretaryAndr�s Cisneros, following Brazil's official announcement of anew defence policy which will be geared to the protection of theAmazon, and to combat the drug trade. For the first time since the end of theTriple Alliance war against Paraguay, in the second half of lastcentury, Argentine and Brazilian troops participated duringOctober in the "Southern Cross" joint militaryexercises in the province of Corrientes to the north ofArgentina. For years now Argentine Navy jets take offand land from the Brazilian aircraft carrier "MinasGerais", since the "25 de Mayo" hasbeen practically out of action since 1982. "After a century and a half ofindependence, our identity is not based on underliningdifferences but common grounds; regional integration is abovenationalism", said Andr�s Cisneros. "There are practically nodifferences between the Brazilian and Argentine defence policies".

(MP).- Stronglobbying from Sao Paulo's exporters and equally strong demandsfor a quicker opening of the Brazilian market from foreigninvestors and bankers, have forced the government of Mercosur's mainmember into a defensive situation. The recent municipal elections where therewas a clear advance of the opposition parties particularly in Sao Paulo,Rio do Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre, the mainBrazilian cities, surprised President Henrique Cardoso who wasconvinced his successful stabilisation economic program wouldensure a swift approval in Congress of his reelection plans. The fact is that the mayor of Sao PauloPablo Maluf managed to retain control over the most importantcity of Brazil turning him at the same time into a formidablepresidential candidate for 1998. Maluf has the support of localindustry and exporters, who are demanding a more flexibleexchange rate and tariff protection. The industrialists' demand has beensupported by recent statistics which indicate Brazil will have arecord trade deficit in 1996 which could increase next year. Atrade deficit which nevertheless has helped Mercosur tradepartners to overcome recession: 30% and 45% of Argentine andUruguayan exports are absorbed by the Brazilian market.

(MP).-Businessmen from Argentina and Bolivia are complaining aboutMercosur in spite of the fact that Argentine President CarlosMenem in his official visit to Bolivia, signed 18 agreements toincrease trade between both countries and ensure Bolivia'aintegration next January to Mercosur. Argentine businessmen argue that Boliviawill become a disloyal competitor if the country joins Mercosurwith a list of 1.200 protected goods. Bolivians on the other hand complain thatMercosur negotiators treat them "as if we were Asiantigers when we're only the poorest country of the area". The Bolivian list of exceptions protects1.200 sensible and ultra sensible products, "but thatumbrella could also become the gateway for many industrial goodsmanufactured in third countries", warns the Argentine IndustryUnion. Bolivian insist they have a right to beconsidered a "less developed country" andwould rather postpone until next April integration to Mercosur. Bolivia is expected to join Mercosur nextJanuary on a similar "4 plus 1" Chileanassociation, but still has to convince Brazil of the long list ofexceptions which will have a special tariff protection. Menem promised his Bolivian counterpart,S�nchez de Losada strong lobbying in the Mercosur coming discussionswith Brazil, and in exchange Bolivia will include Argentina inits mega project to sell natural gas to Brazil. Another thorny issue of theArgentin-Bolivian discussions was the illegal presence of over amillion Bolivians in Argentina, many of whom are discriminatedand exploited because they have no legal documents, while Argentinacomplains they distort the local employment market.

(MP).- Thesecond round of negotiations of Mercosur with the Andeancountries, (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Per� and Venezuela) tocreate a free trade zone between the two blocks, ended with no progressreported. This means that the original idea ofsigning a framework agreement next December in Brazil, during the Mercosurpresidential summit will have to wait. The delegations did agreeto continue discussions in Lima next February. During the first round of negotiations alsoheld in Montevideo, the Andean countries were discussing on an individual"four plus one" basis, but this last time iswas agreed it should be on a block to block basis. Bolivia was left out of the new approachsince negotiations, as those with Chile, had been going on for along time and were close to an agreement. Differences arose when both sides presentedtheir own draft of a framework agreement, and the Andean groupinsisted on a considerable list of products to be exempted, aswell as a timetable for cutting tariffs considered too slow byMercosur. "They came with high expectationsand not enough reality", said a member of the Mercosurdelegation. In spite of the no progress situation,trade between the two blocks is growing: Andean countries exportsto Mercosur reached 2,5 billion US dollars in 1995; 1,27 billionin 1994; 930 million in 1993 and 861 million in 1992.

(MP).-Mexico wishes to have a closer bilateral economic relation withArgentina and in the near future a possible "four plusone" association agreement with Mercosur, leading toblock to block links with NAFTA (North American Free TradeAssociation). Ernesto Zedillo the Mexican President, madethese remarks during his three days visit to Argentina following hisparticipation in the Iberoamerican summit held in Santiago deChile. "We favour an approximation ofMexico to Mercosur since this would help to open markets andincrease trade which is to the benefit of all countries involved",said Zedillo during the signing with Argentine President CarlosMenem of a bilateral Investments Protection and GuarantyAgreement. President Menem said Argentina would commitits support for a closer relation of Mexico with Mercosur and a possiblefuture association similar to that of Chile, who recentlyincorporated to the South American block. But in spite of Menem's optimism, UruguayanPresident Julio Mar�a Sanguinetti said it would be "difficult"to liberalise trade between Mexico and Mercosur. "It's a difficult issue sinceMercosur already has a complex trade structure, Mexico has itscommitment with NAFTA (United States and Canada), and it will behard to make progress", indicated Sanguinetti. Chile's Mercosur incorporation which becameeffective last October took well over two years of endless negotiationsand in spite of a gradual drop in tariffs, Chilean farmers havealready successfully appealed in Court against the import ofagricultural commodities, mainly beef. Mexico has bilateral agreements with allMercosur countries and would like to turn them into an only 4plus 1 agreement. Mexico which has invested almost a billionUS dollars in Argentina, (cement, steel, banking, textiles), istrying since the "tequila" crisis two yearsago, to increase trade and diminish its dependency of the UnitedStates which absorbs 75% of its exports.

The Chilean Appeals Court ruled favourably a demand from local cattle farmers virtually blocking the import of beef from Mercosur countries mainly Argentina. Chilean cattle breeders have openly opposed Chile's association with Mercosur arguing that imports of agricultural commodities from these countries would ruin farmers. The judicial decision, only once month after Chile's association to Mercosur, came as a shock to Argentine exporters who so far this year have sold 75 million US dollars of beef to Chile and were rapidly becoming a dominant force in the local market. Chilean farmers claim that the Argentine beef does not comply with local typification regulations and is below quality standards. Argentina described the decision as "inadmissable" in commercial terms, and said Chilean cattle farmers were complaining simply because they can't compete with Argentine beef, which has lower costs and higher quality. "Chilean supermarkets and consumers only have praise for Argentine beef which so far has captured 30% of the top market", said Felipe Sol�, the Argentine Agriculture Minister. The appeal was filed against the Chilean government by the ultraconservative National Agricultural Society (SNA), which has a strong backing in the Chilean Congressional opposition. Although President Frei's administration can appeal to the Chilean Supreme Court, the ruling can block beef trade for weeks upsetting Mercosur partners. In spite of the fact that the Frei administration has promised farmers 500 millions US dollars in compensation funds over several years, which was part of the deal for the Chilean Senate to vote the association agreement, the SNA has consistently rejected Mercosur and has also self excluded itself from all the main agricultural shows. According to SNA officials Mercosur beef imports so far this year have caused losses of over 100 US million dollars because of the drop in cattle and land prices. CONTROVERSY OVER THE "EFFICIENCY" OF MERCOSUR WASHINGTON. A continental controversy literally exploded when a report by one of the main economists of the World Bank described Mercosur as "an artificial world of growth, where inefficient industries prosper behind a wall of trade barriers". The first critical report was followed by a second praising Mercosur as a "positive and important initiative similar to the first steps given by the Common Market", and letters of apologies to officials of the 4 plus one block. But far from discrediting Mercosur, the reports revealed a strong struggle inside the World Bank where experts and economists seem to be divided concerning trade block policies. On the one side are the fundamentalists who preach complete free market and private enterprise, and elimination of trade tariffs to all commercial partners, while on the other are those who believe that economic block associations can be moderately inefficient but compensate as the market consolidates, gains in credibility and reduces risks to foreign investments. Besides the first report was leaked when the World Bank officially recommended foreign investors to consider "Mercosur a serious option", and also revealed that in the last five years the multirateral institution has loaned 32 billion US dollars to Latinamerica. To make things worse the World Bank as part of a decentralization program has moved its Mexican Department to Mexico City and is planning something similar with Brazil, one of the main clients of the bank. Nevertheless the fundamentalists received some help since their critical report was almost simultaneous with an official claim before the World Trade Organization from the United States and Japan, against Brazil and Argentina for their closed automovile industry regimes. The controversy which happened to take the Mercosur block as an example is expected to be one of the main issues of the December meeting of the World Trade Organization to be held in Singapur. Meantime for the World Bank, "in the context of growing regional globalization, Mercosur promises with time, to improve competitivity and therefore is still considered a positive and important initiative". BRAZIL DEPENDENCY FLORIANOPOLIS. The lack of an "active industrial policy" and the risks of the "Brazil dependency" have become the main topics of debate between the Argentine government and certain industries who feel they are rapidly loosing ground to a more aggresive and pragmatic Brazilian trade partner. The first shots were fired by one of the main industrial tycoons of Argentina with important interests in automovile manufacturing. "We are running the risk of becoming a Brazilian province, not necessarily because that is the aim of our northern neighbours but because we lack an active industrial policy", said Francisco Macri who assembles Fiat and Peugeot in Argentina. The Argentine administration immediately replied with statistics of industrial exports which have more than doubled during the last twelve months. But in spite of the controversy trade between Argentina and Brazil in the framework of Mercosur, is booming with record Argentine oil and agrobusiness exports, while Brazilians are effectively taking the upper hand of the market in several industries. Analysts also point towards the vulnerable political moments the two main Mercosur partners are going through: Argentina is still suffering the consequences of a severe recession and unemployment, and the Brazilian government is under pressure from strong local industrial protectionist groups which are showing their muscle just when President Henrique Cardoso is discussing with Congress a constitutional reform which should open the door for his reelection and the continuity of the present economic development program. MEXICO AND MERCOSUR DRAFTING AN ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT MEXICO. Mexico in the mid term will be discussing a block association agreement which will substitute the bilateral treaties with the four full members of Mercosur. Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo made the announcement during the official dinner to host Uruguayan president Julio Mar�a Sanguinetti who is visiting Mexico with a numerous business delegation. "Even if we have our main frame agreement which is Nafta, we are also determined to have a flexible trade relation with the Mercosur block which has made an impressive progress in recent years", remarked Zedillo. Both Mexico and the Mercosur countries are limited in their possibilities of further regional understandings unless all members agree. So far Mercosur has a main block of countries with a basic common external tariff, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay; a 4 to 1 association with Chile and next December in Fortaleza during the regular biannual presidential summit, Boliva and Venezuela are expected to sign association agreements. EUROPEAN UNION SURPRISED AT "MERCOSUR'S SUCCESS" BUENOS AIRES. Mercosur's rapid success has surprised the European Union and the South American integration process reminds us of "our own continental genesis", according to the president of the Latinamerican Committee of the European Parliament. Spanish representative Gerardo Galeote, on a short visit to Argentina and Brazil, remarked that Europe was most interested in the political aspects of the Mercosur association and in promoting trade in certain areas such as fisheries. "Our European experience indicates that in an integration process unless you have a common political background, a joint foreign affaris expression, and a direct link with the citizenship, progress will be limited", said Galeote. The European representative also indicated that Mercosur has better prospects than Nafta (North American Trade Agreement) since Mexico is suffering serious financial and political difficulties. Finally Galeote underlined that in spite of the fact that Europe has become the main economic block of the world and is working towards a common currency and Central Bank, "we're advancing according to our interests and not as rivals of the United States".

20:18:48 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 18642Last-modified: Sun, 29 Dec 1996 15:37:55 GMT Falklands / Malvinas News Mercopress Agency 14/10/96 FALKLANDS / MALVINAS POPULATION GROWING IN NUMBER AND PROSPERITY Census 1996 Population in the Falkland / Malvinas Islands stands at its highest ever: 2.564 residents, and so does prosperity: 1.364 registered vehicles, 1,5 for each household, 779 televisions; 751 video cassette recorders; 257 computers and 734 washing machines. But the recently published figures of the April '96 census also show imbalances between the population living in Port Stanley and the Camp, as well as significant social changes. While the number of residents in the capital has jumped 63% since 1982, and is now 1,638, the Camp in just ten years lost 208 inhabitants and stands in 445 people. The collapse of wool farming, the strong fishing industry and civil service, plus lately the prospects of oil have attracted many camp residents to Port Stanley looking for better payed jobs and causing at the same time a housing shortage. Since the declaration of a 200 miles exclusive fishing zone round the islands in 1985, the economy of the Falkland / malvinas has not ceased to grow, and the shortage of manpower to keep up with government development contracts has become more evident. The previous record-high population was in 1931, with 2,392 inhabitants, while the lowest statistics correspond to the late seventies and 1980 with a century low record of just 1.813. Another interesting fact is that the Falklands / Malvinas have lately received a steady inflow of inmigrants reversing the tendency previous to the war, when local girls would marry Britsh Royal Marines deployed in the islands and emigrate to Great Britain. This also caused a serious imbalance between the male and female population (2-1), which is now almost normal (1-1). The 1996 census does not include the British military garrison in Mount Pleasant estimated in 2.000 strong, but does include 253 natives from the island of St. Helena generally employed in the base. ARGENTINA'S NEW POSITION ON FISHERIES CONCERNS ISLANDERS To the concern of Falkland / Malvinas islanders and British officials, Argentine Foreign Secretary Di Tella delivered in the United Nations Assembly a hardline message on fishing in the South Atlantic which raised the stakes dramatically. Argentina's new position on a long term fishing agreement ruined any hopes of an early solution by insisting that any understanding must cover the maritime zones, not only of the Falklands / Malvinas, but of South Georgia as well. The issues are "indivisible", and "if we do not reach an agreement over fishing in the Falkland / malvinas and the Georgias, then there is no agreement", remarked Di Tella. Britain controversially controls the South Georgia fishery also, but sees no connection between the two groups of islands and rejects the new Argentine stance. Since the Falklands / Malvinas economy depends almost totally on fishing, mainly squid, which migrates in the South Atlantic between waters of the two countries, the new Argentine policy entails risks for the islands annual income from licences. Both countries recognise that they need a long-term agreement if the stock is not to be over-exploited, but an agreement now seems further away than ever. Di Tella has also said he intends to raise the issue of fishing in South Georgia at the next meeting of CAMELAR (Convention on Antartic Maritime Resources) in Australia. Both Argentina and Chile have protested Britain's decision to licence fishing in South Georgia waters. MERCOSUR MAP INCLUDES FALKLANDS / MALVINAS The first regional map of the Mercosur block chartered and printed by the Uruguayan Military Geographical Service (MGS) and which was just made official includes the Falkland / Malvinas Islands. Following instructions from the Foreign Affairs Offices of the four country members, the islands figure as Argentine territory. "The map reflects the international policy of Uruguay and of the regional block, that is, the four member countries of Mercosur are convinced the islands are Argentine", explained Cnel. Daniel de los Santos head of the Uruguayan MGS. The map is part of a cartographic project contracted by Latinamerican countries which also includes Mercosur. The presentation of the official Mercosur map was done during a ceremony attended by Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti. OZONE RED ALERT The full impact of the thining of the ozone layer this year anticipated a month its appearance in the South Atlantic with very dangerous consequences for human beings exposed to the burning sun rays. The readings in Dobson units, which is the Ultra Violet index, reached a record-low in Punta Arenas and the Falklands / Malvinas, where the government immediately put on a red alert. But for some yet unknown reason the Argentines, who had also anticipated the phenomenom from the Marambio base in the Antarctic, firstly reacted by not releasing the information. A normal Dobson reading is 300, but anything below 220 is considered dangerous, sun exposure must be minimum and special protection for skin and eyes is needed. Readings in Punta Arenas in mid September were below the 220 Dobson units mark.

The candidates include a young Islander, who has a Chilean father and is back in the islands after seven years in the British Army; a female ex-patriate clerical worker in the Post Office and the former General Manager of the Falklands / Malvinas Islands Development Corporation. In their manifesto the three candidates reject any sovereignty talks with Argentina, claim the right to self determination of the islanders but admit "realistic" discussions concerning oil and fish. Elvio Miguel Cofre, 29, who emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1978 and now is a Government Housing Officer is possibly the most bold of all candidates. Cofre believes Councillors must seize every possible opportunity to impress upon Argentines their political views and the right to self determination, but also favours a relaxing of regulations concerning visits from Argentine born citizens. "This needs to be solved in my lifetime and not left to our children; we need a more inter-generation balanced judgement", insists Cofre. June Beasley-Clarke, 50, is married to a former Royal Marine who runs a photo shop in the islands. Mother of five, June is a fervent defender of the islands' life style, (where she's now back for a second time), and feels she could make a contribution to the community and the Council. "I don't want the islands turned into a miniature Great Britain, we have our own way of life and traditions", says June. The candidate with the highest profile in Michael Summers, 44, a sixth generation islander, presently a private consultant with a long experience abroad and in government. Summers besides backing the official Council policy concerning links with Argentina favours rural development, promotion of the private sector and above all long term planning to make sure the islands keep their economic and political initiative in the coming years, and are not surprised by events. The great absentee of the by-election will be Jane, widow of the late John Cheek, favoured to complete her husband's mandate but barred from participating because of a "technicallity" in her nomination form. AGENDA FOR ARGENTINE-BRITISH CONFERENCE IN SALTA CONFIRMED An influential group of British and Argentine politicians, academics and businessmen, plus several Islanders, will meet later this month in Salta, Argentina, for a conference which is expected to concentrate mostly on the disputed Falklands / Malvinas Islands. The Argentine-British Conference's regular meetings have helped improve diplomatic and trade relations between both countries following the South Atlantic conflict. However on this occasion the Falklands / Malvinas' dispute will figure prominently in the agenda, not because of an incoming incident, but because the excellent trade and diplomatic relations, have left the islands as the one remaining problem issue. Among the British personalities figure Jacques Arnold MP, Sir Kenneth Carlisle MP, Alastair Forsyth, Baroness Hooper, Andrew Graham Yooll, Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, John Bueno of British Gas. The Argentine delegation includes Senator Eduardo Menem, Ambassador Carlos Manuel Muniz, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Juan R. Aguirre Linari, Julio Macchi, president of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, businessman Santiago Soldati, Carlos Bulgheroni president of Bridas Oil Co. and the Argentine-Europe Club. The three islanders delegation includes Terry Betts, a local businessman, Lewis Clifton, Director of Desire Petroleum, and Graham Bound, who will be replacing Robin Lee. Another big absence will be Tony Lloyd, MP, Labour spokesman for Latinamerican affairs. LABOUR MP APPEALS FOR SOVEREIGNTY TALKS A Labour government should immediately resume talks with Argentina over sovereignty in the Falklands /Malvinas with the purpose of achieving a long term agreement according to one of the socialist MP back benches. Tom Dalyell who has been a member of Parliament since 1962 and will be running for office once again in Linlithgow, Scotland insisted that the sooner an agreement on sovereignty is reached, "the better for all sides". Dalyell remarks have a special impact since it is almost certain that in 1997 Great Britain will be ruled by the Labour Party. Nevertheless in the last Labour Party Conference held in Blackpool members of Labour including Tony Blair, who will probably be the next Prime Minister, personally promised a delegation of islanders headed by two Councillors, that the wishes of the Falklander / Malvinases will be respected based on the right to self determination. Anyhow Dalyell who shared lunch with Argentine Ambassador Rogelio Pfirter in London, believes that for several reasons it is essential for the islanders to have a constructive attitude towards an approachment with Argentine officials. It is most difficult that the 1982 circumstances will repeat themselves when Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Reagan had such a close and common relation, nor will British public opinion respond with the same enthusiasm. On the other hand if oil is found off-shore the islands the only way to extract it is with Argentine assistance. Finally Argentina's commitment to respect the rights, traditions and way of life of the islanders, is probably the most which can be expected in any future sovereignty agreement Issue 06/09/96 Back WT01-B08-62IA062-000352-B048-37http://www.falkland-malvinas.com:80/sni141096.html 207.32.88.17 19970115202619 text/html 5129HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:19:16 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 4958Last-modified: Sun, 29 Dec 1996 07:30:20 GMT Mercosur News Mercopress Agency 14/10/96 BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA AT ODDS OVER OIL AND EXPORT INCENTIVES The ongoing trade disputes between Mercosur's two main members have erupted again, this time over oil deregulation and export and investment incentives. Argentina forced by its business community is complaining that the Brazilian oil market, contrary to what has happened in Argentina where the market has been completelly deregulated, continues restricted and dominated by Petrobras, and is still waiting for Congress to consider a "flexibilisation" bill. The other area of dispute is the package of incentives to promote exports, (almost a billion dollars in soft loans and reimboursment of taxes) which the Brazilian federal government recently decided in an attempt to diminish the balance of trade deficit. Similarly many of the Brazilian states have their own fiscal incentives to attract foreign investments in the steel, cheminal and paper industries, which offset Argentina's hopes for industrial development. The Brazilian press has been quiet caustic about the whole situation saying that "Argentina wants Brazil to solve its self made economic problems. Our endemic trade deficit with Argentina only helps to finance Argentine purchases in the US", said a leading Brazilian industrialist in the main business publication of Sao Paulo. A SPECIAL MERCOSUR COURT FOR TRADE AND CUSTOMS DISPUTES Members of the Supreme Courts of Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Paraguay have decided the creation of a supranational Court for Mercosur trade, commercial, customs and diplomatic disputes. The resolution was taken in spite of the opposition of the Brazilian judicial delegation which considers the special Court "costly and unnecessary". The special Court will have its seat in Asuncion, Paraguay and will be the first step towards the unification of the regional community legal systems. "It's still too early to think about a special supra-national Court, at least until we have considered and passed an appropiate and efficient community legislation, which should benefit all country members and associates", said Nelson Jobim, the Brazilian Minister of Justice. Before the Special Court comes into existance, the legislative branch of the five countries involved must render its approval.

A Scottish company was appointed for the project which includes the building of eighty new homes and the development to the east of Stanley of a network of roads, drainage and sewer systems plus the installation of water and electricity supply. The engineering project is the second most important in the history of the islands. Since the end of the 1982 conflict and the fishing boom, Stanley has suffered a severe shortage of housing which is believed has inhibited the growth of the population. With the prospects of oil the demand for new homes and building plots has increased. Port Stanley at present has approximately 300 houses. A recent population and housing census taken early this year and whose results will be released in the coming weeks, should help to have a more exact picture of the situation THREE ISLANDERS TO VISIT ARGENTINA Three prominent members of the Falklands / Malvinas Islands community will be participating in the coming Argentine-British Conference (ABC) to be held next October in the northern Argentine city of Salta. The three businessmen who anticipated to the Falklands / Malvinas press that they would be participating are Lewis Clifton, a Director of Byron Holdings Ltd. and of Desire Petroleum; Terry Betts of JBG Falklands Ltd. a fishing company and Robin Lee one of the strongest farmers of the islands and co-owner of White Rock Ltd. an important local public works contractor. Although the three of them at one time held office as elected members of the Falklands' Legislative Council, no present Councillors accepted the invitation from ABC, a non government organization which was created to discuss political relations and cultural links between Argentina and Great Britain. The three businessmen from the islands will be going as part of the British delegation which includes several outstanding and influential personalities from London circles with very close links and interests in Argentina. The meeting is officially scheduled for October 25-27 and ABC's host this time will be the Argentine Foreign Relations Council, a non government organisation which sponsors international visits and conferences. This will be the sixth meeting of ABC, the last was held last year in Oxford, England. AIR LINK WITH CHILE DAP the Chilean carrier which has been flying to the Falklands / Malvinas from Punta Arenas since 1991 has been promised additional financial help from the islands' government until March 1997. The sum which has a limit of � 75.000, was decided by the Executive Council to ensure DAP's Boeing 727 connection with Punta Arenas and then onto Santiago to catch regular British Airways flights to London. The Chilean company covers most of the southern tip of South America including Ushuaia in Argentina, with small aircraft such as the Twin Otter (ten seats) which use to fly weekly to Port Stanley. Since January this year DAP began flying twice a week to Mount Pleasant Airport with a Boeing 727 which has a 125 seat capacity, but has had greater than expected difficulties in booking the aircraft in spite of the tempting and attractive fares of the British Airways connection in Santiago. To begin the Boeing 727 shuttle, DAP received an initial financial assistance from the Falklands' government of almost 180.000 US dollars. The Falkland / Malvinas Islands Development Corporation and the Chilean company estimate that the summer tourist turnover, when cruise ships sailing to Antartica change passengers and crews, will prove the project a success. At present DAP has cut the link to a weekly flight and many times is covered by a Twin Otter. The Falklands also has a two times a week connection with Britain, with an only stop in Ascension Island, in the RAF'S Tristars military transport which have a limited capacity for civilians. REX HUNT OPTIMISTIC Desire Petroleum, an oil company based in Britain and with an important participation of Falklands' shareholders has very good chances of obtaining a licence to explore in some of the best off-shore trenches round the islands, according to Rex Hunt who was governor of the Falklands during the 1982 conflict. Rex Hunt who is vicepresident of Desire Petroleum made these comments after it was announced that two important oil companies, from Texas and Norway, would not be joining Desire in the exploration consortium as had been anticipated. Both companies were expected to become the second most important partners in Desire, of which Lasmo International from Scotland holds 50% of the shares. Falklands shareholders have contributed to Desire with over half a million pounds. The Norwegians walked out because they disagreed with Lasmo's plans to drill two wells during the first (five years) stage of the exploration licence. GREENPEACE WARNING ON OIL The environmental group Greenpeace is following closely the off shore oil exploration process round the Falklands and has anticipated it could actively oppose the industry. "We are keeping a close look at the development of the oil industry particularly in frontier areas such as the Falklands which are marginal and involve new sophisticated technologies", remarked Paul Horseman. Horseman heads the British chapter of Greenpeace and was responsible for the successful campaign against the sinking by Shell of the Brent Star oil rig in the north Atlantic. "The Falklands ecosystem has a very rich wild life and the South Atlantic is exposed to some of the strongest winds in the world which makes the risks of oil spills very dangerous", added Horseman. Horseman refused to say if Greenpeace was planning any protests in the Falklands area, but "our merd0ers are ready to jump aboard any moment". In October the government of the Falklands / Malvinas is expected to announce the consortiums which will be licensed to explore for oil and the trenches where operations will begin. COUNCILLOR'S DEATH FORCES BY-ELECTION The death of one of the leading politicians and Councillors of the Falklands / Malvinas, John Cheek, (57), has caused grief and sadness in the islands and will force a by-election in the coming weeks, just one year before the eight members of the Council face a general election. John Cheek a successfull islander who was one of the first to grasp the opportunities of the fishing industry in the Falklands / Malvinas following the 1982 conflict, was first elected to office in 1981 and had become the most influential of all Councillors. Pragmatic in his understanding of relations with Argentina, (he favoured discussions on fisheries and oil), Councillor Cheek nevertheless was decisive in ensuring the publication of a Councillors' document on the future of the Falklands / Malvinas based on the concept of a "secure independence". In 1982 when the Argentine invasion of the islands Cheek, was in Britain and spent the ten weeks of the war broadcasting daily to the Falklands / Malvinas and acting with the then Governor Rex Hunt as a Falklands / Malvinas government in exile. With "Fortuna", the islands' first wholly owned fishing company, John Cheek was also able to show his talent as a businessman which turned him into a wealthy man and leading member of the community. The Governor of islands Richard Ralph described Cheek as "an exceptional Councillor, a Falklands patriot and a worthy son of the islands". Cheek was elected three times as a Councillor and resigned after chairing a government committee in late August, just a few hours before his death caused by a long battle against leukemia. 06/09/96 Issue 06/08/96 Back WT01-B08-70IA062-000352-B049-20http://www.falkland-malvinas.com:80/sni0609.html 207.32.88.17 19970115202929 text/html 11971HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:22:20 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 11799Last-modified: Sun, 29 Dec 1996 07:29:54 GMT sni0609 IT'S AGRICULTURAL SHOW SEASON August, September are clue months for farming in Mercosur countries. During those two months the most important agricultural and connected industries shows are held in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, giving a clear idea of the prospects and state of mind of the farming industry. This year the Palermo Show in Argentina could not escape the general recession and concern about the future which lingers over the Argentine economy in spite of the very strong international grain market with direct benefits for local agriculture. Cattle and sheep breeders on the other hand have been conditioned to the negative consequences of the international beef market because of the "mad cow" disease which has plagued Europe, and because of the depression in wool prices. Equally disturbing has been the instability of the weather with extreme peaks out of season, which have caused great losses in the four countries: droughts have been followed by floods and below zero temperatures harming the nutrition capacity of the grasslands. In Paraguay official announcements to help cattle breeders managed to neutralise those consequences, and in Brazil the Show of Esteio in Porto Alegre, the biggest in the country with a turnout of over 4.200 animals, in spite of a government package to promote exports of agricultural commodities, protests and complaints were more spontaneous than applauses. In Palermo, Paraguay and Esteio total sales and prices for the best animals of the show dropped compared to last year's edition. Still missing are the results of the Prado Show in Uruguay, the country which most depends on international prices for agricultural commodities since it exports most of its farming production. Anyhow farmers in Uruguay have been complaining bitterly for the last few years over taxes and interest rates. go to expoprado CHILE INVESTS STRONGLY IN MERCOSUR In spite of the fact that the Mercosur-Chile agreement will not become effective until next October, Chilean foreign investments during the last six years have been directed mainly to Mercosur countries. With a total of 8,634 billion US dollars invested by Chile overseas since 1990, almost five billion, that is 57%, have found their way to Mercosur, according to figures released by the Committee of Foreign Investments which depends from the Chilean Ministry of Economy. Of those five billion, 90% have been invested in Argentina, 7% in Brazil and the rest split among Uruguay and Paraguay. Even if most of Chilean foreign investments so far have ended in neighbouring Argentina, taking advantage of the massive privatisation programme of President Menem, it is no secret that one of Chile's main purposes behind the Mercosur agreement is penetration of the Brazilian market with 150 million consumers. Chile has already invested 340 US million dollars in Brazil and has a participation in projects involving over 1,3 billion US dollars. "A MOST INTERESTING PHENOMENON" Mercosur is one of the most significative phenomenon of the continent and it's interesting to see that decisions concerning this common market are taken with out the influence of Washington said Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of State of the Nixon administration. Asked to comment on the present relations between the United States and Latinamerica, Kissinger indicated that unfortunately President Clinton does not show much interest for the continent. "In four years he hasn't even visited Mexico, but what really concerns me is that no proper attention is given to the Mercosur phenomenon", said Kissinger. For the first time in history according to the international consultant, there is a group of allied countries of which the United States has been excluded. "Presidents of Brazil and Argentina are good friends, but decisions over the future of a region so important for the Western world, are being taken in Buenos Aires and Brasilia, while Washington remains indifferent", insisted Kissinger. Finally Kissinger said it was essential the United States recovered the initiative in the continent and attempted a confluence in an only market of NAFTA (North America Free Trade Association) and Mercosur. OBSTACLES TO TEXTILE TRADE IN BRAZIL Brazil has once again set up obstacles to the import of textiles by unilaterally deciding to reduce the terms of payment for foreign merchandise from 180 to 30 days. When the measure was first enforced last May, Uruguay and Paraguay immediately protested and were joined by Argentina. A month later during the presidential summit of the Mercosur countries held in San Luis, Argentina, Brazil announced it was returning to the 180 days term for textiles from Mercosur partners. In this occasion apparently the Brazilian Central Bank August resolution also includes minimum import prices which violate regulations of the WT0. In Brazil political sources said that the purpose of the measure enforced by the Cardoso administration is to "cool" imports and appease manufacturers from Sao Paulo as well as to help combat the growing trade deficit. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ANDES BLOCK Mercosur accepted the invitation to discuss on a block to block basis with the Andes Group the possibility of establishing a common market area. The proposal was sent to the four Mercosur countries by the Andes Group office in Cartagena. Special committees from both groups have been commended to prepare the negotiation documents although no dates have yet been arranged for the meetings. "We don't want to precipitate the talks and we will begin by assessing mechanisms and criteria for the negotiation", said Morris Harf, Colombia's Minister of Foreign Trade. Anyhow a first formal meeting has been scheduled to take place in Lima. The country members of the Andes Group are Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela. CHILE WANTS TO RENEGOTIATE When there are only a few days left for the enforcement of the Mercosur-Chile agreement which was subscribed by the presidents of the five countries involved, but still awaits consideration by the Chilean Senate, officials anticipated the Chilean government will request an extension of the list of goods which can be traded with Mercosur. According to Carlos Mladinic, Director of the International Trade Relations Committee of the Chilean Foreign Office, the request is based on the recent increase of tariffs for 17 goods decided by Brazil and which directly involve Chile.The announcement was made just when the Chilean Senate is beginning to debate the Mercosur agreement which passed with an overwhelming majority in Deputies, but is very much resisted by traditional farmers who have began a public opinion campaign on the issue. Some Chilean businessmen are also concerned that the tariff preferences extended to the Mercosur countries could bring retaliation from other more traditional trade partners of Chile. MERCOSUR WILL REVIEW TARIFFS A delegation of Mercosur will be discussing this month with the World Trade Organisation (WT0) in Geneve the region's trade policies to adapt them to international regulations. This means that some aspects of the Common External Tariff of Mercosur will have to be changed. During one of the last meetings of the Trade Commission of Mercosur held in Brasilia, delegates agreed to a list of products which will have their foreign tariffs reduced to adapt them to the demands of WT0. Another issue which was considered by the Commission was the harmonisation of rules regarding the origin components clause for goods from the four member countries. To abide by the origin clause, goods must have at least 61% of components from the home country. After the WTO sessions in Gerteve, Mercosur officials will be meeting with representatives from India, Japan and the European Union for further trade talks. 06/09/96 Issue 06/08/96 Back WT01-B08-71IA062-000352-B049-53http://www.falkland-malvinas.com:80/snef.html 207.32.88.17 19970115203020 text/html 10658HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:22:59 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 10486Last-modified: Sun, 29 Dec 1996 07:29:03 GMT Noticias del Mercosur Texto Completo Noticias del Mercosur Agencia Mercopress 1/1/97 LACRUZ DEL SUR, SIMBOLO DEL MERCOSUR FORTALEZA.

(MP).- En un mensaje especial deNavidad difundido por la BBC directamente desde Londres a lasislas, el Primer Ministro John Major afirm� que el compromiso deGran Breta�a para con las Falklands-Malvinas no ha deca�do enforma alguna. "El desarrollo de nuestrasrelaciones con Argentina no ser� a expensas del compromiso deGran Breta�a con las islas" dijo Major siguiendo unatradici�n iniciada en 1982 por su antecesora Margaret Thatcher,quien seis meses despu�s de finalizado el conflicto delAtl�ntico sur, irradi� el primer mensaje navide�o a las islas.Major dijo que Gran Breta�a contin�a a buscar una relaci�nestable y productiva con Argentina, no s�lo en funci�n de losintereses que ambos pa�ses tienen en com�n, "sinoadem�s como Uds. nos lo han reiterado, porque es tambi�n envuestro inter�s, tal cual nos lo ha demostrado vivamente elprogreso alcanzado en la exploraci�n petrol�fera"."Uds. tienen el derecho de vivir bajo la bandera devuestra elecci�n, y continuaremos a asegurar que Uds. gocen deese derecho, y que tambi�n gocen de seguridad",subray� en otro pasaje Major. Las afirmaciones llegaron en mediode rumores de grandes recortes en el nivel de tropas actualmentedesplegadas en las islas, y pocos d�as antes del anuncio de unacorta visita del Secretario de Defensa, Michael Portillo. Majortambi�n se refiri� a las oportunidades y desaf�os que implicala perspectiva del descubrimiento de yacimientos de petr�leocomercialmente explotables. "S� que algunos de Uds.est�n nerviosos por las consecuencias para vuestro medioambiente y vuestro tradicional estilo de vida, y comprendo esostemores. Nosotros tuvimos que enfrentar desaf�os parecidos deforma similar, pero yo creo que pueden ser sobrepuestos".Finalmente el Primer Ministro brit�nico tambi�n se refiri� ala b�squeda de un acuerdo de pesca a largo plazo, teniendo encuenta que la venta de licencias para la captura del calamar esla principal fuente de ingresos de las islas. "S� cuanimportante esla pesca es para vuestra prosperidad. A m� meparece que una de la prioridades de 1997 debe ser avanzar en unacuerdo con Argentina para resguardar los stocks de pesca delAtl�ntico sudoeste". LA BARONESA THATCHERTAMBIEN ENVIO SUS SALUDOS STANLEY. (MP).- Como ha sido tradici�ndesde que abandonara el poder, la ex Primer Ministra y ahoraBaronesa Thatcher tambi�n envi� su saludo de Navidad, en estaoportunidad felicitando a los isle�os por su lealtad brit�nica.Con palabras emotivas y apelando a memorias del conflicto de1982, la Baronesa reiter� a los isle�os cu�n cerca de sucoraz�n y mente permanecen las Falklands-Malvinas, y en unademostraci�n de especial admiraci�n por los Estados Unidos,("la �nica naci�n realmente fundada sobre el conceptode libertad"), record� "cuan importantehab�a sido la asistencia brindada en aquel momento, por elentonces Secretario de Defensa, Casper Weinberger". LaBaronesa tambi�n resalt� cuan feliz se sent�a al leer en el FINewsletter (la publicaci�n oficial del lobby de las islas enLondres), el fundamento de la pol�tica oficial de las islas:"Las Falklands-Malvinas son brit�nicas y continuar�nsiendo brit�nicas. Cualquier alteraci�n en esa condici�n esalgo a ser enteramente auto - determinado por el pueblo de lasislas". Pero la ex Primer Ministro que se hizo famosapor la recuperaci�n de las islas en 1982, tambi�n lanz� unaadvertencia a los Falklanders diciendo que "nuncadebemos tomar por sentado la valent�a y generosidad de Am�rica,ni tampoco el hero�smo ni la entrega de aquellos a cuyosacrificio y sentido del deber estaremos eternamente en deuda". OBSEQUIOS DE NAVIDADENVIADOS POR DI TELLA STANLEY. (MP).- Por cuarto a�o consecutivoel Secretario argentino de Relaciones Exteriores, Guido Di Tellaha enviado obsequios a los isle�os: en esta oportunidad 600copias de "El Principito",una alegor�a escrita e ilustrada por el autor franc�s Antoinede Saint-Expury. En la tarjeta que acompa�a, dirigida a"mi estimado vecino", Di Tella explica porqueeligi� este texto en particular: "un peque�o yencantador libro que seg�n el autor fue escrito para los mayoresllenos de imaginaci�n y sue�os, que fueron ni�os no hace tantotiempo". El a�o pasado Di Tella envi� a los isle�osuna foto de sus numerosos nietos, varios de los cuales sostuvoeran "extranjeros" por sus antecedenteseuropeos. En Navidad del 1994 el regalo fue un video de la famosaserie de la BBC "Pingu, el ping�ino", entanto anteriormente hab�a enviado una postal en colores de laciudad de Buenos Aires. Como suele suceder, la reacci�n en lasislas a esta manifestaci�n de la pol�tica de encantamiento deDi Tella, fue de indiferencia o de pesar, pues "eldinero de los contribuyentes argentinos podr�a haberse utilizadocon un fin mejor". "Es un ejercicio sinsentido por parte de un hombre exc�ntrico", afirm� elConsejero John Birmingham. A TODA MARCHA EN EL AREA DECOOPERACION STANLEY. (MP).- Representantesbrit�nicos y argentinos trabajan a toda marcha para asegurarseque el relevamiento s�smico en el �rea de cooperaci�n conjuntapueda comenzar en febrero y la ronda de licencias para laexploraci�n petrol�fera hacia fines de 1997, seg�n lo acordadopor ambos pa�ses.

(MP).- En un mensaje especial deNavidad difundido por la BBC directamente desde Londres a lasislas, el Primer Ministro John Major afirm� que el compromiso deGran Breta�a para con las Falklands-Malvinas no ha deca�do enforma alguna. "El desarrollo de nuestrasrelaciones con Argentina no ser� a expensas del compromiso deGran Breta�a con las islas" dijo Major siguiendo unatradici�n iniciada en 1982 por su antecesora Margaret Thatcher,quien seis meses despu�s de finalizado el conflicto delAtl�ntico sur, irradi� el primer mensaje navide�o a las islas.Major dijo que Gran Breta�a contin�a a buscar una relaci�nestable y productiva con Argentina, no s�lo en funci�n de losintereses que ambos pa�ses tienen en com�n, "sinoadem�s como Uds. nos lo han reiterado, porque es tambi�n envuestro inter�s, tal cual nos lo ha demostrado vivamente elprogreso alcanzado en la exploraci�n petrol�fera"."Uds. tienen el derecho de vivir bajo la bandera devuestra elecci�n, y continuaremos a asegurar que Uds. gocen deese derecho, y que tambi�n gocen de seguridad",subray� en otro pasaje Major. Las afirmaciones llegaron en mediode rumores de grandes recortes en el nivel de tropas actualmentedesplegadas en las islas, y pocos d�as antes del anuncio de unacorta visita del Secretario de Defensa, Michael Portillo. Majortambi�n se refiri� a las oportunidades y desaf�os que implicala perspectiva del descubrimiento de yacimientos de petr�leocomercialmente explotables. "S� que algunos de Uds.est�n nerviosos por las consecuencias para vuestro medioambiente y vuestro tradicional estilo de vida, y comprendo esostemores. Nosotros tuvimos que enfrentar desaf�os parecidos deforma similar, pero yo creo que pueden ser sobrepuestos".Finalmente el Primer Ministro brit�nico tambi�n se refiri� ala b�squeda de un acuerdo de pesca a largo plazo, teniendo encuenta que la venta de licencias para la captura del calamar esla principal fuente de ingresos de las islas. "S� cuanimportante es la pesca es para vuestra prosperidad. A m� meparece que una de la prioridades de 1997 debe ser avanzar en unacuerdo con Argentina para resguardar los stocks de pesca delAtl�ntico sudoeste".

The six consortia represent a total of fourteen companies from ten different countries. The panel of five members and their advisers will closely examine details of the bids for ten tranches in the prospective off shore oil fields mostly to the north of the islands. A final report is expected to be drafted by mid September when it will be considered by the Legislative Council in Stanley. Once the Governor adds his signature the report will be sent back to London for final approval by the Foreign Office. The consortia will have to show a sustainable work programme, financial stability, a reliable record and the best commercial package for the islands. Oil companies are expected to begin operating in the Falklands waters by next summer. Paul Newman The actor Paul Newman has donated u$s 40,000 to a charity set up by British Falkland / Malvinas war veteran Simon Weston, Weston, Weston, who was badly burned during an Argentine air attack in 1982, established The Weston Spirit, to perpetuate the spirit of determination that enable him to recover from injuries that left him permanently scarred. Teh charity operates a network of centres where young people from poverty stricken urban areas are helped to pursue studies and careers away from crime. Paul Newman's gift comes from the profits of the star's successful food company. The funds will be used to set up a new youth centre in London's East End. Mewman was not able to be present at the ceremony where his cheque was handed over, but a representative had this message from the star ; "Simon's dedication and commitment to youth provides a very neccesary programme". Newman's own charitable programme has set up the Hole In the Wall Gang Camps in the USA, Ireland and France, where in, disabled and disadvantaged children enjoy activity holidays. Air link Further talks on the improvement of the Falklands/Malvinas - Chile/Britain link are been held in Santiago de Chile . These include the possibility of medical evacuations to Santiago and an increased air freight capacity with the removal of some passenger seats in the Chilean Boeing 727.

Chilean vessel The Chilean company owner of the vessel “Antonio Lorenzo” which was fined a total of � 367.000 on July 9th. for illegal fishing in South Georgia waters, has refused to pay and has reported the incident to the Chilean diplomatic authorities. The refusal to pay comes as a result of the Pesquero Concar's S.A. non-recognition of South Georgia's jurisdiction in the 200 mile limit imposed around the islands and the fact that Chile is a member of CAMELAR, an international Conference for the Conservation of Marine Antartic Resources which covers. The case attracted international attention because of the presence as counsel for the prosecution of a Senior Barrister QC, fuelling speculation that the case would derive into a challenge of British sovereignty over South Georgia. This was the second time the “Antonio Lorenzo” faced Court proceedings in Stanley since in 1994 they were fined � 74.000. 7/8/96 Back WT01-B08-87IA062-000353-B002-168http://www.falkland-malvinas.com:80/sni0608.html 207.32.88.17 19970115203822 text/html 5334HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:31:23 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 5163Last-modified: Sun, 29 Dec 1996 07:29:41 GMT Mercosur News M. Fernandez Amun�tegui visited Uruguay. Democracy, an open economy and our future tightly knit to Latinamerica are the main elements of Chile's foreign policy", said the Chilean UnderSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs who recently visited Montevideo. Mariano Fern�ndez Amun�tegui said Chile's relations with Latinamerican countries are going through an excellent moment. Chile and The Mercosur. Half of the Chilean population (49%) believes Chile's Mercosur membership will be benefitial for the country according to a poll taken in the main cities and the camp. Nevertheless, in rural areas the support is significantly less than in the urban areas. The poll also showed that 45% of Chileans believe the country is progressing while 39% said it was stagnant and 13% in decadence. Support for President Frei's administration reached 44%, but 33% rejected the present government policies. Most Chileans also believe the government has been "soft" on lobbies and pressure groups. A similar Mercosur poll taken in Argentina showed 56% of Argentine public opinion in favour of Chile's entry and only 19% considered it harmfull. Chile and Argentina For the first time since Chile and Argentina became independant we are going to have a frontier without disputes, mistaken interpretations or misconcepts", indicated Fern�ndez who added most of Chile's foreign investments so far have been in Argentina. Fern�ndez said Chile is also having talks with the Pacific basin countries and Canada to establish closer trade and investment links, and will become the natural gate to that area for the other Mercosur members. The Iran and Lybia Sanctions. Mercosur countries have rejected the Clinton's administration decision to sanction any oil and gas company dealing with Iran and Lybia. The Iran and Lybia Sanctions Act 1996, similar in spirit to the Helms-Burton which punishes companies trading with Cuba, has also become for Washington an area of confrontation with Europe. For Uruguay the bill if finally enacted could have very negative consequences since Iran has been for the last decade an important market for wool, rice and beef in exchange for oil. Uruguay also lost as a consequence of the UN Irak embargo during the Gulf War a 40.000 tons of mutton market in Bagdad. 7/8/96 Back WT01-B08-88IA062-000353-B003-169http://www.falkland-malvinas.com:80/sne211196.html 207.32.88.17 19970115204213 text/html 6397HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:35:00 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 6226Last-modified: Sun, 29 Dec 1996 07:28:19 GMT Noticias del Mercosur ( ) Significa Texto Completo Noticias del Mercosur Agencia Mercopress 21/11/96 Inversiones Brit�nicas En Argentina Llegar�n a Los 2.200 Millones De D�lares BUENOS AIRES.

Las recientes elecciones municipales dondese registr� un claro avance de la oposici�n, especialmente en SaoPaulo, Rio do Janeiro, Belo Horizonte y Porto Alegre, lasprincipales ciudades brasile�as, sorprendieron al presidenteHenrique Cardoso quien estaba convencido que su exitoso programade estabilizaci�n econ�mica le iba a asegurar un r�pido pasajepor el Congreso de sus aspiraciones reeleccionistas. El hecho es que el Intendente de Sao Paulo,Pablo Maluf, logr� retener c�modamente el control de la ciudad m�sinfluyente y de mayor peso econ�mico, convirti�ndolo a la vezen formidable candidato para las elecciones presidenciales de1998. Maluf lo hizo con el amplio respaldo de industriales yexportadores paulistas quienes est�n demandando un tipo decambio m�s flexible y protecci�n arancelaria. El planteo se ha visto reforzado por lasrecientes estad�sticas que indican que Brasil va a experimentarun d�ficit comercial hist�rico en 1996 con perspectivas deincrementarse en 1997. un d�ficit comercial que sin embargo hasido tabla de salvaci�n para los socios del Mercosur que se hanpodido sobreponer a sus recesiones: el 30% y 45% de lasexportaciones argentinas y uruguayas son absorvidas por elmercado brasile�o.

Los exportadores han sugerido que resultaesencial para la industria local un "ajuste"(devaluaci�n) en el tipo de cambio del 30% a marzo pr�ximo,mientras que los financistas advierten que a menos que secontrolen las cuentas del gobierno federal y de los estados, ycomienza la venta de activos al sector privado, la corriente decapitales que ha ingresado al pa�s y duplica el promedio dela�o pasado, podr�a verse "afectada".

(MP).- Lasegunda ronda de negociaciones del Mercosur con el Pacto Andino(Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Per� y Venezuela), para crear unazona de libre comercio entre ambos bloques ha concluido sinavances. Esto significa que la idea original defirmar un acuerdo marco en diciembre pr�ximo, en Brasil, durantela cumbre presidencial del Mercosur tendr� que aguardar. Lasdelegaciones si se pusieron de acuerdo en continuar lasnegociaciones en Lima en febrero. Durante la primera ronda denegociaciones tambi�n desarrolladas en Montevideo, los pa�sesandinos estaban discutiendo su integraci�n individualmente bajola f�rmula "cuatro m�s uno", pero en esta�ltima reuni�n se acord� que fuera de bloque a bloque. Boliviaqued� fuera del nuevo enfoque ya que las negociaciones, al igualque aquellas con Chile, estaban muy avanzadas y prontas aalcanzar un acuerdo. Las diferencias surgieron cuando ambosbandos presentaron su propio proyecto de acuerdo marco, y los andinosinsistieron en una larga lista de productos de excepci�n asicomo plazos para la eliminaci�n de tarifas considerados por elMercosur como muy dilatados. "Vinieron con grandes expectativaspero muy poco realismo", dijo un miembro del equiponegociador de Mercosur. Pero a pesar de la falta de progreso en lasnegociaciones, el comercio interbloque est� creciendo: lospa�ses andinos exportaron al Mercosur 2,5 mil millones ded�lares en 1995; 1,27 mil millones en 1994; 930 millones en 1993y 861 millones en 1992.

La Corte de Apelaciones chilena fall� favorablemente el recurso de amparo elevado por los ganaderos que en los hechos bloquea la importaci�n de carne de los pa�ses del Mercosur, principalemente desde Argentina. Los ganaderos chilenos argumentan se han opuesto abiertamente a la asociaci�n de su pa�s al Mercosur argumentando que la importaci�n de productos agr�colas de esos pa�ses los llevar� a la ruina. El fallo judicial, apenas un mes despu�s de la puesta en vigencia de la asociaci�n chilena a Mercosur, sacudi� a los exportadores argentinos quienes en lo que va del a�o ya colocaron carne por valor de 75 millones de d�lares, y r�pidamente comenzaban a adue�arse de ese mercado. Los ganaderos chilenos alegan que la carne argentina no cumple con las exigencias de tipificaci�n chilenas y es de inferior calidad. Argentina consider� el fallo judicial "inadmisible" en t�rminos comerciales y agreg� que los ganaderos chilenos se quejaban simplemente porque no pueden competir con la carne argentina, la cual afirman tiene menores costos y es de superior aceptaci�n entre los consumiodres. "Los consumidores y supermercados chilenos est�n encantados y nuestros productos se han quedado con el 30% superior del mercado", dijo Felipe Sol�, Secretario argentino de Agricultura. El recurso de amparo fue presentado contra el gobierno chileno por la Sociedad Nacional de Agricultura (SNA), la cual tiene un importante respaldo en la oposici�n conservadora en el Congreso. Si bien el gobierno del presidente Eduardo Frei puede apelar ante la Suprema Corte de Justicia, el fallo puede poner impedimentos durante semanas, al comercio de carnes complicando las relaciones con los socios del Mercosur. A pesar del hecho que el gobierno de Frei oportunamente se comprometiera a extender fondos compensatorios por 500 millones de d�lares durante los pr�ximos a�os para el sector rural, lo cual fue parte del acuerdo pol�tico con el Senado chileno para que votara el acuerdo de asociaci�n, la SNA consistentemente ha rechazado el Mercosur y se ha auto-excluido de las principales muestras agr�cola-ganaderas del pa�s andino. Seg�n altos representantes de la SNA las importaciones de carne del Mercosur han causado, en lo que va del a�o a los ganaderos p�rdidas superiores a los cien millones de d�lares como resultado de la ca�da en los valores de la hacienda y de los campos. POLEMICA RESPECTO A LA "EFICIENCIA" DEL MERCOSUR WASHINGTON.- Una pol�mica a nivel continental literalmente estall� cuando, en un informe realizado por uno de los principales economistas del Banco Mundial se describ�a al Mercosur como "un mundo artificial de crecimiento, donde industrias ineficientes prosperan al amparo de una muralla de barreras comerciales". El primer informe cr�tico fue seguido de un segundo, en el cual se ensalzaba el Mercosur diciendo que se trataba "de una iniciativa positiva e importante similar a los inicios del Mercado Com�n", asicomo de cartas de disculpas a las m�ximas autoridades del bloque 4 por 1. Pero los informes lejos de desacreditar al Mercosur revelaron una dura puja intestina en el Banco Mundial donde t�cnicos y economistas parecen divididos en torno a lo que se denominan bloques econ�micos. Por un lado est�n los fundamentalistas quienes predican una completa libertad de mercado y libre empresa, al igual que la eliminaci�n de los aranceles para todos los socios comerciales por igual, catalogando de ineficiencias todo lo que se oponga a ese planteo; en el otro bando est�n aquellos quienes piensan que las asociaciones en bloques econ�micos pueden resultar moderadamente ineficientes, pero m�s que compensan a medida que se consolidan los mercados, se gana en credibilidad y se reducen los riesgos para la inversi�n extranjera. Asimismo el primer informe fue filtrado justo cuando el Banco Mundial oficialmente comineza a recomendar el Mercosur "como una opci�n seria" para las inversiones y tambi�n revelaba que en los �ltimos cinco a�os la instituci�n multilateral de cr�dito ha otorgado cr�ditos por 32.000 millones de d�lares a Latinoam�rica. Para empeorar las cosas el Banco Mundial como parte de su programa de descentralizaci�n ha trasladado su Departamento de M�xico a la capital azteca y en una segunda etapa ha de hacer lo mismo con Brasil, uno de los principales clientes del banco. No obstante los fundamentalistas recibieron alguna ayuda del momento que el informe cr�tico del Mercosur result� simult�neo con un reclamo oficial de Estados Unidos y Jap�n ante la Organizaci�n Mundial del Comercio, por los reg�menes especiales para la industria automotriz que tienen Brasil y Argentina. La pol�mica sobre bloques econ�micos, que tom� circunstancialmente a Mercosur como ejercicio de prueba, se espera sea uno de los principales temas a discutir en la reuni�n de diciembre de la Organizaci�n Mundial de Comercio a celebrarse en Singapur. Mientras tanto para el Banco Mundial, "en el contexto de una creciente globalizaci�n de las econom�as regionales, el Mercosur promete mejorar su competitividad en el tiempo, y por tanto es considerado una iniciativa positiva e importante". LA BRASIL DEPENDENCIA FLORIANOPOLIS. La falta de una "pol�tica industrial activa" y los riesgos de la "Brasil dependencia", se han convertido en los principales temas de debate entre el gobierno argentino y ciertos sectores industriales quienes entienden que r�pidamente est�n perdiendo terreno ante un socio comercial m�s agresivo y pragm�tico. Los primeros disparos provinieron de uno de los industriales m�s fuertes de Argentina quien tiene importantes intereses sobretodo en la fabricaci�n de autom�viles. "Corremos el riesgo de convertirnos en una provincia brasile�a, no necesariamente porque ese sea el prop�sito de nuestros vecinos del norte pero por la falta de una pol�tica industrial activa", dijo Francisco Macri quien est� vinculado a la Fiat y Peugeot. El gobierno argentino no se hizo esperar e inmediatamente respondi� demostrando con cifras que las exportaciones industriales se han duplicado durante los �ltimos doce meses y mantienen el ritmo de crecimiento. Pero a pesar de la controversia es indudable que el comercio argentino-brasile�o en el marco del Mercosur, est� en pleno ascenso con colocaciones record de petr�leo y alimentos por parte de Argentina, mientras que los brasile�os efectivamente se est�n consolidando en varios sectores industriales. Analistas tambi�n agregan al an�lisis de la situaci�n, la vulnerabilidad de los momentos pol�ticos que atraviesan los socios principales del Mercosur: Argentina todav�a sufre los efectos de una severa recesi�n, desempleo y desfase fiscal, mientras que el gobierno brasile�o est� bajo fuerte presi�n de poderosos grupos industriales proteccionistas, en momentos que el presidente Henrique Cardoso negocia con el Congreso una reforma constitucional que le abrir�a las puertas a la reelecci�n, y asegurar�a la continuidad del actual modelo de desarrollo. MEXICO Y MERCOSUR PREPARAN UN ACUERDO DE ASOCIACI�N MEXICO. M�xico a mediano plazo comenzar� discusiones para alcanzar un acuerdo de asociaci�n con el bloque que sustituya los tratados bilaterales con los cuatro miembros plenos del Mercosur. El presidente mexicano hizo el anuncio durante una recepci�n oficial en honor del mandatario uruguayo Julio Mar�a Sanguinetti quien se encuentra de visita en el pa�s azteca al frente de una numerosa delegaci�n de empresarios. "Si bien nuestro principal compromiso es con NAFTA, tambi�n estamos determinados a alcanzar un relacionamiento comercial flexible con el bloque del Mercosur que ha dado pruebas de un avance impresionante en estos a�os", dijo Zedillo. Por ahora el Mercosur est� integrado por cuatro pa�ses con un arancel externo b�sico com�n, Brasil, Argentina, Uruguay y Paraguay; una asociaci�n de 4 por 1 con Chile y en diciembre pr�ximo en Fortaleza, Brasil, durante la cumbre presidencial semestral se espera que los mandatarios de Bolivia y Venezuela firmen acuerdos de asociaci�n. LA UNION EUROPEA SORPRENDIDA POR EL "EXITO DEL MERCOSUR" BUENOS AIRES. El acelerado �xito del Mercosur ha sorprendido a la Uni�n Europea e igualmente el proceso de integraci�n latinoamericano "nos recuerda nuestra propia g�nesis" afirm� el presidente de la Comisi�n para Latinoam�rica del Parlamento del Viejo Continente. El diputado espa�ol Gerardo Galeote, durante una corta visita a Argentina y Brasil destac� que Europa estaba muy interesada en los aspectos pol�ticos de la integraci�n que lleva adelante el Mercosur as�como en la promoci�n conjunta de algunas �reas como podr�a ser la pesca. "Nuestra propia experiencia nos indica que en un proceso de integraci�n a menos que se cuente con un fuerte anclaje pol�tico, una expresi�n com�n de presencia externa y un v�nculo directo con la ciudadan�a, es poco lo que se puede avanzar", explic� Galeote. Galeote tambi�n arriesg� afirmar que el Mercosur tiene mejores perspectivas que el NAFTA del momento que M�ixco est� atravesando por serias dificultades econ�micas y pol�ticas. Finalmente el diputado europeo subray� que a pesar que Europa se ha convertido en el mayor espacio econ�mico del mundo y est� avanzando hacia una moneda y un banco central comunes, "lo hacemos en funci�n de nuestros intereses y no con �nimo de rivalizar con Estados Unidos".

(MP).-Todo hombre, mujer y ni�o de las Falklands/Malvinas tendr�derecho a un pasaje gratis ida y vuelta al Reino Unido paradisfrutar de vacaciones en el exterior. El anuncio fue hecho porAndrew Gurr, Administrador General de las islas, quien afirm�que la decisi�n se tom� a partir de una recomendaci�n de unequipo de expertos brit�nicos quienes elaboraron un informeespecial relativo a los t�rminos y condiciones de empleo en elServicio Civil de las islas. El programa ya cuenta con el apoyo de todoslos miembros electos del Consejo Legislativo, y consiste de tres"vouchers" anuales y consecutivos de � 315 aser canjeados por un pasaje ida y vuelta, equivalente a � 940 ,que es el costo de viajar a Gran Breta�a, ida la isla Ascensi�nen el Tri Star de la RAF. Volar Punta Arenas/Santiago enDAP/British Airways custa un adicional de � 25, pero losisle�os podr�n elegir la l�nea. El informe describe la iniciativa de lasvacaciones como una necesaria "ventilaci�n cultural",en tanto Andrew Gurr considera que es la mejor forma dedistribuir la riqueza de las islas. "No podemos aplicar un sistemaimpositivo negativo, pero podemos hacer una distribuci�n justade los crecientes recursos de la pesca, tanto entre aquellos quetrabajan para el gobierno, como para quienes no lo hacen",explic� Gurr. Desde que se estableciera la zona de pescaexclusiva en torno a las islas en 1985, las Falklands/Malvinashan tenido super�vit presupuestal a�o tras a�o y las reservasactualmente invertidas en Gran Breta�a ya superan los 180millones de d�lares, para una poblaci�n de apenas 2.300. Pero tanto Gurr, como varios Consejeros yas� tambi�n el informe no niegan una motivaci�n pol�ticaadicional detr�s de la decisi�n: aumentar y perpetuar losfuertes v�nculos de las islas con Gran Breta�a. No sorprende que la decisi�n se hayatomado cuando las islas est�n en el umbral de una posiblebonanza petrolera, y cuanto el Foreign Office est� presionando alas islas para alcanzar una "gradual normalizaci�n"de los v�nculos con Argentina.

BUENOSAIRES. (MP).- Terrance and Alexander Betts son doshermanos isle�os de or�genes muy humildes. Desde temprana edadAlexander tuvo que ganarse la vida acarreando turba para ayudar asus padres, pero no Terry quien sufr�a de complicaciones desalud. En 1982 Alexander trabajaba para el puentea�reo con Comodoro Rivadavia y abandon� las islas para siempre,con las derrotadas tropas argentinas. Se afinc� en C�rdobadonde se cas� con una argentina. Terry permaneci� en las islas,y supo sacar ventajas de la bonanza pesquera a partir de 1985 yahora es un pr�spero hombre de empresas c�modamente instalado. Los hermanos no se volvieron a encontrarhasta 1987 en las Naciones Unidas en Nueva York, pero en bandosopuestos: Terry como un Consejero de las islas e integrante de ladelegaci�n brit�nica ante el Comit� de Descolonizaci�n,Alexander declarando abiertamente en favor de Argentina y encontra del colonialismo brit�nico en las islas. Nueve a�os m�s tarde, Terry visit�Argentina para la reuni�n anual de la ConferenciaArgentino-Brit�nica celebrada en Salta y de retorno pudoencontrarse con su hermano en Buenos Aires. Las razones: elreciente fallecimiento del padre de ambos y el cumplea�os deAlexander. Alexander mantiene su trabajo con unaempresa a�rea argentina pero se queja amargamente sobre lascondiciones de vida hoy en su nueva patria. Sin embargo permanecetan convencido como nunca que Argentina tiene m�s derechosleg�timos, y documentados, sobre las islas, en tanto Terryargumenta que los derechos pertenecen a quienes habitan las islasdesde hace 163 a�os. �Cu�l fue el resultado final? Amboscompartieron copas para celebrar el cumplea�os, pero tambi�nacordaron caballerosamente, permanecer en desacuerdo sobre eltema Falklands/Malvinas. G.B.

(MP).- Gran Breta�ay Argentina estar�n lanzando la ronda de licitaciones paraexplorar y explotar el �rea especial de cooperaci�n conjuntadel Atl�ntico sur, antes de fines de 1997. Licencias derelevamiento s�smico ser�n entregadas a todas aquellas empresasinteresadas antes de fin de a�o. El acuerdo se logr� durante un encuentroinesperado y fuera de agenda de los Ministros de RelacionesExteriores de ambos pa�ses, Guido Di Tella y Malcolm Rifkind enLondres durante la segunda semana de noviembre. De acuerdo a un vocero del Foreign Officeuna pr�xima reuni�n de la Comisi�n Conjunta de Hidrocarburosdel Atl�ntico Sur, a celebrarse en Londres a principios dediciembre, "resultar� crucial para definir lost�rminos de las licencias, las cuales est�n avanzando a granritmo". El �rea especial de cooperaci�n conjunta serefiere a la zona donde las aguas de las Falklands/Malvinas y deArgentina se sobreponen. Pero contrariamente a lo acontecido con elpetr�leo, en la pesca no se registraron avances. Sin embargoambos bandos coincidieron en la necesidad de continuar tratandoel tema: Gran Breta�a insistiendo en un acuerdo a largo plazo,Argentina en incluir las South Georgia en las conversacionessobre conservaci�n y seguimiento en torno a lasFalklands/Malvinas. Y si bien el vocero del Foreign Officerecalc� que "el momento no est� a punto para unavisita presidencial", en referencia a la largamenteanunciada visita del presidente argentino a Gran Breta�a, ambossecretarios de estado se pusieron de acuerdo en dos pr�ximasvisitas de familiares directos al cementerio argentino de Darwina realizarse antes de fines de febrero.

(MP).- Unfuturo de independencia, o que conduzca a un grado de aut�nomiaa decidir por los isle�os, teniendo tanto a Gran Breta�a comoArgentina de garantes del proceso, es la esencia del ensayo queest� siendo circulado informalmente en Argentina, Gran Breta�ay las islas. El hombre responsable por el trabajo esAlastair Forsyth, un banquero y miembro del comit� organizadorde la Conferencia Argentino-Brit�nica, que se ha tomado a pechola disputa del Atl�ntico sur. Uno de los argumentos b�sicos de suinforme es que el conflicto de 163 a�os no ha de ser resuelto acompleta satisfacci�n de ninguno de los bandos involucrados.Otro el creciente sentido de identidad y confianza desarrolladopor los ahora econ�micamente aut�nomos isle�os, que podr�allegar a convencerlos de desprenderse del manto protector de GranBreta�a. "Un liderazgo pol�tico, fuerte yvaliente, de parte de Argentina y Gran Breta�a puede encontrarel camino para sobreponer con honor por parte de todos, elsiempre presente potencial para una crisis", afirmaForsyth. Durante un per�odo de transici�n de dieza veinte a�os, tanto Argentina como Gran Breta�a mantendr�anuna presencia en las islas colaborando en preservar un estilo devida muy �nico, a la vez que se ayudar�a en los preparativospara la independencia. En una fecha pre establecida ambos garantesdejar�an las islas, lo cual significar�a el fin de la colonia,y de ah� en m�s la poblaci�n de las islas puede decidir yasegurarse el desarrollo de su propio futuro. Forsyth estima que se normalizar�an losv�nculos y comercio con el continente y las islas sebeneficiar�n de todo aquello que tienen los argentinos paraofrecerles. "Argentina durante estos �ltimosa�os ha demostrado pragmatismo, madurez pol�tica y unaenvidiable audacia para reformar la sociedad y cambiar creenciaslargamente establecidas; �por qu� no habr�an de aceptar elensayo de Forsyth como elemento m�s a considerar y discutir?".

(MP).- Un informe de treinta p�ginas titulado"El futuro de la agricultura en las Falklands",que es una s�ntesis de los muchos trabajos sobre el sectorrural, un tema por dem�s pol�mico en las islas, finalmente fueliberado para su discusi�n p�blica por el Consejo Legislativo. El informe escrito por el AdministradorGeneral de las islas se sustenta en la idea que la agricultura esel "gran premio de las islas a largo plazo", puesuna vez que la pesca y el petr�leo se hayan terminado, laexplotaci�n agr�cola y la tierra ser�n el �nico recursodisponible. A partir de esta idea b�sica el informedescribe un amplio abanico de recomendaciones para desarrollaruna agricultura de alternativa a la actual monoexplotaci�novina, aprovechando los avances de la tecnolog�a en �reas comoel mejoramiento de pasturas, nuevas cosechas, plantaci�n de�rboles, leguminosas, cr�a de ganado, clasificaci�n de lanas,fertilizantes, ingenier�a gen�tica, etc.- Pero tambi�n tomando en cuenta lascondiciones de vida en el campo, de forma de asegurarse undesarrollo humano equilibrado en todas las islas y, por ejemploel m�s impactante, que los precios al consumidor no resultenmayores que los de Stanley como acontece en la actualidad.

Los rumores ya adelantaban lo que sonaba increible pero as� sucedi�, y tanto las autoridades de las islas como de la propia empresa argentina (ahora privatizada y con participaci�n m�nima del gobierno argentino), y diplom�ticos brit�nicos se apuraron en desactivar cualquier mal intencionada interpretaci�n del acontecimiento. "Somos una empresa privada y tomamos nuestras decisiones en base a criterios de rentabilidad y eficiencia, ciertamente no pol�ticos. De ninguna manera constituye un acto discriminatorio hacia Argentina", subrayaron tanto el president de YPG Le�n Nells, como su sucesor a partir de abril pr�ximo Roberto Monti. De todos modos YPF dej� bien en claro que si hay una nueva licitaci�n del gobierno de las islas se volver� a presentar y por supuesto va a participar en el llamado conjunto que se har� supuestamente en marzo pr�ximo, para adjudicar licencias de exploraci�n en la denominada �rea especial de cooperaci�n, al oeste de las islas donde se sobreponen las aguas argentinas e insulares. En las islas ambos el Gobernador Ralph y el Administrador General Andrew Gurr resaltaron que el consorcio argentino-brit�nico perdi� pues concentr� su oferta en los dos cuadrantes m�s solicitados, pero agregaron que esperan una participaci�n argentina en futuras licitaciones. Un mensaje similar trasmiti� el Embajador brit�nico en Buenos Aires, Peter Hall: "nuestra pol�tica y la del gobierno de las islas est� abierta a las compa��as argentinas, pero eso depender� del nivel t�cnico y comercial de las ofertas". La Canciller�a argentina a su vez tom� la noticia con tranquilidad, a pesar del rev�s que puede significar para el actual enfoque de su pol�tica de acercamiento a los isle�os. "El gobierno brit�nico nos asegur� que incidieron exclusivamente razones comerciales y las circunstancias pol�ticas no influyeron para nada". Sin embargo en la prensa argentina trascendi� que en dos ocasiones la diplomacia brit�nica alert� a los argentinos que la oferta de YPF/British Gas era insuficiente. Hubo un primer intento de mejorarla, pero al segundo YPF habr�a dicho simplemente "hasta aqu� es donde estamos preparados a llegar". La "frustraci�n" por esa reacci�n habr�a sido compartida por ambas canciller�as. BONANZA ECONOMICA Y PRIMERAS POZOS EXPLORATORIOS EN DOS A�OS La poblaci�n de las Falklands/Malvinas se prepara para lo que se consideran a�os de inesperada bonanza despu�s del �xito alcanzado en la primera adjudicaci�n de licencias para explorar hidrocarburos en aguas de las islas y de la cual participar�n empresas petroleras de primera l�nea. Se estima que hacia fines del verano de 1997 ya comenzar�n a llegar a las islas los primeros grupos de t�cnicos y jerarcas de dichas empresas, y dos a�os despu�s, se especula podr�a comenzarse con las primeras perforaciones exploratorias. En esta primera fase de cinco a�os las empresas se han comprometido a invertir varios cientos de millones de d�lares que si bien ser� en equipos y servicios de alta tecnolog�a, fundamentalmente en alta mar, dejar�n buen margen para el talento y capacidades empresariales de los 2.300 isle�os. Desde ya se anticipa un boom en la industria de la construcci�n, hotelera y servicios de aprovisionamiento asicomo en el arriendo de campos para que las petroleras puedan contar con bases de apoyo a sus operaciones. El Gobernador de las islas Richard Ralph declar� que con la exitosa adjudicaci�n de las licencias se abre una etapa potencialmente trascedental para el futuro de las islas. Por su parte Andrew Gurr, Administrador General de las islas y vice-gobernador subray� que el 28 de octubre pasar� a la historia como la fecha m�s importante del calendario isle�o despu�s de la liberaci�n del archipi�lago por las tropas brit�nicas el 14 de junio de 1982. John Martin, un ex-funcionario de British Petroleum y asesor del gobierno de las islas en el tema petrolero expres� que la respuesta de las empresas al llamado del gobierno de las islas has sido m�s que satisfactoria y adelant� que "ello asegura un ingreso vigoroso de las Falklands/Malvinas a la industria de la exploraci�n petrolera". A su vez la Sra. Phyllis Rendell, la flamante Directora del flamante Departamento de Petr�leo dijo que si bien los ingresos por los cuadrantes adjudicados ser�n m�nimos (las empresas pagar�n anualmente 30 d�lares por kil�metro cuadrado), la etapa promisoria ser� a partir del a�o 2003 cuando, se entiende comenzar�a la extracci�n comercial, si es que los yacimientos de hidrocarburos lo justifican. "No olvidemos que en el Mar del Norte peforaron 50/60 pozos antes de encontrar petr�leo", subray� con prudencia. EMPRESAS GANADORAS DE LICENCIAS PARA EXPLORAR El 28 de octubre, primero en Stanley y pocas horas despu�s en Londres el gobierno de las Falklands/Malvinas anunci� los adjudicatarios de licencias para exploraci�n de hidrocarburos en aguas de las islas. De 19 cuadrantes ofrecidos, el inter�s de los consorcios se centr� en doce de ellos, todos al norte de las islas, desech�ndose los siete del sur. Todos los grupos que originalmente se presentaron en julio de 1996, obtuvieron bloques de exploraci�n a excepci�n de YPF/British Gas. En esta primera etapa de cinco a�os, la actividad se va a centrar en la recolecci�n de m�s y mejor informaci�n sobre las cuencas adjudicadas y la perforaci�n de por lo menos un pozo exploratorio. A continuaci�n la lista de adjudicatarios con sus correspondientes cuadrantes de exploraci�n que suman unos 12.800 kil�metros cuadrados. Cuadrante A: AMERADA HESS Ltd. (Operador).

RECOMIENDAN REANUDAR VINCULOS ENTRE LAS ISLAS Y ARGENTINA Con una recomendaci�n consensuada para reanudar los v�nculos de las Falklands/Malvinas con Argentina y las visitas de los argentinos a las islas, a los cuales se opone tenazmente el gobierno de las islas, concluy� la VI Conferencia Argentino-Brit�nica (CAB), celebrada el �ltimo fin de semana de octubre en la ciudad norte�a de Salta. La reuni�n de la CAB, una entidad no-gubernamental, cont� con una numerosa y calificada delegaci�n argentina encabezada por el Senador Eduardo Menem, en tanto los brit�nicos tampoco se quedaron atr�s e incluyeron varios miembros del Parlamento e influyentes personalidades de la pol�tica, finanzas y centros acad�micos. Tambi�n integraron el bando brit�nico los mayores protagonistas del encuentro, tres isle�os que participaron a t�tulo personal pero fueron el centro de atenci�n. Se trata de Lewis Clifton y Terry Betts, dos ex-Consejeros y actualmente empresarios del petr�leo y la pesca, asi como Graham Bound, fundador del Penguin News y periodista de la BBC. "Es natural que las discusiones hayan sido absorvidas por el tema Falklands/Malvinas, ya que es el �nico punto que resta en el marco de exelentes relaciones argentino-brit�nicas", dijo Barney Miller integrante del comit� organizador de los eventos. Extra�amente el Senador Eduardo Menem, considerado de la "l�nea dura" y contrario a la pol�tica de "seducci�n" del Canciller Guido Di Tella quien se mostr� componedor y admiti� sentir que tiene amigos en las islas, se manifest� a favor de mayores intercambios, como la �nica forma para que la gente realmente pueda llega a conocerse". Pero fue un acad�mico ingl�s de la Universidad de Londres, V�ctor DIFERENCIAS POR SEDE PERMANENTE PARA EL TRATADO ANTARTICO Argentina y Gran Breta�a tienen diferencias sobre la ciudad que que albergar� la sede central permanente o Secretariado del Tratado Ant�rtico. Los estados miembros del Tratado que incluye a Gran Breta�a, Argentina, Chile y Uruguay, entre otros, est�n de acuerdo que es necesaria una sede central y permanente si es que la organizaci�n ha de continuar a ser administrada con eficiencia, asicomo para coordinar la intensa investigaci�n cient�fica multilateral que se desarrolla en la zona. Sin embargo no se pueden poner de acuerdo donde localizar la sede. Argentina invocando que cuenta con el respaldo de la mayor�a de los restantes miembros signatarios del Tratado se ha movido r�pidamente reclamando ese honor para Buenos Aires. Sin embargo Gran Breta�a se opone a las aspiraciones argentinas. De acuerdo a una alta fuente del Foreign Office, los brit�nicos creen que el Secretariado no debe estar localizado en ninguna de las tres naciones que se disputan reclamos sobre el continente blanco. Esos pa�ses son fundamentalmente Gran Breta�a, Argentina y Chile. Los tres tienen reclamos que se sobreponen y han acordado dejar en suspenso esas acciones durante la vigencia del Tratado. Empero, aunque sin sostenerlo oficialmente, los brit�nicos son de la opini�n que Argentina insiste en ser sede del Secretariado permanente del Tratado como forma de sumar prestigio a su condici�n de "potencia ant�rtica". . Por tanto se ha sugerido a Montevideo como el lugar m�s apropiado y de compromiso para instalar la sede del Tratado, pero se estima que Buenos Aires vetar�a la propuesta si se llega a formalizar. Bulmer-Thomas que habl� con mayor dureza: "las relaciones argentino/brit�nicas no pueden quedar rehenes de 2.000 isle�os", enfatiz�. A su vez un parlamentario brit�nico Tom Dalyell, anticip� que el pr�ximo gobierno laborista "no va a ser tan tolerante con los isle�os y los va a presionar para que las Falklands/Malvinas normalicen relaciones con Argentina". Los isle�os, aunque en inferioridad num�rica no se dejaron aplastar. Recordaron que argentinos con pasaportes de terceros pa�ses viajan regularmente a las islas, que los familiares de los soldados enterrados en Darwin son bienvenidos y que hay una permanente colaboraci�n en materia de pesca y petr�leo. Desde las islas tampoco faltaron reacciones. Los Consejeros William Luxton y Eric Goss dijeron que en tanto Argentina no renuncie a sus reclamos de soberan�a sobre las islas "no tenemos nada de que hablar".Y agreg� "son las �nicas sanciones que podemos aplicar a los argentinos, y les duelen". Otros puntos acordados por la CAB fue pasar a consideraci�n un "paper" privado y no oficial, presentado por el empresario Alstair Forsyth para una eventual autonom�a de las islas garantizada conjuntamente por Argentina y Londres, e integrada al Mercosur. Tambi�n se estudiar� una interconexi�n v�a internet entre colegios ingleses, argentinos e isle�os; estudios conjuntos para la conservaci�n de los recursos marinos en el Atl�ntico sur y colaborar para la implementaci�n en Argentina de un programa de asistencia a j�venes desempleados que ha resultado muy exitoso en Gran Breta�a. MIKE SUMMERS ELECTO AL CONSEJO LEGISLATIVO Mike Summers se integr� al Consejo Legislativo de las islas despu�s de haberse impuesto por amplio margen en la elecci�n parcial del 17 de octubre. La elecci�n fue convocada para reemplazar la banca dejada vacante por la inesperada muerte de John Cheek una de las figuras de mayor peso pol�tico en los �ltimos a�os. Michael Summers de 44 a�os, tiene una licenciatura en administraci�n de empresas, una larga experiencia en el sector privado y p�blico donde hasta hace unos pocos meses se desempe�� como Gerente General de la Corporaci�n para el Desarrollo de las islas. Tuvo participaci�n decisiva en el establecimiento del v�nculo a�reo con Chile y en la actualidad trabaja como consultor. Es partidario de la actual pol�tica del Consejo en materia de no permitir el ingreso de ciudadanos con pasaporte argentino, aunque s� con documentos alternativos, y quiere un mayor ingreso, controlado de periodistas argentinos para comunicar la verdad sobre las islas. En su manifiesto pol�tico enfatiz� en la necesidad de que el gobierno tenga una mayor planificaci�n en materia de inversiones y objetivos a largo plazo sobretodo para evitar que "la industria del petr�leo nos madrugue y termine dictando los t�rminos de la relaci�n". Tambi�n pidi� la aprobaci�n de una suerte de ley cristal para que todos aquellos miembros electos y altos jerarcas del gobierno hagan una declaraci�n de bienes a sobre cerrado al Gobernador, como forma de evitar lo que considera posibles conflictos de intereses. Respecto a la reciente licitaci�n petrolera y la no adjudicaci�n de una licencia al consorcio YPF/British Gas dijo que el an�lisis estaba fuera de lugar. "Quienes deben estar preocupados son los accionistas de ambas empresas. Si yo fuera accionista estar�a muy molesto por lo acontecido y la incapacidad demostrada por esas empresas. Que les sirva de lecci�n por jugarse a una gui�ada o se�al del poder pol�tico". En cuanto a la reciente reuni�n de Salta dijo ser partidario de aprovechar las oportunidades para trasmitir con firmeza la posici�n de los isle�os, de forma que "a quienes nos dirigimos no se formen una opini�n equivocada". Finalmente en materia de pesca, subray� la necesidad de acatar las nuevas normas internacionales acordadas para la conservaci�n y pesca en alta mar, m�s all� de las zonas de exclusividad. Sin embargo aclar� que debe prestarse mucha atenci�n a que esa limitaci�n, no respetada por otros, lleve a que naves embanderadas en las islas cambien de pabell�n.

Argentina a insistencia de su empresariado ha protestado respecto al mercado petrolero y de combustibles brasile�o, el cual contrariamente a lo acontecido con Argentina donde ha sido enteramente derregulado, permanece restringido y dominado por Petrobras, mientras se aguarda que el Congreso de Brasilia apruebe el proyecto de "flexibilizacion". La otra area de disputa es el paquete de incentivos para promover exportaciones (casi mil millones de dolares en creditos blandos y devoluciones impositivas), que el gobierno federal recientemente aprobara en un intento por disminuir el deficit de la balanza comercial. Similarmente muchos estados brasile�os tienen sus propios incentivos fiscales como forma de atraer a inversiones extranjeras en las industrias del acero, petroquimica y papel, lo cual disminuye las esperanzas de las autoridades de Buenos Aires de conducirlas hacia la Argentina. La prensa brasile�a por su parte ha estado muy caustica en sus comentarios respecto a la situaci�n, afirmando que "Argentina pretende que Brasil le resuelva sus problemas economicos de propia factura. Nuestro end�mico d�ficit comercial con Argentina solo ayuda a financiar las compras argentinas en EE.UU.", resalto un importante industrial brasile�o en un art�culo de la principal publicaci�n econ�mica de Sao Paulo. ACUERDAN FORMACION DE TRIBUNAL ESPECIAL PARA EL MERCOSUR Miembros de las Supremas Cortes de Argentina, Uruguay, Chile y Paraguay acordaron la creaci�n de un tribunal supra nacional para derimir sobre cuestiones comunitarias referidas a disputas comerciales, aduaneras y diplom�ticas. La resoluci�n se aprob� a pesar de la oposici�n de la delegaci�n judicial del Brasil la cual argumento que la instalaci�n de un tribunal especial resultaria "costoso e innecesario". El Tribunal especial tendra su sede en Asunci�n, Paraguay, y se considera el primer paso hacia la unificaci�n jurisprudencial del derecho comunitario de la regi�n. "Todav�a es muy temprano para pensar en un tribunal supra nacional, por lo menos hasta que no hayamos redactado y aprobado una legislacion comunitaria eficiente y apropiada que beneficie a los paises miembros y asociados", indico Nelson Jobim, el Ministro brasileno de Justicia. Pero antes que el Tribunal especial sea realidad, las legislaturas de los cinco paises involucrados deberan debatir y aprobar el proyecto.

Pero las cifras del censo realizado en abril de este a�o, tambien muestran desequilibrios entre la poblaci�n que vive en Port Stanley y el campo, al igual que significativos cambios sociales. Mientras que el n�mero de residentes en la capital ha crecido un 63% desde 1982, y ahora alcanza a 1.638, el campo en apenas diez a�os ha perdido 208 habitantes, quedando con apenas 445 personas. La caida en los precios de lana, la fortaleza de la industria de la pesca y del servicio civil, sumado a las perspectivas petroleras han atraido a muchos residentes del campo a Port Stanley en busca de puestos de trabajo mejor remunerados, ocasionando a la vez una escasez de viviendas. Desde que el Reino Unido estableciera una zona exclusiva de pesca de 200 millas en torno a las islas en 1985, la econom�a de las islas no ha cesado de crecer, y la escasez de mano de obra para mantenerse a tono con los contratos de desarrollo del gobierno se ha hecho mas evidente. El anterior record de poblaci�n data de 1931 con 2.392 personas, mientras que las estad�sticas m�s pobres corresponden a los �ltimos a�os de la decada del setenta y 1980 con el m�nimo hist�rico de 1.813 personas. Otro hecho interesante es que las islas han recibido en los ultimos a�os un influjo sostenido de inmigrantes revertiendo la tendencia previa a la guerra, cuando por ejemplo las jovenes isle�as se casaban con los Infantes de Marina desplegados en las islas para asi emigrar al Reino Unido. Esto tamb�en en su momento ocasion� un serio desequilibrio entre la poblaci�n masculina y femenina (2 a 1), en tanto ahora casi se ha nivelado (1 a 1 ). El censo de 1996 no incluye a la guarnicion militar britanica en Mount Pleasant, estimada en 2.000, pero si a los 253 originarios de la isla de Santa Helena, que generalmente hacen tareas de apoyo y mantenimiento en la base. POSICION ARGENTINA EN TEMA PESCA PREOCUPA A ISLE�OS El duro e inesperado discurso del Canciller argentino Guido Di Tella ante la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas respecto a la pesca en el Atl�ntico sur, elevando dram�ticamente el nivel de las diferencias, ha originado preocupaci�n entre los habitantes de las Falklands/Malvinas y autoridades brit�nicas. La nueva posici�n argentina en cuanto a un acuerdo de pesca a largo plazo, insistiendo en que cualquier entendimiento debe cubrir ambas zonas ma�timas, "no solo las Falklands / Malvinas, sino tambien las Georgias", echo un balde de agua fria sobre cualquier esperanza de una soluci�n en un futuro pr�ximo. Los temas son "indivisibles" y "si no logramos un acuerdo sobre pesca en las Falklands/Malvinas y en las Georgias, entonces no hay acuerdo", resalt� el Canciller Di Tella. El Reino Unido que tambien mantiene un controvertido control sobre la pesca en las Georgias del Sur, no acepta conexi�n alguna entre ambos territorios insulares y rechaza de plano la nueva posici�n argentina. Del momento que la econom�a de las Falklands/Malvinas depende pr�cticamente de la pesca, sobre todo el calamar, el cual circula libremente en el Atlantico sur en aguas compartidas, la nueva politica argentina implica riesgos para los ingresos anuales que genera la venta de licencias de pesca. Ambos paises reconocen que es necesario un acuerdo a largo plazo para evitar la sobre explotaci�n de los recursos maritimos en la zona, pero un acuerdo ahora parece mas distante que nunca. Di Tella tambien ha adelantado que ha de plantear el tema de la pesca en torno a las Georgias en la pr�xima reunion de CAMELAR, Convencion para la Conservaci�n de Recursos Marinos Antarticos, prevista para este mes en Australia. Tanto Argentina como Chile han protestado la decisi�n britanica de extender permisos de pesca para operar en aguas de las Georgias del sur. MAPA DEL MERCOSUR INCLUYE A FALKLANDS/MALVINAS El primer mapa regional del Mercosur relevado e impreso por el Servicio Geografico Militar del Uruguay, (SGM), y que recientemente fuera hecho p�blico, incluye a las Falklands/Malvinas. Siguiendo estrictas instrucciones de las Cancillerias de los cuatro paises miembros, las islas figuran en la publicaci�n oficial como territorio argentino. "El mapa refleja la politica internacional de Uruguay y del bloque regional, es decir que los cuatro paises del Mercosur estan convencidos que las islas son argentinas", afirm� el Cnel. Daniel de los Santos, Director del SGM. El mapa es parte de un proyecto cartogr�fico contratado por los pa�ses latinoamericanos el cual tamb�en incluye al Mercosur. La presentaci�n oficial del mapa del Mercosur se hizo durante una ceremonia que cont� con la presencia del presidente del Uruguay, Dr. Julio Maria Sanguinetti. ALERTA ROJO POR EL OZONO La parte m�s debilitada de la capa de ozono anticipo en un mes su llegada al Atlantico sur con peligrosas consecuencias para quienes se expongan a los quemantes rayos solares. Los registros en unidades Dobson, el indice para determinar los rayos ultra violeta, alcanzaron un m�nimo hist�rico en Punta Arenas, extremo sur de Chile y en las Falklands/Malvinas donde el gobierno de inmediato ordeno una alerta roja. Por alguna raz�n aun desconocida, los argentinos que hab�an anticipado el fen�meno desde la Base Marambio en la Antartida, como primera reacci�n retuvieron la informacion originando una protesta generalizada en las zonas mas afectadas por la erosi�n en la capa de ozono. Se entiende como un registro normal y sin consecuencias, 300 Dobson, pero cualquier �ndice menor a los 220 es considerado peligroso: la exposici�n al sol debe ser reducida al minimo, y se requiere protecci�n especial para la piel y ojos. Los registros en Punta Arenas a mediados de setiembre, el mes cr�tico este a�o, estuvieron un par de d�as por debajo de los 200 Dobson. Vea el mapa ampliado TRES CANDIDATOS SE DISPUTAN BANCA EN EL CONSEJO LEGISLATIVO Finalmente ser�n tres los candidatos de Port Stanley que se disputaran el 17 de octubre, la banca en el Consejo Legislativo que quedara vacante a principios de setiembre, con la muerte de John Cheek, quien fuera posiblemente el mas destacado de los pol�ticos de las islas. En sus plataformas electorales los tres candidatos rechazan cualquier discusi�n con Argentina sobre la soberania, reafirman su derecho a la autodeterminaci�n pero admiten la necesidad de conversaciones "realistas" sobre petroleo y pesca. Los candidatos son un joven isle�o, hijo de padre chileno quien retornara a las islas despues de siete a�os en el ejercito brit�nico; una funcionar�a del Correo de origen ingles, y el ex Gerente General de la Corporacion para el Desarrollo de las islas. Elvio Miguel Cofre, 29 anos, quien emigrara al Reino Unido en 1978 y actualmente se desempe�a como jerarca en el Departamento de Viviendas del gobierno, quiza sea el m�s audaz en sus propuestas. Cofre entiende que los Consejeros deben aprovechar toda oportunidad posible para exponer ante los argentinos sus opiniones pol�ticas y su derecho a la auto-determinaci�n, pero similarmente favorece una flexibilizacion en cuanto al ingreso de argentinos a las islas. "Este problema debe ser resuelto durante nuestra vida y no se lo podemos legar a nuestros hijos; precisamos un criterio intergeneracional m�s equilibrado", reafirma Cofre. June Beasley-Clarke, de 50 a�os, esta casada con un ex Infante de Marina titular del principal laboratorio fotografico en las islas. Madre de cinco hijos, June es una ferviente defensora del estilo de vida de las islas (a donde retornara por segunda vez en 1988), y entiende que est� en condiciones de contribuir en bien de la comunidad y el Consejo Legislativo. "No quiero que las islas se conviertan en una miniatura del Reino Unido, tenemos nuestras propias tradiciones y estilo de vida", sostiene June. Pero el candidato con el mayor perfil, y favorito, es Michael Summers, 44 anos, isleno de sexta generaci�n, quien ahora se desempe�a como consultor privado y tiene una larga experiencia en el exterior y en el gobierno local. Summers apoya abiertamente la actual pol�tica del Consejo referente a (no) v�nculos con Argentina, es partidario de favorecer el desarrollo rural, priorizar el sector privado y de una planificaci�n a largo plazo para asegurar que las islas conserven su iniciativa pol�tica y econ�mica en los a�os por delante, y asi eviten ser sorprendidos por los acontecimientos. La gran ausente de la elecci�n parcial, y que se entendia podria haber sido la elegida para concluir el mandato de su marido, sera Jane Cheek, impedida de participar por un "tecnicismo" en la presentaci�n de su formulario de aspirante. CONFIRMADA LA AGENDA PARA LA CONFERENCIA ARGENTINO-BRITANICO Un grupo influyente de pol�ticos, acad�micos y empresarios argentinos y brit�nicos, asi como varios isle�os, se reunir�n este fin de mes en Salta, Argentina, para una conferencia cuyo centro de discusiones ser�n las disputadas Falklands/Malvinas . A partir de la finalizaci�n del conflicto del Atlantico sur, las sesiones regulares de la Conferencia Argentino-Brit�nico han hecho mucho por mejorar las relaciones diplom�ticas y comerciales entre ambos paises. Sin embargo en esta ocasi�n la disputa en torno a la islas figurara con destaque en la agenda, pero ciertamente no por la inminencia de un incidente, sino m�s bien porque el excelente nivel en las relaciones argentino-britanicas han dejado como el �nico tema problem�tico, el de las Falklands/Malvinas. Entre las personalidades brit�nicas se anuncian Jacques Arnold MP, Sir Kenneth Carlisle MP, Alastair Forsyth, Baroness Hooper, Andrew Graham Yool, Viscount Montgomery de Alamein, John Bueno, Gerente General de British Gas Argentina. La delegaci�n incluye al Senador Eduardo Menem, Embajador Carlos Manuel Muniz, el ex-ministro de RR.EE. Juan R. Aguirre Linari, Julio Macchi, presidente de la Bolsa de Buenos Aires, el empresario Santiago Soldati, Carlos Bulgheroni, presidente de la petrolera Bridas y del Club Argentino-Europeo. La delegaci�n de tres isle�os incluye a Terry Betts un empresario local, Lewis Clifton Director de Desiere Petroleum y Graham Bound quien reemplaza a Robin Lee. Otra ausencia que se hara sentir es la del vocero Laborista para asuntos latinoamericanos, Tony Lloyd MP, quien a �ltimo momento anunci� su imposibilidad de concurrir. PARLAMENTARIO LABORISTA PIDE NEGOCIACIONES SOBRE SOBERANIA Un gobierno laborista deberia reanudar inmediatamente conversaciones con Argentina por la soberania de las Falklands/Malvinas con el fin de alcanzar un acuerdo negociado a largo plazo seg�n uno de los parlamentarios decanos del socialismo brit�nico. Tom Dalyell que ha sido miembro del parlamento desde 1962 y que se presentara para un nuevo mandato en la circunscripci�n escocesa de Linlithgow enfatiz� que cuanto antes se logre un acuerdo respecto a la soberania, "mejor para todas las partes". Las expresiones de Dalyell tienen especial proyeccion del momento que se da con cierta certeza que en 1997 Gran Bretana sera gobernada por los Laboristas. Sin embargo en la �ltima conferencia del Partido Laborista, los representantes de dicha fuerza incluyendo quien probablemente sea el pr�ximo primer ministro, Tony Blair, se comprometieron personalmente frente a una delegaci�n isle�a encabezada por Consejeros a respetar la voluntad de las islas basado en el derecho a la auto determinaci�n. Dalyell quien se reunio con el Embajador argentino en Londres Rogelio Pfirter empero sostiene que es necesario un acercamiento constructivo de los isle�os con autoridades argentinas por varias razones. Dificilmente se repitan las circunstancias de una amistad tan estrecha como en 1982 con la Sra. Thatcher y Mr. Reagan. Adem�s hoy en dia no existe el apoyo de la opinion p�blica brit�nica. Por otra parte si hay petroleo en torno a las islas, solo podr� extraerse con la asistencia de Argentina. Finalmente el compromiso argentino de respetar derechos, tradiciones y estilo de vida de los isle�os es probablemente lo m�s que se puede esperar de un futuro acuerdo sobre la soberania, concluyo diciendo Dalyell Edici�n06/09/96 Volver WT01-B08-106IA062-000353-B007-1http://www.falkland-malvinas.com:80/sne0609.html 207.32.88.17 19970115205245 text/html 11667HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:45:44 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 11495Last-modified: Sun, 29 Dec 1996 07:27:28 GMT sne0609 TEMPORADA DE EXPOSICIONES RURALES Agosto y setiembre son meses claves para la agropecuaria en los pa�ses del Mercosur. En ese per�odo se celebran las muestras ganaderas y de industrias anexas, mas importantes de Argentina, Brasil, Paraguay y Uruguay, ofreciendo un panorama de las perspectivas y animo que reina en el sector. Este a�o la muestra de Palermo en Argentina no escap� del ambiente recesivo y de preocupaci�n que afecta a los agentes econ�micos argentinos, si bien el sector agr�cola por la firmeza del mercado internacional de los granos atraviesa un buen momento. La ganader�a en cambio se ha visto condicionada por las consecuencias negativas para el mercado internacional de la carne de la epidemia de la "vaca loca" y la depresi�n en los precios de la lana. Igualmente la inestabilidad del clima, con temperaturas extremas a destiempo de las estaciones ha ocasionado grandes perdidas en los cuatro pa�ses del Mercosur: las secas se van alternado con inundaciones y registros bajo cero afectando la capacidad de alimentaci�n de los campos naturales. En Paraguay anuncios oficiales de apoyo a la ganader�a neutralizaron esos efectos y en Brasil en la exposici�n de Esteio en Porto Alegre, y la mayor de ese pa�s con mas de 4.200 animales, a pesar de una promesa del gobierno de un paquete para fomentar las exportaciones se cosecharon mas quejas que aplausos. Tanto en Palermo, Esteio como Paraguay la venta de reproductores en esta edici�n fue menor a la del a�o pasado. Falta saber lo que acontecer� en la muestra rural del Prado en Uruguay, el pa�s que mas depende de los precios internacionales de los productos agr�colas pues exporta la mayor�a de su producci�n. Sin embargo en Uruguay el sector rural tambi�n se queja amargamente adem�s de la carga fiscal. Visite expoprado CHILE FUERTE INVERSOR EN MERCOSUR A pesar que reci�n el mes de octubre pr�ximo comienza a regir el acuerdo de Chile con Mercosur, las inversiones externas del pa�s andino durante los �ltimos a�os se han estado dirigiendo mayoritariamente hacia ese grupo de paises. Sobre un total de 8.634 millones de d�lares que Chile ha invertido en el exterior casi cinco mil millones o sea el 57% han sido colocados en el Mercosur desde 1990 seg�n cifras divulgadas por el Comit� de Inversiones Extranjeras del Ministerio de Econom�a chileno. De ese total un 90% se ha colocado en Argentina, 7% en Brasil y el resto en Paraguay y Uruguay. Si bien el grueso de las colocaciones chilenas hasta el momento se han dirigido hacia Argentina aprovechando la pol�tica de privatizaciones, es sabido que uno de los objetivos principales de la participaci�n de Chile en Mercosur es el mercado brasile�o. En Brasil Chile ha invertido 340 millones de d�lares pero participa en proyectos de negocios que superan los 1.300 millones de d�lares. . "UNO DE LOS FENOMENOS MAS INTERESANTES" El Mercosur es uno de los fen�menos m�s significativos del continente y es interesante comprobar que las decisiones para conformar ese mercado se est�n tomando fuera de la �rbita de Washington afirmo Henry Kissinger, ex Secretario de Estado de los EE.UU. del gobierno de Richard Nixon. Kissinger entrevistado sobre las actuales relaciones de EE. UU. con Latinoam�rica dijo que lamentablemente el presidente Clinton no muestra inter�s por el continente. "En cuatro a�os no ha visitado siquiera M�xico, pero lo mas preocupante para mi es que no se presta la debida atenci�n al fen�meno del Mercosur", resalto Kissinger. Por primera vez en la historia seg�n el consultor internacional existe un grupo de pa�ses aliados del cual esta excluido Estados Unidos. "Los presidentes de Brasil y Argentina son buenos amigos, pero las decisiones sobre el futuro de una regi�n tan importante en el hemisferio occidental est�n surgiendo en Buenos Aires mientras Washington permanece indiferente", explico Kissinger. De acuerdo al ex-profesor de Harvard es esencial para Estados Unidos recuperar la iniciativa continental e intentar la confluencia en un solo mercado com�n del NAFTA y Mercosur. BRASIL TRABA TEXTILES Brasil ha vuelto a trabar las importaciones de textiles al decidir unilateralmente bajar de 180 a 30 d�as el plazo para el pago de las compras en el exterior. Cuando se anuncio la medida por primera vez en mayo pasado, Uruguay y Paraguay protestaron en�rgicamente y luego Argentina. Un mes despu�s en el marco de la cumbre presidencial de los pa�ses del Mercosur celebrada en San Luis, Argentina, Brasil retorno al plazo de 180 d�as para sus socios. En esta ocasion aparentemente la resoluci�n del Banco Central incluye precios m�nimos de importaci�n que violan las normas de la Organizaci�n Mundial de Comercio. En Brasil medios pol�ticos han dicho que la medida obedece alas intenciones del gobierno de Cardoso de enfriar las importaciones para satisfacer a los industriales paulistas y contener el desbalance comercial. NEGOCIACION CON EL BLOQUE ANDINO El Mercosur acepto la propuesta del Grupo Andino de negociar en bloque el establecimiento de una zona com�n de libre comercio. Comisiones especiales del Mercosur y del Grupo Andino han sido encomendadas para preparar los documentos a negociar si bien no se han puesto una fecha definitiva para la reuni�n. "No queremos precipitar las conversaciones y vamos a iniciar analizando mecanismos y criterios para la negociaci�n", dijo el Ministro de Comercio Exterior de Colombia Morris Harf. Un primer encuentro formal esta previsto se realice en Lima. El Grupo Andino esta conformado por Colombia, Ecuador, Per� y Venezuela. CHILE QUIERE RENEGOCIAR Cuando faltan apenas d�as para la puesta en vigencia del acuerdo Chile-Mercosur rubricado por los cinco presidentes pero que aun aguarda aprobaci�n del senado chileno, autoridades de Santiago de chile adelantaron que desean ampliar la lista de productos negociados para ingresar al Mercosur. De acuerdo al Director de Relaciones Comerciales Internacionales de la canciller�a chilena, Carlos Mladinic, el pedido se fundamenta en el aumento de aranceles a 17 productos dispuestos por Brasil y que afectan directamente las ventas chilenas. El anuncio se realiza cuando el Senado chileno comienza el debate sobre el acuerdo con Mercosur que fuera aprobado por amplia mayor�a en Diputados pero que ha levantado fuertes resistencias en sectores agr�colas tradicionales quienes van lanzado una campa�a publica de sensibilizaci�n. Tambi�n otros sectores importadores est�n preocupados que las preferencias arancelarias otorgadas a los pa�ses del Mercosur despierten represalias de socios comerciales tradicionales de Chile. MERCOSUR ADECUARA ARANCELES Autoridades del Mercosur negociar�n en el curso de este mes con la Organizaci�n Mundial de Comercio (OMC), la adecuaci�n de sus pol�ticas comerciales a normas vigentes internacionales, para lo cual ser� necesario alterar algunos aspectos del Arancel Externo Com�n. Durante una de las ultimas sesiones de la Comisi�n de Comercio de Mercosur se aprob� una lista de productos cuyas tarifas ser�n reducidas para adecuarla alas exigencias de la OMC. Otro tema que abordo dicha comisi�n fue la armonizaci�n de las reglas de aplicaci�n de los regimenes de origen de los productos de los cuatro pa�ses, los cuales para calificar como tal, deben alcanzar un m�nimo del 60%. Despu�s de la reuni�n con negociadores de la OMC en Ginebra delegados del Mercosur tienen previsto mantener encuentros con representante de India, Jap�n y la Uni�n Europea para establecer agendas de trabajo. 6/9/96 Edici�n 6/8/96 Volver WT01-B08-107IA062-000353-B007-32http://www.falkland-malvinas.com:80/adeos.html 207.32.88.17 19970115205336 text/html 911HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:46:30 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 741Last-modified: Wed, 11 Dec 1996 04:17:20 GMT Adeos Fuente : NASA/ ADEOS TOMS Volver WT01-B08-108IA062-000353-B007-64http://www.falkland-malvinas.com:80/mne0609.html 207.32.88.17 19970115205416 text/html 13245HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:47:17 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 13073Last-modified: Sun, 29 Dec 1996 07:19:35 GMT mne0609 DESARROLLO URBANO DE PORT STANLEY El gobierno de las Falklands / Malvinas invertir� seis millones de libras en el desarrollo urbano y extensi�n de la capital Port Stanley. Una empresa escocesa fue seleccionada para el proyecto el cual incluye la construcci�n de ochenta nuevas viviendas y el trazado al este de Stanley de una red de calles, saneamiento y el tendido .de los respectivos servicios el�ctricos y de agua potable. El proyecto es el segundo en importancia por su desembolso en la historia de las islas. Desde fines del conflicto de 1982 y como resultado de la bonanza producida por la pesca, la capital de las islas ha sufrido una severa escasez de viviendas lo cual se estima ha contenido el crecimiento de la ciudad. Las perspectivas que promete el petr�leo, tambi�n ha incidido en la demanda de viviendas y de predios para construir. En la actualidad Port Stanley cuenta con unas 300 viviendas. Un censo de poblaci�n y viviendas realizado a principios de a�o, y cuyas resultados ser�n divulgados pr�ximamente ayudar�n a completar un panorama de la situaci�n. TRES ISLE�OS VISITARAN LA ARGENTINA Tres destacados miembros de las Falklands / Malvinas han de participar de la pr�xima reuni�n de la Conferencia Argentino - Brit�nica (ABC) a celebrarse en octubre en la ciudad de Salta. Los tres empresarios que anticiparon a la prensa de las islas que habr�an de concurrir son: Lewis Clifton, Director de Byron Holdings Ltd. y Desire Petroleum; Terry Betts de JBG Falklands Ltd. una compa��a de pesca, y Robin Lee uno de los productores rurales mas fuertes de las islas y co-propietario de White Rock Ltd., empresa contratista de obra p�blica. Si bien los tres empresarios han sido integrantes del Consejo Legislativo, ninguno de los miembros de la actual legislatura acepto la invitaci�n de ABC, una organizaci�n no gubernamental creada para discutir relaciones pol�ticas y v�nculos culturales entre Argentina y Gran Breta�a. Los tres empresarios de las islas participaran como integrantes de la delegaci�n brit�nica que incluye a varias destacadas e influyentes personalidades de Londres algunos de ellos con v�nculos e intereses en Argentina. La reuni�n esta oficialmente agendada para el 25/27 de octubre y el anfitri�n de ABC en la oportunidad ser� el Instituto Argentino de Relaciones Exteriores, una organizaci�n tambi�n no gubernamental que auspicia visitas de acad�micos y conferencias. Esta ser� la sexta reuni�n de ABC; la ultima fue celebrada el a�o pasado en Oxford, Inglaterra. VINCULO AEREO CON CHILE El gobierno de las Falklands / Malvinas ha decidido brindarle hasta marzo de 1997 asistencia adicional a DAP, la l�nea a�rea chilena que desde 1991 ha estado volando a las islas desde Punta Arenas. La cifra acordada por el Consejo Ejecutivo, � 75.000, tiene por objeto asegurar los vuelos del Boeing 727 de DAP a Punta Arenas y luego Santiago para combinar con las frecuencias regulares de British Airways a Gran Breta�a. La compa��a chilena cubre la mayor�a del extremo sur del continente sudamericano, incluyendo a Ushuaia, Argentina, con aviones menores del tipo Twin Otter con capacidad para diez pasajeros, que tambi�n semanalmente volaban a Port Stanley. A partir de enero de este a�o DAP comenz� a volar dos veces a la semana al aeropuerto de Mount Pleasant con un Boeing 727 y capacidad para 125 personas, pero ha encontrado mayores dificultades de las esperadas para llenar la aeronave, a pesar de las atractivas y tentadoras tarifas para combinar con British Airways en Santiago. Para iniciar el puente a�reo con el Boeing 727, DAP ya hab�a recibido una primera asistencia financiera del gobierno de las islas del orden de los 180.000 d�lares. La Corporaci�n para el Desarrollo de las islas y la empresa chilena estiman que en los meses de verano cuando los cruceros que viajan a Ant�rtida relevan pasajeros y tripulaci�n, quedar� demostrado el �xito del proyecto. Durante el invierno el puente a�reo de DAP alas islas se ha reduj� a un vuelo semanal, muchas veces cubierto por un Twin Otter. Las Falklands / Malvinas cuentan adem�s con una conexi�n bisemanal a Gran Breta�a, con una �nica escala en la Isla Ascensi�n, en los transportes militares Tristars de la RAF, que ofrecen un limitado numero de asientos para los civiles. REX HUNT OPTIMISTA Desire Petroleum, una compa��a petrolera con sede en Gran Breta�a, y una importante participaci�n de accionistas de las Falklands / Malvinas tiene muy buenas perspectivas de obtener una licencia para explorar en algunos de los mejores cuadrantes que han sido licitados, afirmo Rex Hunt quien fuera gobernador de las islas durante el conflicto de 1982. Rex Hunt que tambi�n es vicepresidente de Desire Petroleum hizo estas declaraciones luego de saberse que dos importantes compa��as petroleras de primera l�nea, una de Texas y otra de Noruega, que estaba previsto participaran del consorcio exploratorio, anunciaron que se retiraban. Se esperaba que ambas empresas se convirtieran en los segundos accionistas de Desire, despu�s de Lasmo Internacional de Escocia que es titular del 50% del paquete. Accionistas individuales de las islas adquirieron acciones por el equivalente a medio mill�n de libras en Desire Petroleum, una empresa creada especialmente para intervenir en la licitaci�n del gobierno de las islas para explorar en busca de hidrocarburos en aguas de las Falkalnds / Malvinas. Los noruegos desistieron del consorcio porque estaban en desacuerdo con los planes de LASMO de perforar dos pozos durante la primera etapa (de cinco a�os) de la licencia de exploraci�n. GREENPEACE ADVIERTE SOBRE PETROLEO El grupo ecol�gico Greenpeace esta siguiendo de cerca el proceso de desarrollo de exploraci�n petrolifera en aguas de las Falklands / Malvinas y ha anticipado que podr�a oponerse activamente a los trabajos que se realicen. "Nosotros vigilamos con mucha atenci�n el desarrollo de nuevos campos y cuencas petrol�feros, sobre todo en �reas v�rgenes o de frontera como en las Falklands / Malvinas que son marginales y exigen sofisticadas tecnolog�as", afirmo Paul Horseman. Horseman esta al frente del capitulo brit�nico de Greenpeace y fue el ejecutor de la exitosa campana para evitar el hundimiento Ken el Atl�ntico norte de la plataforma petrol�fera Brent Star, perteneciente a la Shell. "El ecosistema de las Falklands / Malvinas cuenta con una vida natural muy rica y el Atl�ntico sur esta expuesto a algunos de los vientos mas arrachados del mundo lo cual acrecienta el riesgo de derrames petrol�feros", explico Horseman. Horseman rehuso anticipar si Greenpeace estaba planificando protestas en la zona de Falklands / Malvinas pero dijo ,'nuestros miembros siempre est�n prontos para embarcarse en cualquier momento" . En octubre se espera que el gobierno de las islas anuncie a que consorcios se les extender� licencias de exploraci�n ven que cuadrantes se comenzara a operar. MUERTE DE UN CONSEJERO CONDUCE A ELECCION PARCIAL La muerte de uno de los pol�ticos y Consejeros m�s destacados de las Falklands / Malvinas , John Cheek, 57, ha ocasionado gran congoja y dolor en las islas. Pero tambi�n obligar� a una elecci�n parcial en las pr�ximas semanas para llenar la banca, pr�cticamente doce meses antes de las elecciones generales para renovar a los ocho miembros del Consejo. John Cheek, un exitoso isle�o y uno de los primeros en aprovechar las oportunidades que ofrec�a la pesca en las Falklands / Malvinas como resultado del conflicto de 1982, fue electo por primera vez en 1981 y en poco tiempo se convirti� en uno de los Consejeros con mayor capacidad de liderazgo. Pragm�tico en su enfoque respecto a las relaciones con Argentina (estaba a favor de negociaciones en materia de pesca y petr�leo), Cheek sin embargo fue uno de los m�s comprometidos con la publicaci�n del documento de los Consejeros sobre el futuro de las islas, basado en el concepto de "independencia segura". En 1982 cuando la invasi�n argentina, Cheek estaba en Gran Breta�a y paso las restantes diez semanas del conflicto emitiendo diariamente a las Falklands / Malvinas , y actuando de hecho junto al entonces Gobernador Rex Hunt, como un gobierno de las islas en exilio. Con la empresa "Fortuna", la primera de las compa��as de pesca enteramente de las islas, John Cheek tambi�n pudo demostrar su talento como empresario, convirti�ndose en un hombre de s�lida posici�n econ�mica y miembro influyente de la comunidad. El Gobernador de las islas, Richard Ralph describi� a Cheek como un "Consejero excepcional; un patriota de las Falklands / Malvinas e hijo prodigo de las islas". Cheek fue electo Consejero en tres oportunidades y trabajo por el cargo hasta �ltimo momento. A fines de agosto y despu�s de haber presidido una comisi�n legislativa anuncio su renuncia, apenas pocas horas antes de su muerte a causa de una larga batalla contra la leucemia. 06/09/96 Edici�n 06/08/96 Volver WT01-B08-109IA062-000353-B007-90http://www.falkland-malvinas.com:80/sne0608.html 207.32.88.17 19970115205436 text/html 5632HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:47:38 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 5461Last-modified: Sun, 29 Dec 1996 07:27:14 GMT Noticias del Mercosur M. Fernandez Amun�tegui en Uruguay. Los valores democr�ticos, una econom�a abierta y un futuro estrechamente ligado a Latinoam�rica son los principales elementos de la pol�tica exterior de Chile”, afirm� el Subsecretario de Relaciones Exteriores chileno quien recientemente visitara Montevideo. Mariano Fern�ndez Amun�tegui sostuvo que las relaciones de Chile con los pa�ses latinoamericanos est�n atravesando un excelente momento. Chile y el Mercosur La mitad de la poblaci�n chilena (49%) opina que el ingreso al Mercosur ser� beneficioso para el pa�s seg�n una encuesta realizada en las principales ciudades y en el campo. Sin embargo en las zonas rurales el apoyo result� bastante inferior al registrado en �reas urbanas. La encuesta tambi�n indic� que el 45% de los chilenos opina que el pa�s est� progresando, mientras que el 39% manifest� que estaba estancado y el 13% en decadencia. Un 44% de los encuestados manifest� su apoyo al gobierno del presidente Eduardo Frei, en tanto un 33% rechaz� las pol�ticas en ejecuci�n . La mayor�a de los chilenos considera que el gobierno chileno ha mostrado debilidad ante los lobbies y grupos de presi�n. Chile y Argentina Por primera vez desde que Chile y Argentina son independientes vamos a poder contar con una frontera sin disputas, sin malas interpretaciones, ni malos entendidos” , resalt� Fern�ndez quien agreg� que la mayor�a de las inversiones chilenas en el exterior actualmente est�n dirigidas hacia Argentina. Fern�ndez dijo adem�s que Chile mantiene conversaciones con los pa�ses de la cuenca del Pac�fico y Canad� para desarrollar v�nculos m�s estrechos en materia comercial y de inversiones, y seguramente se convertir� en la puerta natural de los pa�ses del Mercosur hacia esa zona. Sanciones econ�micas a Libia e Ir�n Los pa�ses del Mercosur rechazaron la resoluci�n del gobierno Clinton de sancionar a aquellas empresas que comercien en petr�leo y gas con Libia e Ir�n. El Acta de Sanciones 1996 contra Ir�n y Libia, similar en su redacci�n a la Helms-Burton que castiga aquellas empresas que comercien con Cuba, tambi�n se ha convertido para Washington en un �rea de confrontaci�n con Europa. Para el Uruguay la instrumentaci�n de esta legislaci�n podr�a tener consecuencias muy negativas del momento que durante la �ltima d�cada Ir�n se ha transformado en un importante mercado para lana, carne y arroz a cambio de petr�leo. Uruguay tambi�n sali� perdiendo como consecuencia del embargo de las Naciones Unidas impuesto a Irak durante la Guerra del Golfo : Bagdad adquir�a anualmente 40.000 toneladas de carne ovina 7/8/96 Volver WT01-B08-110IA062-000353-B007-118http://www.falkland-malvinas.com:80/mne0608.html 207.32.88.17 19970115205501 text/html 7292HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 15 Jan 1997 20:47:58 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.3Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 7121Last-modified: Sun, 29 Dec 1996 07:19:12 GMT Noticias de Falkland-Malvinas Petroleo en Falkland/Malvinas El panel especialmente designado por el gobierno de las Falklands /Malvinas comenz� en Londres la ronda de entrevistas con los seis consorcios que se presentaron a la licitaci�n petrolera de las Falklands/Malvinas. Los seis consorcios representan un total de catorce compa��as de diez pa�ses distintos. El panel integrado por cinco miembros y sus asesores examinar�n en detalle las propuestas para explorar diez cuadrantes con perspectivas de petr�leo en aguas al norte de las islas. Se espera que un informe final sea redactado hacia mediados de setiembre cuando sea elevado a consideraci�n del Concejo Legislativo de las islas en Stanley. Una vez que el Gobernador haya estampado su firma el informe ser� devuelto a Londres para su aprobaci�n final por el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores del Reino Unido. Los consorcios deber�n exponer ante el panel un programa de trabajo sostenible, demostrar estabilidad financiera y una confiable trayectoria empresarial al igual que el mejor paquete comercial posible para las islas. Las compa��as petroleras esperan estar operando en aguas de las Falklands/Malvinas para el verano entrante. Paul Newman El actor Paul Newman don� U$S 40.000 para un fondo de caridad organizado por el veterano de la guerra de las Falklands/Malvinas, Simon Weston. Weston quien result� gravemente quemado durante un ataque a�reo argentino en 1982, estableci� el “Weston Spirit” para perpetuar el esp�ritu y determinaci�n que le permitieron sobreponerse a las heridas que lo han dejado permanentemente marcado. La organizaci�n opera una red de centros donde j�venes de �reas urbanas pauperizadas son ayudados en sus estudios y a proseguir carreras que los aleje del crimen y una vida delictiva. La donaci�n de Newman proviene de los beneficios alcanzados por una exitosa compa��a de alimentos de su propiedad. Los fondos van a ser utilizados para montar un nuevo centro juvenil en el East End de Londres, una de las zonas m�s peligrosas de dicha ciudad. Newman no pudo asistir a la ceremonia de entrega del cheque pero su representante ley� un mensaje de la estrella : “La dedicaci�n y compromiso de Sim�n con la juventud conforman un programa de recuperaci�n muy necesario”. Newman tiene su propio programa de caridad, (The hole in the wall gang camps) que est� constituido por una serie de campamentos distribuidos en los EE.UU., Francia e Irlanda donde ni�os con impedimentos y deficiencias pueden disfrutar activamente de vacaciones. V�nculo A�reo Prosiguen las conversaciones en Santiago de Chile para mejorar el v�nculo a�reo Falklands/Malvinas - Chile/Gran Breta�a. Entre las posibilidades que se manejan est�n las de incluir evacuaciones m�dicas de emergencia a Santiago y un aumento en la capacidad de carga mediante la remoci�n de varias filas de asientos del Boeing 727 de bandera chilena que cubre el trayecto. En la actualidad el v�nculo incluye un vuelo semanal Punta Arenas/Stanley/Punta Arenas a cargo de la l�nea chilena DAP, en tiempo para la combinaci�n en Santiago con los vuelos de British Airways a Londres. Pesquero Chileno La compa��a chilena armadora del pesquero “Antonio Lorenzo” que fuera multada unas � 367.000 el 9 de julio pr�ximo pasado por pesca ilegal en aguas de las islas Georgias del Sur se ha rehusado a pagar el importe y ha denunciado la situaci�n ante la canciller�a chilena. La decisi�n de no pagar se fundament� en el no reconocimiento por parte de la empresa Pesquero Concar S.A. de las 200 millas de jurisdicci�n impuestas en torno a las islas por el gobierno de las Georgias y el hecho que Chile es miembro de CAMELAR, una Conferencia internacional para la Conservaci�n de los Recursos Marinos Ant�rticos que cubre justamente esa �rea. El caso logr� atenci�n internacional por la presencia en Stanley, Falklands/Malvinas, donde se desarroll� el juicio, de un abogado especial, Consejero de la Reina, lo cual dio lugar a que se podr�a plantear un abierto desaf�o por parte de los chilenos a la soberan�a brit�nica en las Georgias del Sur. Es la segunda vez que el “Antonio Lorenzo” es arrestado y condenado en Stanley : la primera vez fue en 1994 cuando debi� pagar una multa de � 74.000. 7/8/96 src="images/atras.gif" alt="Back" align="absmiddle" border="0" width="50" height="50">Volver WT01-B08-111IA069-000435-B024-389http://www.whitneyfarm.com:80/ 206.163.112.59 19970208173951 text/html 2549HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Sat, 08 Feb 1997 17:39:59 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b6Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Tue, 05 Nov 1996 20:11:39 GMTETag: "ae4-907-327f9f7b"Content-Length: 2311Accept-Ranges: bytes Whitney Farms Organic Gardening Fertilizers Soil Amendments Garden Composting Lawn Care Products All Natural, All Organic [ Products |Monthly Special |About Us |Name that Poo! |Our Faves | Order/Pricing |Ask the Gardener |The Dirt |Martha + Malcolm | Smell |Gardening |Compost |E-Mail |Feedback ] © Whitney Farms and The Garden Grow Co. 1996 Yes, here too.

People often assume that organic gardening is some kind of fad or gimmick that is the result of the latest environmental concern. Organic gardening is in no way a new phenomenon, however. It is a return to the methods of cultivation practiced for centuries. Organic gardening is a conscious effort on the part of the gardener to reintroduce the cycles and inherent balances of nature back into their gardens. Organic gardening has several basic principles that provide the foundation for its success: Learn to live with nature, not in confrontation with it. Promote diversity within the garden. It is through this diversity that nature achieves stability. Grow plants in environments to which they are best suited. Feed the soil, not the plant. It is the health of the soil that ensures a plant's health. Return to the soil as much as you take out. Think of the garden as a total system. Organic gardeners think of the soil as the foundation of a healthy garden. The soil holds most of the vital nutrients a plant requires for growth. The soil also serves as the reservoir for the water plants require. By feeding our soil, making regular additions of organic matter, we create an environment that fosters the growth of healthy, vibrant, and nutritious plants. Plants are allowed to grow at their natural rate (not pushed along by synthetic fertilizers) and they therefore develop a higher resistance to attacks by insects and diseases. By creating diversity in our gardens, such as planting flowers in vegetable gardens, we learn to attract beneficial insects and other life into our garden to help us maintain an appropriate equilibrium. In time we learn to accept a few holes in the leaf, the occasional slug or snail, the presence of weeds, as signs that the garden is healthy, vital, and self-sustaining. As a result , we are able to vastly reduce the chemical dependency many gardens have unwittingly developed. Whitney Farms Organic Fertilizers and Soils provide the gardener with sources of the finest quality fertilizers and soils derived from entirely natural sources. We have made every effort to produce plant foods that feed and enrich the soil so that the gardener may enjoy the abundance a healthy garden can afford. About Organic Fertilizers Any discussion of fertilizers should begin with at least a brief overview of plant nutrition. It is commonly accepted that there are 16 elements required by plants for healthy growth. Of these, three-carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen-are supplied by air and water. The other 13 are normally absorbed from the soil by plant roots. This group of 13 is further divided into 3 subgroups: primary nutrients , secondary nutrients, and micro nutrients. All of these elements are essential, regardless of the amounts required. They include: Primary Nutrients: Nitrogen, Phosphorous,Potassium Secondary Nutrients: Calcium,Magnesium, Sulfur Micro nutrients: Zinc, iron, Manganese,Copper, Boron, Molybdenum, and Chlorine All of these nutrients work together in a delicate balance to promote plant growth. For example, an excess of one nutrient can reduce a plant's ability to absorb another. The role of any fertilizer is to improve the fertility of the soil. The soil supports plant life and is the vehicle that supplies the necessary nutrients to the plant. The more fertile a soil is (i.e. rich in organic matter) the more likely it is to yield a healthy and abundant garden. Fertilizers are commonly divided into two different categories: synthetic/chemical fertilizers and natural organic ones. Plants cannot tell the difference between an organic and a synthetic/chemical fertilizer. The difference between the two types of fertilizers is evident in their impact on the soil. Organic fertilizers feed the soil, not the plant. The soil will feed the plant. Organic fertilizers help maintain overall soil fertility by contributing vital organic matter and enhancing the soil structure in addition to supplying plant nutrients.They are most often derived from the by-products of once living organisms or from rock powders. Organic fertilizers are released gradually to the plant. They actually form a store house in the soil; the plant takes up the nutrients as it needs them. Soil fertility is maintained and enhanced for the long-term benefit of the garden. Synthetic/chemical fertilizers are formulated to be fast-acting. Most synthetic fertilizers are salt or acid-based. They typically have a higher nutrient grade than do natural organic fertilizers and they are often intended to be immediately available to the plant. In many cases the plant can only use 10% to 15% of the available nutrients in synthetic/ chemical fertilizers. The rest is essentially wasted -creating possible harmful side effects and suppressing many beneficial soil organisms. Soil fertility can be reduced with an excess of synthetic/chemical fertilizer use. Whitney Farms Organic Fertilizers are derived from entirely natural sources. Except for our rock powders, all of our organic fertilizers are by-products that have been "recycled" for the gardener's benefit. Our fertilizers fit into two categories: fertilizer blends and simple plant foods. All Whitney Farms Organic Fertilizers are derived from natural organic sources (as defined by organic certifying organizations). We produce plant foods that aid the gardener by feeding and enriching the soil. A rich soil will produce an abundant garden.

I enjoy mowing the lawn. In fact, I enjoy it so much that I even mow my neighbor's yard every week. It sounds strange as I write this but I seem to get lost when I am pushing the mower back and forth. It must go back to my Midwest roots and the long summers of lawn mowing.My first real business in high school was mowing lawns for all of our neighbors. In my old neighborhood there are no fences. It is just a collection of shared lawns with houses in the middle. It was not uncommon to start mowing in a straight line at one home and turn around four houses later.We rarely see lawns of this magnitude in the West. Like most of my neighbors, we've taken out most of the existing lawn and put in flower beds. Even as good as the flower beds look, without the lawn in the middle the yard would look incomplete.

Sadly, we have not been able to give it theattention it deserves- i.e., more frequent updates. Never fear, weWILL continue to update it, maybe someday at a quicker pace Martha Stewart has beautiful hair...leave her alone!You are not funny.....you are really a waste of time Ouch- that stings! �Though I suppose there are WORSE places tohere a statement like that. Keep the cartoonist--however, I don't believe MS cuts her weeds atroot level. Martha removes the entire root. Malcolm needs adifferent weeding technique if he intends to keep his position as oneof Martha's helpers. I make no claims as to being an expert in gardening. I do try toconsult with our resident experts, but often when I'm busy cartooning,they're off doing something silly- like gardening. steer manure ??? how old r u? my guess is 14. Actually, I'm 26. It's a real challenge to come across asimmature, so thanks for the compliment. I Loved your cartoons! Martha is a pesonal hero for me as wellway to go buddy! Nerissa, 19 yrs old from OR. Martha Stewart is a big phony! When are you people going to catch onto the fact that she and Kathie Lee Gifford are involved in aconspiracy to take over the world by creating a false image of whatwomen should be, thereby causes the brains of all women that have themto implode (those women that don't have brains are already mindlesslytrying to follow the Stewart/Gifford way of life). If all works asthey have planned, the universe will be filled with nothing butStepford wives by the year 2000, and a leadership vacuum will becreated as men try to rule the world without the input and influenceof thinking women. At this point, Martha and Kathie will make theirmove. Mr. Perot, I've told you before, this is NOT www.conspiracy.com! Can't tell if you are making fun of Martha or you really like her,either way this is very stupid -- Get a real life.... Well, for your information, I DO have a real life. I have a greatfamily, hobbies, I'm engaged to a wonderful woman, AND I GET PAID TODO THIS! HA! Do not kill him! Excellent site. I'm am 1 of 3 who maintain a pagefor Fred Meyer. Harry Jung, told me that we made honorable mention onyour page so I had to check it out. Thanks, and once again, way aboveaverage page, keep it up. Thanks for the thumbs-up! And to all of you viewers who live instates that don't have Fred Meyers, you have my sympathies. I love this stuff. Awesome cartoons.Or, to put it another way..."it's a good thing". I like to see people having fun and using their imaginations!! Implies all pommies (i.e British, although in this case I exclude theWelsh: known for their medicinal use of alcohol) are heavy imbibers.Difficult to see humour in juxtaposition of gardening and beerconsumption. Yes, that 'toon was a simplified, narrow-minded view of Brits. AndI will be the last person to encourage mass consumption of ANYTHINGdangerous, but I do have to admit that an English pub is a good placeto do it. We should kill him because quite frankly my darling, it wasn'thumorous at all. What does this have to do with Martha Stewartanyways? After seeing so much negative humour directed towards Martha, it isrefrreshing to see something that I can actually smile at! Your artwork is also top notch - keep up the good work...by the way, anyresponse from MSL yet??? You should have had him make a home-brew beer usingingredients from Martha's garden!!! pretty darn silly, I'd say Anyone who can manage to mention organic gardening, Martha Stewart,and Dogbolter Stout(3 of my great loves in life) in the same cartoon,is a man (or is it a woman), who should be treated with greatadmiration and respect. Ooh! Who sent this? We need to make it possible for people toleave their e-mail addresses (optional, of course)- I've only had 3pints of Dogbolter in my life, and I would love to find out if thereis anyway to get it in the States.

Most of the people that are on the internet areadults. This doesn't hold my interest at all and something moremature should replace it!! If it doesn't hold your interest, then why did you use so manyexclamation points??!!!!!!! Keep the toon, we all need to smile just a littlemore each day and this might help We should kill him because it isn't funny at all and i saw and readbetter than this.

Composting is a modification of the natural process of decay, which maintains and enhances the nutrients in the system. Selecting Materials There are two types of organic matter that go into the building of a compost pile: Materials high in carbon - woody dry materials like sawdust, straw, dry grass clippings, and fallen leaves. (Hint: The older and more mature the material is, the higher the carbon content.) Materials high in nitrogen - green, wet materials like fresh grass clippings, kitchen wastes, fresh green weeds, and manure's. (Hint: The greener the material, the higher the nitrogen.) Material high in carbon is usually the ingredient most readily available for composting but it is also the limiting factor in a compost pile because it breaks down slowly. To ensure the proper balance of materials, it is crucial to match the carbon content with the nitrogen content. Locating Your Compost Pile To achieve the optimum temperature, adequate mass is required. The ideal minimum size for a compost pile is a cubic yard (3 ft. by 3 ft. by 3 ft.). Position the compost pile where it will be protected from drying winds in the winter, and hot, drying sunlight in the summer. In general, the more exposed the location for the pile, the more extra watering will be required to ensure a good moisture content. Building Your Compost Pile By layering the ingredients in a compost pile, we simplify the process of balancing carbon and nitrogen. Put layers of matter high in carbon (6-8 inches thick) next to layers of matter high in nitrogen (3-4 inches thick); layers of dry ingredients next to layers of wet ingredients. In general, a number of thin layers will allow for more efficient decomposition than a few thick layers. Raw Materials Begin by loosening the soil in the area where you wish to build your compost pile. Make a base of coarse material like corn or sunflower stalks. This will allow for good aeration at the bottom of the pile and will help to hasten the decay of these materials. Water. On top of the base layer, place a 6"-8" layer of organic wastes, such as grass, leaves, and plant trimmings. (Hint: Any Material that could nut and putrefy should be mixed with other drier materials like straw or sawdust, and kept in thin layers no more than 1 "-2 " thick.) Water. Next layer: Use green materials high in nitrogen or use a nitrogen source like Whitney Farms Compost Maker. (Use 2 cups for every 6"-8" layer.) On top of the nitrogen source, it is useful to add a half-inch of soil to inoculate the pile with the appropriate microorganisms. This soil layer will also help reduce the leaching of mineral nutrients like potassium, and help to trap escaping nitrogen gas. Add water. Continue to repeat the layers adding organic wastes, a nitrogen source, and soil until the pile is completed. (Be sure to water each layer, except for those layers composed of wet materials like kitchen scraps.) The pile should be at least 3 feet high when finished. It is important to cap a finished pile with 2"-3" of soil. This final layer of soil will help to trap many escaping gases, like ammonia, and retain those nutrients in the finished compost. A thick layer of straw in winter will help to protect the pile from rain and provide insulation so that the desirable temperature for decomposition can be maintained. Air The most efficient green high decomposition requires an with the adequate supply of oxygen.Oxygen can be provided in two ways: The first technique is to construct your compost pile in layer cake fashion to provide adequate ventilation. The second technique is to turn the compost pile periodically - once or twice a month. By thoroughly turning the pile inside out, a sufficient supply of oxygen can be guaranteed and the process is accelerated. In a well built and well aerated compost pile, the process of decay generates a lots of heat - up to 150'F (66'C). This high heat is crucial for killing any weed seeds and pathogens (disease producing organisms), and for accelerating the decaying process. Monitor the temperature of the compost pile with a compost thermometer. Turn the pile after the temperature has peaked and begun to cool down. Water Water is also vital to a compost pile, because the microorganisms in the pile dependupon it for their metabolism. A compost pile that is too dry will not break down efficiently; compost pile that is too wet will interfere with oxygen availability and become anaerobic. Asyou construct the compost pile, water each layer until the material glistens; as a rule of thumb, the compost should have the feel of a damp sponge. (Some materials, like wet leaves or kitchen scraps, may be wet initially, and do not need additional watering.)

It will gently feed the lawn and enhance the vitality of the soil to provide the foundation for a healthy turf. Whitney Farms Organic Lawn Food should ,be used as a complete annual program to achieve optimum results. For those lawns converting from a "chemical dependency" on synthetic fertilizers, the first year is critical to the process of rebuilding a healthy soil ecosystem. In order to restore vitality to the soil, it is necessary to initially use our lawn food at higher rates than in subsequent years. Indeed, the longer you use it, the better your turf response. Ingredients: Blood Meal, Dried Poultry Waste, Feather Meal, and Bone Meal. Tips for Preparing New Lawns Whether using seed or sod, always begin by thoroughly preparing the soil. For best results, incorporate 2-3 inches of compost or other organic matter into the soil. Till to a depth of 6-8 inches. Level area with rake or roller. Under any new lawn it is important to establish a basis of soil fertility. To give the turf a gentle start, add Whitney Farms Organic Lawn Food at a rate of 25 lbs. per 1000 feet. Rake in lightly to a depth of 1-2 inches. Keep the new lawn area moist throughout its first 3 weeks. For newly seeded lawns, keep it moist until the grass is at least 2 inches tall. For newly sodded lawns, ... keep turf area moist for at least 3 weeks.Apply Whitney Farms Organic Lawn Food again 4-6 weeks after lawn is established. Why Use Whitney FarmsOrganic Lawn Food? The results are longer lasting. The longer you use our fertilizer, the less frequently you will need to apply it. It gently fertilizes turf grass and relies on soil microorganisms to release their nutrients at the same rate plant rootscan absorb them. Our lawn food is easy to use. It is a dust-free, homogenous blend, granulated for easy spreading. It is an ideal lawn food for the low water or drought growing conditions in the West. Available in 25 lb. bags. Tips for a Healthy Lawn Aerate lawn in spring and fall to help reduce thatch problems. Add a 1/4 to 1/2 inch of finely screened organic matter annually to enhance soil life under turf. Mow regularly. To recycle nutrients (particularly nitrogen), leave lawn clippings whenever possible. When you water, water deeply. Most lawns require about an inch of water per week. Avoid watering daily to prevent shallow root development. In the spring, mow the lawn short to help stimulate the grass. In the summer andfall, allow your grass to grow higher. This will help, shade the lawn and crowd out potential weeds. In the late fall, lower the height again.

Organic matter is the waste residues and remains of living organisms. As it undergoes the natural process of decay in the soil, it is converted gradually to a very stable form called humus. Ultimately humus and the process by which it is formed can have a dramatic impact on your garden. An adequate supply of humus in a garden will: Improve aeration in the soil and enhance its ability to absorb and retain water readily Improve the soil's ability to retain and release nutrients Provide a source of nutrients to plants Serve as a food source for soil microbes, thereby improving the soil's biological activity There are few things as important in garden preparation as adding organic matter to the soil. Yet, many gardeners have gotten away from adding organic matter to the soil and instead have relied on synthetic fertilizers. While synthetic fertilizers can provide the raw elements necessary for plant growth, they can not replace organic matter lost through the mismanagement of soils. In time, more fertilizer is needed to compensate for degeneration of organic matter in the soil. At Whitney Farms we have worked hard to develop a line of soil amendments that provides a quality compost for the home gardener. All of our manures and amendments are composted for a minimum of one year. They aren't just stacked in a big pile and left to sit; they are turned regularly with compostturning machinery to ensure proper breakdown. Throughout the process we maintain temperatures close to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for optimum breakdown. By composting, we ensure that the finished product is a material rich humus that will contribute to a garden's success. Our amendments and composts won't rob nutrients like an unfinished compost or wood byproducts will. Whitney Farms amendments add life to a garden. It is important that compost or other organic matter be added to a garden every year to keep the soil alive. We suggest that 2 inches be added and tilled in to a minimum of 6 inches before spring planting. For stubborn soils, add organic matter again in the fall as a mulch for the first few years of a garden.

Periods of extremely low rainfall, coupled with rapidly growing populations and limited reservoir capacity in some areas has prompted municipalities to institute measures to reduce outside water use. Should gardeners he concerned? Does this mean loosing that prized collection of lilies? While water use restrictions may mean an inconvenience for some, they do not signal an end to gardening. During the eighties, many areas, such as the central coast of California, endured extended periods of drought. Gardeners simply adapted and learned how to conserve water while their gardens continued to thrive. Conservation begins with wise water use. The first step should be to check existing sprinkler systems and outdoor faucets for leaks; even a slow drip can add up to hundreds of gallons of lost water in a very short time. Repair leaks, and replace worn washers with new ones. At the same time, check the a pattern of your sprinklers to ensure that your water is going where you want it, on your garden - not your neighbor's driveway or the sidewalk where it will be lost to evaporation. This is also a good time to repair that leaky hose that has dribbled water down your arm for years when you watered your hanging flower baskets. A new hose end costs very little, a new washer even less, and you can save a substantial amount of water with these simple repairs. Saving water may also require a change in your watering schedule. Many gardeners make the mistake of watering in the heat of midday when water is lost to evaporation. Instead, water during cooler periods of the day, early morning and late evening. To avoid diseases like powdery mildew, early watering schedules are best, because the water has time to evaporate from the leaf surfaces while the day warms up. Automatic timers can make early watering easier: They can be set to go on at dawn and to shut off the water after running for a specific time. Soil Learning to determine how much water to use is another important component of wise water use. Different plants will require different amounts of water, and different soils will have different water needs. Begin by establishing what type of soil you have. Generally, there are three different kinds ofsoils: sand, loam, and clay. Sandy soils will have a gritty feel if rubbed in the palm of your hand. The bigger particles in sandy soil create large air spaces between particles that allow for good drainage and fast water infiltration. Unfortunately sandy soils are often so well drained that they do not retain water well. Clay soils are the other extreme: Composed of fine particles that will fell smooth and slippery when rubbed in the palm of your hand, clay soils have very small spaces between particles. This causes them to absorb water more slowly making them prone to runoff. On the positive side however, soils of this type can hold significantly more water than sandy soils. Loamy soils lie somewhere in the middle of these two extremes, and often share the properties of easy infiltration balanced with good moisture retention. Regardless of soil type there is one factor that can substantially improve the ability of all soils to retain moisture: Compost. The spongelike quality of compost allows it to hold substantial amounts of water in a form available to plants. Incorporate compost when planting, or add it to existing beds by carefully working it into the soil around plants. Because of the absorbent nature of compost, you may have to use more water initially to thoroughly wet your soil, but you should be able to go longer between waterings, saving in the long run. Compost can also be used as a mulch, which will help conserve moisture by reducing the loss of water from the soil due to evaporation. At the same time, it acts like an absorbent covering for the soil which aids in the infiltration of water into the soil and reduces runoff. In general, compost is one of the most cost effective improvements you can make to drought-proof your garden. All of our Whitney Farms composts and soil amendments provide you with an outstanding source of high quality organic matter to help you enhance and maintain the natural reservoir in your soil. Learn to judge when to water by the color and feel of your soil. Dig down 8-12 inches and grab a handful of soil. Most soil with adequate moisture will look relatively dark, feet moist to the touch, and will form a ball under light pressure. If your soil won't form a ball and looks dry, it is time to water. It will take a while to become expert at this, but a good, sense of moisture comes with practice. Plants The kind of plants you are growing will also influence your watering methods. Different plants have different watering needs. Deeply rooted shrubs, for instance, will not have the same requirements as shallow rooting annuals. It is important when planning your garden that you take into account these differences so that plants can be grouped by water requirements and thus be maintained more easily without wasting water. Remember that the way you water will also determine the rooting depths of the plants in your garden. If you water frequently with small amounts of water, you will encourage your garden to develop shallow roots close to the surface that require almost daily applications of water. For healthy root systems that grow deep into the soil for moisture, water deeply as infrequently as possible. Even lawn grasses, usually thought of as shallow rooted, can be encouraged to root as deeply as 10 to 24 inches, which allows them to tap reserves of moisture lower in the soil, but only if the gardener waters deeply and infrequently. If you have questions about the watering requirements of plants in your garden or the kind of root systems that you can expect to develop, consult the staff at your local nursery for further information. Fertilizers An important consideration is the kind of fertilizers you use. Because most inexpensive synthetic fertilizers are salts, they can compete for moisture with plants during time of drought. At the same time, extremely soluble forms of nitrogen can encourage tender succulent growth which increases the demand for water in the plant. Avoid these problems by using Whitney Farms fertilizers. Our natural organic products are not salt based, and add valuable organic matter to your soil when you fertilize. Because they are slow release, they also allow the plants to grow at a more gradual natural rate and make more efficient use of the water available to them. Watering The kind of sprinkler you use will also have an influence on your ability to conserve water. Sprinklers come in a wide variety of styles and sizes. Ideally a sprinkler should apply water like a light spring rain with fine gentle droplets. This allows the water to soak into the soil gradually and helps to limit compaction of the soil, Additionally, some sprinklers have motions that allow the water time to soak in between cycles. This will also aid in reducing compaction and the loss of water to runoff. It is better to have a number of small sprinklers that do an excellent job of covering different areas of your garden than to try to adapt one sprinkler to a variety of different uses. Perhaps the most important tools for reducing water use in the garden are soaker hoses and drip systems. Both soaker hoses and drip systems apply water at such low rates that local authorities will often exempt them from many of the water restrictions. And because they do not spray water directly onto the foliage, these systems will also allow you to irrigate at night when there is the lowest chance of evaporation. Soaker hoses are the easiest and least expensive to use; they hook up to your spigot and the water leaches out from tiny holes along the entire length of the hose. They are best suited to intensively planted areas like vegetable gardens or ground covers where they is little concern if the area between plants is watered as well.Drip systems are similar to soaker hoses and have the added advantage of allowing the gardener to apply precise amounts of water to specific areas. They are made up of a variety of little "drippers" (which are small outlets that meter the flow of water) and the tubing and connectors necessary to supply them. It is clear that gardeners have tools available that can help their gardens flourish through periods when water is in short supply. In fact, it is the experience of many gardeners in California that their gardens grew better when they were on watering restrictions. Why? Many gardeners discovered they were simply over watering, while others discovered that they were wasting water with short shallow sprinklings that quickly evaporated and left their gardens thirsty. Some gardeners even found ways to save water in the home to ensure that they would have an adequate supply for their plants. While the possibility of watering restrictions may be in our future, they will not mean an end to gardening. Rather it will encourage more efficient water use through careful planning and the many water saving technologies available to gardeners today. At Whitney Farms we are dedicated to helping you have a rich, healthy soil that will allow your garden to make optimum use of the water available to it.

This fertilizer, known to its fans as Veg, shares many traits with those baseball heroes who get the job done without calling attention to themselves. Like Cal Ripken, Veg is well-rounded and always there when needed. Veg has blood meal to promote green growth in the cool days of spring, and dried poultry waste to sustain plants throughout the season. Bone meal and sunflower hull ash round out Veg with phosphorus and potash so plants produce strong roots and abundant fruit. Unlike its tired competitors, the chemical fertilizers, Veg will never have a rain delay because its ingredients will not wash away under heavy rains or irrigation. Veg, with its kelp meal, will also help plants take any curve that nature can throw at it. The potash and micronutrients in kelp meal help plants resist pests and diseases and enhance their overall vigor and hardiness. Veg is also a great motivator of its teammates. Its organic matter stimulates soil organisms, like earthworms, which greatly contribute to a garden's fertility and productivity. Other players may boast bigger numbers, but Veg gives all its has and will never burn out, wash out or fade in the stretch. Those gardeners who have Veg on their team wouldn't trade it for all those over-promised hotshots in the league. Get out of line! Raised Beds in the Vegetable Garden In 19th century Paris, growing vegetables reached a zenith unparalleled even to this day. Small market gardens using intensive methods supplied the city with an incomparable variety of fresh produce throughout the year. The famed English gardener, William Robinson remarked in his book, Parks and Gardens of Paris that, "The culture of salads for the Paris market is not merely good it is perfection." Using techniques dating back to the 1600s it was not unheard of for these gardens to produce asparagus in December; radishes, lettuces, and mushrooms in January; cauliflower in March; strawberries in early April; peas in May; and melons in June. Similar methods were employed for centuries by the gardeners and farmers of China. Unlike the use of row planting in "modern" vegetable gardens, which wastes an incredible amount of space, the gardeners of 19th century Paris maximized the production of their market gardens by using their limited space as efficiently as possible. A hallmark of these methods was the use of intensively planted, heavily amended raised beds. Somewhat forgotten with the advent of the "Green Revolution," raised beds found their way into American gardens through the work of Allan Chadwick at the Garden Project at the University of California at Santa Cruz. On a steep hillside above what was then the main entrance to the campus, Chadwick carved a veritable Eden out of heavy clay soils covered with native shrubs and poison oak. In early 1967 when he began his work at the Garden Project the soil was as hard as rock and no one could imagine the transformation it would undergo. Using techniques Chadwick described as "The Bio-dynamic French Intensive Method", techniques adapted from the French market gardeners of a century earlier, he and a core group of students began a remarkable process. Today, a visit to the Garden Project reveals amazingly productive soils that are easily worked with a garden fork. Every year, the garden produces an unbelievable abundance of vegetable crops and cut flowers. Like the market gardens of 19th century Paris, the key to the productivity of the Garden Project in Santa Cruz is the use of intensively planted raised beds. For many gardeners the mere mention of raised beds implies a massive construction project and a small fortune in wood, which steers many away from raised-bed gardening. In reality, that image could not be further from the truth. The French Intensive method does not require a vast investment in timber; the soil is raised simply through cultivation and the introduction of air into the soil. The French Intensive method only requires the gardener to shift from planting in rows (moved about from season to season) to planting in permanent beds. The beds become the focus of all soil-building efforts. In turn, the paths are made permanent and all the traffic in the garden is restricted to those paths. This allows the soil in the beds to undergo a remarkable transformation. Raise Your Beds Raised beds provide the gardener with a number of important benefits. By employing a method of deep cultivation, they mimic nature�s own soil dynamics of aeration and drainage. Raised beds drain readily, allowing earlier planting in the spring. At the same time they warm up faster, which encourages faster rooting and earlier growth and leads to earlier harvests. The soil is kept loose and well-aerated in raised beds so that the plants are able to establish more vigorous root systems and take advantage of a larger portion of the nutrients in the soil. Because the beds are never walked on, there is minimal compaction of the soil in the growing area, which results in better retention of soil structure.Studies show that the yield, when using this method, is four times the yield of traditional row planting because of the more efficient use of space in the garden. In his book, The Self Sufficient Gardener, John Seymour wrote of his own skepticism about the vast difference between the two methods: "I had read these figures but did not fully believe them. I went to California to see for myself...Seeing is believing and in this case I am completely convinced of the superiority of this method." Constructing raised beds is relatively simple. Traditionally they are constructed using a technique called "double digging."(see diagram) To begin, lay out a bed four to five feet wide�a good rule of thumb is to make the bed twice as wide as you can reach. The bed can be made as long as needed or as space allows. One important consideration when deciding on the length of the bed, however, is the time it will take you to walk around it; once established you should never walk on it. A convenient length for most people is 20 to 25 feet. Raised beds are often oriented to the south so that the plants in the bed get an even exposure to light as the sun moves from east to west. You can lay your beds out side by side with paths in between. Be sure your paths are wide enough to allow you to move comfortably around the beds. After marking out the area, lay a covering of manure or compost on top of the bed. (For vegetable gardens you could use Whitney Farms Barnyard Manure. If establishing beds for perennials or other plants, use our Uncle Malcolm's Planting Mix.) If needed you can also add lime or other fertilizers like Whitney Farms Vegetable Food to the bed at this time. To begin digging, simply dig a trench to a spade's depth and width. Set the soil from the trench aside in a wheelbarrow. Dig your spade or fork into the bottom of the trench and loosen the soil as deeply as you can; leave the large clods in the bottom of the trench to promote drainage. Some gardeners add more compost to the trench at this time to aid in loosening the deeper layers of soil. Working backwards down the length of the bed, dig out a second trench next to the first one and "slide" the soil and manure into the first trench. Do not invert the soil layers if possible�keep the topsoil on the surface and the subsoil below it. Work the bottom of the second trench as you did the first. From here move the third spade's width of soil into the second trench. Continue in this fashion until you reach the end of the bed. After loosening the soil in the bottom of the last trench fill it with the soil from the first trench. Looking down the length of your newly tilled bed, you will see that the soil has formed a rough mound. In fact, you may be surprised to find the soil much more raised than you imagined possible. To complete the process, use a digging fork to work the surface of the new bed, breaking up clods as you go. Use the fork in a lifting motion to bring clods to the surface�like sifting flour. A gentle side-to-side motion with the fork breaks the clods up into a finer texture. Don�t pound down onto the bed to break up the clods of soil, that only serves to compact the soil again. Rake any soil that falls onto the paths back up into the bed. These Paths Are Made For Walking From this point onward, NEVER WALK ON THE BED nor let anyone else walk on it. Always tend and work the bed from the paths. The only time you should walk on the bed again is if you are deep digging for another season. It is not necessary to double dig to form raised beds. You can also rototill the beds, leaving the paths untouched and raking any excess soil back up into the bed. Top-dress the bed with manure or compost as you would for double digging. Typically, however, tilling does not result in as loose or deeply prepared a bed as does hand digging and can leave a layer of compacted soil at the lower limits of the tiller depth. Rototilling can also lead to a pulverized soil texture if overdone. This in turn can lead to problems with drainage and aeration. Depending on the quality of your soil, one initial digging is often all that is required. To maintain the beds, simply dress them annually with compost, fertilizer, and lime as needed, and till them with your digging fork. Gardeners with heavy clay soils may need to double dig the beds for a couple of years to ensure that their improvements are permanent. Planting Raised Beds Perhaps the single biggest advantage of raised beds is the dense planting pattern they allow as compared to row plantings. Don't plant in traditional rows; instead work in a triangular pattern with your crops spaced in "clumps." The objective is to space the plants so that the leaves just touch when they are mature. The overall effect is to create diagonal rows of closely spaced plants that waste no soil in the bed. Because the soil is so deeply prepared and traffic is limited to the paths, plants grown using raised beds typically develop much more vigorous root systems, which allows for denser planting. There are several other benefits that result from using a dense planting pattern. Because the leaves of the plants just touch when mature, they create a micro-climate within the bed. Weeds are suppressed by the shading of the crop plants, and because the soil is so loose, any that grow in the bed are easily removed. You will also find that the garden will use less water than a traditional "row garden" because of the shading of the soil surface. When seeding raised beds: Sow them heavily and thin the seedlings after germination to allow for the mature plants to just touch as outlined above. Direct sowing plants like carrots or radishes in a raised bed will result in significantly higher yields in a very small area as compared to sowing seeds in rows. Unlimited Applications Raised beds are easily adapted for use throughout the garden. The same methods can be extended to preparing areas for planting annual flowers, bulbs, perennials, roses, and other shrubs. Even trees can be planted using this technique. In all cases your garden and the plants growing in it will benefit from the richly prepared soil. The time and energy required to transform your garden will be paid back immeasurably by the increased yields and the ease of maintaining raised beds.

However, these limits need not constrain the resourceful gardener. Raising vegetables in containers, whether they are old buckets or fine pottery, is the answer to the apartment dweller or small-lot suburbanite who yearns for fresh homegrown veggies. Container gardening saves time in soil preparation and weeding; containers can be placed virtually anywhere and can be moved easily to take advantage of available light and heat. Gardeners with soil-borne disease problems will find containers indispensible. Theoretically, any vegetable can be grown in a container, given proper care. As a practical matter some vegetables are more rewarding when raised in the confines of a container. Moreover, some are more attractive and have neater growth habits, making them more suitable for visible locations on a deck or patio. Generally, those that have compact growth habits and yield abundant veggies that are far superior in flavor to store-bought kinds bring the most satisfying results. A rich, water-retentive potting soil like Whitney Farms Premium Potting Soil or Whitney Farms Uncle Malcolm's Potting Soil is best because most vegetables need a steady supply of water and nutrients. Light but frequent fertilizing with Ellie's Ultimate Plant Food (Fish and Kelp) or a tea made from composted manure or Whitney Farms Fruit and Flower Booster will ensure adequate nutrients for the entire growing season. The all-natural ingredients are released slowly and will not leach out with the frequent watering that containers need in the summer. An all-organic mix like Whitney Farms' Uncle Malcolm's Potting Soil will work great for the following suggested vegetables: Tomatoes- Several dwarf and compact types will stay small yet produce big crops in a small container. "Patio" is an old standby for small containers. You can try your favorite larger varieties in appropriately sized containers. A whiskey barrel works well for beefsteak types. Eggplant- Be sure to place these in a hot location for best results. Try the flavorful Japanese varieties in cool summer areas. Peppers- These attractive plants double as ornamentals even before peppers ripen. Leaf lettuce- Be sure to keep evenly moist; use blood meal for rapid growth in cool soil. Scallions- Easy to grow; great value when compared to what supermarkets charge for them. Garlic- Plant cloves the previous autumn for earliest harvest. Bush beans- Go easy on the nitrogen for this and other legumes. Bush cucumbers- Try training one up a trellis for further space savings and increased production. As a rule, select a container at least 12 inches across and 18 inches deep. Smaller containers will suffice for shallow rooted veggies like lettuce, scallions and small peppers. Cool Veggies Are you bored with beets and beans, tired of plain tomatoes, sick of zucchini? Well, the editors of The Dirt have compiled a list of cool vegetables certain to stimulate the most jaded vegetable gardener.Now, we don't mean just those vegetables that do best during the cool months of spring and autumn. We're talking about vegetables with attitude, that break the rules, and will have your neighbors wondering what you're up to. As with people, cool in vegetables is hard to pin down, but you know it when you see it. The following list is based upon the vegetable's distinctive flavor, and not least of all, its appearance. Kohlrabi-These otherworldly cabbage relatives look like they could be alien beings from a B movie. They also bear a startling resemblance to the first satellite launched into space, Sputnik. Kohlrabi have a flavor similar to water chestnuts but of course are far fresher and sweeter than what you get at the store. Kohlrabi are easy to grow because the edible portion, a bulbous stem, grows above the ground, beyond the reach of soil-borne insects and diseases. They even come in an extra-cool purple variety. Heirloom tomatoes- Upscale nurseries and catalogs have featured "old" tomato varieties for several years now, which makes them more than a fad. And for good reason. These varieties are unsurpassed for flavor and texture, even if they can�t match modern hybrids for productivity and shelf-life. An example: "Brandywine," the classic Amish variety, has the cachet of their devotion to the old ways, which include, incidentally, an unwavering adherence to organic farming principles and techniques. Popcorn-You can grow your own popcorn to eat while you watch a movie starring Kohlrabi. Kids will get a kick out of stomping the dry kernels off the cobs� a fast, fun way of processing large quantities! Colorful potatoes and peppers-Better garden centers will now offer yellow and blue varieties of potatoes as well as the more familiar red ones. You can grow bell peppers that ripen to purple, yellow, orange and red. The purple peppers will turn green when cooked, however.

Working with specialized bacteria known as rhizobia, legumes convert pure nitrogen in the atmosphere to an ammonia form that is immediately available in the soil. With sufficient rhizobia, legumes will produce a reserve of nitrogen that will be available for a succeeding crop. Each kind of legume� vegetables such as beans and peas, and cover crops such as clover and vetch�respond best to different species of rhizobia. You can ask at your local garden center for rhizobia innoculant for each specific crop, or use a general purpose innoculant. Another option, which the editors of the Dirt shamelessly promote, is to add copious amounts of high-quality compost, which is naturally full of rhizobia and other beneficial microbes, as well as the phosphorus necessary for good root growth and flower production. The origins of Corn Corn has been raised in North America for over 800 years. Bred from wild grasses, it was developed by Mesoamerican farmers around 7000 years ago, probably in Mexico. As aboriginal farmers spread north and south, new strains of Zea mays or maize (as corn is known) were selected to adapt to different soils, pests, moisture levels and growing seasons. Today, modern high-yield hybrids have replaced the traditional varieties. Corn is totally dependent upon humans for its continued existence. If humans were to stop planting and harvesting corn, it would disappear. As one scientist reports in a recent article in Smithsonian (November 1995), "Corn's seeds, the kernels, grow embedded in cobs. The stay pressed together when the cob falls to the ground, inhibiting one another's growth. �Over time, reproduction stops. The only reason we have corn today is that for thousands of years humans have selected seeds and planted them." We are as dependent on the ancient varieties of corn today as our forebears were hundreds of years ago. Why? We depend on the genetic diversity of the maize plants of the ancients to provide stability to the modern agricultural corn field. In fact, in 1970 an outbreak of Southern corn leaf blight killed 15 percent of the U.S. corn crop, reminding us of how fragile are the monocultures upon which we depend for our food. The Three Sisters Ancient farmers in the Americas practiced a unique form of intercropping known as the "Three Sisters." For example, in upstate New York, the Iroquois used a variation of this system to produce crops for over 400 years. The ancient farmers would girdle the trees in a field. After the trees had died, they would burn the field using the ash as a fertilizer. A few kernels of corn would be planted in a hole. After the corn sprouted, the area would be weeded and the soil mounded up around the young corn stalks. Two weeks or so after they planted the corn, the Iroquois farmers would then plant two or three bean seeds. Between the corn and bean "mounds" they would also plant pumpkins or other squash. As the plants grew, these Three Sisters worked together. The broad leaves of the squash plants shaded the soil and suppressed weeds. Bacteria living in the roots of the beans converted atmospheric nitrogen into a form that the plants could use. The corn provided the beans with a framework to grow on.At harvest, the Iroquois farmers would leave the debris in the fields to enrich the soil. As the bean plants rotted, the soil was enriched with nitrogen. The following season, the mounds were replanted using the same system. As the fields became worn with time, the planting area was moved and the old ground allowed to regenerate. When measured in bushels of corn produced the native practices were not as productive as modern agricultural techniques: 25-40 bushels per acre compared to modern yields of over 100 bushels to the acre. But the Iroquois did not raise corn alone. When the combined output of the corn, beans, and squash are measured by comparing the overall caloric production, the traditional system produces over 4.02 million calories per acre as compared to the modern cornfield's production of only 3.44 million calories per acre. That modern number is further reduced when one factors in the caloric content of the fuels, fertilizers, and pesticides required to produce a bushel of corn in the modern world.

Only nature can deliver fertilizer with more style than Whitney Farms. In fact, nature brings it to the garden in a flash� of lightning, that is. Lightning forces nitrogen in the atmosphere to combine with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides. When rain washes nitrogen oxide out of the air, it eventually produces nitrogen in the soil that plants can use for leafy growth. However, Whitney Farms is far more predictable than thunderstorms, even if wecan'tmatch nature's dramatic display. Mucky Myth of the Month In our continuing quest to debunk gardening myths, the editors of the Dirt now turn their attention to the persistent belief that sand is a beneficial and desirable soil amendment. Like many myths, this one contains an element of truth that is the genesis of the mistaken belief. First, in a man-made potting soil or in small localized areas, sand is a perfectly acceptable ingredient for promoting adequate drainage. However, in a garden that has clay soil, sand is the last thing to add to improve drainage over a large area. Sand is a binding agent. If you add sand to most clay soils, you will end up creating a low-grade concrete. For an acre of clay garden soil you would have to add more than a million pounds of sand to beneficially change the soil structure in the top six inches! A far better solution to poorly drained clay soils is to add ample amounts of good compost. We suggest Whitney Farms Planting Mix or Mushroom Compost come to mind. In addition to improving soil structure by making the clay become granular in texture, the compost will stimulate soil organisms and add essential plant nutrients. Fruit or Vegetable? The quandry continues It is prominent among life's great questions. Experts in the fields of law, science, and business have wracked their brains over it for centuries. It is the subject of heated debate at the dinner table, across backyard fences and in neighborhood bars. It has even reached the United States Supreme Court.The question is this: Is a tomato a fruit or vegetable or what? The editors of the Dirt have found the definitive answer to this weighty matter to be as elusive as a blight-resistant tomato. As the Supreme Court decided decades ago, the tomato is generally accepted and understood, according to its common usage, to be a vegetable, and therefore should be classified and taxed as such.On the other hand, many gardeners will insist that because it grows on a vine it must be a fruit, like grapes or kiwi. They also rightly point out that the part of a flowering plant that holds seeds is technically a fruit. Webster's Dictionary takes the middle road, defining the tomato as "a widely cultivated solanaceous plant, native to South America, bearing a slightly acid, pulpy fruit, commonly red, sometimes yellow, used as a vegetable; the fruit itself." Botanists go further still, and classify the fruit of the tomato plant as a berry. That�s right, a berry, because of its fleshy pulp and numerous small seeds. So there you have it. A tomato is different things to different people. What almost everyone can agree on is that they are versatile, delicious, and easy to grow. Now what are we to make of rhubarb, an ornamental vegetable with poisonous leaves and roots with edible stems that are used as a fruit in pies? Now to address a practical question: Where do you find a blight-resistant tomato? The insidious and rampant fungal disease known as blight is a persistent problem of tomato growing. The form known as late blight is particularly devastating, striking with little warning just as harvest begins. An airborne fungus, late blight often hits after a prolonged warm, humid spell in mid-summer.An organic fungicide, such as copper or sulfur spray, applied before the fungus spores land on the plant, can prevent the disease from taking hold. However, once the plant is infected, the disease spreads rapidly, spoiling the entire crop. Some growers find that a row cover can prevent infection, while others advocate pruning to open up the plant and improve air circulation. The editors of the Dirt are anxious to know if some tomato varieties are more blight- resistant than others. Readers are encouraged to share their experience either throughe-mail or by letter. A note from the President Fresh vegetables. I was speaking with a grouch the other morning about gardening. He claimed that he had never planted a vegetable garden because the economics didn't make sense. "Why garden when I can go down to the grocery story and buy ten ears of corn for a dollar?" he said. "I can't grow corn that cheap." He misses the point. For most of us, gardening is not about dollars and cents. It's about that series of small successes we all look forward to. For the vegetable gardener, it's also about taste. There is little more satisfying than a plate of fresh vegetables from your own back yard in the late summer. The difference in taste between store-bought and home-grown is dramatic. Grow your own! John D.

That observation is especially accurate when it comes to the concept of beneficial organisms. Sometimes all a gardener needs to do is change their perception of a supposed pest to turn it into an ally. Take moles, for instance. Many gardeners see them only as destructive critters that leave unsightly mounds of soil in their otherwise perfect lawns. In addition, moles can uproot young plants, possibly killing them if not replanted promptly. However, moles have an important role in maintaining soil health. Their tunneling helps improve soil structure and drainage. Inspect the soil in a mole mound sometime. A rototiller couldn't do a better job of aerating heavy wet soil. Also, moles are primarily insect eaters. Only rarely do they nibble on plant roots. While they do eat the gardeners favorite soil dweller, earthworms, moles also eat grubs that cause serious damage to grass roots.So rather than declare war on moles with traps, poison gas and other weapons, consider enlisting them as biological subsoil's. The money and time spent on killing them could be just as well applied to replanting their mounds. Or on controlling slugs, a slimy, voracious creature with no known redeeming qualities, unless you're a French raccoon. Natural Lawn Care:The way to grow In the United States lawns occupy more land than any single crop including wheat, corn or tobacco. Homeowners use ten times more chemical pesticides per acre than farmers do, much of it on lawns. The average American homeowner will spend 40 hours a year behind a lawn mower. By practicing a more natural approach gardeners have found that they can have a great looking lawn with less work and vastly reduced inputs! Here are some of our ideas on how to have an easy-to-care-for and beautiful lawn. While most of the information applies to cool season grasses (Ryes, Bluegrass, Fescue, etc.) much of it can apply to warm season grasses as well. Make The Cut A healthy, easy-care lawn begins with the right mowing height. Proper mowing height is critical to the health of your lawn. Only about 5% of turf grass nutrition is derived from the soil; the other 95% is taken in through the blades as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen. Grass blades exist to convert energy from sunlight into sugars, starches and plant fibers that the grass plant then uses for growth. The food manufactured in the blades of the grass is used for both the top growth and the root growth.When you mow you reduce the ability of the grass plant to manufacture food, and thereby to form strong roots. The shorter you mow, the less the roots will grow. Deep roots are the key to a healthy, drought resistant lawn. Mow lightly and frequently. Mow the lawn when the grass is dry, and only remove 1/3 of the blade length at any given time. If you remove more than 40% of the grass blade the roots stop growing. The grass should always look green even after you cut it. Generally, if the lawn is yellow or brown after mowing, you are cutting too short. The shorter you cut the longer it will take the roots to begin growing again. At worst, if you cut too close, the grass roots may never grow again. Clippings 1/2 inch or smaller can be left on the lawn, and will help to reduce thatch buildup and help to provide your lawn with valuable nutrients. Many homeowners worry that longer blades will mean a less attractive lawn. In reality, the look of a lawn is determined by how even the grass is mown, not how long the blades are. In fact, according to Stuart Franklin in his book "Building a Healthy Lawn,"a taller lawn will actually require less mowing than a lawn kept shorter. In addition, the taller turf grass will shade out many sun loving weeds. Lawns that are mown too short will require more work and result in a sickly hard-to-manage lawn.Mowing heights for most cool season grasses (Perennial Rye, Bluegrass, Fescue, etc.) will vary with the season as the grass grows at different rates throughout the year. Start mowing when the grass begins to grow in the spring. As a general guideline, cut the lawn shorter in spring (the actual height will vary with the kind of grass you are growing). This removes dead grass and increases the penetration of sunlight to newly forming blades. A short cutting in early spring also helps to invigorate the grass and will aid in warming the soil sooner. After this initial cutting, set the mower at around two inches for the next few mowings until the lawn begins to grow vigorously. By mowing higher you encourage the grass to thicken and grow new tillers, stolons, or rhizomes. Allow lawns of cool season grasses to grow longer in the summer months�in the range of 3 to 4 inches. A higher mowing height helps to improve the growth of the lawn and to shade the soil which aids in reducing water use and helps to suppress weeds. Keep the mower set high into the fall. This allows the grass to replenish its store of nutrients in the roots. In late fall, after the leaves drop from deciduous trees, gradually reduce the mowing height again to 1-1/2 inches. Remember, never remove more than 1/3 of the blade length. Regardless of the time of year, the lawn should always still be green after mowing. There is some evidence to show that by varying mowing heights through the year you may actually improve the drought resistance of your lawn.Leave the clippings. One of the great myths of lawn care is that clippings cause thatch. Research has definitively shown this to be untrue (see sidebar). In fact, by leaving short clippings on the lawn (1/2 inch or finer) up to 40% of the lawns annual fertilizer needs can be met. In one study at the University of Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, researchers observed that, "You didn't need any fancy instruments to see the difference. Where the clippings were left, the plots were much greener." The research shows that clippings begin to break down within a week, and by the end of two weeks the nitrogen from the clippings is available to the growing grass. Grass-cycling can contribute significantly to the annual fertilizer needs of the lawn and helps to improve the soil and retain moisture. The only exceptions would be for lawns suffering from some diseases like red thread or rust, for lawns with heavy infestations of weeds with mature seed heads, and during times of the year when clippings may be too wet or excessively long. Finally, remember to keep the blades of your mower sharp to reduce incidences of disease. Mowing lawns when they are dry will also help to reduce the spread of some diseases, limit the compaction of the soil, and aid in a cleaner cut and more even spread of the clippings. Pick the Right Fertilizer A second component of easy-care lawn practices is the use of slow release, natural organic lawn foods with an approximate nutrient ratio of 3-1-2 like our Whitney Farms Natural Organic Lawn Food (8-2-4) or Lawn Food Plus Iron (6-2-4). Remember, your lawn is only as good as the soil it grows in. Good nutrition improves turf performance and disease resistance. Slow release natural organic fertilizers are less likely to contribute to thatch buildup, and do not acidify the soil or cause a decline in the population of earthworms and other microbes in the soil. Unlike many forms of synthetic nitrogen, natural sources do not cause the lawn to grow too quickly. In addition, the iron sulfate in our Lawn Food Plus Iron contributes to the growth and color of your lawn while it also helps to increase the drought and disease resistance of your lawn and discourages moss. By comparison, chemical or synthetic fertilizers can release their nutrients too quickly contributing to thatch buildup and causing over vigorous growth that means more mowing. Also, because these types of fertilizers can contain extremely soluble forms of nutrients they tend to leach away during periods of heavy rainfall or irrigation particularly on sandy soils. Research at Alabama Polytechnic University showed that up to half of the soluble nitrogen applied to the soil will be leached out and unavailable to plants. This can contribute to the contamination of groundwater and waterways. At the same time, because synthetic fertilizers are by definition salt based, you are much more likely to burn the lawn if they are accidentally over�applied or you are not able to water soon after application. Furthermore, because of their reliance on sulfate of ammonia many chemical lawn foods are actually extremely acidifying leading to the need for applications of lime to counteract the lower soil pH caused by the repeated use of acid forming fertilizers. Additionally, there is some evidence that repeated use of salt based synthetic fertilizers can result in the destruction of soil microbes which in turn contributes to the loss of soil structure and thatch build up. As Elliot Roberts, director of the Lawn Institute, has said, "We've found that the grass plant is a very efficient user of nitrogen" The more chemicals you use, the more you disturb the natural biological processes that convert organic matter into nutrients to keep the lawn growing since you get heavily involved with chemical fertilizers, you�re increasing the growth rate of the plant and growing it to death." Grass grown with chemical fertilizers can often grow so quickly and require such frequent mowing that the plant is unable to store carbohydrates which ultimately leads to a reduction in the root growth of the plant. Ultimately this weakens the lawn making it more susceptible to drought stress during hot weather, diseases, and weed invasions. Through the use of natural organic sources of nutrients and through the practice of grass-cycling, or leaving the clippings, it is likely that you will be able to significantly reduce the amount of fertilizer needed to keep your lawn looking its best. Most lawns require between 2-4 pounds of nitrogen per thousand square feet per year, with as much as 4-6 pounds required for lawns on very poor soils, to look their best. Clippings alone can contribute almost 2 pounds of nitrogen per thousand square feet per year. With this in mind, it is evident that is not necessary to feed as often as many companies would have you use their products in order for your lawn to look its best. In fact, research at Oregon State University has shown that over time using organic fertilizers for feeding your lawn will actually result in nutrients building up in the soil, something that the research has not shown with synthetic fertilizers. Feed Your Lawn in the Fall Proper timing is essential to feeding the lawn for the best results. Feed your lawn every fall sometime from late September through mid-October in areas with milder climates. The fall feeding is the most important feeding for cool season grasses. During the fall, the grass plant is storing nutrients that will support the growth in the spring. By feeding late in the season, but while the soil is still warm, you will stimulate the root growth and food production in your grass. The other ideal time to feed again is in the spring about the time the initial growth spurt is beginning to slow down. Your lawn has now used up all of the reserves stored the previous fall and is feeding itself. Fertilizing at this time helps to support that process. If you intend to keep your lawn watered and green through the heat of summer another feeding, if needed, in late May will help the lawn to thrive through the hot summer months. This application should be made at least 30 days prior to the onset of hot weather. Do not feed the lawn in the summer. The growth of cool season grasses slows down in the heat of summer, and all you end up feeding are the weeds which thrive in summer heat and will often out compete the grass for nutrients during hot weather. Dress Your Lawn Once a year, top dress with compost. Add a thin layer of up to 3/8 of an inch of a finely screened, unsterilized compost, like Whitney Farms Peat Humus or Mushroom Compost, to your lawn to help control thatch and improve the soil, as well as to discourage diseases. Dr. Eric B. Nelson reported as early as 1990 in the trade publication "Lawn Care Industry" that, "Research at Cornell University with the use of compost and organic fertilizers has indicated the potential to suppress diseases such as brown patch, dollar sport, typhula blight, pythium blight and root rot, and red thread by topdressing with some of these materials." The fall is probably the best time of year to top dress your lawn, but top dressing is also recommended anytime after aerating or thatching your lawn. Deep Water, Deep Roots Another critical component of natural lawn care is proper watering. Water your lawn deeply and infrequently. Many gardeners make the mistake of watering the lawn with short, shallow waterings for a few minutes every day. There is ample evidence to show that lawns are more tolerant of drought and have deeper root systems when watered deeply, less often. A simple test to see if your lawn needs water is to simply walk on it. If your footprints spring back, the lawn has adequate moisture. If your footprints stay depressed, it is time to water. Apply enough water to wet your soil to a depth of eight or more inches once or twice a week as needed. Check the pH of your lawn periodically and add lime when needed. A slightly acid pH (around 6.5) ensures the optimum availability of most nutrients and good microbial activity which results in better nutrient availability and reduced thatch buildup. Fall is ideal for lime applications, but spring is acceptable as well. Depending on your local climate it may be necessary to lime as often as every year or so. From time to time your lawn will require some additional maintenance. Some older lawns may require thatching (see accompanying sidebar). Thatch is a build up of roots and stems that inhibits moisture penetration, encourages diseases, and interferes with fertilizer availability. Thatch is typically caused by fast acting, soluble nitrogen which encourages excessive growth and kills soil microbes; mowing at too short a height which keeps the roots near surface, as does watering too often and too shallow. Pesticides and fungicides can also kill off soil life like earthworms slowing the decomposition of roots, stems, and clippings and contributing to a build up of thatch. Using the practices outlined above can often completely eliminate the need for dethatching. Through normal wear and tear your lawn will become compacted and require aeration from time to time. Aeration helps to improve the exchange of air between the soil and the atmosphere vital for healthy plant growth. It will also enhance the breakdown of thatch and will help to reduce water runoff and puddling. Aeration helps to improve rooting and fertilizer and water uptake, and while it also enhances heat and drought tolerance. Ideally, aeration should be followed with a top dressing of compost and a fertilizer. Most problems lawns face, from moss to problems with insects and diseases, can be dramatically reduced through the use of more natural methods to maintain your lawn. Consequently you can avoid using harsh and toxic chemicals to achieve a beautiful and sustainable lawn that will be the envy of the neighborhood.

In time, however, the monoculture of grass known as a lawn can become boring. As we all know, variety is the spice of life, and that old saying applies to landscape design as much as anything else. Variety in the landscape has benefits beyond the aesthetic. Mixed plantings attract birds and beneficial insects that prey on pests. Diverse landscapes, which are based on a healthy soil full of organic compost that stimulates earthworms and other helpful little critters, will also function as ecosystems that are less vulnerable to diseases and more self-regulating than a mono- culture. In a stable ecosystem, natural controls prevent problems from getting out of hand, fertilizer needs are reduced and herbicides are unnecessary. A gardener can promote diversity within a lawn by using a seed mix that includes flowers such as lawn daisies, Roman chamomile, yarrow and clover. Several years of research at Oregon State University have led to the development of such "Eco-Lawns," mixes that stand up to foot traffic, need minimal maintenance and are pleasing to look at. A gardener could also consider replacing some lawn area with beds along the edge, or with "islands" of desirable flowers, shrubs or trees. Of course, a well-planned and maintained water garden will also attract birds and possibly frogs and toads. A visit to a quality garden center can reveal the unlimited possibilities for enriching the environment with thoughtful garden design. Grass substitutes for problem areas Sometimes, despite a gardener's best efforts to improve the soil and care for the grass, their lawn fails to thrive. Insufficient light is often the cause of the problem. Other times the location is too hot or steep to keep well-watered and fertilized. On such sites a gardener is well-advised to consider low-maintenance alternatives to turfgrass. The following plants are excellent choices for difficult locations. For shade: Vinca minor-Best choice for dry soil, has periwinkle blue flowers. Pachysandra-Spreads quickly through underground runners but is not invasive;thrives in acid soil. Creeping Oregon grape-Yellow flowers and blue berries against holly-like leaves make this Oregon state flower attractive year-round. Sword fern-A tough fern that tolerates some sun and looks good through winter. Sweet woodruff-A pleasant aroma and profuse white flowers add to this rapid grower's charm. Hostas-Lush yet elegant appearance, dozens of varieties and easy care make hostas a popular choice for shade. Lily Turf-Ideal for use around ponds and the edge of streams, best with well-drained soil and light feeding. Wintergreen-Large scarlet berries really light up dark areas, needs woodland soil conditions. Sarccococca humilis-Also known as Himalayan box, it is fragrant in bloom and always a polished dark green. For Sun: Kinnickinnick-Thrives on steep slopes and meager but well-drained soil. Very cold hardy. Willowleaf cotoneaster-The most graceful of the cotoneasters, and as tough as any. Blue rug juniper-Flattest juniper, intense blue-green color. Must have well-drained soil and full sun. Roman Chamomile-Delightful apple-like fragrance, profuse daisy-like flowers; can be mowed to make a sweet-smelling pathway. Mother of Thyme-Spicy fragrance, pink flowers, excellent between stepping stones. Creeping rosemary-Good over walls and on slopes. Tolerates heat, but not cold. Hardy to about 18 degrees F. Rockrose-Attractive grey-green foliage and long bloom period. A fire-resistant favorite in California, rockrose tolerates salt spray, ocean winds and desert heat. Free fertilizer through grass-cycling Grass clippings are the largest source of landscape waste in most yards. Yet leaving the clippings on the lawn, or grass-cycling, is healthier for the lawn than removing them. Grass-cycling recycles nutrients and reduces fertilizer needs often contributing almost half of the lawns annual nitrogen needs. Grass cycling also adds organic matter which rejuvenates the soil and helps to conserve moisture, and it saves the time and expense of bags and collection fees. Many mowers are now designed to chop clippings into tiny pieces and blow them down into the turf. Inexpensive mulching blades and conversion kits for older mowers are also available to convert older rotary mowers for mulching . Most real-type and push mowers cut clippings small enough so that they can be left on the lawn. Grass-cycling with any mower requires more frequent, light mowing, but each mowing takes less time without bagging and disposing of clippings. The key to successful grass-cycling is to mow often and leave fine clippings on the lawn.

This could not be further from the truth. Here is June's Myth of the Month. What is Thatch? Thatch is a naturally occurring layer of partially decomposed dead stems and roots that builds up beneath some grasses. High in lignin, these parts of the grass plant are slow to decompose. Some thatch is normal; up to 1/2 inch of thatch is typical for many species of grass and acts almost like a mulch for the lawn. A layer of thatch thicker than 1/2 inch, on the other hand, can mean problems for the lawn. In severe situations thatch can inhibit the ability of water and nutrients to reach the soil below, and can actually slow the growth of your lawn. It also provides a breeding ground for insects and can harbor diseases harmful to your lawn. In cases where the thatch layer becomes really thick it can also result in the lawn actually growing in the thatch layer on top of the soil. This in turn can make the lawn much more susceptible to dehydration, frost damage, insect attack, and damage from traffic over the lawn. Most experts have come to agree that the surest way to create a thatch problem in your lawn is to over-fertilize with quick release nitrogen like sulfate of ammonia, a common ingredient of many synthetic lawn foods. Grass clippings do not except under very unusual circumstances contribute to the buildup of thatch. Thatch is caused by the excessive use of soluble fertilizers which cause grass to grow too vigorously, resulting in a buildup of roots and stems that can�t decompose fast enough. These types of fertilizers can also have a detrimental effect on soil life and can inhibit the very species that would normally help to break down the thatch before it could become a problem. Other factors that contribute to the formation of thatch include: mowing too short, which keeps the roots close to the surface; frequent light watering which keep only the top of the soil moist and the roots close to the surface; overuse of pesticides and fungicides which suppress soil life like earthworms�an important contributor to the natural control of thatch. To tell if your lawn has a thatch problem, take a close look at your lawn. As you walk out onto it does it feel spongy and springy? This could be a sign of a thatch problem. Next, stick your finger down into the turf. If you feel soil right away, you have no thatch layer. If instead you feel a spongy layer, take a closer look. Dig a small hole in your lawn (you can replace the sod, just like repairing a divot at the golf course) and take a look at the cross section of the grass. Bring along a ruler. It should be easy to see the soil layer and the grass growing above it. If you see a brown or tan underlying layer of straw-like material between the soil and the grass, measure it. This is the thatch layer. If it is more than half an inch thick, it is time to take action. To rid your lawn of thatch, follow a few simple guidelines. First, while getting the thatch under control, catch your clippings. (Otherwise, in most cases you should leave fine clippings of less that 1/2 inch to help feed your lawn with valuable nutrients.) Aerate your lawn with a core aerator. After aerating, top dress your lawn with up to 1/4 inch of finely screened compost, like Whitney Farms Peat Humus or Mushroom Compost. This will help to revitalize your lawn with microorganisms and contribute to the decay of the thatch. Also, using natural fertilizers like Whitney Farms Lawn Food can help to add beneficial organisms to your lawn. Change your mowing practices and your watering habits (see the accompanying article).In severe cases, it may be necessary to de-thatch your lawn using a thatch rake or a power rake or vertical mower. This is best done in the fall before mid-October and may require over-seeding to help the lawn fill back in. Help! I need some water! For many lawns, particular those grown with cool season varieties of turf grass, the hot days of summer can be particularly stressful. A number of steps can be taken to ensure that your lawn is ready to withstand the heat and to prepare it for the fall. Here are some steps recommended by the Turf Resource Center in Rolling Meadows, IL: Thirty days before the anticipated arrival of hot weather, reduce or eliminate fertilizer. Fertilizers encourage lush growth that does not withstand the high summer temperatures very well and can increase the amount of water the lawn requires. Weed killing herbicides can also place the grass under stress that reduces its rate of growth. Infrequent, deep watering encourages deeper root growth. Most lawns will need around an inch of water per week, though exactly how much will vary with your soil texture. Sandy soils will require more frequent watering but will not need as much water each time to ensure a deep watering, while clay soils will require water less often but more water at each application to penetrate more deeply into the soil.In early fall, a number of steps can be taken to improve the health of your lawn for the winter and next summer. Aerating and thatching followed by an application of a slow release fertilizer (like our Whitney Farms Lawn Food) a couple of weeks later will greatly enhance the performance of your lawn in the coming months. If you find yourself in an area where severe watering restrictions are enacted during the summer months it does not necessarily mean an end to your lawn. If you have taken the steps outlined above, allowing your lawn to go dormant (the natural response to extremes of temperature) and turn golden brown is an acceptable solution. As the heat subsides and the water restrictions are eased, start watering deeply again. Once the lawn re-establishes its health, you can begin to reduce mowing heights again, and if needed weed control measures can be taken. If you would like more information from the Turf Resource Center you can contact them at 800-405-TURF.

Controlling moss is relatively simple, but may require some changes in the garden. Generally moss is favored by thin lawns (see our hints on lawn care), poor drainage, shade, and acid soil conditions. To get existing moss problems under control you can use existing commercial formulations or use Whitney Farms Iron Sulfate. Broadcast it over the mossy areas according to the rates on the label, or dissolve three ounces of Iron Sulfate in five gallons of water to treat 1000 sq. ft. The treated moss will turn black and can be raked out of the lawn. Overseed thin areas if needed. Unless steps are taken to correct the conditions that favored the moss you will soon have moss again. If necessary, prune or trim trees and shrubs to increase light and air flow to the area. Aerate the lawn to correct compaction; improve the soil drainage if needed. Use shade tolerate varieties of turf grass in shady areas. Reduce frequency of irrigation. Avoid over-fertilization with soluble forms of nitrogen. Increase mowing height to around three inches and mow as frequently as is required to remove less that 1/3 of the blade length at each cutting. Still More on Planting Trees... or a reader stakes his reputation on correcting one of our oversights We recently received a letter from a reader in Illinois reminding us of an omission in our tree planting instructions in our premier issue. Mr. Tom Vorbeck wrote to remind us that there are instances when stakes are absolutely indispensable�planting fruit trees on dwarfing rootstocks, particularly apples on M7, M7A, and EMLA-7 rootstocks. Mr. Vorbeck has a great deal of experience with these trees and reminds us that they require staking to withstand windstorms particularly when they are young and soils are wet. Along with the M7 rootstock and it's relatives, apples planted on M26, M9, Mark and EMLA 27 must be staked at planting as well. Mr. Vorbeck included in his letter an article he had just written for an apple grower's newsletter in which he makes the following recommendations, "You can plant a2" x 2" x 8' pole with the tree at planting time." He warns that whatever you use should be a minimum of 2" x 2" and should be of a material that will last up to three years in the soil. "Lesser quality stakes," he continues, "will keep the tree from getting loose in the ground. But lesser quality stakes will increase the risk of catastrophe in years four and five in which the winds snap off the stakes and the tree at its bud union." He notes that a number of varieties in his orchard have "been nearly immune" to getting loose on M7. Specifically he notes Jonagold, Mutsu, and Spigold. He warns that all of his Blushing Goldens on M7 got loose. He also observes that trees planted in soil that had been tilled for crops the previous season stayed better anchored than trees planted into sod. The good news is that trees planted with a stake "grow taller and bear younger." The editors of The Dirt encourage readers to stake loosely to allow some movement so that the trunk and root systems are encouraged to develop through the natural swaying motion of the tree.In most cases trees on M7 and its relatives will only require staking for the first three to five years. Trees on M26 and Mark will require staking the first 5 to 8 years. Trees planted on M27 and M9 rootstocks will require staking for their entire lives and are ideally suited for use as espaliers or in a cordon systems because of this. It had been our intention to include a caution in the original article. Due to the pressures of our first deadlines it was unfortunately omitted. We are grateful to Mr. Vorbeck for bringing our omission to our attention.

Many would have you believe that growing roses is the biggest challenge and most mysterious process that gardeners face. Secret formulas for fertilizers and other concoctions abound. Every ardent rose grower has his or her own theory on just the right method to grow roses. Indeed, it seems that few groups of plant enthusiasts are as headstrong as are rosarians. In reality, growing roses is much easier than many might suspect. Before you select a spot to plant a rose, it is important to have a general sense of what roses like. Few things can have as great an impact on successful rose growing as finding the best location for the rose bush. Roses need and thrive in sunlight. Ideally they should be planted in an area that receives a minimum of six hours of sunlight a day. David Austin in his book "Old Roses and English Roses" goes so far as to say, "They do not like shade, even partial shade" Perhaps the best suggestion comes from Graham Stuart Thomas in his classic work "The Rose Book." He suggests that the best results particularly in very hot areas will come from planting roses where "their roots are shaded and their flowers are in full sun."The second most important consideration for growing beautiful roses is the soil they are planted in. Roses prefer and thrive in a rich, slightly acid soil that is well drained. If you have a poorly drained PREPARING THE SOIL More than many other plants, roses will benefit from careful preparation of the soil before planting. All too often, planting instructions focus on the planting hole. We take a slightly different approach and encourage gardeners to think instead of the area you will be planting your rosebush in. Rather than preparing a rich hole to plant your rose in, we suggest that you amend the area and then dig the hole for planting. Most roses will grow in an area roughly three foot by three foot, or four by four. Begin by spreading one to three inches of a good quality compost, like our Uncle Malcolm's Planting Mix or Mushroom Compost over the area. David Austin considers the addition of compost or humus "crucial in growing good roses." If you live in an area with very acid soils, you could add lime at this point, or if you are in an area with alkaline soils, soil sulfur or peat moss could be used to help acidify the soil. Spread Whitney Farms Rose and Flower Food over the area at the same time. Unlike many synthetic blends, there is no danger of burning tender roots with our fertilizers. They can be used safely at the time of planting.Thoroughly work all of this into the soil. Graham Stuart Thomas recommends digging as deeply as possible "up to 18 inches" as long as "undesirable subsoil is not brought to the surface." Indeed, he suggests that the poorer the soil, the more extensive and thorough the preparation should be. At the very least a spade's digging depth is recommended. By preparing the soil for planting in this way we have accomplished two very important things. First, we have loosened the soil around the hole so the roots can grow quickly into the surrounding soil. Second, we have already amended the soil that will go back into the hole. One word of caution: Do not work the soil when it is wet. (See our first issue for an explanation of how to tell if your soil is safe to work.) Meanwhile, soak your bare-root roses in water for an hour or two. This is particularly important if the roots may have dried in shipping or storage at the nursery. Next dig the hole. Be sure it is wide enough to easily take in the roots of the plant. Eighteen inches is usually sufficient for most plants. Save the soil from the hole. Mix a handful of compost with some more Rose & Flower Food, or a handful of Bone Meal, into the soil in the bottom of the hole. If you are planting a bare root rose, form a cone of soil in the hole and gently spread the roots over the cone. Be sure to keep the plants' bud union (the knob from which the canes grow) just above the soil surface. A small stick or board can be helpful to check the level of the bud union. In colder climates you can plant the rose with the bud union just below the surface. At this point, return the soil to the hole. When the hole is half full, give the bush a light shake to help settle the soil around the roots and then carefully firm the soil around the plant with your feet. Be careful not to tread too heavily. The soil should be firm enough to hold the plant, but not compacted. (Remember all the digging we did to loosen the soil for the roots to grow in!) Finish filling the hole with the remainder of the soil and then firm the soil again. The last step is to water the rose into the soil. This helps to ensure contact between the soil and the roots and to flush air out from around the roots. If you are planting a rose from a container, the steps are essentially the same, except that rather than forming a mound, refill the hole with enough soil that the bud union is jut above the soil surface. flatten the soil in the hole and position the rose in the center. Backfill as outlined above. CARING FOR YOUR NEW ROSES Everyone has a personal theory on the care and feeding of roses. here at the Dirt, we are no different. Because he is long famous for the cultivation of roses, we turn to the suggestions of the English expert David Austin. He claimed that the most important aspect of good rose care is probably mulching. Roses like a cool, rich, moist soil. Mulching helps to provide the right soil conditions for your roses, and makes continuous flowering possible. It helps to conserve moisture in the soil, as well as to suppress weeds. Mulching provides nutrients as well, reduces the susceptibility to some fungal diseases like black spot, and will help to keep the soil loose and friable. In fact, if you are growing roses in hot climates, one trick is to mulch early in the season before the soil warms. up. This helps to keep the soil cooler longer, encouraging your roses to thrive. Look for our Garden Mulch or Mushroom Compost at your favorite garden center. Mushroom compost is particularly well suited for use around roses as it is rich in potash, which roses like in abundance. However, if you live in areas with alkaline soils, we would discourage the use of mushroom compost. Because roses are heavy feeders, good nutrition is important too. We admit an obvious bias, but with good reason. Recently, a number of experts, (officers of regional rose societies) have been critical of organic fertilizers for a variety of reasons, including what they perceive as low nutrient content or high price. Often this only serves to illustrate how little most people know about soil fertility and how little they understand about organic fertilizers. Keep in mind that high analysis fertilizers like 16-16-16 are often made from very soluble nutrient sources. This means that they will be subject to leaching from the soil during periods of heavy irrigation or rainfall. In fact, many soil scientists estimate that as little as 10 to 20 percent of the synthetic nitrogen fed to plants actually ends up in the plant. Suddenly that super rich triple 16 becomes a 1.6% or at best a 3.2% fertilizer, and that much less of a bargain. By comparison, natural organic fertilizers like our Rose & Flower Food (4-6-2) are derived from nutrient sources that by definition are not water soluble and release their nutrients slowly over a long period of time. Unlike synthetic nitrogen sources, repeated use of organic sources can actually result in a reserve of nutrients building up over time, and can be used less often. In our mind, this offers the gardener a much better value. What is important is that your roses get a good feeding in early spring as they begin to show signs of new growth, again after the first blossoms fade, and finally one more feeding in midsummer. By using organic fertilizers and mulching, we are confident that your roses will be as beautiful as any in the neighborhood, with less work! How do we know? That is what our manysatisfied customers have been telling us for years! Alfalfa Meal is great for roses and is an ingredient in our rose food. the January 1993 issue of the American Rose Society Magazine recommended alfalfa meal for stronger stems and greener leaves. Rich in natural growth stimulants, use it according to directions�more is not better, and can actually suppress growth. Similarly, kelp meal, another ingredient of our fertilizer, can help increase disease resistance and provides a source of trace minerals. One rose grower had outstanding results when we added Greensand to his rose beds last spring. Chris Pruitt of Weeks Roses told us that he was amazed by the results he had when he used Greensand last year. For those of you who prefer foliar feedings, look for our Ellie's Ultimate Plant Food, a unique blend of hydrolized liquid fish and kelp meal. One reader of the American Rose Society Magazine also reported great results mulching roses with our Chicken Manure, but keep in mind that chicken manure is loaded with readily available nitrogen and could burn if over-applied. Generally, we would only recommend it for use around established roses and not for use when planting new roses.

This month we want to point out a fallacy perpetuated by those city slickers at the big Madison Avenue advertising agencies.No doubt, dear reader, you have seen those TV ads featuring someone standing in a field of wildflowers, sneezing their heads off and complaining of itchy, watery eyes. The impression is that big beautiful flowers are the culprits behind the allergy attacks. This simply is not the case.The serious offenders are plants with inconspicuous flowers which depend largely on wind to spread their pollen. (the actual allergen) This group includes many common trees and grasses. The wind spreads the pollen everywhere, including your house, your car, your office and finally up your nose and in your eyes.Showy flowers depend on bees and other insects to spread their pollen. Botanists theorize that flowering plants have evolved attractive colors precisely to increase their prospects for pollination and thus reproduction.So go ahead and smell the flowers. It's something else that's making you sneeze. Don't pick on the Chicken Chicken manure has gotten a bad rap. Many gardeners believe that it is likely to burn plants.Truth is, any fresh manure contains salts that can dehydrate plants, causing them to appear burnt.Well-rotted, composted manure, like all of our Whitney Farms products, applied judiciously (i.e., don't plant anything directly into large amounts of it) is non-burning and an excellent, even essential, ingredient to gardening success. Manure improves soil texture and makes it easier to work, it stimulates beneficial soil organisms, which makes the nutrients more available to the plants. It is important to remember that manure has what is called a high mineralization rate (which is how fast the nutrients it contains become available to plants). For example, only about half the nutrients in steer manure become available the first year. By comparison, 90% of the nutrients in chicken manure are available to plants in the first year. So, it is important to use chicken manure judiciously.The main advantage of chicken manure is that it is rich in nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium in a readily available form. Like all of our manure, Whitney Farms Chicken Manure has been composted and has a nutrient analysis of 3-2-2, which makes it specially suited to the nutritional needs of annuals and vegetables. Use it sparingly, spreading 1/4-1 inch of manure over the garden area and tilling it in to a depth of 4-8 inches. As a nutrient-rich top dressing, spread up to 1/2 inch of manure around the drip line of well established plants. Remember, the nutrients chicken manure contains become available quickly, so if in doubt, use a little less.Some of our competitors have been critical of our use of dried poultry waste (DPW) in our fertilizers; they call it a cheap filler.* We could not disagree more strongly. The low moisture DPW we use can last up to two years in the soil according to Ross Penhallegon from the Lane County, Oregon, Extension Office. In addition our DPW contains 4% nitrogen, 3% phosphorous, and 2% potash as well as trace minerals. We feel that it is a quality product that keeps our products affordable, while helping poultry producers deal with a substantial waste problem. In short, it is a well-balanced source of long lasting plant nutrients that produces excellent results at a moderate cost. *Ross H.

Did you know that sunflowers face the sun because of a growth regulator called auxin? Unequal light on each side of the stem causes auxin to build up on the shaded side. The auxin buildup increases growth on that side of the stem, causing the stem to bend toward the light. This habit, which allows plants to make the best use of available light, is known as phototropism.Sunflowers are among the most popular flowers, and for good reason. They are charming, cheerful, and fun to grow. The heads, of course, are a source of food for people and animals. Sunflowers now range in color from red to yellow, from farm-size giants to a fuzzy double-flowered variety called "Teddy Bear." Garden centers now have entire seed racks devoted to sunflowers.Sunflowers are perhaps the best choice for children because their rapid growth and impressive flowers provide a sense of accomplishment. The following sunflowers, which produce flowers on many branches, are especially good for cutting: Teddy Bear Luna Primrose Stella Sungold Tithonia Autumn Beauty Q: When is a flower not a flower? A: When it is an inflorescence. What most people think of as flowers in the composite family of plants are really numerous tiny flowers arranged in a compact head. The petals of a daisy, for instance, are known botanically as ray florets. Sunflowers are another familiar example. Attracting butterflies and hummingbirds Happily, many flowers that attract butterflies and hummingbirds to the garden are easy to grow as well as colorful. In general, butterflies favor large flowers with abundant nectar, while hummingbirds are drawn to brightly colored tubular flowers such as fuschias. Consult your local nursery for specific advice on growing these flowers. Common perennials for attracting butterflies: (Common Name) (Scientific Name) Autuman Joy Sedum Sedum spectabile Bee Balm Monarda didyma Black-eyed Susan Rudbeckia spp. Buddlea Buddlea alternifolia Buttlerfly Bush Buddlea Davidii Chrysanthemum Chrysanthemum Common Rue Ruta graveolens Coreopsis Coreopsis spp. Daylilies Hemerocallis spp. Frikarti aster Aster frikatti Germander Teucrium spp. Globe Thistle Echinops ritro Heliotrope Heliotropium arborescens Honeysuckle Lonicera spp. Indian Blanket Gaillardia Lavender Lavendula spp. Mint Mentha spp. New Jersey Tea Ceanothus americanus Parsley Petraselinum crispum Pincushion Flower Scabiosa caucasica Purple Coneflower Echinacea purpurea Queen Anne�s Lace Daucus carota Rosemary Rosmarinus officinalis Spike Garfeathers Liatris spicata Summer Phlox Phlox paniculata Sunflowers Helianthus spp. Sweet Pea Lathyrus Thyme Thymus spp. Tiger Lily Lilium speciosum Violet Viola spp. Yarrow Achillea spp. Easy-to-Grow flowers for hummingbirds Columbine Achillea spp. Foxglove Digitalis spp. Lupine Lupinus Veronica Veronica Bee Balm Monarda didyma Lobelia Lobelia Clarkia Clarkia Did you know? Hummingbirds eat half their weight in food everyday. Hummingbirds are the only birds that can fly backward. They can also fly upside down and hover in their search for nectar and insects. however, you'll never see a hummingbird walk. They will fly even to move an inch. Some hummers beat their wings 70 times each second!

Due to space limitations, some content had to be left out. This month, however, we've expanded, and thus present: MORE ON TREES! To stake or not to stake? Contrary to popular opinion, it is generally better not to stake a tree. A recent study at Michigan State University showed that staking trees often results in long and leggy growth with thin and weak stems. Unstaked trees develop better root systems and more dense and compact growth. In areas where wind may be a problem, or if the tree starts to lean, the trunk should be attached loosely to the stake. An old nylon stocking makes a great flexible tie. If possible, use a flexible stake. Some movement is necessary for the tree to build a strong trunk and sturdy root system. After one year, the stake and ties should be removed, to prevent damage to the tree from the tie. Studies have also clearly shown that the old recommendation to prune the shoots to match the roots is also misguided. The old theory: Reduce the leaf surface to lessen transpiration and accommodate the reduced root system, and the plant would better survive transplanting. New theory: Research has shown that the shoots and leaves provide the plants with the photosynthetic surface to produce the nutrients required for good root growth. Finally, be sure to keep your new tree well watered during dry spells. In most areas, an inch of water per week is all that is required. Ideally, water the whole planting area�not just the area near the trunk�so as to encourage the growth of a vigorous root system. Just as you read about our favorite roses, here we present our picks on annuals. Peter Hershey: Choosing my favorite annual flower-Poached Egg Flower- was easy because I only grow a few. My family's garden consists mostly of perennials, small trees, flowering shrubs plus a vegetable garden. Poached Egg Flower,also known as Meadowfoam, bears the scientific name Limnanthes douglasii. It can be found at nurseries with good selections of native plants or specialty seed suppliers.Poached Egg Flower is an apt name. The profuse flowers have a bright yellow center surrounded by pure white. The foliage is a bright green, about the color and texture of parsley. The plant looks good enough to have for Sunday brunch. However, this is one tough plant that will thrive despite heavy soil, overwatering and light frost. Meadowfoam reseeds readily, yet will not become an pest. In a natural garden setting it is a welcome and underused treasure. Sylvia Carlton-Cordaro: Impatiens or Petunias? Impatiens grow in shade, they're bold, easy and reliable, and cheer up woodsy places. But petunias come in rainbows of colors and will grow anywhere in full sun, spilling out of baskets, mounding out of borders. Let's see, petunias or impatiens'? Kevin Loomis: Of the many annuals to choose from it is very difficult to choose a favorite! There are so many that have such specific uses. Some for heat tolerance, some for shade, some as dramatic specimen plants and others as wonderful companions mixed in containers. There is one, however, that I have always liked and used a great deal, which has earned a new special place in my garden. That annual is trailing Lobelia. Last year, trailing Lobelia seeds (apparently from containers in my gardens the previous year) self-sowed at random throughout my garden. Because of the light, almost airy growth habit of trailing Lobelia the effect was better than anything I could have planned. Beautiful light blues, lavenders and whites wove gently through and around perennials, roses, or whatever they happened to encounter. This year I will try to achieve similar results by scattering trailing Lobelia seeds throughout my gardens. Chris Totten: Agrostemma, or Coneflower; This beautiful wispy plant grows sturdily to a height of about three feet. the purple flowers unfurl as they bloom. It makes a great cut flower never failing to add character to a mixed bouquet. Brenda Sage: Sweet pea is my favorite annual flower because it provides plenty of fragrant bouquets all summer long. From time to time, The Dirt will print a roundup of various employees' favorite plants relevant to the appropriate season. Chris Totten: Madame Alfred Curriere. This amazing climber has a beautiful white bloom with a faint peach blush as at opens. The fragrance is unbelievable. It is very vigorous, and blooms profusely in the spring and fall. In Portland, it will continue blooming well into the fall, finally giving up with the onset of freezing weather. Brenda Sage: Graham Thomas, a David Austin English rose, is my favorite because it is vigorous, with true yellow flowers. It is fragrant and very disease-resistant. Sylvia Carlton-Cordaro: Although it�s a lanky rose, Gertrude Jekyll has pretty pink flowers that allure me. Then I can't keep my nose out of the blossoms the rest of the day. Norm Ross: American Beauty, because it was a Grateful Dead album cover; Bob Hope because of the memories; and Blazer, because I went to every one of the Portland Trailblazers' 1977 playoff games. (Norm likes basketball -Ed.) Kevin Loomis: My favorite rose is a budded shrub variety Floribunda named Bonica. Bonica displays masses of clear pink, ruffled and heavily petaled 2-3 flowers all summer, above glossy medium green foliage. It has a light, sweet fragrance and I have found it to be highly disease and insect resistant. Bonica's fragrance and contrast in flower and foliage color make it especially nice for a prominent position near a favorite evening sitting area. Peter Hershey: After the severe winter the Pacific Northwest gardeners just endured, my choice for favorite rose is clear. Of the disease resistant varieties we grow one stands out for hardiness and vigor -Rosa rugosa. It is the only one of 10 rose bushes that survived the February freeze unscathed. The others survived, but with extensive dieback because they had already come out of dormancy after the mild temperatures beforehand. Rosa rugosa is available in several color and form varieties. They all have attractive crinkly foliage and produce large orange-red fruit, called hips, that are a good source of vitamin C, and sometimes used in preserves. We know what our favorites are.

After eight years with us, Sam Rodriguez has left to go on to new opportunities.Sam performed a number of important jobs for us including warehouseman, forklift operator, and stacker. But Sam was most famous for his work as a sealer on our bagging line. Adeptly keeping pace with any number of different fillers (the employee who actually loads the empty bag onto the line for filling) over the years, Sam helped to set production records year after year. He could keep up with the best fillers we ever had, and was always ready to step up the pace another notch. He was also famous with his fellow crew members for the delicious burritos he would sometimes bring to work. We want to thank Sam for his many years of dedicated service to the Garden Grow Co. and wish him all the best in the future. We will all miss him. The good news is, his brothers Severo and David are still with us working in our warehouse.

In one day crews dumped 200 truckloads of gravel to fill 12 major washouts and several minor ones.Polk County's prompt response will minimize disruption of production and distribution.Company production workers will work double shifts seven days a week to make up for the week of lost time and $500,000 in lost inventory. High Water: The Willamette encroached, but did not flood out the buildings. The water came within six inches of the company warehouse, sparing the fertilizers and indoor sods. The main office also escaped damage. However, 700 pallets of bagged outdoor soil products and a pile of zoo animal manure were lost to the high water.In response, Garden Grow will ask our suppliers at Washington Park Zoo to increase their output so that the project can continue. The product, a compost that has yet to be named, is on hold for a year.The Willamette River normally flows peaceably along a high bank bordering the 67-acre property, which is located near the farming community of Independence Oregon.On Thursday Feb. 8 the river crested at 36 feet, covering the access road with four feet of water and swamping the composting yard. Employees had evacuated the premises when the water level reached 24 feet. The call to evacuate, according to company president and founder John Graham came when the rising waters lifted and started to push a fully loaded semi truck. Employees were not able to return to work until Tuesday Feb. 13, and then it was on foot. By the next day the road was back in service. Graham noted that insurance will cover the losses. "Normally we brag about our beautiful river front property. This week we're bragging about our flood insurance," said Graham. Planting Trees& Shrubs In recent years, many problems associated with trees in urban and suburban areas have been traced to poor planting techniques. Essentially, planting trees in the old-fashioned hole in dense compacted soils like those often found around new construction sites and filling the holes with amendments such as peat moss or compost can cause the roots to grow in tangled circles in the rich soil. Any outward growth stops when the roots reach the denser original soil. It is important to select either the right tree for the location, or if your heart is set on a particular tree, to ensure that it is planted in a suit-able spot. Once the proper site is found, loosen the soil by digging or tilling to a depth of 12 inches over an area as much as five times the diameter of the root ball. Ideally the planting area should be about 30 sq. ft. in size, with the minimum area no smaller than 4'X4'. Quality organic amendments, like Whitney Farms Planting Mix, can be added to the soil at this time. Use it uniformly throughout the area and mix it thoroughly into the soil. If required, blend fertilizers and lime into the planting area at the same time. Use our All Purpose Plant Food for planting trees and shrubs. For planting roses, we recommend our Rose & Flower Food. Some debate surrounds the use of organic matter when planting new trees. A number of studies have shown that the closer the soil in the planting area is to the native soil, the more success and better long-term health of the tree. There are exceptions to the rule, however. To decide if you need to use compost consider the following factors: 1) Assess the size of the tree when mature. Contrary to popular belief, a tree's roots are not a neat mirror image of its shoots. Root systems can extend three and four times the diameter of the drip line. Obviously, for large specimen trees like oaks or standard fruit trees, it would be all but impossible to amend the entire root system of the tree. By comparison many smaller trees and shrubs, including roses and fruit trees on dwarfing root stocks, have extremely compact root systems at maturity that are confined to a small area. With these plants it is quite practical and affordable to thoroughly amend the planting area. The plants will grow better as a result. 2) Assess the condition of the native soil. Adding compost or organic matter to the planting area can contribute significantly to the success of the planting if the soil has poor structure, drains poorly, or is excessively sandy or heavy. A simple rule of thumb is, the heavier the soil the less amendment should be used. If you are blessed with rich fertile soil it is likely that few or no amendments would be required for planting trees. Once the area has been tilled, dig a shallow hole no deeper than the root ball in the center. To prevent the tree from settling, do not loosen the soil beneath the root ball. However, if desired, the bottom of the planting area around the root ball could be loosened where practical. The tree can be set in the hole with the upper surface of the root halt or the old soil mark on the trunk at the same level as the existing soil. At this point, if you are planting a balled and burlapped plant, you should carefully cut and remove the rope or wires holding the burlap in place. Some nurserymen recommend that th burlap be removed as well, though care should be taken handling the rootball or it could be damaged. Roots circling the root ball should be spread out or even cut as needed. If you are planting bare root plants, gently spread the roots out in the hole. Cut off any damaged roots. Fill in around the root ball with the soil from the hole, and Gently pack it down to prevent air pockets. DO NOT compact the soil around the root ball with your feet. A good watering will help to settle the soil and ensure contact between the earth and the roots. Rake the soil around the area, and cover it with two to four inches of mulch like leaf mold, compost, or Whitney Farms Garden Mulch. Be careful to keep the mulch away from direct contact with the trunk. In some areas with low rainfall, gardeners are often encouraged to form a berm around the plant to conserve water. It may, however, also cause the roots to concentrate in the area within the berm close to the tree, as well as contributing to problems with crown rot in areas of high rainfall. A good mulch provides the same water saving benefit without contributing any problems. Check before you dig! Or how to be sure you get the most out of your dirt...All the hard work you have put into building your soil can disappear in one misguided morning of overzealous digging or tilling. Working a soil that is too wet or too dry can destroy the structure of the soil. Clay sods in particular are easily damaged by digging when they are too wet or dry. Take a moment to check your soil by following these simple steps. 1. Pick up a handful of your soil and squeeze it gently in your palm to form afirm ball. 2. If the soil balls up easily without oozing through your fingers or disappearing into the palm of your hand as gooey mess, it, may be ready to work. The final check is to see if the ball crumbles, easily. If you can make a firm ball of soil that still crumbles readily, your soil is just right for digging or tilling. 3. If the soil is too dry, you will not be able to form a ball. In this case, give your garden a thorough soaking, let it drain for a day or two, and repeat the above test. 4. Some soils , like sandy soils are more forgiving and can be worked more easily than clay soils. For more information on how to determine the kind of soil you have, keep your eye on future editions of The Dirt, or browse the Soil Ammendments section of our web site. Uncle Malcolm's Fun Facts © The Dinosaur Tree The Ginkgo tree is the sole surviving member of an ancient family. During the Mesozoic Era dinosaurs roamed the earth in forests full of these primitive trees.The Ginkgo is a deciduous broadleaf tree, but is unique because it is related closely to conifers.Scientists once believed the Ginkgo survived only because of its cultivation as a sacred tree in China temple gardens. However, wild Ginkgos have recently been found growing in remote valleys of western China. The Ginkgo's fan-shaped leaves turn bright yellow in the fall, then drop all at once, making a loud "swoosh" sound. This curious habit endears to anyone who wants to keep leaf raking to a minimum. TheGinkgo, as you might expect, is also highly adaptable. It withstands Pollution, low sunlight, meager soil, and extreme temperatures. It is virtually immune to disease and pests. With all those traits, the Ginkgo should be around for another 200 million years. Does Peanut ButterGrow on Trees? The Harlequin Glorybower, a small garden tree that has pretty white flowers in late summer, is also known as the peanut butter tree. The next time you're in a nursery, crush one of its leaves between your finger and sniff it. Many people think that the scent is similar to peanut butter. Unfortunately, the leaves make a lousy sandwich, even with jelly.

What value does this have? Plants feed themselves by converting the energy contained in sunlight toforms that can be utilized by life on this planet. This is a processknown as photosynthesis. As part of that process plants require certainnutrients some of which come from the air, some from water, and somefrom the soil. By supplying nutrients to the soil, we are ensuring thatthe plants have the elements they require to perform the valuable servicethey provide the rest of us who depend on them for food. A good example is magnesium. It is at the heart of the chlorophyllmolecule--putting the 'green' in plants--and acts much like thehemoglobin in our own blood. Only 20% of the magnesium in plants ispart of chlorophyll, it also is necessary to every operation in a plantinvolving phosphorus; it influences the metabolism of nitrogen and isimportant to the assimilation of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis.Obviously, it is vital to the well being of plants. Plants getmagnesium from the soil. At the same time, it is important to understand that every time weharvest a vegetable, cut a flower, or feed plants to livestock we aretransferring minerals and nutrients from the soil where the plants grewto a new location--our bodies, the cows, our dining room table, or eventhe garbage. If we don't replace those nutrients either by compostingor through supplements from fertilizers we could eventually deplete thenatural reserves of available nutrients in the soil, and we would nolonger be able to grow plants. It is also true that in many soils some nutrients are deficient or in aform that is not available to plants. This is particularly true ofnitrogen. Nitrogen is very soluble in water and is often deficient inmost soils. It is also absolutely essential for plant growth. It candramatically limit our abilities to grow plants. By adding it to oursoils, we ensure that our plants have what they need to grow and thrive. Ultimately, the value of adding nutrients and minerals to the soil isthat we ensure that our plants grow, that the organisms in the soilvital to the health and growth of our plants are able to grow andthrive, and most importantly we ensure that the food we eat is rich andwell balanced and contains the minerals and vitamins we need to live. It is my belief that without soil and the plants that grow in it, lifeas we know it would not exist on this planet. All the food we eat, allthe gasoline we burn, all the natural gas we cook with is a by-productof the process of photosynthesis. Without it, we would cease to exist.By taking care of our soils and providing them with the nutrients theyrequire to support the plants and the rest of the life on the planet, weensure that we continue to live on this planet. Without fertile soilsyou have deserts where nothing grows and only the toughest species oforganisms can survive--we humans are not that tough!! Hope I could answer your question...It is not one that lends itself to ashort or simple response...If you still need clarification, please emailagain. What does organic mean? There are a variety of definitions on what constitutes "organic." At Whitney Farms our guiding definition of "organic" is any naturally occurring animal and plant by-products approved for use by the major certification organizations like Oregon Tilth and California Certified Organic Farmers. We only use products that will improve the soil and encourage a healthy population of soil organisms, while meeting the nutritional requirements of your plants. Does a plant know the difference between a synthetic/chemical fertilizer and an organic fertilizer? All nutrients, whether synthetic or organic must be converted to a form which can be utilized by the plant. The plant does not recognize a difference between synthetic/ chemical or organic nutrient sources, but the soil does. Organic fertilizers and amendments are meant to develop a healthy and vital population of the organisms that make nutrients available to plants. Therein lies the age old organic gardening motto, "Feed the soil, not the plant." A plant's growth is dependent on the ability of the soil to retain and release nutrients. It is therefore critical that the soil be nurtured and fed. A healthy soil will result in a garden full of healthy plants. Our intent is to help the gardener build a fertile soil with a large reserve of nutrients. The plant will draw the nutrients it needs from this storehouse in the soil. What impact does soil temperature have on organic fertilizers? Because organic fertilizers work in unison with the microbial life in the soil, most organic fertilizers work more effectively when the ground temperature is above 55 degrees Fahrenheit, which allows those organisms to be active. Below that ground temperature, the biological processes in the soil may be sluggish and the nutrients are, in a sense, "dormant" in the soil. Why are organic fertilizers more expensive than synthetic/chemical fertilizers and yet still considered a better value? Organic fertilizers are more expensive than synthetic/chemical fertilizers because the raw materials cost considerably more. In most cases, however, organic fertilizers are a better value because they don't have to be used as often, and will have the long term benefit of improving the soil. Organic fertilizers may be more expensive, but they will improve the ability of the soil to retain and release nutrients that will reduce a garden's overall fertilizer needs. How often should organics be applied? How frequently you apply fertilizers will depend largely on the inherent fertility of the garden soil. A very poor soil may require regular applications of nutrients and soil amendments as it is being built-up. Rich, healthy soil only requires applications of nutrients to replace those that are removed by the plants or lost by natural processes of decay. Because organic matter is naturally consumed by soil organisms it is advisable to apply compost or other amendments and organic fertilizers at least once a year. Don't organics work slower than synthetic/chemical fertilizers? Organic fertilizers work gradually, and that is what contributes to their effectiveness. Because the nutrients are released slowly, the plants are able to use them as they need them, and to grow at a natural rate. This slow release enhances the inherent ability of plants to resist attacks. from insects and disease, and to survive dramatic extremes of climate, such as drought and unseasonable freezes. How important is amending the soil in organic gardening? Amending the soil is the foundation of organic gardening. The whole philosophy is to encourage the growth of those organisms within the soil that govern the availability of nutrients. By carefully amending the soil through the use of regular applications of organic matter, the physical structure of the soil can be vastly improved. This will contribute significantly to better moisture retention, nutrient retention, aeration, and drainage. Dear Whitney Farms -- Can you recommend a source of Organic fertilizerthat will giver the desired results as per 1000square feet? First let me tell you how to determine how much nitrogen is in a givenfertilizer. You will find three numbers on every label of fertilizer. Thefirst is nitrogen (N)--green growth in plants; the second is phosphorous(P)--flowering, fruiting, and rooting; the third number is potash(K)--overall health and vigor (these are simple "rules of thumb" butgenerally accurate.) These numbers are a percentage of the weight of thebag. So, for example if we had a 100 lb. bag of a 10-10-10 fertilizer, 10%of 100 lbs. would be the total nitrogen content of the product--10 lbs..The math is not as neat for P and K, there is a small conversion for theactual content. (Hopefully, I didn't just bore you with information youalready knew!) So, to answer your question, I would suggest blood meal for your nitrogensource. Why? Oregon State University has been looking at organic nitrogensources for the last couple of years, and the Professor doing the researchhas come to believe that blood meal is the single finest nitrogen source hehas ever seen, bar none--synthetic or organic. It will release itsnutrients in cold, wet soils or warm, dry soils. It releases its nutrientsquickly, and yet OSU has seen it continue to feed for up to 8 months ormore. It is good stuff. How much to apply? Given the information above, there are about 2.6 poundsof N in a 20 lbs. bag of Blood Meal (13% of 20 lbs.). So that ought toprovide you with what you are looking for. Be sure to add compost at the same time you till in the fertilizer, if youare not in the habit of doing so already. Dear Whitney Farms -- About how large an area will 1 yard of mulch cover if it is about 2 inches deep. We estimate that it takes about nine cubic feet to cover a hundredsquare feet (10 X 10) with one inch of compost. Given that there are 27cubic feet in a cubic yard, you should be able to cover about 150 sq.ft. with a yard of material spread two inches deep. Dear Whitney Farms -- what's the last spring frost date in st.paul,mn? Is this a trick question? Being from Oregon, and central Californiabefore that, I can't honestly say that I know the last frost date forSt. Paul. Were I to seek out the answer, I would call the agriculturalextension service for the State of Minnesota. I know that in Montanathe growing season is relatively short--in the 75- to 150-day range, andthat it is possible to have a frost almost any time of the year in someof the more mountainous areas. The last frost can be as late as earlyJune. Presumably, conditions are similar in Minnesota. Sorry we could not be of more help, but the question is a little out ofour range--give those extension folks a call though! We pay taxes sothat we can get information like that from folks like them! Oceanside(San Diego) CA Dear Whitney Farms -- Which of your fertilizers would be best for an outdoor cactus garden? I would recommend our All-Purpose Plant Food for use in cactus gardens.It is an excellent general purpose fertilizer that has long lastingingredients to gently feed your cactus throughout the year. One or twoapplications per year should be sufficient for the needs of most cactusplants. Dear Whitney Farms -- What are the major drawbacks to using chemical fertilizers in our garden. I am especially concerned about any health related problems orsoil contamination. I can not tell you honestly that in and of themselves chemical orsynthetic fertilizers are harmful or inherently evil. If usedjudiciously and intelligently they can make a significant contributionto the overall health and productivity of our soils. Unfortunately thatis not how they are use. Instead, they are viewed as all that is needed to grow plants. Vitaminsare important to our health, but it would be impossible for us to liveon vitamins alone. I see synthetic fertilizers in much the same light.They are only one part of a very complex picture. Here are the primarydrawbacks I see to there use: Destruction of soil structure. Soil is alive and depends on organicmatter to keep it healthy. Just as we require carbon to live so to dothe organisms in the soil. Excessive use of synthetic or chemicalfertilizers has several detrimental effects on the soil. One soilmicrobiologist I know has documented the destruction of soil life due tosalt based, synthetic fertilizers. She says it is a pretty simpleprocess--you have a salt, with a very low moisture pressure (thefertilizer) next to bacteria and other organisms critical to the healthand productivity of the soil. These organisms are basically cellsfilled with water. Water moves from areas of high pressure (thebacteria) to areas of low pressure (the fertilizer). The result? Awhole bunch of dead soil microbes. This particular biologist hasdocumented a depletion of soil life on American farmlands from a naturalhigh of anywhere from 200-2000 species to a low of fewer than 20species--all due, she believes, to the overapplication of salt basedfertilizers. (chemical fertilizers are by definition salt based)Furthermore, many of the less expensive forms of these products utilizesources or raw materials that are very high in chloride, also toxic tomicrobial life. So what's the big deal? Dead bacteria who cares? Most people do notrealize that all the nutrients plants need are cycled at one time oranother by the biology in the soil. In fact, most forms of syntheticnitrogen are made available by microbes in the soil. Without themicrobes the soil is dead and unproductive. Furthermore, the microbial life in the soil makes a significantcontribution to the structure of the soil which determines how easy itis to work, to the prevention and destruction of pests and diseases (Infact, penicillin is a derived from soil microbes!), to the overall growthof plants in the soil. At the same time, due to the excessive use of synthetic nitrogen, soilsystems can be affected in several other ways. For example, if there isalways an overabundance of soluble nitrogen, many of the microbialsystems slow down--why work if we don't need to. Then when the plantsneed the nitrogen to be converted to a more available form thebiological system that makes that happen is not working at optimumefficiency. At the same time, because there is a balance of carbon andnitrogen in the soil, a lot of soluble nitrogen floating around can leadto the destruction of soil organic matter which ultimately leads to lossof soil structure and productivity. This can lead to catastrophicevents like the dust bowl in the early part of this century, or erosionat levels far beyond what the soil can naturally replace. Many chemical fertilizers are acidifying which can cause problems inareas where soils are already acid. Many nutrients are made lessavailable due to high acidity (low pH), which results in plants notbeing able to use them and suffering from nutrient deficiencies. Soluble forms of nitrogen are also readily leached out of the soil oftencausing ground water contamination due to excessive nitrateconcentrations. Nitrates are toxic to mammals and extremely harmful tobabies etc. I have seen some work indicating a relationship betweenmiscarriage and high nitrate levels in farm well water. At the sametime, in places like the Everglades extremely high levels of phosphorousdue to the excessive use of phosphate fertilizers has caused severeenvironmental damage. Furthermore, many lakes and streams in thiscountry are clogged with algal blooms directly related to the misuse andover dependence on synthetic nitrogen on agricultural lands. There is a good body of evidence to show that the salts can build up inthe soil also leading to a loss of productivity. The deserts of Iragand Iran are known to anthropologists and historians as the FertileCrescent and may be the first example of highly centralized, irrigatedagriculture. Many scientists believe that these practices lead directlyto the desertification of the region and the current state of the landthere. More? Ironically, many soil scientists estimate that only a very smallpercentage of the chemical fertilizers applied actually find there wayinto the plants. Some estimates are as low as 10-20%. The rest is tiedup in the organic matter of the soil, where it is released to plants insubsequent seasons, or it is leached out into the water supply, or lostto the atmosphere as a gas. Gardeners become dependent on the fertilizers and fail to understandwhat is happening in the soil. They stop adding organic matter orcompost, and the soil becomes less and less productive. So they addmore and more fertilizer and the soil becomes less and less productive.Soil is alive and you have to feed that life to keep it productive.Inert salts do not feed the soil. In fact, in reality they do not even feed the plants. Sunlight and thephotosynthetic process feeds plants (and the rest of us too!), thenutrients in the soil, air and water are only the building blocks thatmake that process possible. Feed the soil, not the plants! What else? It is very easy to make a severe mistake with highlyconcentrated salt based, synthetic fertilizers. An obvious example issalt burn. Too much fertilizer salts and the plants burn. Otherproblems can be more subtle. It does not take a lot of some of thetrace minerals to cause some very severe nutritional deficiencies in theplants. Often synthetic blends have these trace mineral packages inthem that are supposed to be just dandy--but no one knows how much ofthese substances you already have present in your soil. People justapply them because the box told them too, and yet they could be buildingup a toxic level of a trace mineral without even realizing it. Synthetic fertilizers contribute to our dependency on foreign oil. Ittakes energy to make them and some are even made using by products ofoil. Synthetic fertilizers can also cause over abundant growth in plants.This can make plants weak, subject to falling over when exposed to theleast wind or the most gentle spring rain. That overly lush growth canalso be attractive to insect pests and subject to diseases. It is alsotypically very water intensive--all that growth makes a plant a lot lessdrought resistant. There is some evidence that produce grown with soluble salt basedfertilizers is also less nutritious than that grown using naturalorganic methods. There is a fairly large body of research comparing thedry weight of produce--the crops grown using chemical fertilizers arefull of water, and have a lower mineral content than that using organicmethods. These are a few of the concerns that I have with the long term use ofchemical fertilizers. I hope I answered some of your questions. OurWeb page (as you probably already know) has some more info which mayalso answer some of your concerns. I would also invite you to visit a"friend's" web page. Check out www.cfarms.com (if that doesn't work trycfarm.com without the ess). They have a great, albeit long, piece aboutwhy organic covering many of these topics and more.

(frost?) I couldn't tell where you lived in New York state, upstate?, NYC?I would bet that you are getting closed to the planting date for tomatosin your area. In the milder parts of NY state, I believe mid to lateMay is just the right time, and in some of the colder areas late in themonth should be fine. You still might want to be prepare to protectthem in the event of a late frost. For more exact information, contact the New York State AgriculturalExtension Service. We all pay tax dollars to have these folks availableto answer questions just like the one you have! They can usually provideyou with planting dates for all the major vegetables in your area. Dear Whitney Farms -- I just read your topic on watering and am considering running a networkof soaker hoses throughout my various vegetable beds.Question: Would it work if I were to bury the hoses slightly under the soilnext to the plants? Yes!! It works really well. People have even started to use the new"weeping" style soaker hoses under lawns for irrigating turf grass. Thekey is to be certain that you have "weeping" soakers (most majormanufacturers make a version of them) not the old style "soaker" hosesthat spray streams of water or the really old forerunners of today'shoses--canvas soakers. Burying the hose would not work with thesetypes. The second key is not piercing the hose with garden forks, weeders,spades, shovels, etc. when you are out working in the garden (havingonce done it, I can tell you that I now have a very clear visual senseof how sink holes are formed...). A great way to set your system up is to go ahead and plant as younormally would and lay the hose out to fit the needs of your currentgarden. I would counsel flexibility--don't lock yourself into a set upthat won't allow for annual changes in the layout of the vegetable patchfor crop rotations, etc. Then, after the soil warms up, mulch over thehose. Simple as that. . . I have used the hoses extensively and know commercial growers who haveemployed them in intensively managed systems anc can vouch for theireffectiveness. One other note: You will need to account for your soil type when layingout the hose. On sandy soils, the water is going to go virtuallystraight down (think carrot shape) whereas on clay soils the water isgoing to move more laterally as well as vertically (think onion). Besure that the spacing between the hoses accounts for the way water movesin your soil. Dear Whitney Farms-- HI... I ALREADY HAVE A WELL ESTABLISHED GARDEN, IN 12" POT APPROX. 40 OR SO AND A VEGGIE BED THAT IS APPRX. 4' X 4'. I LIVE IN A CONDO SO I HAVEHAD TO IMPROVISE. I KNOW FROM MY COURSE IN BIOLOGY 122 THIS SEMESTER THAT PLANTS ESSENTIALLY NEED 9 BASIC NUTRIENTS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS RICHNESS. I HAVE READ THE LABEL ON "MIRACLE GROW" AND CAN NOT DECIDEIF MY VEGETABLES ARE STILL GOING TO BE ORGANIC.. I AM USINGABSOLUTELY NO OTHER FERTILIZER OR BUG AND WEED KILLER. IF IT DOES TAKE THE "ORGNIC OUT OF MY VEGETABLE GARDEN, CAN I CORRECT THE PROBLEM BYCHANGING THE SOIL OR CAN I JUST USE YOUR PRODUCT FROM NOW ON AS I GRADUATE MY PLANTS INTO LARGER POTS AND EXTEND MY VEGETABLE BED. PLEASE ADVISE AND SEND ME INFORMATION IF YOU HAVE AN ORGANIC NEWSLETTER OF ANY SORT. PERSONALLY, I MAKE CLOTHING OUT OF RECYCLED PLASTIC SODA BOTTLES AND/OR RECYCLED COTTON...WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE MORE ROOM FOR FIELDS AND LESS ROOM FOR LAND FILLS! ECOLOGICALLY YOURS... To answer your question, plants need more than just the 16 essentialnutrients you learned about in class. In fact one of the bigdifferences between organic and what I call convential vegetables is theactuall mineral content in the plant tissue. The elements you learnedabout have been identified as essential to the growth of plants, butthere is much more happening here particularly in terms of the manydifferent organisms who call the soil home and are beneficial to thegrowth of your plants... To answer your specific question...Miracle Gro is not now and never willbe organic...It has taken the organic completely out of yourgarden...and it is just about the most expensive way to fertilize--butthat is a whole other conversation. Don't worry...while it is not "organic" by the market definition, it isalso not in and of itself "toxic." This is a fertilizer after all, andnot a pesticide or an herbicide. Don't get obsessed with labels. Some of the trace minerals required arein such small concentrations that annual applications of compost, orusing compost based potting soils like Whitney Farms potting soils, willusually supply most if not all of the various trace minerals required.I would heartily encourage you to take a look at our vegetable food foryour fertilizer needs. Just mix it in the next time you water or if youare potting up to a larger size. Otherwise, liquid fish or liquid fishand kelp products work wonders for quick, natural organic supplementalfeedings. We have a great product out there in nurseries called Ellie'sUltimate Plant Food--it's a fish and kelp combo--the kelp helps providetrace minerals. Also, organic gardeners/farmers will supplement withproducts like greensand or raw rock phosphate or even ground rock dustas a supplement for trace minerals. So, don't go to the trouble of replacing the soil, just make the switchand you will be back on track and gardening organically... Alabama--- Dear Whitney Farms -- I am trying to start an organic vegetable garden. What steps can I take to prevent pests in the garden. I have heard that planting various flowering plants with the vegetables will help ward off unwanted bugs. Any suggestions? One of the underlying principles of organic gardening is diversity. Without it, weare sorely limited in what we can do as gardeners. Your question touches on anumber of different topics: trap plantings, companion planting, and attractingbeneficial insects to the garden. A couple of basic principles in organic gardening (and gardening in general):1) Focus your energies on improving the soil! Organic gardening is as much aboutfeeding the soil as it is about reducing the chemical inputs to our garden. Thetheory goes, and the experience teaches, that the healthier and more rich the soil,the healthier the plants that grow in it. Essentially, much like humans have theability to resist the various diseases that affect us, most plants have a naturalresistance to insects and diseases. By allowing the plants to grow at a morenatural rate and ensuring that the soil is full of the vital nutrients needed bythe plants to grow, we can help the garden better withstand the various pests thatmight afflict it. 2) Plant the right plants in the right place. Be sure that the plant you aregrowing is suited to the environment you are asking it to grow in. More problemsare caused by poor choices--putting shade loving plants in a hot sunny location,for example. 3) Avoid monocultures like the plague. Plant a variety of vegetables and flowersa few at a time, as opposed to one big massive planting that goes in all on thesame day. With diversity comes stability. 4) Accept a little damage from time to time as the cost of gardening in a naturalworld. I am not suggesting that you surrender to the pests, but realize that notall insects are pests. Entomologists estimate that at best only 2% and at worst10% of insects would qualify as pests. All too often, we get the arsenal out tokill a couple of aphids that could be washed off with a sharp stream of water andend up killing all the good guys that were feeding on the aphids. Balance is thekey. If you are going to attract beneficial insects to the garden, they need tohave someone to eat, or they will just move on to the next garden with a readymeal. So, to get to the specifics of your question. There are a number of strategiesthat can be utilized to reduce the problems you might have. One is companionplanting. Basically this just means mixing it up. Planting a variety of plantsthat use different parts of the soil for example. Some plants are shallow rootedand others deeply rooted. Some plants like to vine and climb, while others like totumble out across the garden. A classic example of companion planting are the'three sisters' of native American agriculture--corn, beans and squash. All arestaples of the traditional diet--the corn gives the beans something to climb on,the beans fix nitrogen which feeds the corn and the squash, the squash fills thearea between the plants, helping to shade it and keep it cool--conserving moistureand cutting down on competition from weeds. More nebulous are the interactions between the plants themselves. This is not aswell documented, but there seems to be a fair amount of anecdotal evidence to showthat some plants do well when planted together. Tomatoes and basil, beans andcorn, the cabbage family and onions, etc. This is all subject to a great deal ofopinion, but there are books out there with lists that can give you some guidance.Check out Rodales' Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening, or Robert Kouriks' book aboutedible landscaping titled "Designing and Maintaining Your Edible LandscapeNaturally"(this one is a great source of a number of different lists of plantsthat attract insects, repel insects, etc.)--to name just a couple. A number of plants are also attractive to beneficial insects, like Angelica. Arobust perennial member of the umbell or parsley family, it produces huge flowerheads that are attractive to a number of beneficial insects. By planting plantslike this in and around the garden, you can actually help to attract the bugs thateat the bugs that eat your plants. Quite a few fairly common plants make the list,like candytuft and yarrow to name just a couple. This goes back to my commentsabout avoiding monoculture--no where in nature do you see whole stands of just oneplant all the same age. So don't be afraid to mix the flowers in with thevegetables. Even if you just have the occasional stand of flowers at the end ofthe beds, or you edge your beds with marigolds, they will help to attract the goodguys to your garden. Some research has been done using some plants as trap crops to entice the pestsaway from the crop you want to harvest and into a plant that you are willing tosacrifice. Birds are good predators. Many an aphid outbreak has been cured in my yard by theneighborhood birds long before I could get the Safers Soap out to do the aphids in.Plant shrubs around the outside of the garden that will attract birds and give thema place to hide between forays into your garden. There are also any number of cultural controls you can resort to. Like using verylight reemay fabrics to float over your plants as they grow preventing pests fromgetting into the plants where they could lay eggs and do harm. Water is aneffective control for pests like aphids and mites--a good sharp stream will knockthem from your plants down to the soil from where they will never find there wayback to your plants. Learn about your local pests, when they are active, whattheir lifecycle is and time your plantings, controls, etc. accordingly. This lastpoint is probably the most important. If you know a little bit about the pest, youcan go a long way toward controlling it. Most important, don't get discouraged. If you loose the occasional battle, make afew notes, learn a little about what went wrong, and avoid the same mistakes nextyear. One of the things I appreciate most about gardening organically is that itencourages us to understand a little more of what goes on in our gardens, asopposed to viewing them as some industrial process which can be managed with theintroduction of chemical A or B. If this is your first year gardening organically,it does take time to reintroduce nature into your garden. But don't believe thehorror stories you may hear about loosing all of your crops to pests they simplyaren't true. A great fallacy of modern agriculture is this notion that we haveeradicated pests--we use more chemicals than ever in wider variety than we've everimagined yet according to a report I recently heard, we loose about the samepercentage of crops to pests as we did before the introduction of all thechemicals! HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!! Dear Whitney Farms -- My vegetable garden is situated under the branches of my neighbors oaktree. it is not shaded, but it does drop a great deal of aphids into myyard the infestation usually begin just about the time my tomatoes andpeppers are ready to set fruit, and is disastrous. what can I do toprevent this from happening again. I am an organic gardener, but lastyear I had to resort to other methods to save my crop any suggestionswould be helpful. This is not an easy one. Anytime the pest problem crosses neighborhoodboundaries it makes solving the problem a bit more difficult. Here are my ideas:1) The obvious answer--move the garden. I realize that forconsiderations of light, etc. that might not be an option. 2) Talk to your neighbor and explain the problem. I would offer tocontrol it myself--as opposed to making it your neighbors problem. Youcould spray the tree with a good sharp stream of water and blast theaphids off--unless they are in the winged stage or actually land on yourplants, it is unlikely that they will find there way by foot into yourgarden as they are not very mobile. You could also hit the tree with aSafer's Soap Solution (an organic control) or use a solution of SunsprayHorticultural Oil (approved for use by most of the Organic CertifyingGroups), or use a product containing Neem--also organic--though I am notsure it has vegetable registration yet. This would at least help toreduce the population in the tree above your garden, and give yourplants a head start. The soap is an excellent control to use in thevegetable garden too. (A lot of people are convinced it doesn't work,but if you understand how it works--on contact--and use it early in theday so it can stay wet on the pests as long as possible it is veryeffective and very safe.) Aphids are very easy to control organically,so I am surprised that you "had to resort to other methods." 3) You could also try some releases of beneficial insects in the areaas well. You can order green lacewings by mail and release them intothe garden near the oak tree. Provided your neighbor doesn't spray thetree (and I don't get the impression he does) these voracious littlecreatures will make a feast of the aphids. I have friends who areorganic farmers and very successfully control aphids with thesepredators. I have also spoken to a person who manages the pest controlof a state university grounds and uses the lacewings very successfullyto control aphids in trees on the grounds. Ladybugs will eat aphids,but often are not as effective as the lacewings--so most expertsrecommend the latter. Dear Whitney Farms -- My zucchini squash plants have white spots on the leaves that look likemildew. What is it? Can I get rid of it using household products? To answer your question, it does indeed sound like powdery mildew. Are thetops of the leaves covered in a white powdery growth? Do areas of theleaves turn brown and dry? Does it affect older leaves first then theyounger leaves? Do leaves become cupped and show silvery undersides? Doesthe powdery growth attack the fruit? Answered yes to some or most of these?Yes, you do have mildew on your squash. How to control it?In general the best approach is to select varieties that are resistant topowdery mildew. At the very least, if you find one variety to beparticularly susceptible, I would suggest you avoid planting it and try anew variety of zucchini. There are a number of cultural practices you can use to limit the incidenceof the fungus. 1) Plant in unshaded areas as much as possible. 2)Provide enough water and avoid excess fertilizer. (Here comes a plug fororganics--unlike most synthetic fertilizers which are typically comprised ofvery soluble forms of nitrogen--they are readily available, organicfertilizers tend to be slow release, which means more natural growth. Mostplants have a natural ability to resist disease and insect attacks.Synthetic fertilizers often 'push' the plant causing them to grow too fastand become susceptible to attack. Using organic fertilizers allows theplant to grow at a more natural rate, and often results in better resistanceto disease. You will find the plants to be just a productive.) 3) Sincespores are often killed or suppressed in the presence of free moistureplantings with overhead sprinklers or with frequent water sprays may have areduced incidence of powdery mildew. 4) Rotate your plantings from year toyear. 5) Clean up and destroy any infested plant material. Do not use itin your compost. 6) Use lots of compost-it often helps to enhance thepresence of naturally occurring antibiotics, etc. in your garden. From time to time it may be necessary to use fungicides. Organically, youcould try Safer's Garden Fungicide--a formulation containing sulfur (checkthe label to be sure that squash are listed.) Timing is everything. Do notuse sulfur sprays on days when the temperature is expected to exceed 90degrees. My sources caution that some varieties of squash may be sulfursensitive so you may want to try it on part of a plant rather that the wholething. Remember, sulfur works to prevent the disease, not to cure it. Besure to apply it before you see and outbreak of powdery mildew. In the last couple of years, there has been a lot of work done looking atusing a baking soda solution to control mildew and black spot on roses. Theformula for roses is 3 tsps. baking soda and 1 TBS. HorticulturalOil--Sunspray seems to be the best--in a gallon of water. Spray to preventthe disease. Please remember--this is not an official recommendation!!Technically, we are not allowed by law in the industry to makerecommendations that do no appear on the product label. But you wanted toknow about household products... The non organic control would be to use a product containing a fungicidecalled chlorothalonil. Spray according to the directions on the label at 7day intervals. (You will find this as Orthos' Daconil Multi-PurposeFungicide.)

If they don'tget the message the first time, they certainly do by thesecond...Obviously, keep off of your plants, etc. BUT...I recently read an abstract of a study done in the midwest lookingat the benefits of mice and ants in no-till cornfields. Did you knowthat ants ate 95% of the weed seed in the study area!!!!!!! Are yousure you want to get rid of these ladies? Ants are after all, as oneentomologist friend of mine likes to say, mother nature's little garbageladies! So unless they are actually doing harm to the plants, likefarming aphids, you might think twice about killing them all, 'causethey just might be doing you a big favor in the meantime..... Hope you will look for our products in your area!! You'll find us atlocal nureries (Mitchels; fertilizers at Wasatch; Western GardenCenters; Mill Creek; and of course Fred Meyer). Massachusetts I have a flower garden and the main problem I have is that a hedgehog keeps eating the flowers. What can I do to prevent the hedgehog from feasting onmy flowers? The only experience I have with gardening in New England is the summersspent as a child in my grand fathers garden in Pittsfield, MA. I can'trecall hedgehogs being a problem for him....Out here on the West Coast,no hedge hogs. But somewhere in the recesses of my mind I recallreading about coping with these guys in a garden setting, and if mymemory serves I believe the recommendation was a fence much as you wouldbuild to keep out rabbits. Not the simplest solution, I realize... You might consider a trip to the library and a check of theperiodicals--I have a recollection of the article appearing in eitherHorticulture or Organic Gardening. Northport LI Dear Whitney Farms-- Any suggestions for squirrels eating bulbs and taking off the flower heads just as they start to open. I had heard that their is sosolution that you can soak the bulbs (tulips in particular) beforeplanting. I haven't heard of a solution for treating bulbs, so I am afraid that Ican't help you there. Standard recommendations include fences, cages orscreens; traps; repellents; and poison baits. Not a very creative setof alternatives...I'll keep your query and should I here of anythingelse I'll forward it to you. I wonder if one of those plastic owl "predators" strategically placedbetween the squirrels and your garden would help? Nashville, TN Dear Whitney Farms-- My tomato plants are being eaten by something leaving tiny holes in theleaves. I have basil and marigolds interspersed with the plants to keepaway critters, but its not working with these. What can I use that's notpoison? Sounds to me like flea beetle damage to me. Symptoms look like someoneshot your tomatoes with a shotgun. Leaves are riddled with little holesabout 1/8 inch in diameter. If you look closely, you may see tinylittle black beetles around 1/16th of an inch that jump like fleas whendisturbed--in fact it often makes it hard to see them. If they are attacking seedlings, one suggestion would be to provide themwith protection until they are old enough to out grow the attack.Usually, flea beetle damage is the worst on seedlings and once plantsget older they may remain present but limit their damage to older leaveslower on the plant with less effect on the host plant. There are a number of fabrics available that would work. Look for "spunbonded polyesters" (Reemay). Look for lightweight fabrics called"floating row covers," not "frost blanket" materials which are quite abit heavier. While these fabrics are designed to "float" on the plantsas they grow, for use around tomatoes I would suggest building a supportstructure. It can be as simple as plastic or wire hoops with the fabricdraped over it and held down securely. Use the row covers while the plants are young. Once the plants getlarge enough to tolerate some damage, remove the covers. The thing towatch for is the temperature under the covers getting too hot. Withforecasts in your area in the eighties this week, some covers couldraise the temperature to lethal levels; spunbonded floating fabrics areusually sheer enough to allow enough air movement through them that theydo not reach temperatures harmful to warm season crops like tomatoes.Remove them before they interfere with the plants vertical growth.Usually by the time the plants have more than six true leaves and aregrowing vigorously they will out grow the flea bettle damage. A friend of mine once trapped the beetles on young cabbage plants bygetting a gallon bottle of apple juice--the big old fashioned jugtype--and carefully removing the bottom of the bottle (quite a feat!).He then coated the inside of the bottle with a sticky material calledTanglefoot. He would go from plant to plant, quickly covering them withthe bottle. The beetles would jump from the plant and get stuck in theTanglefoot. He did this once or twice a day while the seedlings weresusceptible. It was labor intensive, but we were able to save the cropof cabbage. If the seedlings are severely damaged, you have few choices. One wouldbe to replant and protect the new plants as outlined above, anotherwould be to spray pesticides containing either pyrethrum or rotenone.Both of these products are approved for use by organic farmers, but theyare pesticides and should be handled with care and used according to thelabel. Some rotenone products are combined with insecticidal soaps andthese have been reported to have been particularly effective. Finally, be sure to till any corp residues or into the soil next fall.The flea beetles over winter in debris and weeds. Tilling them underwill help to reduce the population next spring. Zone 6 - Western PA Dear Whitney Farms -- Our lawn is seriously infected with grubs (Japanese Beetle). Is there an organic solution to eliminating these pests? I have read about "Milky Spores" and "Nematodes". I cannot locate any reseller of the "Milky Spore" products and I am unaware of howorganic/effective "Nematodes" are. Please HELP! The beetles have defoliated me by August. One thing I really like about being a gardener/citizen of the West--NOJAPANESE BEETLES!! (The exclamation was followed by a quick rap on theproverbial piece of wood...) I remember them from the years I spentgrowing up in Virginia and I do not miss them... Obviously, the first step is to ensure that your lawn is getting all itneeds to be healthy. Use a quality organic lawn fertilizer. Follow ourtips on the web page for a healthy lawn. As to the availability of Milky Spore it is not something I have seenavailable out here on the West Coast. But since we do not have JapaneseBeetles to contend with, it probably should not come as a surprise. Iwould suggest getting in touch with the folks at OrganicGardening/Rodale Press. I am certain they could help you find theproduct. You also might try "Gardens Alive!". They are out of themidwest and I get there catalog from time to time--but I just recycledall of my old catalogs! so I don't have an address for them to give you.Once again, the folks at Organic Gardening could probably help you withthat. Here are some other phone numbers of folk's who supply beneficialinsects, etc.: Worms Way--800-274-9676Peaceful Valley Farm Supply--916-272-4769Arbico--800-827-2847 ext. OG596 I know the first two companies and would recommend them highly. WormsWay is based in the Eastern US, and would be the first place to check.Peaceful Valley is in California, but they do supply a lot oforganic growers and might have some info on the availability of MilkySpore. As to the predatory nematodes. They work!! I have used themsuccessfully to control root maggots on broccoli and cabbage. We use ithere in the Pacific North West to control root weevil larvae onrhododendrons with great success--it's even recommended by the OregonState Extension Service. I know that it is widely used to great effecton "grubs" in the lawn, and I know that it is labeled specifically forJapanese Beetle larvae. I have seen a video of how these guys 'work'and it is very nasty!! I would hate to be a beetle larvae and getattacked by these nematodes--the result is not pretty, for the grub...They are also very effective for controlling fleas. I would feel very confident recommending them to you. The most widelyavailable brand is Biosafe. It should be easy to find. (As to the"organic" nature--the nematodes themselves are definitely 100% approvedfor organic control by all of the major certifying organizations in theUS. The Biosafe brand does have a preservative and so it falls into agray area; there are pure strains available. (Worms Way and PeacefulValley will probably have those for you...) The trick to using it is ensuring that your soil temperature is highenough for the nematode to survive. About 55 degrees F. For a severeinfestation, it might require a couple of applications over a couple ofyears, and you will never completely eradictae the beetles. But you cancontrol them. Check with your local Extension Service to find out whenthe grubs are likely to be feeding/active in the soil and treat at thattime. Massachusetts coast Dear Whitney Farms -- Are there any organic solutions for birch leaf miner? I was not able to find any information on birch leaf minersspecifically. Here are some general guidelines: 1) Because most leaf miners feed only on leaves, plants can usuallytolerate substantial mining without loss (the particular reference wasto fruit trees and crop yields--but I think the point is important--if afruit tree will be largely unaffected by leaf miners, then it is fairlysafe to assume that the birch will not be dramatically impacted by thepresence of the pest.) 2) Leaf miners are often kept under control by natural enemies,including parasitic wasps. 3) Leaf miner outbreaks often follow insecticide sprays for otherpests. So, my suggestions would be to check with the local extension service tosee if they know if anyone is supplying predatory wasps in your area thatwill attack the leaf miner. It has been reported that they willactually attack the leaf miner through the leaf tissue. If theinfestation is bad enough, you may actually have a population ofbeneficials hard at work getting things under control. DON'T use abroad spectrum insecticide! It will not only kill the leaf miners, butalso all the beneficial insects in, under, or around the tree. In alllikelihood, the leaf miners will return and the predators will not bearound to slow the spread--the problem only gets worse. Any number ofpredators may be out there controlling the leaf miners, these include:green lacewings and spiders (control eggs and adults) or other naturalenemies like ants, true bugs, some species of flies and birds. I know that when the larvae is ready to pupate it drops down into thesoil emerging 10 to 15 days later as adults. I am not certain if itwould work, but there are predatory nematodes that attack soil dwellinglarvae like grubs. You'll find these under the name Biosafe (there areother brands out there as well) at nurseries and garden centers. Ifyour extension service can give you an approximate time frame when thelarva drop to the soil, you could try an application of biosafe. I have also seen a reference to a new generation of microbially derivedinsecticides like Avid (avermectin) as effective against leaf minerswhile showing little toxicity to its parasites. It is registered for usein some vegetable and fruit crops. Generally, these new pesticidesare characterized by relatively low toxicity and specificaction--less likelihood of non target species getting wiped out too.The drawback? To my knowledge it is only available in commercial andnot retail formulations and as such it is relatively expensive. I am sorry I can not give you a specific solution, but I hope I havegiven you some insight into the concept of organic pest control. Letnature do the bulk of the work. Recognize that you can not permanentlyand totally eradicate the leaf miners, so create conditions thatencourage the presence of their natural predators. Finally, ensure thatyour trees are getting adequate moisture and nutrition so that they arebetter able to resist the attack of the insects. Zone 5 Dear Whitney Farms -- Every year I have a problem with potato bugs. I was wondering if you had an organic or environmental safe method of getting rid of thesepests. Thank you. I am not sure what pest you are referring too when you say "potato bugs."In my childhood, I remember a big brown insect we commonly called apotato bug, that to my knowledge is not a plant pest persay, though itis quite UGLY! Then there are a whole collection of insect pests whofeed on potatoes. These would include Colorado Potato Beetles, FleaBeetles, Potato Leafhoppers, European Corn Borers, Wireworms, andothers. Most of these insects can be controlled organically using pyrethrumproducts. In-"organic" controls would include diazinon or sevin. Exactinstructions vary slightly depending on the pest. If possible, a general description of the pest would help me give you amore precise answer. You could also check with your local extensionoffice for a diagnosis. If you are interested in organic controlmethods and they are unable to help you, email us again, and I will tryto give you more specific information. Dear Whitney Farms -- What can I do to get rid of grub worms? The description "grubworms" is a bit on the generic side, and you didn'tindicate where you were having trouble with them--lawn?; garden?;vegetable garden? So I will give you a general response and addresssome of the more common pests that are often called grubworms. First, there are the larvae of a number of different species of beetles.These grubs feed on the roots of the lawn and can kill the entire lawnif left untreated. Generally, the adult beetles do not damage the lawn,but they do lay eggs in the soil which hatch into voracious turf pests.Depending on the actual beetle in your yard, they lay eggs in thespring and summer (May and June Beetles) or in mid- to late-summer(Asiatic, Japanese, and masked chafer beetles). After hatching thegrubs feed on the roots in the top 1-3 inches of soil. In late fall,they move down deep into the soil to overwinter until next spring. My first choice for control would be a product called BioSafe or one ofits cousins. This is a predatory nematode that feeds on soil bornlarvae like grubs or root weevils. It is essentially harmless tohumans, but if you are a grub, it is a nasty fate to be attacked bythese guys. Once the soil in your area warms up to about 55 degreestreat with the Biosafe according to the directions. This product hasbeen shown to be effective on a wide range of pests--even fleas!! Check with your local extension service (in the Government Pages in thephone book, under state, under Agricultural Extension) for the dates inyour area when eggs are typically lain or when the grubs are likely tobe active. Treat accordingly. The nematodes will probably not survive the winter in Indiana and wouldneed to be applied again. If that fails to give adequate results, there are a number of pesticidesthat would typically be recommended to control these pests. Theyinclude diazinon or chlorpyrifos--commonly seen as Dursban. Treat justafter the eggs are laid according to the directions. The grubs willcome to the surface, usually, and die. Given the associated hazards tobirds, etc. these products would only be a last resort, in my book. There are also a group of larvae known as root weevils, often referred toas "grubs." My recommendations would be the same, try the Biosafetype products first and then graduate to harsher pesticides if controlwas unsuccessful. Typically, you could add Orthene (acephate) to thelist particularly for root weevils on Rhododendron. South Texas Dear Whitney Farms -- I live in Houston, TX. I have a shrub that has become infested with spider mites and lace bugs. The local nursery has recommended a strong chemical pesticide to get ride of the little critters. Can you recommend a more "organic" approach? I usually begin any pest control discussion with a little basicinformation about the pests. Understanding the 'enemy' is fundamentalto controlling them organically. Many mites are favored by dry weather and a warm environment withtemperatures over 70 degrees, though there are some that like coolerweather. Mites are often a problem when there are dusty conditions, orwhen plants are stressed for water. Lacebugs are also most active in warm summer weather, but are a littleharder to control than the mites. Your email did not indicate whichinsect was the bigger problem. Ironically, often the use of pesticides makes the mite problem worse.Many mite outbreaks are often caused by the use of pesticides to controlother insects. Sometimes it is just a matter of killing off thepopulations of predatory mites that keep the 'bad guys' in check. Someinsecticides will actually stimulate the reproductive process mites.According to one source, mites exposed to carbaryl (SEVIN), methylparathion, or dimethoate in the lab reproduce many times faster thanuntreated populations. Carbaryl, some organophosphates, and somepyrethroids also apparently favor mites by increasing the level ofnitrogen in the leaves--which may be what attracted them to your plantin the first place. Additionally, it is well documented thatinsecticides applied during hot weather can cause dramatic outbreaks ofmites within a few days. So, how to control them? First, I would start by ensuring that all thecultural needs of the plant are met. Is the plant getting adequatewater? Does the soil it is growing in meet its nutritional needs?Often giving the plant a good watering and then using a rich organicmulch (preferably compost based) around the plant will help keep thesoil moist and help prevent drought stress that can lead to conditionsthat favor the mites. Mulching can also help reduce the dust levelwhich removes another condition the mites prefer. Many gardeners are able to get minor infestations under control usingone of my favorite pesticides--water. In fact, there is a gentlemansomewhere in your part of the world who has developed a wandspecifically for controlling mites and aphids with a good sharp blast ofwater. Strong enough to knock the mites/aphids down without harmingthe plants. The key is to get good thorough coverage, especially on theundersides of the leaves. The principle is simple--on the one hand, theadded humidity will help suppress the mites, and on the other hand, amite knocked from your shrub to the ground will not find its way back tothe shrub--they aren't designed to cover that kind of distance. Trythis a couple of times and see what results you have. If you need more control, graduate to the insecticidal soaps--like SaferInsecticidal Soap, by Ringer. These products get a bad rap, but if usedcorrectly my experience has been that they are very effective as acontrol. The key is to use them at a time of day that allows them tostay wet as long as possible. Spray the plant thoroughly being carefulto get good coverage on the undersides of the leaf where the mites are.Spray early in the day so the soap solution stays wet as long aspossible--it kills on contact when it is wet. I am going to guess thatyou are going to set the lacebugs back with the soap solution at thesame time you spray for the mites. One note of caution, if your shrubis not listed on the soap label, test a small area first before sprayingthe entire plant. If the soap is not working, then I would graduate to the horticulturaloils. I personally prefer Sunspray Horticultural Oil--it is paraffinbased and seems to be less detrimental to the plants particularly duringperiods of warm weather. Use according to the instructions and again besure to get into the undersides of the plant. Be sure that you areusing a summer rate--some of the oils can also be used during thedormant season. One note, some lacebugs overwinter on the plant in aprotected area--those little crooks and crannies into which an insectcould crawl--be sure the spray penetrates into these areas. If the shrubis deciduous--ie. it loses its leaves in the winter--give it a thoroughdormant spraying with the oil. This helps to smother any overwinteringinsects on the plant. Other brand names will include Ortho's Volk Oilor Lilly Millers' Supreme Oil. These are specially formulated for useon plants, and when used according to the directions should not beharmful to the plant. A couple of tips, be sure the plant is wateredand is not stressed before you spray it. I have seen a lot of plantsdamaged by well meaning care takers who sprayed them when they were dryand under drought stress. Generally, you end up with one burnt plant! You might have to try one of the above techniques a couple times.Remember, organic pest control is not a "final solution"--pests are noteradicated, they are controlled. The idea is to create conditions thatallow nature to get the pest under control and reestablish the naturalsystem of checks and balances. It is not possible to completelyeliminate the pest from the environment. Better to get it under controland to a point where you can live with it rather than to use an endlesssupply of nasty pesticides in a futile quest for CLEAN plants. Very unlikely to control the mites, but possibly effective on thelacebugs is a pesticide commonly known as Neem. Available under variousformulations it is derived from the seed pod of the neem tree and actsas an insect growth regulator. To be effective, the insect must be in agrowth stage and not already a mature adult. I have not found specificreferences to the lacebug, but I would be inclined to try it. It hasbeen shown to be effective on a pretty wide range of insects. From here your options include the pyrethroids--botanically derivedinsecticides which are often approved for use by organic certifyingorganizations. These are still potent pesticides and should be usedwith caution. The advantage is that they break down very quickly in theenvironment. Again, follow the instructions on the label. If you have tried all of the methods mentioned above and are stillplagued by the pests, it might be time to go for the big guns. I alwaysadvise folks at this point to ask yourself one question. Will I have toalways use these chemicals if I am to grow this plant in my yard? Ifthe answer is yes, then do you really want or have to grow thisparticular shrub? I know it is a difficult question, but I think it isa legitimate one. There are a lot of plants out there, and there mightbe one better suited to the environmental conditions in your yardthan the one you have now. Please understand, I am not suggesting thatyou go out and tear out your favorite shrub. Just ask yourself if youare setting yourself up for an endless struggle to bend nature to yourwill--it can be a long and disappointing road. (FACT: We use morepesticides today than we have in the history of human agriculture, andyet we continue to lose almost the same amount of crops to insects as wedid prior to the introduction of pesticides...Makes you wonder...) So, the philosophical digression aside, if you have reached the pointwhere none of the low impact methods have brought you any results, thenit is time to graduate to the next level. For the mites, you do havesome reasonably low toxicity, pest specific acaricides (mite killers)available--like Avid. The trouble will be finding them in a consumerpackage--it is very expensive by the quart in the commercialformulation. My guess is, however, that the mites will be easier tocontrol than the lacebugs. If that is the case, you could useOrthene--a local systemic by Ortho--or Isotox--the latter used to beOrthene plus a miticide like Avid. I had heard rumors that Ortho wasdiscontinuing the Isotox formulation. But check your local nursery forit. With the obvious effects that carbaryl/Sevin has on the mites (seeabove)--I would not even consider using it. I hope that I have been able to answer your question. You should beable to CONTROL your pests organically. Begin with cultural changesthat will help to reduce the mite problem, and work up from there. A PS. of sorts--There are quite a few predatory mites available mailorder. Once you get things under control, you might consider releasingsome of those into your yard to reduce the chance of problems in thefuture. And finally, on a philosophical note, think about how tocorrect the conditions that brought about the problem--that is the bestlong term solution! Prescott, AZ Dear Whitney Farms -- I'm a 1st time organic gardener..formerly from PDX & Eugene.I have a huge plot with both flowers & veggies starting, what can I do to keep away aphids from my roses but notpoison myself in the process!? I have great news for you! Aphids are one of the easiest pests tocontrol organically! In fact, the biggest challenge to controlingaphids organically is the patience required to allow nature to assertits own controls over these pesky little plant pests. First a couple of things about aphids that are really cool! Did youknow that aphids bear live young? Yep, the females can actually clonethemselves--hence the incredibly quick pace with which they appear inyour garden and infest your roses. They are also what some have calledthe "cows" of the insect world, as they excrete a sweet liquid commonlycalled honeydew. This is actually harvested by ants as a food source.In fact, the ants will often help to get the aphids evenly distributedon your roses so they can get the most out of them! Finally, when thepopulation reaches a particular density, individuals with wings begin toappear so that they can migrate to your neighbors garden! (I love thisstuff--insects never cease to amaze me with all the ways they haveadapted to the world they live in!) The good news is that you do not have to get the toxics out to get theaphids under control. As a great article in the latest (May/June) issueof Organic Gardening (highly recommended to recent converts to theorganic gardening fold) notes, the first stept to getting these guysunder control is to get the ants under control. Strategies suggested inthe article include ringing your plants with coffee grounds (which wormslove by the way) to repel the ants--never heard of this before, but I amgoing to try it this spring--and if you find the nests, dousing themwith boiling water poured over the nest very slowly so it has a chanceto seep in--this I have tried and can attest to its effectiveness. Now the hard part. The aphid population will take off once they arrivein your garden, as you probably have noticed. Provided you havecontrolled the ants--who defend their insect nectariesferociously--mother natures' natural aphid predators will move in andmake a quick meal of the aphids. If you'd like, you can give your roses a blast with a good sharp streamof water. Obviously not a technique to use when they are blooming, itis however very effective. Aphids are not the most mobile creatures,and once knocked to the ground, will not find their way back to thetender new tips of your roses. In fact, I would imagine that in the hotsummer days of Pheonix they will whither and die quite quickly. Thewater will also be appreciated by the roses, and the increased humiditycan help to prevent mites. I would suggest giving your roses their bathin the morning, so the foliage can dry off as the day warms up. Please,exercise caution--don't get so carried away with the desire to rid yourplants of the aphids that you blast them into oblivion. Use just enoughpressure to knock the little aphids off the plants and to the ground.Also, don't get carried away trying to get every last aphid. The ideais to get the population in check while you wait for the reinforcements. If you are patient, and resist the impulse to SPRAY pesticides, you willget to witness one of the great dramas of nature--predation. All kindsof insects eat aphids--ladybugs, green lacewings, hover fly's, andothers--and some wasps actually lay their eggs in the aphids creatinglittle aphid mummys. (Take a look with your hand lense or magnifyingglass, and you will see little brown aphid domes with tiny little holesin them where the wasp crawled out of the aphid.) Unfortunately, all too often folks get the malathion out and give theaphids a good spraying not realizing that at the same time, they arekilling all the natural predators of the aphids. This often leads tomuch worse infestations because the natural check on the aphids has beenwiped out! You can even introduce your own beneficials. Lady bugs are OK, but thereal killers are green lacewings. These suckers eat aphids like sushi!A couple of green lacewings will wipe out 100s of aphids in a shorttime. And all you have to do is sit back and watch. If mother nature is slow to respond, you can intervene with some fairlysafe products. Look for Safer's Insecticidal Soap. Unlike the liquidivory under the kitchen sink, this is a product derived from naturalfatty acids that has been formulated to control insect pests on plantsand tested extensively on a wide range of plants. It is virtually nontoxic to us--watch the eyes, follow the label, etc. A couple of pointsabout getting the most out of it. 1) It only kills on contact while itis wet. So be sure to apply it early in the morning so that it can staywet as long as possible. 2) Its effectiveness can be reduced by hardwater, so you might have to adjust for that. But it works--if you useit correctly!! A last resort if things get really out of hand would be the family of"botanical" insecticides used by organic gardeners pyrethrum, rotenone orsabadilla. Seriously though, you shouldn't need to use these. I findthat if I am just patient, the birds and insect predators clean theaphids off my roses (in Stumptown/aka the City of Roses/aka Portland,OR). Typically, I see the aphids have arrived; tell myself to bepatient; finally decide its time to get the soap out and blast thesuckers; get up early in the morning; mix the spray solution, and headout to do battle only to find that there is not an aphid in sight! Uponclose examination, I find the culprit--the overstuffed lady bug larvaresting in the morning sun. EGAD!! Stop me before I spray again! Hope I gave you some inspiration to resist the temptation to get thechemical nasties out! DON'T DO IT! But I would check your localnewsstand for the latest issue of Organic Gardening! You can read up onthe pests and their predators, and rest a little easier knowing that youhave mother nature in your corner. She is one heck of an ally!! On March 14, you wrote asking about diseases and pests on Cornus sp.(Dogwood). Here are some common diseases of Cornus sp.: Dogwood Anthracnose (Gloeosporium sp.) Phytophthora Powdery Mildew (Phyllactina corylea) Botryisphaeria ribis Common insect pests of Cornus sp. include: Dogwood borer (Synanthedon scitula) Leafhoppers This is not a comprehensive list, just the most common pests associated withdogwoods. Dear Whitney Farms -- What ever happened to a product called BlackLeaf 40? I believe it was a tobacco extract. Itwas the only pesticide I ever used and I didn'teven use it as pest (killer). I sprayed only smallareas of newly planted, very tender seedlings justto keep the "pests" at bay until the seedlings gotgoing. In an organic light, how would you rate theefficacy of tobacco extracts as pesticides? I checked with a couple of buyers at retail nurseries on the west coast andthey said that they had not seen it available for some time. The questionis, was it removed from sale in all states by the EPA or just from thestates with more stringent regulations like California. Another possibilityis that the registration expired and the manufacturer did not want toreregister the product due to costs associated with the process and the verylow sales volume for the item (I used to sell Black Leaf 40 at a very large,high volume independent nursery in Santa Cruz, CA and it was one of theslowest items I had--and we were the largest dealer in Safers' Soap--so itwasn't for lack of organically minded customers.) Both buyers (one inOregon and one in California) thought that you could probably find somefloating around, though that would depend on how long (and if) it had beenoff of the market. (In fact, while checking some numbers for the secondpart of this answer, I found no manufacturer listed for the United States) As to your question about efficacy, that is the one concern I had when Iused to handle the product. It may be too effective! It is an extremelytoxic substance with an oral LD50 (the lethal dose to kill 50% of a giventest population) of only 50 mg/kg. In fact, the lethal dose for a human isonly 50 mg--the equivalent of the nicotine contained in two cigarettes (It'sa good thing most of the nicotine is destroyed by burning!) To put thatinto perspective, the oral LD50 for Diazinon is 66, Malathion 885! Thepoint being, that because something falls into the organic family bydefinition it is not necessarily less toxic or less dangerous. (Pyrethrin'sLD50 is 200, rotenone 60) It also has a fairly high dermal toxicity. This is not to say that it did not work! In my experience it was veryeffective! Just use it with caution!! Follow the precautions on the labeland wear protective gear! Respirator, goggles, protective clothing at theminimum.

Area Dear Whitney Farms-- I am looking for very low maintenance flowers to plant around the house. The flower beds are only about 2 ft. by 8 ft. Direct sunlight is about 35 - 40%. I prefer large flowers but any info you can give will be much appreciated. "The question was: very low maintenance, beds 2' by 8', 35-40%light, prefer large flowers. Lots of missing information; without a description of what's surroundingthe beds, hard to know how big plants can really be - if at allpossible, the gardener should consider widening beds. Don't know which % of light - is this all day dappled?Hot all afternoon? Some morning, some afternoon? I assume less than allday sun, but 35% direct. All these plants should handle that. As for large, a large look is going to come with the combinations, asopposed to what any individual plant will give. Peonies are the biggestflowers & foliage, but don't bloom for long. Nice leaves & fall color,though. Peonies are nearly no work - just a cage when the new growth is startingto come up, and cut away the old before the new gets tangled in it.(Leaving old foliage is helpful to protecting crowns in harsh winters.)They can handle less than all day sun, get floppier but still bloom inpart shade. A definite recommend. Roses do indeed come hardy enough for the area, and for length of bloom,one might not be too much work. In such a small area, best to send oneup! A trellis over a bed, arching w/real shade plants like bleedinghearts & ferns beneath will give months of color for a few minutes ofpruning & feeding in spring. (I assume the garden will get at least somewater.) The Canadians have been doing lots of work w/roses(etc), and theExplorer series is very hardy. There are some old roses hardy enough foran old fashioned look - Konigin von Danemark is very fragrant, pure pinkw/quartered blooms, blooms in summer; Stanwell Perpetual is a delicatewhite double, flushed w/pink, & very fragrant. Therese Bugnet is dusky pink, tall, extremely hardy, blooms late springwith light repeat bloom until frost. William Baffin is a newer rose, atall pillar, and neon pink for a stronger look. Spiraeas are very popular in the midwest because of their sturdiness -later blooming varieties like Spiraea japonica 'Little Princess', or thestrongly colored foliage varieties like Spiraea bumalda 'Goldmound'(both abt 24"-30" tall) would be very simple to prune - just a lightspringtime shearing to neaten them up is all that's needed. (Earlierblooming ones should receive a thinning type pruning -usually thought tobe "difficult") (It doesn't hurt to cut out old wood on the later ones,either.) They don't fit the criteria for larger flowers - but the coloredfoliage ones will be very helpful in combination for a "large" look,esp. if the gardener uses some of the colored Berberis thunbergii, like'Crimson Pygmy' or 'Aurea'. Golden foliage is positively gorgeous inpart shade, glowing chartreuse. Crimson Pygmy will be most red in areasw/at least some strong light. Weigelas, like spireas, are frequently used midwestern plants. Theybloom for weeks, come in dwarf varieties (Minuet, Red Prince) attracthummingbirds, and require nothing in Portland, as long as the rain hitsthem periodically. They do best w/occasional (once every few yrs)pruning of old wood. Unfortunately, dwarf weigelas are truly stumpy, andreally ought to be combined with something -columbines, daylilies,anything. Very hardy deciduous azaleas - the Lights series - fragrant, trulysturdy. Train up! by removing lower branches as they becomeestablished, and underplant with woodland goodies, or a quiet, serene,green groundcover. (They will not stay 2'wide.) Potentillas are like spiraeas & weigelas - the midwestern rhodie. Veryvery easy -shear when shaggy. Some have blooms to 2"across, and theybloom all summer in waves, like the roses they're related to. (So areSpiraeas.) They will need 35% of direct, not dappled sun, and happy toget more. I definitely recommend at least some space being given to daylilies,iris, asters, forget-me-nots, and annuals, including calendulas. Theforget-me-nots are easier to clean than to type their name - when doneblooming, pull them out. They will leave seeds behind, as long as you'renot too quick, and the new young plants will germinate and take care ofthemselves. Iris should be sheared when foliage is crummy. Hmmm. Somefertilizer....(Bob, I think she is implying that this is the commercialpart of the answer...) These plants will make a very simple garden, but one that I think couldlook very nice. It'll all look better if the gardener can give theplants a backing of green - yew? holly? Both would suit the situation,can be sheared, & have dwarf forms, if the room can be found." N.E. Alabama Dear Whitney Farms-- I recently moved to N. Al. from Fl. I *Love* to grow roses. I used adilute garlic spray on the roses and a banana compostin Florida,...it doesn't seem to be working as well up here in Al.Any advice on organic pest control and fert. in this area?? Here are some general thoughts vis a vis rose care in your area (also besure to check out the second issue of our newsletter 'The Dirt'. It isavailable on line at our website and talks about planting roses) Roses generally prefer a cool, moist, slightly acid soil. I would checkthe pH of your soil first. If it is in the 6's don't worry about it.If it is above pH 7 or below pH 6, then adjust it accordingly with limeto raise the pH or sulfur to lower it. Make a practice of adding lots of high quality compost to the rosegarden. Well rotted cow or steer manure is a great choice. If yoursoil is acidic, aged mushroom compost is excellent for roses as it bothhelps to sweeten the soil and it adds valuable potash to the soil. Ifyou make your own compost, by all means apply that. Work it into thesoil around the plants taking care not to damage the roots. Your roses will also benefit from a good mulching. Any of the materialsabove would be ideal for use as a mulch around the plants. Apply themulch early in the season before the sun gets hot and warms the soil.This will help to keep the soil cooler as well as preserving moisture.Use about 2 inches of mulch around the plant, but keep it away fromdirect contact with the crown of the plant. I like to leave a smallarea free of mulch right around the base of the plant itself. Inaddition to providing the cool soil temperatures in which roses growbest, mulches will also help to control weeds. At the end of the yearit can be worked into the soil--if the earthworms in your yard haven'talready moved it under ground for you. Be sure to keep them well watered. As you probably know from your daysin Florida, roses are a thirsty lot and like a regular supply of water. I like to stick my finger down into the ground as far as I can. If thesoil is not cool and moist a couple of inches down, the plants wouldprobably benefit from a good soaking. I prefer to use a soaker hose, ifpractical, for watering roses. The hoses that weep--brands likeMoisture Master--are ideal because they will gradually soak the rootzone over a couple of hours without getting the foliage wet. Remember,if the mulch dries out you will have to give some extra water to ensurethat the soil down deep gets good and wet. That's a nice benefit ofusing the soaker hoses--you can bury them under the mulch. As to suggestions for organic fertilizers, I can tell you that AlfalfaMeal comes highly recommended for roses. Rich in natural growthstimulants it has been reported to give "greener leaves and strongerstems" within a week or two of application. Also, Greensand has beenused by a number of rose enthusiasts in our area and has gotten ravereviews from them. It supplies valuable potassium as well as traceminerals. I recently heard the assistant horticultural director of the NationalArboretum in Washington DC recommend using a foliar spray of liquid fishand sea weed. She said they have been using it a the garden and areamazed by the results! Some of the healthiest roses she has ever seen!A recent article in the New York times reported that the NationalArboretum is also feeding the roses aged chicken manure (make sure it isreally well aged and use it sparingly as it can burn). Be sure to feed them some Bone Meal or Rock Phosphate a couple of timesa year as well. Most blooming plant will benefit from the extraphosphorous they provide. Another great fertilizer to use on roses isSul-Po-Mag. Use it instead of Epsom salts. It provides all the sulfurand magnesium one would get from the Epsom salts but in a longer lastingform, and it provides potassium! For pest control, I am intrigued by a new product form a company calledGreenlight. They have just introduced a product called Rose Defense.Derived from a naturally occurring insecticide called Neem, it not onlycontrols insects but is also labeled for powdery mildew and black spot!!To my knowledge Neem is approved for use to control pest organically onornamental plants and I believe will soon receive EPA approval forvegetables. It might be one to try especially if you are plagued withJapanese Beetles. Below is an answer I wrote to another visitor to our web site aboutcontrolling aphids on her roses: "I have great news for you! Aphids are one of the easiest pests tocontrol organically! In fact, the biggest challenge to controlingaphids organically is the patience required to allow nature to assertits own controls over these pesky little plant pests. First a couple of things about aphids that are really cool! Did youknow that aphids bear live young? Yep, the females can actually clonethemselves--hence the incredibly quick pace with which they appear inyour garden and infest your roses. They are also what some have calledthe "cows" of the insect world, as they excrete a sweet liquid commonlycalled honeydew. This is actually harvested by ants as a food source.In fact, the ants will often help to get the aphids evenly distributedon your roses so they can get the most out of them! Finally, when thepopulation reaches a particular density, individuals with wings begin toappear so that they can migrate to your neighbors garden! (I love thisstuff--insects never cease to amaze me with all the ways they haveadapted to the world they live in!) The good news is that you do not have to get the toxics out to get theaphids under control. As a great article in the latest (May/June) issueof Organic Gardening (highly recommended to recent converts to theorganic gardening fold) notes, the first step to getting these guysunder control is to get the ants under control. Strategies suggested inthe article include ringing your plants with coffee grounds (which wormslove by the way) to repel the ants--never heard of this before, but I amgoing to try it this spring--and if you find the nests, dousing themwith boiling water poured over the nest very slowly so it has a chanceto seep in--this I have tried and can attest to its effectiveness. Now the hard part. The aphid population will take off once they arrivein your garden, as you probably have noticed. Provided you havecontrolled the ants--who defend their insect nectariesferociously--mother natures' natural aphid predators will move in andmake a quick meal of the aphids. If you'd like, you can give your roses a blast with a good sharp streamof water. Obviously not a technique to use when they are blooming, itis however very effective. Aphids are not the most mobile creatures,and once knocked to the ground, will not find their way back to thetender new tips of your roses. In fact, I would imagine that in the hotsummer days of Phoenix they will whither and die quite quickly. Thewater will also be appreciated by the roses, and the increased humiditycan help to prevent mites. I would suggest giving your roses their bathin the morning, so the foliage can dry off as the day warms up. Please,exercise caution--don't get so carried away with the desire to rid yourplants of the aphids that you blast them into oblivion. Use just enoughpressure to knock the little aphids off the plants and to the ground.Also, don't get carried away trying to get every last aphid. The ideais to get the population in check while you wait for the reinforcements. If you are patient, and resist the impulse to SPRAY pesticides, you willget to witness one of the great dramas of nature--predation. All kindsof insects eat aphids--ladybugs, green lacewings, hover flies, andothers--and some wasps actually lay their eggs in the aphids creatinglittle aphid mummys. (Take a look with your hand lens or magnifyingglass, and you will see little brown aphid domes with tiny little holesin them where the wasp crawled out of the aphid.) Unfortunately, all too often folks get the malathion out and give theaphids a good spraying not realizing that at the same time, they arekilling all the natural predators of the aphids. This often leads tomuch worse infestations because the natural check on the aphids has beenwiped out! You can even introduce your own beneficials. Lady bugs are OK, but thereal killers are green lacewings. These suckers eat aphids like sushi!A couple of green lacewings will wipe out 100s of aphids in a shorttime. And all you have to do is sit back and watch. If mother nature is slow to respond, you can intervene with some fairlysafe products. Look for Safer's Insecticidal Soap. Unlike the liquidivory under the kitchen sink, this is a product derived from naturalfatty acids that has been formulated to control insect pests on plantsand tested extensively on a wide range of plants. It is virtually nontoxic to us--watch the eyes, follow the label, etc. A couple of pointsabout getting the most out of it. 1) It only kills on contact while itis wet. So be sure to apply it early in the morning so that it can staywet as long as possible. 2) Its effectiveness can be reduced by hardwater, so you might have to adjust for that. But it works--if you useit correctly!! A last resort if things get really out of hand would be the family of"botanical" insectides used by organic gardeners pyrethrum, rotenone orsabadilla. Seriously though, you shouldn't need to use these. I findthat if I am just patient, the birds and insect predators clean theaphids off my roses (in Stumptown/aka the City of Roses/aka Portland,OR). Typically, I see the aphids have arrived; tell myself to bepatient; finally decide its time to get the soap out and blast thesuckers; get up early in the morning; mix the spray solution, and headout to do battle only to find that there is not an aphid in sight! Uponclose examination, I find the culprit--the overstuffed lady bug larvaresting in the morning sun. EGAD!! Stop me before I spray again! Hope I gave you some inspiration to resist the temptation to get thechemical nasties out! DON'T DO IT! But I would check your localnewsstand for the latest issue of Organic Gardening! You can read up onthe pests and their predators, and rest a little easier knowing that youhave mother nature in your corner. She is one heck of an ally!!" Everett, WA Dear Whitney Farms-- How do you take care of Ranunculus once it is done blooming? How do you ensure that it will come back year after year? Ranunculus will naturalize in our climate in the northwest; they justwon't survive our winters in the ground. You can save your tubers fromyear to year and propagate them by dividing them--that way the colorsremain true. After the blooms fade keep the plants well fed (I prefer our WhitneyFarms Bulb Food--it tends to last longer than most of the other productsand is less likely to be washed away by our wet weather here in the PNW)and watered and allow them to mature naturally. Sometime in mid to latesummer you will see the foliage begin to whither or 'ripen.' At thatpoint, lift them carefully, cut off the tops, clean them gently andstore in a cool dry place until next spring. Plant after any danger offrost has passed in rich well drained soil. The reason to let them 'ripen' is to ensure that you give the tuberplenty of time to grow and store nutrients before it goes dormant. zone 3 Dear Whitney Farms-- When the flowers on violas shrivel up should I pluck them off? What should I use that is around my house to kill the bugs that eatmy coelus? It certainly would not hurt the violas to remove the spent blooms."Deadheading" as it is known is a great way to keep annuals and otherflowering plants blooming longer (as the plant sets seed, it usuallystops or greatly reduces flower production to favor seed production). As to the pests on your coleus, I would look for the least toxicalternatives. If the pests are mealybugs, for example, a safari with analcohol dipped q-tip works really well, and is satisfying in a bestialsort of way...In the arena of sprays, it is hard to make arecommendation without knowing what the specific pest is, but mypersonal choice would be to start with the least toxic alternatives theinsecticidal soaps. Safer's is the most common brand in the market. Besure to check that coleus is listed on the label. Next would be thepyrethrum based insect sprays for houseplants. From there your into thereal strong stuff... Dear Whitney Farms-- I have gorgeous wysterias growing in my yard but they never bloom. I have tried pruning strategies, etc. but nothing seems to work.Any suggestions? I recently heard a piece on NPR's Talk of The Nation where the Presidentof the American Horticultural Society described an elderly neighbor whohad waited decades to celebrate the first bloom of her wisteria--whichgrew to cover an enormous area before finally pausing to flower... I don't think the future is as bleak as this story might make it seem.You didn't indicate how old the Wisteria vines were. It is not unheardof for young plants to take 4 or 5 years to bloom. Sometimes patienceis all that it takes... On the other hand there are a few things you can do to "encourage" thevines to bloom: 1) Don't feed the vines. At the very least, don't give them anyfertilizers with high levels of nitrogen. In fact it is oftenrecommended to with hold nitrogen for entire seasons in order toinduce blooming. Nitrogen encourages the green growth in plants and Idon't think you want any more of that...If you would like you could tryfeeding with more of a "bloom" formula. The classic synthetic versionwould be an 0-10-10, or something like Peter's Root & Bloom (5-50-17).From the world of organic fertilizers a blend of rock phosphate andgreensand would approximate a 0-10-10 type product, though quite a bitmore long term. I think this is OK in your case though. 2) Being stingy with the water can help too. Don't kill the plant--alittle well managed stress is what we're talking about here. Don'twater it as often as you might. If you have regular summer rains I might notgive any extra water at all. Again, don't kill the plant, just stressit. 3) Another trick you can try is root pruning. I remember an article in Horticulture years ago that even talked about exposing roots andbeating on them with a hammer...That might be a bit extreme. A lessdramatic technique is to go around the plant with a spade an cutvertically into the plants root zone. Don't get carried away and tooclose to the crown--you could potentially kill the plant. Look at theplant, determine where the drip line is (the limit of the leaves) andwork around the interior of the plant within the drip line. Again, theconcept is stress; it often will induce a plant to bloom. Wait untilyou are sure that the plant will not bloom for the year. So those would be my suggestions. I would start with numbers one andtwo this year. If you still have no blooms next year, try number three. Dear Whitney Farms -- I enjoyed your article very much.. I have a question for you, my next door neighbor, who is 90 + in age saw me planting gladiolas and lilies. She bugged me till I had to put in the hole 2 tablespoon Bone Meal, 1 tablespoon of Cow manure and 4 tablespoon of Peat Moss mix well for each bulb. Have you heard of this formula for bulb planting? Would love to hear your opinion on this subject.. Sounds like a great recipe for success!! The only thing I would dodifferently is to prepare the entire area using your neighborsformula--and a bit more steer manure--rather than just the tiny littleholes! Might as well give those roots some room (and reason) to grow! San Francisco Dear Whitney Farms -- I would like to know what organic methods I could use to combat rust, mildew and earwigs in my rose garden. Controlling the problems you asked about begins with good culture forthe roses. Be sure that you have a rich, slightly acid soil with lotsof good compost in it. Mushroom Compost (provided it is well aged) isparticularly well suited to roses and one of the secrets of some of thebeautiful rose gardens in England. Roses also like a cool moist soil togrow in. If you haven't already, I would encourage you to mulch yourroses with a good compost (like mushroom or your own) or a product likeour Garden Mulch. Mulching now will help keep the soil cooler andmoist, as well as suppressing weeds under the roses. Also give yourroses a good feeding from time to time. Given that this is a commercialweb site, I am confident you will not be surprised to hear me recommendsome of our products. We make a high performance all natural organicRose & Flower Food which provides your roses with an excellent source oflong lasting fertilizers. I also would encourage you to think about feeding your roses someAlfalfa Meal (it's an ingredient of our rose food). In the January 1993issue of the American Rose Society magazine it was recommended with"stronger stems and greener leaves" visible within a week ofapplication. Also, one sales rep. for a large rose nursery triedGreensand on his roses last year and reported amazing results to us. Heis now convinced that it is a miracle product for use on roses. Resultswere comparable to alfalfa and yet he felt that it did better than thealfalfa. Finally, last week on National Public Radio's May 1 Talk of the Nation Iheard the assistant director of the National Botanic Garden recommendand rave about the benefits of using a liquid fish and kelp spray on theroses in the NBG. (See our Ellie's Ultimate Plant Food) One of thepoints she made was that they had a lower incidence of disease andinsect problems in the garden as a result of regular applications of afish and kelp product. I have seen a large body of evidence showingthat foliar applications of seaweed sprays do help prevent diseases. So that's step one. Be sure your roses have all the good things theyneed and like to thrive. (Check our last issue of The Dirt for some moretips on growing roses.) Timely pruning is helpful as well. Be sure to remove any dead, damagedor diseased wood, and prune to open up the bush. Mildew in particularcan be suppressed if air circulation is increased. Good sanitation is inherent to controlling both rust and mildew. Cleanup any affected leaves and remove them from the garden. Destroy them,do not compost them. Also, using dormant sprays in the winter can helpto kill any fungal spores that might be overwintering on the plant. Youcan use a lime sulfur product when the plant is dormant at therecommended rate. If you apply an oil spray at the same time (the labelfor the lime sulfur should have instructions for combination sprays) itwill also help to kill overwintering insects or their eggs which mightbe on the plant. I would also encourage you to be careful when you water. Avoidsplashing soil onto the leaves as this can transmit fungal spores to theplant. Similarly, it is advisable to water early in the day so that theplant can dry off long before the evening. The new soaker hoses thatslowly weep water down their length are ideal for getting water to theroses without getting them wet. Now living in the Bay Area, as you do, you live in a climate conduciveto these two fungi. Powdery mildew is favored by warm days, cool nightsand low light intensities. Rust likes continual moisture and is aparticular problem where dew lasts for several hours--like foggy SF. If after practicing the cultural controls above you are still faced withthe problem, do not despair. You still have organic techniques to useto get the problem in check. Powdery Mildew has been effecively prevented (Jackson & Perkins has eventried it and been successful with it) using a mixture of baking soda andhorticultural oil (like the one used in the dormant spray). A greatdeal of University research has been done supporting this in the lastfew years. The formula is to use 3 teaspoons of baking soda and 2 1/2tablespoons of oil (I like a brand called Sunspray) in a gallon ofwater. Some sources recommend adding a 1/2 teaspoon of insecticidalsoap as a spreader sticker to the mix. Spray the roses thoroughlyensuring contact with both the top and the bottom of the leaf. Work atCornell showed that both diseases were "subdued" by a weekly spraying ofthe solution. I spoke to the horticultural director of Jackson Perkinsa couple of years back and he spoke highly of the solution when usedpreventatively. He was less enthusiastic about its curative properties.Some of the dormant sprays (lime sulfur) out there also have summerrates on them for use in season. You could also try one of these aswell. One tip: I like to be sure the plant has plenty of moisture beforespraying. Water it well a day or two prior to application. That wayyou can help to reduce the chance of burning with the spray. So that should help with the mildew. Now the rust. It responds well totreatments with sulfur based fungicides. You can look for Safer'sGarden Fungicide or mix your own using a wettable powder. Follow thedirections on the label and again be sure you get a thorough coverage.You can also dust with sulfur, but I think spraying helps get bettercoverage. There is also a new product out this year called "Rose Defense" by theGreenlight Company. It is a 90% solution of neem oil which is derivedfrom the seed of the Neem tree. Neem has been long recognized for itsinsecticidal properties (it acts as an insect growth regulator), and nowhas been found to control--are you ready--both powdery mildew and ruston roses--even blackspot!! It is brand new, so I have little experiencewith it yet. But I do have a bottle and intend to try it should I haveany problems this year. I spoke with one of the sales people for thecompany and asked about the other 10%--he assured me it is only apreservative which helps to keep the product stable and effective. Theyhave another formulation approved for use on vegetables so I am fairlyconfident that it would be OK to use. I do not know, however, howorganizations like California Certified Organic Farmers feel about it.Given the alternatives (Funginex, etc.) I feel comfortable recommendingRose Defense for you to try first. Always use according to thedirections on the label. Finally, under the disease prevention heading, I have seen results fromresearch in Israel using antitranspirants (AntiStress 2000 [best] andWiltpruf are common brands) to prevent mildew and even mites. In fact,I successfully used them a few years ago to prevent mildew on roses in aretail nursery in Santa Cruz. Essentially they coat the leaf with acompound that prevents the spores from contacting the leaf surface.The research results were outstanding. Very effective. The drawback?You have to apply them regularly to keep any new growth protected. So that leaves the earwigs. Trap 'em. They like to hide in cool darkplaces during the heat of the day. Give them a place to hide like apiece of bamboo, an inverted clay pot, or a loosely rolled newspaper.Check the traps each morning and dump the insects into a bucket of soapywater. I have also heard of using tuna cans with a 1/2" of vegetableoil in them to attract and drown the earwigs. Generally, earwigs arebeneficial scavengers that eat decaying fruit or plant litter and poselittle problem to the garden. Sometimes they do get out of control anddue to population competition eat plants. Trapping is usuallysufficient to get them back under control. If you are still seeingdamage, I would take a late night walk in the garden. With a flashlightinspect the plants. Sometimes other critters are at work and earwigs getthe rap. Finally, there are varieties of roses more resistant to diseases thanothers. I remember a talk I went to in San Jose a few years back. Itwas sponsored by the California Association of Nurserymen (sic) andfeatured a local rose expert. She was asked what she recommended forcontrolling powdery mildew. Her response took most of the audience bysurprise, "A good sharp spade..." Her point was that there are hundredsof varieties of roses, many of which are far better suited to a givenarea and more disease resistant than others. Her suggestion was to findthe right rose for your area, and not to make the mistake of trying tomake an ill suited variety adapt to your conditions. So, I will leaveyou with that thought. Dear Whitney Farms -- What is the best mixture for potting containers that are going to be very crowded with annuals for a good all summer display? Potting soilplus what? Zone 7 Well, now I do have to admit a bias. If you live in the Western UnitedStates the answer is simple...Whitney Farms Premium Potting Soil foryour clay or wood planters and Whitney Farms Uncle Malcolm's PottingSoil for your plastic pots and hanging baskets. It is our website,after all... Seriously though, you should be able to find a quality mix in your area.Unfortunately, I can't tell which part of Zone 7 you're in, else I mightbe able to suggest a brand to look for. In most parts of the UnitedStates you should be able to find potting mixes made by qualityproducers using quality ingredients. You will not often find this atthe big chain stores. Quite often (though not always) those productsare of very inferior quality, and prove disappointing to the customerswho use them. Look for a potting soil that is made with Peat Moss, a compost of somekind or earthworm castings, and other ingredients including pumice,and/or vermiculite, and/or perlite, as well as some kind of fertilizer.It is hard to explain over the Internet, but take a look at the mix ifyou can, it should look, smell and feel good. Look for a nice balancebetween large and small particles, does it feel rich or does it looklike a bag of wood by-products--not a good sign. Ask yourself, if I wasa plant would I want to call this stuff home? If you can find a good bagged mix, use it. It is a bit more difficultto mix your own soil, though it can be done. The point is, if you havea reputable bagged soil producer, then they have done the work for you,and since the future of their business depends on the quality of theproduct they will hopefully give you the best mix they can. If you elect to mix your own, I would think about using peat moss,compost, if you have it, and something to facilitate drainage. In ourarea we use pumice and composted bark fines for that. Other componentscould include sand, perlite, and vermiculite. Exact formulas are hardto offer without knowing what will go into the mix. You can see that bythe time you locate, gather, and mix the ingredients, it makes sense toby a pre-formulated mix from a quality producer. That should be all you need for a soil mix. I would not think that youwould need to supplement a quality mix--I would not encourage anyone toadd anything to our mixes for example; they are ready to use as is. Be sure to fill your containers from top to bottom with the soil mix.The old tale about a layer of gravel or shards of pottery in a pot, isill advised as it interferes with the drainage and can actually causemore problems than it might solve. If you are concerned about loosingsome soil out the drain hole, it is not really that big a deal, but asmall piece of window screen or a single shard of pottery to cover thehole is all you need. Beyond that, be sure to give them regular feedings. I generally use aquality organic fertilizer, like our Rose & Flower Food, to supplementwhat is in our blend, and then feed regularly through the season with awater soluble fertilizer--I use our Ellie's Ultimate and our Flower andFruit Booster in a tea--but you could use any good soluble fertilizer.Just use it more often at a lower concentration. (A lot of nationalbrands call for one tablespoon per gallon of water every two weeks. Iwould use half a tablespoon per gallon every week.) Dear Whitney Farms -- I need to know whether it will be harmfulto my azaleas to feed them before they bloomthis spring, or should I wait until after theybloom? I would generally feed just after blooming in most instances. Feedingearlier would usually not cause any harm with a few exceptions, as noted below. The Sunset Western Garden Book recommends feeding once growth begins in thespring, again at bloom time or right after, and monthly until August. Iwould generally agree with their directions with a couple of qualifications.I adapt my recommendations based upon a couple of factors. 1) What is thecondition of the plant? Is it yellow and showing obvious signs ofnutritional deficiencies? Feeding will help to ensure that you have ahealthy plant capable of blooming well and more importantly setting buds fornext years bloom. 2) What kind of fertilizer are you using? If yourfertilizer has high amounts of soluble nitrogen (for example fertilizerslike Miracle Gro which are designed to be dissolved in water or if theycontain large amounts of nitrogen sources like sulfate of ammonia, ammoniumphosphate, or nitrate sources of nitrogen) it may be advisable to delayapplication until after blooming. A sudden flush of nitrogen in the plantsystem could upset blooming. This has been the belief of many for years,and the traditional recommendation has been to feed immediately afterblooming. Also, if you are using a synthetic fertilizer with nutrientsources like those above, remember that they are salt based. Azaleas andtheir cousins, rhododendrons, are typically shallow rooters that grow closeto the surface, so be sure to spread the fertilizer out to avoid burning anddamaging the roots near the surface. On the other hand, if you are using an organic fertilizer like our WhitneyFarms Azalea, Camellia, and Rhododendron Food or cottonseed meal, than youcan safely use the products according to the directions without fear ofburning. At the same time, because of their slow release nature, these couldbe applied in early spring, after danger of frost, and when you see signs ofnew growth on your plants. Because they release their nutrients gradually,they will not cause a too rapid feeding, and will help the plant maintaincolor and growth throughout the year. Remember, azaleas are evergreens, andas such they have a fairly continual demand for nutrients. In fact, I haverecently seen articles recommending a more "year round" approach to feeding.Though I would echo Sunsets comments about August being the final feedingparticularly if you are using synthetic fertilizers. The concern being thatthe soluble nitrogen will cause too tender growth late in the season thatcould be subject to frost damage. With organic fertilizers you do not havethis concern, because as the soil cools down and the plant growth slows, sowill the conversion of the fertilizer to more available forms slow down aswell. Another benefit of using organic fertilizers is that you will not haveto use them nearly as frequently to get the same benefit as their syntheticcounterparts. Finally, be sure to mulch your azaleas. They prefer a rich, moist, acidsoil, and will thrive if you give them a good organic mulch. If you makeyour own compost, you could mix it with a little peat moss (peat is acidicin nature) or just use your compost as is. We also make a great mulchcalled Garden Mulch. This is a rich, dark compost-based product that reallyhelps to highlight the plants while at the same time helping to keep thesoil cool and moist. If you prefer, Bark Mulch would be a good one to useas well. In fact, one of the few times I like to use it is around therhodie and azalea family members. In addition to keeping your soil cool andmoist, a good mulch can also help to suppress weeds, and if it derived fromcompost, can help to feed the plants as well.

If so, I often hear about using "dry" manure. What does this mean, and what is the process? Goat manure is great for composting!! I have been fortunate (some mightthink unfortunate, but in my eyes it is good fortune!) to have had someexperience composting just about every common domestic animal manure andI can promise you that goat manure makes a fine compost. As always, I am a big advocate of getting the bedding along with themanure. Often the urine soaked straw or shavings and the manurecombined will make a much better compost than the fecal matter byitself. The key is to make a good solid pile (check our compostinginstructions on the web...), be sure that there is plenty of moisture(the pile should be like a damp sponge), dust in some fine (1/4 inch orless) layers of soil as you build it--this helps to trap nutrients andinoculate the pile with the organisms that will break it down. I haveadded diatomaceous earth to the pile as well to help control flies andit seems to have helped in the past. Turn it if you can, moving insideto out and vice versa. After you can't tell what it was to begin with,when it looks and smells like rich earth. It's ready!! Dry manure?? Dry manure will not compost. You will have to addmoisture. It is not something I am familiar with and all of thequestions come from the Midwest. I am guessing that this is a marketingangle. The only advantage I could possibly see is in handling. Itwould have to be rewet to decompose or for the nutrients in the manureto be made available. Other than ease of handling and saving a bit inweight for transport, I see no advantage to "dry manure"--as I saidabove, if it is for composting, I like it wet with lots of urine soakedbedding--it heats up faster and contains more nitrogen. Portland Oregon Dear Whitney Farms-- What's a good organic additive for a large garden? I was thinking about composting a truckload of sawdustand chicken manure. Or would horse manure be better. My garden is about 1/5 acre. Congratulations!! You are the first person from Portland to submit aquestion. What's the big deal? At last somebody from the homeland... You are on the right track as to the stuff to add to the garden.Nothing is better than compost, and composted manures or a compost madeof manure and the debris collected from your garden would both beexcellent additions to the soil. I would recommend a soil test--checkwith Portland Nursery--if you will be gardening in the area for sometime. This will give you an idea of where to focus on soil building andwill help you to identify any nutrients that might be in short supply.Often folks are surprised to learn, for example, that they did not needto use the All Purpose fertilizer, just a nitrogen source or aphosphorous source. By recycling the nutrients that you have added to the garden bycomposting the debris that comes out of the garden, and adding acomposted manure you should be able to meet most of the nutritionalneeds for most crops. From time to time you might need some extrasomething for one crop or another and it is pretty easy to add thebonemeal or the greensand or the whatever as you prepare the soil forthat particular crop. To answer your second question, both should make a good compost, but inmy experience it is a little easier to compost the horse manure than thechicken/sawdust combo. Here are some thoughts: If you can get horse manure with lots of good urine soaked bedding--Ireally like straw--it makes an excellent compost just by itself. If itis a little on the dry side, I would add some water as I layered themanure. I also find that a small amount of soil or old compost mixed inevery few layers helps the process as well. I mean small--just adusting of a 1/4 inch or less every other layer. It serves to do acouple of things. On the one hand it is a great way to inoculate thepile with the microorganisms who will facilitate the decay of thematerial, and the soil layer acts almost like a filter helping to trapnutrients leaching down through the pile or rising up through the pileas a gas. It also would not hurt if you sprinkled in a littlediatomaceous earth as you build the pile. This can help to controlflies which sometimes come in with the manure. I have just added bandsof DE about a foot wide around the edges of the pile as I built it. Building the pile? You can just dump the manure on the ground, but itwill compost better if it is stacked into a bit more structured pile.By turning a couple of times (watch the temperature, when it peaks afterthe initial rise and starts to go back down, that is a great time toturn the pile) you ensure that most of the weed seeds that might be init are destroyed. Make sure that the outer layers become the inside ofthe pile (they may need a little extra water) so that they can beexposed to the extreme temperatures at the core of the pile. Theeasiest way to do that is to take of the outside of the pile all around,stack it up, then surround it with the material inside the pile. Weed seed? Not that big a deal. A well made compost pile will reachtemperatures as height as 150 degrees F which is sufficient to kill weedseeds and other pathogens. Remember, "weeds are the manufacturers offine soils," as Alan Chadwick (the founder of the particular 'school' ofhorticulture in which I was trained) used to say. They are present inyour soil, having been deposited for 100s of years by ma nature and areoften excellent at trapping nutrients that other less efficient plantscan not make use of. As long as you don't let them go to seed add themto the compost with confidence...they are a great asset to the gardenand to your soil... Now to address the chicken/sawdust combination. If you can get thechicken already bedded with the sawdust that would be ideal. Chickensexcrete urine and fecal material simultaneously so that the sawdustabsorbs all that good liquid and really cooks when you pile it up. Butif you are thinking of mixing the sawdust and the chicken yourself, thatcan be a little tricky. If the proportions aren't right you could endup with a very slow pile that took forever to breakdown (too muchsawdust) or one that blows off all kinds of ammonia and annoys theneighbors (too much chicken). If the chicken you have in mind isalready mixed with a bedding material then I would not see the need tomix in the sawdust. If the chicken is the straight stuff----Danger,Warning, Caution!!--fresh chicken is a gooey mess. It should be driedfirst and then it is a dusty mess. That is why most chicken farmers usea bedding material to make it easier to handle. Don't get me wrong,chicken manure will make a great compost and is an excellent fertilizer(the NY Times just ran a small piece on the virtues of chickenmanure--Sunday, May 5). If you are considering a "pure" source, or evenif you have a bedded source, chicken is a great concentrated manure toadd to compost piles with a good percentage of garden debris,particularly at those times of year when there is a lot of brown leavesand similar high carbon material. Seattle,Wa Dear Whitney Farms -- Can a dog's solid waste be used in the compost bin? Also what zone is Seattle in? Whenever I get a question like this from a city as tuned in to gardeningand composting as Seattle my suspicious side wonders if it is a trickquestion...which should not be interpreted as a stupid question--no suchthing, just stupid answers... To answer your question--theoretically yes; as a practical matter no.Not recommended. Unfortunately our pets share a number of pathogenswith us (dogs have worms that we can get, for example). It is notadvisable to put any animal waste from pets like cats or dogs into thecompost--your rabbit, chicken, cow, etc. is fine however. If you want to "recycle" it, we would recommend finding a quietcorner(s) of your yard away from any edible food crops. Bury it in ahole dug 12 inches deep and cover it with 6 to 8 inches of soil. Youcan work your way around from place to place an make little deposits.Obviously pick areas that aren't going to be dug for a long time; don'tput it in the middle of your annual flower beds, for example.Otherwise, send it off with the curbside garbage--even landfills benefitfrom the addition of organic matter. Climate Zone? We on the west coast are blessed with the Sunset WesternGarden Book. Sunset Magazine has devided the western US into climatezones that are far more discreet and accurate than the giant USDA map.Seattle falls into Sunsets' Zone 5--"Marine Influence Along theNorthwest Coast and Puget Sound;" "Over a 20 year period minimumtemperatures range from 28 deg. to 1 deg...." If you enjoy gardeningpick up a copy of the Western Garden book. It is a great resourcegardeners, and would even be useful if you were to move east. (fromyour email I thought that you might possibly be a student on a studentsbudget--used copies should be available at used book stores like Shorey,et. al.--worth it. Still really useful, though not totally"up-to-date") Otherwise, looks like you are in USDA zone 8 (I use the Sunset systemmyself so I am not as familiar with the USDA zones). Another great resource for you if you don't already know of them isSeattle tilth. Just over the five from the UW at the Good SheppardSchool. Take 50th west to ???. Carl Elliot is an old friend, host ofthe KUOW garden show on Thurs. mornings, Tilth Garden Coordinator andinvaluable source of information on gardening in your area (not that wedon't want you writing to us again!). If Carl doesn't know, he probablydoes know someone who does... Bellevue,WA 9? Dear Whitney Farms -- A milk farm in Kent sells "blown" manure to use as a mulch. Aged supposedly. But will it be any good? I have to confess that I am not sure what "blown" manure is. I think ifyou are going to use it as a mulch, you will probably be safe. Take alook at it--does it seem aged and broken down?; can you tell what itonce was or does it look like good compost?; how does it smell? If ithas any strong odors of ammonia or sour, rotten smells I would behesitant to use it; if it smells like aged compost--go for it!! If you aren't sure about it, but the deal is "too good to pass up" thenbuy some and mix it into your compost or let it sit and age some more.Turn it from time to time and add some water if the pile dries out.(Compost should be about the moisture of a damp sponge). If you haveever seen our Barnyard or Steer Manure (Whitney Farms brand) compare itto those products. If it seems to be the same or similar quality youshould have no problems. Hawaii Dear Whitney Farms -- Are maggots good for a compost pile? Are maggots good for the compost pile? I suppose in a general sense,anything that facilitates the breakdown of the organic matter in thecompost could be considered good for it. On one level, flies are goodfor compost as they are an excellent source of some of thebacteria that do the work in the compost. Unfortunately, maggots willsomeday grow up to be annoying flies, so I would try to avoid creatingconditions which cause maggots in the pile. Here are some tips on keeping the maggot population in check (a few maybe inevitable). Keep a layer of dry leaves or grass clippings on top ofthe pile and cover kitchen garbage promptly when adding it to the pile.Maggots will also not survive the extreme temperatures of a well builtcompost pile, so turning the pile to ensure good aeration is alsohelpful in reducing the fly population. (Aeration in a well builtcompost pile helps to get to those good hot temperatures...) Nashville area Dear Whitney Farms -- What plants can coffee grounds and or ashes be used for? I've heard they are a big help! Both coffee grounds and wood ashes are great additions to the garden orthe compost pile. According to Rodale's Encyclopedia of Organic Gardening coffee groundscontain up to 2% nitrogen, .0033% phosphoric acid, as well as potash,minerals, trace elements, carbohydrates, sugars, vitamins, and caffeine.They are reportedly acidifying and are recommended for use around acidloving plants like blueberries, rhodies, azaleas, etc. In my owncompost piles the worms congregate in the coffee grounds. I just addthem along with all of my other kitchen scraps. I have also heard of coffee grounds being used in bands around roses torepel the ants that farm aphids. I don't have any personal experiencewith this, but plan on giving it a try if I get an aphid invasion. Wood ashes are a great source of potash in the garden. They arealkaline in reaction and should be used with that in mind. It isestimated that they contain from 1 to 10% potash and around 1-11/2%phosphorous. You can safely use them at up to 1 to 2 lbs. per 100 sq.ft. Keep them away from germinating seeds or new roots. I would alsonot use them around acid loving plants. A cord of wood contains theequivalent liming value of around 25 lbs. of lime. Be careful handling them, they are caustic and can cause injury ifmishandled. Another cautionary note, I avoid using any colored papers inthe fire place. No glossy inserts, etc. The concern is that they mightcontain heavy metals like cadmium in the inks. Add ashes to composts after the first initial heating of the pile. Thisis particularly true for composts high in manure's. Compounds in theashes can cause the loss of nitrogen from the piles. Finally, do not use anything other than wood ashes. Coal ash should notbe used in the garden and has little fertilizer value if any. Rocky Mountains Dear Whitney Farms -- Can I use waste water from my washing machine to irrigate my garden? Do the worms like it? The general answer is yes, you can use water from the washing machine inthe garden. Here are some guidelines: 1) It may be illegal in your community. I would check that out just toknow if it is one way or the other. Quite honestly though, I would notlet that stop me...(This is the view of the author and not the sponsor,the station...) 2) Sometimes the fiber and lint in the water can make it harder tohandle. 3) Do not use any water that has been used to rinse or clean diapers.A very BAD idea! 4) Be sure to use a screen of some kind in the distribution system tocatch fibers that might clog sprinklers, etc. 5) If you are on a well do not use gray water any closer to it than thelocal authorities would allow a septic leach field. 6) Not all plants like gray water. Often the soaps and detergents makethe water alkaline, so all of the acid loving plants like citrus,rhodies, azaleas, camellias, etc. should not get any gray water. Also,don't use it on any edible plants--though some use it on fruit trees andother plants where the edible portion is well away from the water. Ingeneral, NEVER use it on leafy greens, root crops, etc. The best place to use it is on ornamental plants that tolerate alkalineconditions or the lawn. Most plants will thrive on the phosphates inthe detergents, as long as they don't get overwatered. In general, arich loamy soil can absorb up to one quart per square foot per week. Or400 gallons to every 100 square feet. Clay soils can handle less, andsandy soils can handle more. In any event, I would suggest alternatingareas where it is used, and watering with fresh water betweenapplications. 7) Be conscious of water your putting into the water. Use simple soapsand detergents. Avoid all modern detergents that whiten, brighten,soften or have "enzymatic powers." Avoid bleach in any form or anythingwith chlorine in it. Do not use cleaners pr detergents containing boron(no Borax products), though a plant nutrient, it can build up to toxiclevels very quickly. Baking soda is OK. Ammonia is a good substitutefor bleach to cut grease, etc. 8) Now, I am not sure where you are in the Rockies, but if you are inthe more arid parts or in the rain shadow be cautious. It is possiblefor toxic salts to build up in more arid regions. They are usuallywashed out by a few good heavy rains. Hence my suggestion to alternateareas where you use it. 9) Keep an eye on the pH. If you start to see pH over 7.5, you couldbe building up sodium. Use gypsum to correct this problem. Similarly,if you have a water softener, that is going to increase the sodiumcontent of the water. 10) Don't use it on potted plants. 11) Don't pour it directly on the base of trees or shrubs; disperse itover the whole root system. 12) Keep an eye out for signs of damage and discontinue use. If plantsare injured, flush the area with a fair amount of fresh water.

Central Ohio Dear Whitney Farms -- I live in a neighborhood of predominantly rental property. Few peoplearound here pick up after there dogs. I heard that dog poop is a bitstrong for the garden. Is it OK to mix it in with my kitchen scrapsand compost it. If so how much can be added It seems as though there is no end to it. We would not recommend putting any waste from pets into the compostpile. The primary concerns is pathogens that might be harmful to humansthat could be found in the waste. Unfortunately, our good pet friendscan be hosts to organisms that could be harmful to human health. Generally, if you want to recycle the waste in the garden, find a remotespot, under a favorite tree for example, dig a hole 8 to 12 inches deep,fill it for a time with your over abundant pet piles, and cover with sixinches of soil. DO NOT use it around food plants, etc. Wear gloveswhen handling--um, ah, you probably get the picture. Dear Whitney Farms -- I want to buy a chipper/mulcher for small limbs (2"dia.) and leaves.What to look for and what to look-out for. Under $500.00. Anyinformation will be helpful. Thank you. Boy Molly, I can't say I am an expert in this area, but I can hopefullyhelp you narrow your search a bit. First, let me encourage you! I bought an electric shredder a couple ofyears ago--it will handle things up to about an inch in diameter prettyhandily. What a great investment! Always an avid composter, I now havevery little that can't be composted or converted into a mulch. Thestuff that is too big for the shredder is used as fire wood. Thepayback--very quick. We have yard debris recycling here, but I haven'ttaken advantage of it in years, which is a big saving in waste disposalbills. The unit cost about $250, but between the lower garbage billsand the yards of free compost, I'd say it paid for itself in two yearsat the most. Huge piles of prunings are quickly transformed into smallpiles of compost ingredients! Some suggestions. To deal with the limbs of the size you describe, 2inches, you will definitely be looking at gas powered units. Theelectric's are handy for small yards and light materials, but will nothandle the big stuff. Be sure to look for a model with good safetyfeatures--no matter how intelligent you are, it is hard to resist thatimpulse to just stick your hand in there to loosen that onestick----ooooooouuuuuuuuucccccccccchhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! I like a unitthat makes it impossible to do yourself or any one else harm. Also, Iwould look for a unit that is easy to get into. These things jam up,and it is nice to be able to open it up fairly quickly, clear the jamand get back to shredding. Look for one with blades that are easy to resharpen. The electric unitI have even has blades that are reversible, so I can get them sharpened,use them for a while, then reverse them and use a whole new edge beforeI have to worry about getting them honed again. Definitely get a unit that has a hopper as well as a feed for the largerlimbs. They are great for shredding up leaves and small twiggybranches, etc. I know that Organic Gardening often reviews power tools and of coursethere is the indispensable Consumer Reports. I'd say it is time to takeadvantage of a cool and rainy spring day to head to the library for someresearch. . . Dear Whitney Farms -- I raise hogs, cows and poultry. If I do not feed them organic feedis their manure not organic? I grew my own field corn last year using organicfertilizers (Fertrell) how ever I ran out of corn by early Feb and had tobuy feed. I would some day like to be 100% organic. Usually most of the organizations that certify organic farmers don't make alot of distinctions about the source of animal manure. For example, instates like California, quite a bit of organic produce is grown usingchicken manure, and a lot of that comes from Foster Farms (a giant chickenprocessing/growing operation without any links to the organic community). Iam certain that New York State has a certifying organization, and they cangive you guidelines on what inputs are acceptable. I would be verysurprised if they split hairs about the source of the manure. Organic matter (compost, humus, etc.) is the very heart of organicgardening. That is the whole point of what we do--returning organic matterto the soil in order to foster the various processes in the soil thatsupport the growth of plants. I hate to sound like an agchem guy, but it isimportant to consider the notion of "dose." If the non organic corn you fedyour livestock was grown using synthetic fertilizers, they were long agotransformed into corn, and would certainly not be a factor in the manureyour animals produced. Similarly, even if there were pesticides orherbicides used in the production of the crop, by the time they got to youranimals--if there were residues in the feed grain--and passed through youranimals digestive system, the concentrations would be so low that they wouldbe insignificant. If you compost the manure, the process of composting wouldalso break down any minute traces of many ag chems (Roundup for example). If the organic/sustainable farming movement were to limit themselves only tousing manure from organic sources we would greatly limit the organic matteravailable to us. Look at the dairy industry--only a handful of dairies inthe country are organic. There are thousands of organic farmers andmillions of organic gardeners, many of whom like to use manure in therefarms/gardens/compost piles. If farmers like you were required to only usemanure from organic sources, there would be a shortage and the littleorganic manure out there would probably become unaffordable quickly. Part of the tenet of organic farming is reusing what many would see as awaste problem--manure--and returning it to the soil. Maybe someday we willlive in a utopian world with only sustainable farms using organic methods togrow food. In the meantime, use your manure, feed your soil, and keep upyour good work! The point, in my opinion, is that you are making the effort to convert to amore sustainable farming method. You should be applauded for your efforts,encouraged in your transition, and not have the manure from your livestockdisqualified on a technicality! Hey, Sh!t is Sh!t! And composted sh!t isreally good sh!t! Feed it to your soil, keep up your transition, and get agood nights sleep knowing that you have helped your farm to become a moresustainable place in the process! If you need more help or want to get in touch with other folks doing whatyou are doing get in touch with your organic certifying group in New YorkState--if you haven't already. They can connect you with a lot of farmerswho have gone through or are in the process of going through what you are.Also, the folks at Rodale (Organic Gardening) used to publish a mag calledThe New Farm that was written with the transitional farmer in mind, theymight be a good resource for you. There are some news groups, etc. that youmight find useful, as well. Check out The Sustainable Agriculture Network(san).

Dear Whitney Farms -- I have lots of Lama and Horse manure, what wouldbe a good percentage to add to a compost pile, themore the better? OH JOY!! How envious I am of you! How I long for the days when I had asteady and reliable source of large quantities of manure! (Though I do geta good break on Whitney Farms Products these days!) How much to add to the pile? You can successfully compost the manure byitself. (If you'd like more info on composting send me your snail mailaddress and I will send you a couple of articles about composting.) Justbuild layered piles like you would in a normal compost situation and be sureto water the manure well as you layer it. Provided it has some bedding likestraw or would chips, it should heat up and compost beautifully. I used to work in an all organic market garden and our primary source ofcompost/fertility was well rotted (read composted) horse manure--along withsome goat, quail, and chicken manure from time to time. We would clean outa stable, haul it back to our composting site, and stack it into a nicepile. We turned the piles periodically, adding water if needed. It made abeautiful compost in about six months which we added to our beds. (Wesometimes dusted in layers--thin--of diatomaceous earth. It seemed to helpcontrol the fly population.) We would also add layers of manure to our piles of garden debris--gleaningsfrom vegetable harvests, trimmings, weeds, etc. Basically, every otherlayer we would add a layer from 4-6 inches thick depending on how hot themanure was. The hotter, i.e. fresher, the manure the thinner the layer.Again, we added water as we went. Also worked great! As you can see, it is hard to give you a percentage--I guess the answer isup to 100% depending on the other materials you have for composting. Ithink you were on the right track with "the more the better." Another way we used the manure was as a mulch around established plants, orto cover beds in the winter left bare after a late harvest. Generally,depending on your level of skill and expertise, I would suggest mulchingwith composted manure. If you are an experienced gardener, you could trymulching with fresher manure. Try it around things like fruit trees. Keepit away from direct contact with the trunk. After the soil warms in thespring, pile it an inch or two thick in the area just beyond the trunk tooutside the drip line. Every time you water you will wash some nutrientsinto the soil as well as keeping the soil cooler, which will help toencourage root growth, etc. To use as a winter cover, a variation of the agricultural technique calledsheet composting, just spread a couple of inches over your bare beds as youready your garden for winter. The winter rains will wash many of thenutrients into the soil, and the manure will usually rot where it lies sothat you can till it in come spring. Though in areas with colder wintersyou may just want to rake it off the beds come spring and throw it into thecompost. We were even able to start cover crops through the manure--if itwas already slightly aged. We simply scattered fava beans across the top ofthe soil, and mulched with an inch or two of manure. It worked great!(This was in the milder climate of central California.) At Whitney Farms we compost piles of manure and bedding by the 10s ofthousands of yards. It makes a wonderful compost! Dear Whitney Farms - What about blending kitchen scraps and pouring them into your borders. It is a well accepted practice used by many folks to preprocess materialsfor composting. Much like using a shredder to prepare woody materials forcomposting, using your blender for your kitchen scraps is a great way tospeed up the time it takes for those things to decay in the soil or yourcompost pile. Composting is partly a function of surface area. The finer the particlesthe faster and more efficiently the many microorganisms can get to it, breakit down, and convert it into a form that plants can use again for nutrients. You did not mention if you bury the liquefied waste or if you are justpouring on the surface. That would be my only suggestion. If you are notalready doing it, dig a hole 6 to 8 inches deep around your favorite plants(be careful not to damage any roots) and pour your elixir into the hole.That will help to keep animal pests out of your garden who might be drawn bythe very interesting smells of your blended compost. Citrus is fine to grind up or to add to the compost pile. Guidelines? Only that you should rotate around the yard, so that all yourplants have a chance to share in the wealth--so to speak. Also it helps toprevent some of the slurry from building up someplace and putrefying.

We typically do nothing to ourlawn except mow it. However, this year we are plagued by dandelions. Ifeel like I am walking through a land mine of bees when I walk acrossit! We have five acres, so hand pulling them does not seem reasonable. Do you have any ideas? The best solution is going to be to get the grass growing as well aspossible. A good vigorous turf with a nice dense stand of grass is abetter competitor than a less healthy one. The upcoming issue of theDirt will feature a whole mess of stuff on lawns and should be postedon the web site by mid June give or take a week. In the meantime, use a top quality slow release organic lawn food--inyour area both Ringer and Milorganite are good options, though ourproduct is, I feel, superior to both. (it's a bit heavy to mailthough!) The advantage of using natural organic lawn foods is that theywill feed the lawn gradually providing all of the essential nutrientsthey need, without causing excessive growth, acidification of the soil,and many of the other problems associated with synthetic fertilizers.There may be a few other things to do like aeration and dethatching,though if you have been leaving clippings in your low maintenanceapproach and not feeding with really soluble nitrogen sources (read"cheap lawn foods") then you probably don't have a thatch problem(unless the lawn is really old). So, step one, get the lawn growing well and get it nice and thick, andout grow the dandelions. Two, don't let them go to seed!! Keep aheadof the flower heads and you will slow down next years crop. Three, getrid of as many as you can. Obviously, hand digging is out! With 5acres I would be loathe to do it as well. I have seen a weeder made bethe same folks who make "The Claw"--wonder if that would help? I thinkthe only practical solution is going to be limited intervention with achemical. You could try a new product called Finale--preliminaryinformation that I have seen seems to indicate a fairly low toxicity andenvironmental hazard. It is essentially a synthetic form of a naturalenzyme that inhibits the metabolism of ammonia in the plant leading todeath. I have limited experience with Finale and don't know how well itwill deal with the roots which are the key to getting rid of dandelions.Keep in mind that it will kill the grass too, so just spot treat theweeds. If Finale is less than final, then the only practical alternative that Ican think of is judicious use of Roundup. It does biodegrade tonitrogen, phosphorous, carbon dioxide, and water. There are someconcerns about hazards with the product (check out www.panna.org), but Iwould say that it might be the best bet for a problem on your scale. (Ihad a friend who worked part time as a landscaper and part time doingmassage and natural healing. I saw him one day buying a gallon ofRoundup concentrate. What gives?, I asked. "A 250 foot long driveway.I could not weed by hand and get the job...") Again, it kills grasstoo. Attached you will find some pointers on natural lawn care that were fora sign I did for a demonstration project. The concepts will be flushedout in the next issue of the Dirt. Also good resources for lawn careare "The Chemical Free Lawn" from Rodale Press and "Building a HealthyLawn" from Garden Way Publishing. NE Conn. Dear Whitney Farms-- I have light brown patches of quickly dying grass, varyingsizes usually the size of a football. At first I thought my mower wasdropping gas or oil in spots. I did not find any leaks. Please help me!! The brown spots could be caused by several different things. You havealready ruled out one possibility--damage due to gasoline.Other potential causes include: Dog urine spots--do you have a dog? The salts in the urine can damageturf grass. Sometimes you may see a green 'halo' around the burnindicating that the nitrogen in the urine is feeding the undamagedgrass. A good soaking will usually get the salts leached out. Reseedif needed, though often the grass will fill back in. Fertilizer burn. Dead Annual Blue Grass. The most obvious key hear is the seed headsthat appear on the grass just before it turns yellow and dies. Mowhigher--lawns mown at 2-21/2 inches seldom have a problem with annualblue grass. Any Number of Different Diseases--Often upon examining the foliage ofthe grass closely you will see spots on the blades or dead spots withconcentric rings of dying tissue around it. It is important to get anaccurate diagnosis of the disease before you attempt to treat it. Irecommend taking a sample to the most reputable nursery in town andasking them to identify the problem. To get a sample I suggest cuttingout a small piece of sod--maybe 6 inches long by 4 wide. Get a piecethat includes the dead area, the transitional area, and the healthygreen area. That gives a good picture of all the things that might begoing on and allows for a much more accurate diagnosis. You can alsolook at various resources like the Ortho Problem Solver--a big "rogue'sgallery" of garden pests and diseases. It should be available to lookat in a good nursery and has pictures of the common diseases and theirpatterns. This aids in diagnosis as well. It may also be insect related. To check for these first look closely atthe damaged areas. See any "silky tubes" with light brown or grey wormsin them? That would be sod webworms. Otherwise dig around the edges ofthe dead spot. Check under the sod surrounding the damaged grass. Youmay find any number of different grubs or beetle larvae feeding on theroots and killing the lawn. If you have a problem with one of thesepests, I am a big fan of using predatory nematodes--commonly seen underthe brand name Biosafe...also helps to control fleas. Look out for mowing too short!! I see more problems caused by this thanjust about anything else. Mow in the 11/2 to 3 inch range on coolseason grasses depending on the time of year--shorter at the beginningand end of the season, longer during the heat of summer. Mow often andnever remove more than 1/3 of the length at any time. Cutting any morethan that will damage the lawn and lead to problems in the long run. Finally, be sure to feed the lawn well. Try an organic lawn food. Theyfeed gradually over a longer period of time. This means a great lookinglawn, less mowing, no thatch problems, and fewer peaks and valleys inthe nutrition curve. The Washington Park Zoo here in Portland, ORswithced to organic lawn foods four years ago and have been verysurprised by the outstanding results! More and more experts arebeginnig to recognize the benefits of using a slow release, naturalorganic fertilizer in turf care. Many golf courses have been doing itfor years using some of our competitors products as part of therestandard fertilizer program (Ringer and Milorganite). Sorry I could not give an exact diagnosis, but that would require beingable to visually inspect the grass. Haven't quite sorted that one outyet... WESTERN MASS. Dear Whitney Farms-- ON PARTS OF OUR LAWN WHERE IT IS SHADY WE HAVE GREEN AND BROWN MOSS. WHAT IS THE EASIEST AND CHEEPEST WAY TO GET RID OF THIS. Good news!! This is an easy one. The cheapest, most effective mosscontrol is also really good for the lawn. Iron sulfate is the activeingredient in moss killers for use in the lawn. It kills principally byburning the moss which will turn brown or black. Rake it out, andreseed the lawn if needed. You can find it as a pure product--which is probably the cheapest way tobuy it, or as an ingredient in any number of different 'moss killers'some with fertilizers some without. Now, the moss is going to come back unless you take some steps tocorrect the conditions which encouraged it in the first place. Aeratethe lawn to improve drainage, and increase light to the lawn ifpossible. For years lime has been recommended--the theory was that mosslikes an acid soil and liming helps correct that. I have seen a fairamong of research in the last few years which does not support that. Ithink the real key is improving drainage and light, and keeping yourlawn growing vigorously. Also, just a theory, but I wonder if mowing a little higher might helptoo. The problem I see with most lawns is that they get mowed much tooshort. This makes it hard for the lawn to feed itself, it needs theblades to photosynthesize and thrive. Often this leads to thin lawnsand the chance for weeds and moss to get started. Our next newsletter, the Dirt, due out in June will feature articles onlawn care from a more natural and organic perspective. Send us youraddress and we will add you to our snailing list, or visit our websiteagain in late June and read it on line--though the pictures aren't asgood...yet. Remember, the great thing here is that as you kill the moss you are alsogiving your lawn to very important nutrients--iron and sulfur. Florence, OR on the coast. Dear Whitney Farms-- Last November, my husband mowed our grass for the last time that year.Shortly there after it all died! At first I thought it was moss butnobody elses grass was dead around me so when I started digging I noticedthese grey grub type worms. I talked to the local nursery and theyrecommended some lawn chemical to kill grub worms. I put it on buthated using chemicals. The grass is now growing but I'm afraid it willhappen again. Can you tell me if you have heard of this happening toanyone else? Also is there an organic way to treat this problem. I hateputting poison into the water table? Thanks for you help. Don't worry! Your yard is not the scene of some bizarre alien invasion!!There are a number of insect larvae that feed on the roots of the lawn.You have just met one of them...The good news is that you should nothave to depend on the chemicals to get them under control (and yourinstincts are correct--they do pose a hazard to the water table as wellas birds--diazinon for example is no longer allowed for use on golfcourses due to the high avian mortality rate often associated withit...) After the soil has warmed up above 55 degrees F you should be able tosuccessfully control these pests using a predatory nematode. It iswidely available as a product called Biosafe--though you will also findit under several other names as well. This creature attacks any numberof soil dwelling organisms--including fleas--and kills them in a ratherdramatic fashion--good thing that the hole process takes place out ofsight!! This product is very effective and should give you excellent results.You may have to apply it a couple of times and the various insects youare after can come back, so you may have to use it from year to year.Follow all the directions. I have to put a plug in for one of our products. I encourage you to tryour all natural lawn food (You can get it at the Newport Fred Meyer).It should give you excellent results on the sandy soils at the coast.It is the official lawn food at the metro Washington Park Zoo inPortland. If you have never used an organic lawn food you owe it tooyourself to try it for a year. It is a favorite not only at the zoo,but also of gardeners throughout the west who have been surprised by thegood color and less frequent mowing it brings to your lawn. Sorry forthe commercial announcement, but it is really great stuff. Besides,your mom must have told you that there is 'no such thing as...freeadvice! Chicago IL. Area Dear Whitney Farms -- I need info on which type of grass to plant. the area is shady, about 50% sun.I am trying to get the yard ready for an outdoor wedding in the end of July and need a fast growing and tough type of grass. Thank you for your help in advance. You should be able to get a good looking lawn by the end of July, butstart this weekend!! I would recommend a shade tolerant blend of perennial ryegrass and bluegrass. It should do well in your area. I stress the shady blendbecause any grass will do fine in full sun, but shade tolerant varietieswill do much better in the conditions you describe. Brands are notimportant--just avoid the bargain brands and look for a quality mix.Check your local independent garden center, or go with a top qualitynational brand. One question--is the area under a tree? Sometimes it is difficult toget a thick and lush stand of grass under trees because of thecompetition from the tree roots for moisture and nutrients. If that isthe case, a carefully timed application of annual rye grass in mid tolate June--about 4 to 6 weeks before the ceremony--might be thesolution. It won't last the summer without turning brown, but thingsshould look good at least as long as the wedding. It is a temporaryfix, but then that may be all that is needed. (Annual rye is usedcommonly as a winter overseed for grasses that go 'dormant' in thewinter in the southwest, etc.) Boston MA Dear Whitney Farms -- I have a white grub problem in my yard and I have 2 small children and do not want to use chemicals. What can you recommend I use that will be effective and safe. Also I would like to move from a "chemical dependent" lawn to an organic lawn. What do I need to do? And when can I start? . Here is the answer I gave to another guest at our site: First, there are the larvae of a number of different species of beetles.These grubs feed on the roots of the lawn and can kill the entire lawnif left untreated. Generally, the adult beetles do not damage the lawn,but they do lay eggs in the soil which hatch into voracious turf pests.Depending on the actual beetle in your yard, they lay eggs in thespring and summer (May and June Beetles) or in mid- to late-summer(Asiatic, Japanese, and masked chafer beetles). After hatching thegrubs feed on the roots in the top 1-3 inches of soil. In late fall,they move down deep into the soil to overwinter until next spring. My first choice for control would be a product called BioSafe or one ofits cousins. This is a predatory nematode that feeds on soil bornlarvae like grubs or root weevils. It is essentially harmless tohumans, but if you are a grub, it is a nasty fate to be attacked bythese guys. Once the soil in your area warms up to about 55 degreestreat with the Biosafe according to the directions. This product hasbeen shown to be effective on a wide range of pests--even fleas!! Check with your local extension service (in the Government Pages in thephone book, under state, under Agricultural Extension) for the dates inyour area when eggs are typically lain or when the grubs are likely tobe active. Treat accordingly. The nematodes will probably not survive the winter in Indiana (orBoston) and would need to be applied again. If that fails to give adequate results, there are a number of pesticidesthat would typically be recommended to control these pests. Theyinclude diazinon or chlorpyrifos--commonly seen as Dursban. Treat justafter the eggs are laid according to the directions. The grubs willcome to the surface, usually, and die. Given the associated hazards tobirds, etc. these products would only be a last resort, in my book." I think, personally, that with kids I would avoid the pesticides. Iwould not be comfortable with kids playing on lawns treated with eitherDursban or diazinon, and the biosafe type products are very, veryeffective. It may take an application or two to really get these guysin check. As to breaking the "chemical dependency," do it now!! There are acouple of great books--The Chemical Free Lawn (Rodale Press) or Buildinga Healthy Lawn (Garden Way Publishing)--that give you a thoroughunderstanding of the topic in an enjoyable and easy to readpresentation. Warning Subversive Editorial Comments Which May Not Be Suitable forGeneral Consumption: The obsession we have in this country with golfcourse like lawns is ridiculous. Most homeowners have no idea of theamount of time, energy and money that goes into maintaining the averagegolf course. Most homeowners would also be completely unwilling tospend the kind of money that golf courses spend preparing the soilprior to the installation of the turf. And yet they think that therelawn should look like Augusta National. WRONG! NOT! Forget it! Won'tHappen! American homeowners use 10 times more chemical pesticides per acre thanfarmers do. As much as 30 percent of the water in eastern cities goesto maintaining lawns (60 percent in the arid west). Of the 34 majorpesticides commonly used on lawns, 32 have not been tested for long termeffects on humans and the environment. So, by all means, make the switch! Your lawn and family will be betterfor it! You can have an absolutely beautiful, healthy lawn that is theenvy of the neighborhood without being part of the treadmill that somany homeowners are on. (I'll attach a draft copy of a sign I wrote fora demonstration project on converting lawns to organic methods--it willoutline some of the ideas--also check our Website in late June--the Juneissue of "The Dirt" is slated to be a lawn issue.) So start this weekend. Mow your lawn a little higher. Feed it with aquality organic fertilizer (Boston, hmmmmm, look for Ringer LawnRestore--they are a competitor, whose product is not as good as it oncewas, but it will be the easiest to find in your area and give you goodresults). Mow lightly often and leave the fine clippings on the lawnwhere they can do some good. Aerate the lawn and dress with a lightapplication of compost. Check for thatch and treat if needed. Don'tfreak out over the occasional dandelion or some clover. Leave theclover and dig up the dandelion. Don't be obsessed with a pictureperfect lawn--as our resident expert at Oregon State is oft heard to say(by the way more than 60% of all the lawn seed in the world comes fromOregon, we know lawns...), "A great looking lawn? One that looks goodto the neighbors across the street..."--it is an impossibility. Your newlawn will be invaded by native grasses, don't sweat it. Keep the lawnwell fed and properly and sensibly maintained and you will be happy, thekids will be happy, the neighbors will be happy... Remember, as those fellow Oregonians have said--"Just do it!" Alberta Dear Whitney Farms -- How do I get rid of burn spots caused by female dogs? The easiest and only way I know of is to 1) Water the affected areasthoroughly to wash the salts from the urine out; 2) Either reseed orlet the existing lawn refill the damaged area. Generally the damage is going to be more severe in hot, dry weather. Ifyou keep your lawn well watered, that can help to mitigate the damage. Scar,Ontario,Canada Dear Whitney Farms -- Help!!!! It is spring and all around me I see beautiful lawns beginning ,however our lawn is beginning to look like it is going to be the eyesore of the community. It is still almost totally brown with very little green coming through. To let you know about it's condition, I think my trouble started in the spring last year. I dug up a small portion of the lawn to make a flower bed,and to my horror I found these small fat white worm type bugs.( I think they're called grebs.) The birds were suddenly using my lawn as a feeding ground, and every once in a while you would look out to see a lawn just covered in holes, but wait that's not all. In the middle of the summer it seemed as though I had also inherited this ugly thick grass that eventually turned into a purplish colour.( I have been told that it is crab grass.) Now that you know my problem, and the history of it any advice you could give me would be most appreciated. Well, the good news is that you can have a beautiful lawn again, the badnews is that it may not be the lawn you have now. Below is a note to another visitor to our web page about controlling thepests you found in your turf: "The description "grubworms" is a bit on the generic side, and youdidn't indicate where you were having trouble with them--lawn?; garden?;vegetable garden? So I will give you a general response and addresssome of the more common pests that are often called grubworms. First, there are the larvae of a number of different species of beetles.These grubs feed on the roots of the lawn and can kill the entire lawnif left untreated. Generally, the adult beetles do not damage the lawn,but they do lay eggs in the soil which hatch into voracious turf pests.Depending on the actual beetle in your yard, they lay eggs in thespring and summer (May and June Beetles) or in mid- to late-summer(Asiatic, Japanese, and masked chafer beetles).

My first choice for control would be a product called BioSafe or one ofits cousins. This is a predatory nematode that feeds on soil bornlarvae like grubs or root weevils. It is essentially harmless tohumans, but if you are a grub, it is a nasty fate to be attacked bythese guys. Once the soil in your area warms up to about 55 degreestreat with the Biosafe according to the directions. This product hasbeen shown to be effective on a wide range of pests--even fleas!! Check with your local extension service (in the Government Pages in thephone book, under state, under Agricultural Extension) for the dates inyour area when eggs are typically lain or when the grubs are likely tobe active.

Treat justafter the eggs are laid according to the directions. The grubs willcome to the surface, usually, and die. Given the associated hazards tobirds, etc. these products would only be a last resort, in my book. There are also a group of larvae known as root weevils, often refered toas "grubs." My recommendations would be the same, try the Biosafetype products first and then graduate to harsher pesticides if controlwas unsuccessful. Typically, you could add Orthene (acephate) to thelist particularly for root weevils on Rhododendron." From your description of the extent of the damage, it sounds tome, without being able to actually see your lawn, that the 'grubs' haveprobably killed the majority of the lawn. I would go out and dig aroundto see if you can get an idea about the size of the population of thelarvae feeding on what remains of your lawn. If you find a fair numberof them, you might consider treating with the Biosafe type products toget the problem under control. The purple-ish grass is probably a native/"pest" moving in to cover thethin soil on your lawn. Nature abhors a vacuum/bare soil, and will doeverything to ensure that the resources (sunlight, soil, etc.) do not goto waste. Evolution is a natural process in most lawns and it is rareto find a lawn over 3-5 years old that still has a 100% stand of theoriginal grass in it. Usually, it has been invaded by the locals. From your description, it sounds like the lawn is ready for renovation.If it is a thin and bad as you say, that is going to be the easiest wayto get the lawn you are looking for--start over. Till it all under (youcan treat with Roundup first to kill the remaining grass(es)); this willprobably expose a lot of the grubs, and I would let the birds feast fora day or two. Check our website for instructions on starting a new lawn(I am not sure that page is done yet, but it is "Coming Soon!") or talkto your local nursery. You can struggle to save the old lawn, but Isuspect you will eventually need to put in a new one anyway, so whywaste the time and money in a futile effort to save a terminally ill"patient." Again, not being able to see the lawn in person, I can only go on yourdescription, but it does sound like the time has come...After you getthe new lawn in, check our tips on maintaining healthy turf grass. Zone 7-South Eastern PA Dear Whitney Farms -- What's the latest wisdom on organic lawns? My husband's bossjust bought a new home on three acres, and is considering installing asprinkler system (he's on a well!) and hiring ChemLawn to make it looklike a private golf course. He asks my husband for advice, because heknows we're into gardening. Would love an article or something to showhim, pointing out that Americans have realized this isn't England andwe can't have lawns that look like golf courses without huge expense,water use and fertilizers, but can still have a lovely lawn, moreappropriate to our climate and conditions. Ever hear of Don Quixote? I mean, if ever there was a cultural myth, itis the fascination with lawns we have in this country! What giveshere?!? Good luck trying to talk this guy out of his golf course. Fewthings provide more of an obsession than a lawn and the vague image of agolf course for the average American male! I wish I could come up with an article or two describing just what youhope for, but unfortunately we seem a long way off from the averageAmerican gardener giving up their obsession with lawns. And myexperience in the lawn and garden industry does not give me much hope... I can recommend a couple of great books that you could either read, soas to be true experts on organic lawn care when he comes to you foradvice, or maybe you could surreptitiously leave a copy behind on hisdesk. They are: The Chemical Free Lawn, by Warren Schultz, published by Rodale Pressand Building A Healthy Lawn, by Stuart Franklin, published by Garden WayPress Both of these are excellent resources with loads of great informationabout how easy and sensible it is to take a more natural approach tolawn care. Then there was the article in Time Magazine (June 21, 1993)which also notes a number of sources of information about natural lawncare. As to the wisdom of managing your lawn organically--Elliot RobertsPresident of the Turf Grass Institute is a huge advocate of thesemethods. He points out that grass is a very efficient nitrogen user,for example, and only after we get it hooked on synthetic nitrogen do wehave to resort to the ridiculously intensive methods we use to keep itlooking "the best." Here in our hometown of Portland, Oregon we havethe local zoo using organic fertilizers throughout the landscape. Butthe biggest success story is the 3 acre lawn at the zoo, knownappropriately enough as The Whitney Farms Concert Lawn. It gets heavytraffic--picnics all day, and 2-3 concerts per week in the evening, tensof thousands of people a month, millions annually. According to thelead landscaper there switching to organic foods and methods is the bestthing they have ever done. He was very skeptical of using organicfertilizers and techniques prior to doing it, but he is absolutelyconvinced today that it is easier to manage and costs less money thanthe chemical treadmill they were on before. Meanwhile, at Oregon State University, we have Prof. Tom Cooke, who hasdocumented how suited organic fertilizers are to growing beautifullawns. The only draw back--cost. They cost more to use on a per unitof nitrogen basis, but if the experience at the Zoo proves anything,they cost a lot less in the long run--all the extra costs--thatching,aerating, mowing, liming are reduced dramatically. But if your husbands' boss is bent on bragging about how much time andmoney he spends keeping his lawn like a golf course (and boy are peopleshocked when they discover how much time and money goes into those golfcourses. . .), then there may be no reasoning with him. You mightmention to him though, how a lot of those turf guys at the golf courseuse Milorganite (an organic lawn food) on there turf. Dear Whitney Farms -- Just a quick question. Is you lawn food safe for children to be playing on the lawn? This is our biggest concern with chemical fertilizers. Look forward to hearing from you. Yes, our lawn food is safe for children and pets. In fact, the onlyproblem I have encountered using it around my dog is that he likes toeat it--some of the ingredients are also used in pet foods. It shouldpose absolutely no danger to children playing on it, unlike some of the"chemical" lawn care products like weed and feed. In fact, one of ourlargest users of our lawn food is the Metro Washington Park Zoo. Theyuse it on a large lawn that gets a lot of traffic from picnickers toconcert goers. The grounds keepers have been thrilled with the successof the fertilizer--it has made their jobs a lot easier, and given themtime to focus in other areas. Dear Whitney Farms -- I'm hoping you can tell me an organic solution to those peskyonions that seem to take over your lawn? Unfortunately, I have no suggestions other than the age old, tried and truetechnique of digging them out. To my knowledge there is no other techniquethat will work and still fall under the umbrella of organic method. If youdo elect to dig them, be sure to get all there pesky little bulblets, asthey will regrow if you don't. Unfortunately, I can't think of a worse place to have a weed like this otherthan your lawn! The digging will leave bare spots and any more intensivecontrols will leave the lawn damaged! Speaking of more intensive--there is a new herbicide out called Finale whichis a synthesized version of a naturally occurring substance that apparentlyblocks the metabolism of ammonia in plant tissue, resulting in death of theplant. The literature indicates that it has an extremely low toxicity andis probably the most environmentally friendly product currently available.You could try that, though it would also damage the lawn in the areas youtreat. Also, there is Roundup. Not organic, but perhaps another example ofthe "least worst" category of products. Again, warnings about what it willdo to your turf grass! Sorry I could not offer more constructive advice, but I just don't know ofan organic method to rid ones' lawn of wild onion! Dear Whitney Farms -- I was interested in using Milorganite as a lawn fertilizer andwould appreciate an opinion. Is it a good route vs synthetic(non-organic)fertilizers?Any information or recommendations are appreciated. I don't know, asking me to answer questions about my competitors!?!?!?Seriously, that is what we are here for! Milorganite is a very good product that has been on the market for quitesome time. It is digested sewage sludge from the Milwaukie municipal system(thats where they got the mil- in milorganite, I suppose). It has been"purified" by heat and microbial organisms. It has a long history of use ongolf courses, parks, lawns, etc. It was even used in the fifties to feedthe grass on the Forty Niners field at Kezar Stadium (?). There has beensome concern in the past about heavy metal content, and up until justrecently, the EPA did not allow it to be labeled for vegetable gardens,though that seems to have changed with the latest label. It has a 6-2-0 analysis and also contains sulfur, calcium, magnesium, iron,zinc, boron, copper, manganese and molybdenum. The only thing lacking ispotash, which you could add by mixing in some wood ash or greensand. Lot of folks speak very highly of the product, and in my retail nurserydays, I sold quite a bit to very satisfied customers including landscapersand homeowners. But, I do have to put in a word for our product. If you live in our marketregion, basically the 16 western states, I would encourage you to look forour Whitney Farms Lawn Food. It has been tested by Oregon State Universityfor a number of years and has been a consistent top performer, outperforming Milorganite in every study. It has a 8-2-4 analysis (a ratio of3-1-2 is recommended for cool season grasses which include rye grass,fescues, and blue grass), and is derived from the three best organic sourcesof nitrogen according to ODU. These include Blood Meal (which the Prof atOSU considers to be the finest source of nitrogen he's ever seen), DriedPoultry Waste, and Feather Meal. We provide the local Zoo with the productfor their lawns, and they are ecstatic with the results! It is quicklybecoming the favorite of gardeners throughout the west who want a greatlooking lawn without the hassle of mowing all the time. We sell it in 25lb. bags that feed 2000 sq. ft. (comparable to the coverage from Miorganite).

I've heard of using lime sulfur and BT, but I don't know what BT is.Any help will be appreciated. I have to admit to putting off answering this question, as it seems arather daunting task. Also my experience is limited to the West Coastand my answer will be from that perspective (ie. there may be apple pestI am not aware of in other areas of the country). Here goes: A few basics to begin with. The exact timing of some of theseapplications will vary from region to region; check with your localAgricultural Extension Service for the dates to anticipate the emergenceor likely activity of some of the pests in your area. (Unfortunately, Ionly know what zone you're in, and it covers a good part of the country)I firmly believe that pesticides should only be used when they will dosome good. It is important to understand the life cycle of the pestsyou are trying to control rather than just spraying by the calendar. In fact, a friend who owns a very large commercial/conventional raspberryfarm in southern Washington state began monitoring pest populations afew years ago and timing spray applications according to need as opposedto a calendar date. The result? He cut pesticide applications by 75%!! That said, here are some suggestions for an organic program for apples: Begin with a dormant spray program in the winter (after leaf dropthrough mid winter). A number of apple pests can be controled throughthe use of a good dormant spray program. Often aphids, scale, and miteeggs will stay on the tree through the winter and using a dormant oilspray will help to kill these pests. Many oils are approved for use inorganic farming--I prefer a product called Sunspray (a paraphinic oil).It has performed very well on a wide variety of plants throughout theyear. Other products would include petroleum based oils like Ortho'sVolck Oil or Lilly Millers' Supreme Oil. I recall that the Sunspraycan't be mixed with one of the dormant sprays though at the moment Ican't recall whether that was sulfur products or copper products. Oneadvantage of the Volck type oils is that they can be used in combinationwith the lime-sulfur products saving you the time and trouble of havingto make multiple applications. The dormant sprays like lime sulfur or copper are used to controldiseases on the tree including scap and mildew. These products kill oncontact. I have always heard that the longer they are in contact withthe target organism the more effective the control. I usually recommendmaking several applications to ensure the best results. Wait for aperiod of dry weather so that the product is not washed off of the tree.Rough dates for spraying might include Thanksgiving, New Years andValentines Day. Easy to remember. Be careful with the dormant sprays. They are usually applied at veryhigh concentrations and would very likely damage non-deciduous plantsthat might be growing under the trees. Be sure to follow all thedirections on the label and wear the correct protective gear. (Thebiggest hazard is probably getting it in the eyes or irritation to theskin. To my knowledge you aren't faced with a big inhalation hazard.) There is also a 'delayed dormant' spray time (approximately theValentines day spray above). Generally sometime in March and Aprilaround the time the blossoms swell. This application is particularlyimportant for controlling the fungi that attack the buds as they openlike scab or mildew. As the buds begin to swell, but before you can seeany blossom, color use lime sulfur according to the directions (thedilution rate may be a little lower than the full dormantrate--unfortunately I don't have any labels in front of me to confirmthis...). If you have had a big problem with scab or mildew anotherapplication can be made at 'pink' or just as color begins to show in thebud. Again lime sulfur according to the directions. Some spray schedules also call for an additional application of limesulfur at petal fall for mildew and scap control. A couple of thoughtson this. One, this would definitely be at a summer dilution rate; adormant rate would be extremely harmful to the tree at this time. Two.if you haven't had a really severe problem with either of these diseasesyou might not need to make this application. Three, if you expectunusually hot weather with temperatures above 85 degrees do not usesulfur sprays. Also in the delayed dormant period, a preventative oil spray can beapplied to control aphids, European Red Mites, and San Jose Scale toname a few. You could also substitute insecticidal soaps at this time.Again, read the label and be sure that you are using the correctdilution rate for the time of year. At the prepink stage, you can make a soap application to prevent appleaphid and scale. If you have had a problem with 'stink bugs' you couldalso apply sabadilla during this time period. Prepink is also the time to begin to think about coddling moth controlsif you have a problem with that pest. The best approach is to usepheremone traps to monitor the populations and to time your spraysaccordingly. I also know that the coddling moth is influenced by atemperature trigger (First egg hatch usually occurs when 125 degree dayshave accumulated from the first 62 degree F sunset. One source I havegoes into how to make 'degree day' calculations. If you sent me youraddress, I could mail you a copy of it.) before it becomes active. Thisis the kind of info your extension service should be able to provideyou--what is the time frame when coddling moths typically become activein this area? NOTE: If you do not and have not had a problem withcoddling moth do not use a pheremone trap. You will almost certainlyhave the problem after you hang the trap! Otherwise, it is probably thebest way to know when to spray other than the temperature indicators Imentioned. Products to control the coddling moth include "ryania with fish oil"(from one growers catalog) to diazinon--decidedly non organic. I knowthat a graduate student in the Agroecology at the University ofCalifornia Santa Cruz was looking at the pyrethrum products for use incontrolling the moth and was having a great deal of success.Unfortunately I haven't seen her in ten years, and never heard theoutcome of her research project. The challenge with the moth iscontrolling it before it gets into your fruit. Timing is everythingparticularly with organic products as they do not have the longevity ofthe synthetic pesticides. Coddling moth can also go through severalgenerations so repeat applications may be necessary. One suggestion would be to keep an eye on the eggs which are typicallylain on the fruit or on a nearby leaf. They are laid singly and aredisk shaped, opaque white, and a little difficult to spot. They laterdevelop a red ring, and just before hatching the black head of thecaterpillar becomes visible. If your trees are isolated from other apples by more than a mile, youcould try mass trapping. Hang a lot of traps in the trees and catch allthe males before they can mate. This is not a good idea though if youare in an area with a lot of other apples close by. Coddling moth alsoattacks pears, walnuts and plums. This is a fairly labor intensivemethod, and I will save a discussion of it unless you are interested.(Email me and I'll send you the additional info.) There has also been some work using pheremone twist ties to controlpest. The idea is to flood the insect sensory organs with sexualpheremones so that they are completely confused and unable to find amate. I don't know if there have been any in-roads with this techniquein coddling moth control, or if the ties are available to consumers. Here is where the Bt comes in. Bt or Bacillus thurengensis is amicrobial insecticide that controls members of the Lepidoptera family,also known as moths and butterflies. Some organic growers do use it tocontrol coddling moth. Success requires 9 to 15 very carefully timedapplications per season. You have to apply the product just around thetime the larva begin to emerge from the eggs and before they burrow intothe fruit. I am not sure that this is the best method. One source I have ('Pests of the Garden and Small Farm'--U CaliforniaPress) makes the following comments: "Botanical and microbialinsecticides and oils are most likely to provide acceptable control inorchards that have low populations of coddling moth to begin with.Therefore, they should always be used in combination with the variouscultural methods (coming up)...Orchards with very heavy populations...and many nearby sources of infestation will be very difficult tomanage without more toxic pesticides." Here are the cultural controls. Some of the larva will overwinter inprotected areas on the tree. Clean up any loose bark and give thoseparts of the tree a thorough application of a dormant oil spray. In thespring, clean up any fallen fruits within a couple of days. Many of thefruit dropped by the tree may be attacked by the first generation ofcaterpillars in May or June. There is some evidence that collectingthem and destroying them can have a significant impact on the subsequentgenerations. Another technique which I have seen used and which proved successful wastrunk banding. Essentially the idea is to trap mature larvae as theymove down the trunk in a band of tanglefoot, burlap, or corrugatedcardboard. In the particular instance that I was involved with, we usecorrugated cardboard backed with foam strips--like weatherizing strips.These were attached firmly to the tree with the foam acting as a gasketbetween the tree and the cardboard. Use 2 inch wide strips of 'Flute A'cardboard and wrap around the tree so that the corrugation tubes arevertical. The larva crawl into the cardboard and pupate. The idea isto remove and destroy the strips regularly, thereby killing the pupatinglarva. Ideally the strips should go on the lower portion of the treewhere the bark is smoothest. Timing? Well in coastal California whereI first encountered this method, we put the bands up by the end of May,removed them around the last week of June (725 degree days after egglaying) and burned them. We then checked for and destroyed any pupae wecould find on the trunk. We put bands up again in August and removedand destroyed them sometime between November and January. This workedvery well for us! It is much more effective on smooth barked varieties.On trees with really rough bark the larva will often find a place topupate long before they reach the bands. Finally, the secret to those incredible $5 apples in Japan is baggingthem. This is also good for preventing coddling moth damare. Afterthinning the tree tie double paper bags around the individual fruit thatremain. Leave on until three weeks before harvest (peek inside the bagsto check the fruit) Remove the outer bags leaving special translucentbags over the fruit. About a week later, remove the inner bag and letthe fruit color up. You should be able to harvest about two weekslater. Here is a source on the bags: AppleCorps, 700 13th ST. NE, EastWenatchee, WA 98802 (509)86-9204. Cost around $10 for 100 bagsincluding shipping. So much on coddling moth!?!? Hey, it is in my mind the worst of theapple pests! Who likes to bite into an apple with a big 'ole nasty wormin it... Where was I? Oh, yeah, petal fall...If apple maggots are a problem, youcan use red spheres treated with a sticky substance to trap them. Theseare effective controls for this particular pest and are fairly easy tofind in a good progressive independent nursery or by mail order. Another lime sulfur application could be made for scabor mildew if neededat petal fall too. From 14-28 days after full bloom yet another spray for mildew or scab ifneeded. If aphids become a problem, use soap sprays or summer dilution'sof oils. You can also release predators like green lacewings if youwant. Spring and summer follow the many guidelines for coddling moth. Ifmites or scale appear, oil sprays are your best bet. Again soaps foraphids. That gets us to the fall and a copper sulfate or Bordeaux mix if youhave problems with anthracnose. And then, start again at the top.... Dear Whitney Farms -- Why is chicken manure not recommended for trees? We are planting apples and pears in heavy clay soil. Generally, the concern is that chicken manure releases the nutrients itcontains very quickly--usually about 90% in the first year. Because ofthis, there is some danger of burning. This is particularly true with bareroot trees. All those tender new roots don't always appreciate the highconcentration of nutrients and the associated salts often found in manure. As a rule, I would not recommend manure for use when planting trees with thefollowing exceptions: If it is extremely well aged like very old horse manure, well composted(like our Steer Manure), or very unlikely to burn like rabbit manure then itwould be OK to use when planting trees and shrubs. But I would amend thewhole area prior to planting and then dig the hole and plant the tree. (Seeour article on tree planting in the last issue of our newsletter or at ourweb site--remember--the new thinking is shallow and broad for trees notnarrow and deep...) If the manure seems hot to the touch, smells ofammonia, throws off steam in the morning don't use it. But if it smells likerich freshly turned soil (or really good compost) go ahead and use it. With chicken, you could use it to top dress the trees. After the soil haswarmed up, and they have had a chance to get some roots established--saymidsummer in your climate zone (mid July) you could spread a 1/2 inch to aninch around your trees, keeping it off of the crown of the tree andspreading it around the root zone to a little beyond the drip line. If youuse it this way, and allow the natural effects of rainfall or irrigation tomove the nutrients down to the roots you should have nothing to worry aboutand very happy trees! One last note, if you are planting very large trees like standard trees ortrees on only semi dwarfing root stock (M111 for example) you will be betteroff not amending the soil too heavily in your heavy clay and then mulchingaround the tree to encourage the development of finer soils. Research inthe last few years has shown pretty definitively that with larger trees themore the soil is like the native soil the better the tree will do in thelong run--no shock to the roots as they move from a super rich planting holeto the poorer native soil. If you are planting trees that are on verydwarfing rootstocks (M9) go ahead and amend as much as you would like. Dear Whitney Farms -- What about a fuzzy gray fungus on my plumsand how do I control it. To answer your question, it sounds like one of two things. It could bebrown rot or powdery mildew. Brown Rot: Do small circular brown spots appear on the young fruit? Do thespots enlarge as the season progresses to rot part or all of the fruit. Dotufts of gray spores cover the fruit in moist weather? When you slice openthe fruit do you find brown, firm and fairly dry flesh? Does the infectedfruit drop prematurely or dry, turn dark brown, and remain on the tree pastthe normal harvest period? Powdery Mildew: Do gray-white powdery patches occur on the leaves? Is newgrowth curled, stunted, and distorted? Do infected buds shrivel and openlater than usual? Are infected leaves brittle and do they often die? Isthe fruit small and misshapen? Is it russet colored or covered with whitepowdery patches? A key difference--brown rot will produce spores in moist weather, where aspowdery mildew is often killed in the presence of free moisture. The controls will be similar. First, if you do not already do so, I wouldencourage you to get into the habit of using a dormant spray on your fruittrees in the winter. Look for products containing lime sulfur and useaccording to the label instructions every winter. This can be veryeffective at reducing the population of organisms over wintering on theplant. When combined with an oil spray, it will also help controlpopulations of insects as well. There are a couple of cultural techniques that can help as well--lessapplicable for you perhaps, as you are dealing with established trees. 1)For mildew prevention, plant trees in full sun. Prune to encourage aircirculation. Remove or relocate any roses from near the trees as theyprovide an alternate host for mildew. 2) For Brown Rot, pick up and destroyall 'mummies'--the damaged fruit. Prune to encourage air circulation and toallow for thorough spray coverage. Prune out and destroy any wood showingsigns of infection--twig dieback, sunken lesions on the twigs and branches,a sticky ooze, and dead twigs. Clean up and destroy all debris around thetree. Avoid wetting blossoms with overhead irrigation. Finally, here are the sprays and approximate timing to use to control theseproblems. On the organic, less toxic side you can use sulfur or lime sulfursprays. Be sure to use at the recommended rates for summer applications.You will notice that dormant rates are significantly higher than summerrates. (If you were to use a winter rate, you would burn all the foliage.)Be careful not to use sulfur sprays during periods of hot weather. Otherwise, in the chemical arsenal you have your choice of products. Thefollowing control both pests: benomyl or chlorothalonil (Daconil). Followthe directions on the label. Timing: For Brown Rot you can use a bordeaux or copper containing fungicideat budswell (in early spring, you will see the buds on the branches begin toswell noticeably prior to opening); spray with a fungicide during blooming(sulfur might harm blossoms so be careful) and respray 10 days later. Toprotect maturing plums, spray about 3 weeks before harvest. For powdery mildew, apply lime sulfur or sulfur sprays at 2 week intervals,beginning when buds start to open (they will show faint green tips), untilsmall green fruit are present. Another recommendation is to spray trees atregular intervals of 10 to 14 days until 3 to 4 weeks after the petals havefallen form the blossoms. Resume whenever the mildew reappears. You might also keep your eye out for a new product by a company calledGreenlight. They will have a Neem (a tree in India with naturalinsecticidal and fungicidal properties) based spray labeled for vegetables(and I hope fruit trees). I have seen their ornamental version of theproduct called Rose Defense, and it controlled both insects and powderymildew on roses. Given that plums are in the same family I am hoping thattheir vegetable formulation will have the same properties. One note, unlikeother neem products this one is a 90% concentration of neem oil--hence itsmuch broader range of applications.

Ohio Firm Receives $160,000 Civil Penalty for Illegal Exports: On January 8, Assistant Secretary John Despres ordered RMI Titanium of Niles, Ohio, to pay a $160,000 civil penalty to settle allegations that had exported six shipments of titanium alloy to France and Israel without the required export licenses. Encryption Items Transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List: On December 30, the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 68572) published an interim rule that amends the EAR by exercising jurisdiction over, and imposing new combined national security and foreign policy controls on certain encryption items previously listed on the United States Munitions List. This rule is consistent with both the Executive Order and the Presidential Memorandum issued on November 15, 1996. Included in the rule are export licensing policies for different categories of encryption items, and criteria for key escrow or key recovery products, agents, and development plans. You may download this Federal Register notice from the BXA Encryption Page. You may also refer to the press release located on this website. Contacting BXA for Export Licensing Advice: With the new Export Administration Regulations becoming fully effective on December 31, BXA has been experiencing a high volume of calls seeking export control advice. Many of the inquiries are about obtaining a correct export control number for a commodity, determining if a license is required, or identifying license exceptions. If you experience a busy signal, please be patient. We are doing all we can to assist everyone. The best times to call are before 10 and after 3:30 EST.

Texas Firm Receives Criminal Fine for Illegal Exports to China: On December 20, New World Transtechnology (NWT), Galveston, Texas, pled guilty to charges stemming from its 1992 illegal exports of computers valued at $97,585 to a nuclear equipment factory in the People's Republic of China. A district judge in Galveston fined NWT $10,000 and levied a special assessment of $600. Office of Export Enforcement special agents seized one of the computers prior to its shipment to China. Illinois Firm Receives Civil Penalty for Antiboycott Violations: On December 30, Acting Assistant Secretary Frank Deliberti ordered Aurora Pump, an Illinois manufacturer and exporter of industrial and commercial pumps, to pay a civil penalty of $18,000 to settle allegations that it agreed to furnish information about another person's blacklist status and failed to report its receipt of boycott-related requests from Kuwait in violation of the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Regulations. German Firm and its General Manager Denied Export Privileges and Given $500,000 Criminal Fine for Illegal Shipments to Libya: On December 18, Acting Assistant Secretary Frank Deliberti denied the export privileges of Doornbos GmbH of Solingen, Germany, and its general manager, Helmut Korelski for four years in settlement of allegations that they violated the Export Administration Regulations by their involvement in shipments of U.S.-made machine parts and construction equipment to Libya. Korelski, acting for Doornbos, acquired the goods in the United States claiming that their ultimate destination was Germany, when in fact he sold the goods to the Dong Ah Consortium for use in the Great Man-made River Project in Libya. In a separate proceeding, Doornbos and Korelski pled guilty to one conspiracy count in district court in Ohio and Doornbos received a criminal fine of $500,000. An order denying export privileges prohibits the person or entity from participating in any export transaction involving items subject to the Export Administration Regulations. New Jersey Firm Receives Civil Penalties for Exports a Chemical used in Ballistic Missiles: On December 16, Assistant Secretary John Despres ordered May National Associates, Inc. of Clifton, New Jersey, to pay a $25,000 civil penalty to resolve allegations that it exported hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene to France without the required export license. Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene is commonly used in rocket engines and its exportation is controlled to prevent the proliferation of ballistic missile systems.

Reinsch, Under Secretary for Export Administration Sue E. Eckert, Assistant Secretary for Export Administration Iain S. Baird, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration John A. Richards, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Industries and Economic Security John Despres, Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Frank W. Deliberti, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Hoyt H. Zia, Chief Counsel for Export Administration Robert F. Kugelman, Director of Administration Rosemary A. Warren, Director of Congressional and Public Affairs BXA Mission Statement: The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) promotes U.S. national and economic security and foreign policy interests by managing and enforcing the Department's security-related trade and competitiveness programs. BXA plays a key role in challenging issues involving national security and nonproliferation, export growth, and high technology. The Bureau's continuing major challenge is combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction while furthering the growth of U.S. exports, which are critical to maintaining our leadership in an increasingly competitive global economy. Vision Statement "We will be the leading innovator in transforming U.S. strategic trade policy and programs to adapt to the changing world." Major Programs and Activities Implementing the Export Administration Act (EAA) through the Export Administration Regulations (EAR): The EAA, which has lapsed, and needs to be re-authorized, provides for export controls on dual use goods and technology (primarily commercial goods which have potential military applications) not only to fight proliferation, but also to pursue other national security, short supply, and foreign policy goals (such as combating terrorism). Simplifying and updating these controls in light of the end of the Cold War has been a major accomplishment of BXA. Enforcing the export control and antiboycott provisions of the EAA, as well as other statutes such as the Fastener Quality Act. The EAA is enforced through a variety of administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions. Analyzing and protecting the defense industrial and technology base, pursuant to the Defense Production Act and other laws: As the Defense Department increases its reliance on dual-use high technology goods as part of its cost-cutting efforts, ensuring that we remain competitive in those sectors and sub-sectors is critical to our national security. Helping Ukraine, Kazakstan, Belarus, Russia, and other newly emerging countries develop effective export control systems: The effectiveness of U.S. export controls can be severely undercut if "rogue states" or terrorists gain access to sensitive goods and technology from other supplier countries. Working with former defense plants in the Newly Independent States (NIS) to help make a successful transition to profitable and peaceful civilian endeavors: This involves helping remove unnecessary obstacles to trade and investment and identifying opportunities for joint ventures with U.S. companies. Assisting U.S. defense enterprises to meet the challenge of the reduction in defense spending by converting to civilian production and by developing export markets: This work assists in maintaining our defense industrial base as well as preserving jobs for U.S. workers. BXA's two principal operating units, Export Administration and Export Enforcement, as well as its Office of Administration, have undergone significant reorganization and downsizing in recent years in order to meet the goals of reforming and streamlining the export control system, as recommended by the National Performance Review (NPR) and the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC). BXA is also an NPR Reinvention Laboratory.

The U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Export Administration Fact Sheet: How do I know if I need to get a license from the Department of Commerce? The Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is the primary licensing agency for dual use exports (commercial items which could have military applications). Other departments and agencies have regulatory jurisdiction over certain types of exports and reexports. For example, the State Department licenses the export defense articles and services, while certain nuclear materials and equipment are licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Of those exports and reexports subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), a relatively small percentage require the submission of a license application to the Department of Commerce. License requirements are dependent upon an item s technical characteristics, the destination, the end-use, and the end-user, and other activities of the end-user. You will need the following five facts to determine your obligations under the EAR: What is the item you intend to export or reexport; Where is it going; Who will receive it; What will they do with it; and, What other activities are they involved in? The first step in determining your license requirements under the EAR is to classify your product against the Commerce Control List (CCL). Click here for more information on Commodity Classifications. For assistance in determining which U.S. Government agency has licensing jurisdiction over your export see Commodity Jurisdictions. Click here for help with determining what your obligations are under the EAR. Go to top of page Go to Where should I call for help?

All commodities, technology or software subject to the licensing authority of BXA are included in the Commerce Control List (CCL) which is found in Supplement 1 to Part 774 of the Export Administration Regulations. On the CCL, individual items are identified by an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN). To determine licensing requirements, you must first classify your item against the CCL. To classify your product, you should begin with a review of the general characteristics of your item. This will usually guide you to the appropriate category on the CCL. Once the appropriate category is identified, you should match the particular characteristics and functions of your item to a specific ECCN. You can also request an official commodity classification from BXA. A commodity classification request requires the submission of an application and technical specifications of your commodity, software or technology to BXA. To submit a classification request use Form BXA-748P or its electronic equivalent (ERIC). Form BXA- 748P can be obtained by calling BXA s Exporter Counseling Division or the Western Regional Office.

The U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Export Administration Fact Sheet: What is a Commodity Jurisdiction request, when and how do I submit one? A commodity jurisdiction (CJ) request is used to determine whether an item or service is subject to the export licensing authority of the Department of Commerce or the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls (DTC). BXA is the primary licensing agency for dual-use exports, while the DTC licenses defense articles and services. If you are not completely sure of the export licensing jurisdiction of an item, you should request a CJ determination. You can also submit a CJ request if you believe that jurisdiction of an item has been incorrectly assigned and should be transferred to another agency. A CJ determination will only identify the proper licensing authority for an item, and is not a license or approval to export. CJ requests are processed by DTC under procedures established by that office. You should contact that office for the specific procedures, but generally, to submit a CJ request, send a letter and supporting documents to DTC. To avoid delays in the interagency coordination process the Department of State suggests you include nine complete collated sets of the letter and attachments. If you believe that the current jurisdiction of the item is incorrectly assigned, provide an explanation outlining the reasons. DTC will send copies of the CJ request to appropriate U.S. Government agencies, including Commerce, for review. Upon receipt of recommendations from reviewing agencies, DTC will make a jurisdiction determination and notify the reviewing agencies. DTC will provide the applicant with final notification of the decision by letter. For specific instructions you may contact DTC by telephone at (703) 812-2576, or via fax at (703) 875-6647. Please make your fax ATTN: PM/DTC/CJ The convenient term "dual use" is sometimes used to distinguish the types of items covered by the EAR from those that are covered by the regulations of certain other export licensing agencies. In general, the term dual use serves to distinguish EAR-controlled items that can be used both in sensitive (e.g., military or nuclear) and other, non- sensitive applications from those that are (a) weapons or military-related in use or design and subject to the controls of the Department of State or (b) subject to the nuclear-related controls of the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Note, however, that although the short-hand term dual use may be employed to refer to the entire scope of the EAR, the EAR also apply to some items that have solely civil uses.

There are several steps you should take. The first is to read and understand the "Know Your Customer Guidance" provided in the Export Administration Regulations and as part of this website. It will help you recognize and avoid prohibited transactions. The second is to be familiar with the "Red Flag Indicators" that can help you recognize illegal, or potentially illegal, transactions. The third is to check the parties to your transaction (including freight forwarders, intermediate consignees, and the ultimate consignee) against the most recent "Denied Persons List."* Although you are only required to make this check for export or reexport transactions, it may also be useful to do so for domestic transactions as well. Click here for an example of why this may be important. [*Note: This link will transfer you to FedWorld. You may want to add our address to your "bookmarks" or "favorites" prior to leaving our website.] If you are being asked to participate in an export transaction that you believe may be illegal, or if you have information that such an illegal transaction may be about to occur, you are encouraged to contact BXA's Office of Export Enforcement immediately. You may also wish to check the parties to your transaction against the "List of Specially Designated Nationals" maintained by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.

Controls are maintained on exports from the United States, and reexports of U.S.-origin items from foreign destinations, on strategic commodities and technical data worldwide to prevent the diversion of such strategic items to end-users or end-uses of concern. The effectiveness of these controls is enhanced by their being maintained as part of multilateral control arrangements. The Wassenaar Arrangement (e.g. conventional arms and related dual use items), the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group (e.g. chemical precursors and biological agents), and the Missile Technology Control Regime are the four multilateral export control regimes in which the United States participates. BXA implements U.S. foreign policy controls such as crime control, antiterrorism and regional stability and is responsible for export controls on terrorist countries. BXA also administers export controls to protect the United States from the adverse impact of the unrestricted export of commodities in short supply (e.g. some crude oil, other petroleum products, and unprocessed western red cedar). For further information, refer to the BXA fact sheets or the Export Administration Regulations. The convenient term "dual use" is sometimes used to distinguish the types of items covered by the EAR from those that are covered by the regulations of certain other export licensing agencies. In general, the term dual use serves to distinguish EAR-controlled items that can be used both in sensitive (e.g., military or nuclear) and other, non- sensitive applications from those that are (a) weapons or military-related in use or design and subject to the controls of the Department of State or (b) subject to the nuclear-related controls of the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Preventive Enforcement: Pre-license Checks and Post-Shipment Verification: All export license applications are screened electronically by EE to ensure items are not illegally exported. In addition EE reviews specific individual license applications to assess diversion risks, identify potential violations, and determine the reliability of those receiving controlled U.S.-origin commodities or technical data. In some instances EE, or another Federal agency, requests that a pre-license check be conduced to determine the bona fides of the transaction and suitability of the end-user. The result of this check is factored into the licensing recommendation EE makes to BXA's licensing offices. In addition, EE carries out post-shipment verifications to ensure that a controlled U.S.-origin item has actually been delivered to the authorized ultimate consignee or end-user and that it is being used as claimed on the export license application. Safeguards Verification Program: Annually, EE conducts numerous on-site safeguard verification trips around the world. During these trips, pre-license checks and post-shipment verifications are conducted on controlled U.S. goods, especially those of proliferation concern. In cases where EE's Safeguards Verification Teams discover items are being used inappropriately or in a manner that is inconsistent with an export license they work closely with host government officials to correct the situation. The EE verification teams also assess the suitability of foreign firms to receive U.S.-origin goods and technologies that require U.S. validated licenses. SED Review Program: EE conducts on-site reviews of selected Shipper's Export Declarations (SED) at U.S. ports before goods are exported and again after shipments are made. These on-site reviews are conducted to uncover attempts to export items illegally which require a validated export license from the Department of Commerce. Items for export to destinations of concern and exports of proliferation concern are targeted specifically. In addition to the preventive enforcement efforts under the SED Review Program, EE's Office of Enforcement Support identifies past shipments that may have violated the Export Administration Regulations and refers them to the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) for further investigation. Hundreds of investigations of suspected export control violations occur annually, based on the routine review of SEDs. Visa Application Review Program: Initiated in 1990, the Visa Application Review Program attempts to prevent the unauthorized access to controlled U.S. technology or technical data by aliens visiting the United States. Under this program, information on visa applications is reviewed to detect and prevent possible violations of the Export Administration Regulations. Each year this program results in a number of recommendations against issuing visas being forwarded to the U.S. Department of State. Protecting the National Interest and Prosecuting Violators Export Enforcement protects U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic interests by educating exporters, interdicting illegal exports, and prosecuting violators, all without impeding legitimate trade activities. Export Enforcement special agents work with BXA's licensing officials and policy staff to deter the export of items which, in the hands of unreliable users, can prove damaging to U.S. interests. Export Enforcement personnel also work closely with BXA's Office of Chief Counsel and U.S. Attorneys offices in bringing enforcement actions against violators of the Export Administration Regulations. Violators can face criminal penalties (fines and possible imprisonment), civil penalties and administrative sanctions, or both. The list of Denied Persons contains information on the names and addresses of firms and individuals denied access to U.S. goods in addition to the reason(s) for the denial action. Penalties for violations of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) can include: Criminal: "knowing violations:" The penalties for each such violation can be a fine of $50,000 or five times the value of the exports involved, whichever is greater, may be imposed in addition to imprisonment of up to five years. "willful violations:" The penalties for each violation -- where the violator has knowledge that the items will be used for the benefit of, or that the destination or intended destination of the items, is any country to which exports are restricted for national security or foreign policy purposes -- for individuals is a fine of up to $250,000, imprisonment for up to ten years, or both. For firms the penalties for each violation can be $1 million or up to five times the value of the exports involved, whichever is greater. Administrative: For each violation of the EAR any or all of the following may be imposed: Revocation of validated export licenses; The general denial of export privileges; The exclusion from practice; and/or The imposition of fines of up to $10,000 per violation, or for a violation of national security export controls, $100,000. The maximum civil penalty allowed by law during periods where the regulations are continued in effect by an Executive Order pursuant to the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) is $10,000 per violation. Temporary Denial Orders: Temporary Denial Orders are issued by the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement, denying any or (typically) all of the export privileges of a company or individual to prevent an imminent export control violation. These orders cut off not only the right to export firm the United States, but also the right to receive or participate in exports from the U.S. Section 11(h) Denials: Section 11(h) of the Export Administration Act provides that, at the descretion of the Secretary of Commerce, no person convicted of a violation of the EAA, IEEPA, or Section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (or any regulation, license, or order issued under any of these laws) will be eligible to apply for or use any export license issued under the EAA for up to ten years from the date of the conviction. In addition, Section 11(h) provides that the Secretary of Commerce may revoke any export license in which the party had at the time of the conviction. Public Cooperation: In its efforts to inform and educate the public, EE's special agents participate in seminars and trade shows across the country. These events provide the special agents the opportunity to meet with many exporters and freight forwarders directly, provide them with guidance on export control and enforcement matters, and to hear private sector concerns. Business Executives' Enforcement Team (BEET) Program: The BEET program is part of EE's effort to prevent possible violations by expanding its contacts with U.S. businesses. The BEETs are a series of half-day meetings, held around the United States, that allow corporate officials to learn about their export control and enforcement responsibilities while offering them the opportunity to question export enforcement officials about U.S. export control issues. BEET participants explore ways for businesses and enforcement officers to work together to prevent violations and identify projects of concern for proliferation reasons. We expect to schedule BEET conferences in the near future. When they are scheduled, they will be listed here. Enforcement of New Programs: Fastener Quality Act: The Fastener Quality Act (FQA) prohibits anyone who represents their fasteners as meeting standards established by certain standards setting organizations or government agencies (i.e., manufacturers, importers, and private label distributors of fasteners) from selling fasteners that do not meet the standards appearing on their products. It also requires the testing of fasteners by an "accredited" laboratory to ensure they meet the standard claimed and the retention of records relating to testing for five years. Three organizations within the Commerce Department are responsible for implementing the FQA. BXA's Export Enforcement is responsible for enforcing the FQA and conducting industry outreach programs to ensure compliance with the FQA. In cases of alleged violations of the FQA, EE will conduct investigations and pursue criminal and administrative sanctions as appropriate. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) determines the standards-setting organizations which set the FQA standards. NIST is responsible for accrediting the laboratories that conduct tests under FQA; for recognizing private accrediting organizations; and for maintaining the list of accredited laboratories. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) maintains the Fastener Insignia Register to record insignias of fastener manufacturers and private label distributors to ensure traceability of fasteners.

These "antiboycott" laws are the 1977 amendments to the Export Administration Act (EAA) and the Ribicoff Amendment to the 1976 Tax Reform Act (TRA), [which is found in Section 999 of the Internal Revenue Code]. Objectives: The antiboycott laws were adopted to require U.S. firms to refuse to participate in foreign boycotts that the United States does not sanction. They have the effect of preventing U.S. firms from being used to implement foreign policies of other nations which run counter to U.S. policy. Primary impact: The Arab League boycott of Israel is the principal foreign economic boycott that U.S. companies must be concerned with today. The antiboycott laws, however, apply to all boycotts that are unsanctioned by the United States. Who is covered by the laws? The antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) apply to all "U.S. persons," defined to include individuals and companies located in the United States and their foreign affiliates. These persons are subject to the law when their activities relate to the sale, purchase, or transfer of goods or services between the United States and a foreign country. This covers U.S. exports and imports, financing, forwarding and shipping, and certain other transactions that may take place wholly offshore. Generally, the Tax Reform Act applies to all U.S. taxpayers (and their related companies). The TRA's reporting requirements apply to taxpayers' "operations" in, with, or related to boycotting countries or their nationals. Its penalties apply to those taxpayers with DISC (Domestic International Sales Corporation), FSC (Foreign Sales Corporation), foreign subsidiary deferral, and/or foreign tax credit benefits. What do the laws prohibit? Conduct that may be penalized under the TRA and/or prohibited under the EAR includes: Agreements to refuse or actual refusals to do business with or in Israel or with blacklisted companies. Agreements to discriminate or actual discrimination against other persons based on race, religion, sex, national origin or nationality. Agreements to furnish or actually furnishing information about business relationships with or in Israel or with blacklisted companies. Agreements to furnish or the actual furnishing of information about the race, religion, sex, or national origin of another person. Furnishing information about business relationships with Israel or with blacklisted persons. Implementing letters of credit containing prohibited boycott terms or conditions. TRA does not "prohibit" conduct, but denies tax benefits ("penalizes") for certain types of boycott- related agreements. What must be reported? The EAR requires U.S. persons to report quarterly any requests they have received to take any action to comply with, further, or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott. The TRA requires taxpayers to report "operations" in, with, or related to a boycotting country or its nationals and requests received to participate in or cooperate with an international boycott. The Treasury Department publishes a quarterly list of "boycotting countries." How to report: EAR reports are filed quarterly on form BXA 621-P, available from the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration and Bureau of Export Administration field offices or from the Office of Antiboycott Compliance in Washington, D.C. TRA reports are filed with tax returns on IRS Form 5713. This form is available from local IRS offices. Penalties: Violations of the antiboycott provisions of the EAR carry the same penalties as those for export control violations. These can include: Criminal: "knowing violators": The penalties for each such violation can be a fine of up to $50,000 or five times the value of the exports involved, which ever is greater, may be imposed in addition to imprisonment of up to five years. "Willful violators": The penalties for each violation -- where the violator has knowledge that the items will be used for the benefit of, or that the destination or intended destination of the items, is any country to which exports are restricted for national security or foreign policy purposes -- for individuals is a fine of up to $250,000, imprisonment for up to ten years, or both. For firms the penalties for each violation can be $1 million or up to five times the value of the exports involved, whichever is greater.

This program consists of four main areas comprising a strategy that provides a wide variety of short and long term assistance to address the immediate and emerging needs of the defense industrial base. These programs are: International Diversification and Defense Market Assessment Guides Defense Trade Advocacy Resource Matching Seminar Program Needs Assessment Program International Diversification and Defense Market Assessment Program: This program provides information that addresses the immediate need to find new markets for dual-use and defense products. The program also provides diversification and market assessment information to U.S. firms. These guides provide a variety of information regarding non-traditional dual-use and defense markets in the Pacific Rim, Europe, the Middle East, and the Western Hemisphere. Each guide gives comprehensive information on how to do business in targeted countries, as well as specific commercial and defense trade opportunities open to U.S. firms. These guides are designed for small businesses that are new to exporting. The goal of the market assessment program is to help U.S. firms maintain revenue from alternative domestic and/or international markets which, in turn, allows time to implement diversification or conversion programs. To order a free copy of these guides, please use our e-mail order form. BXA also publishes a Small Guide to Business handbook that describes the various assistance programs that are offered to small and medium sized businesses in the face of defense downsizing and decreased defense procurements. To order a free copy of this handbook, please use our e-mail order form. Return to top of page Defense Trade Advocacy: BXA serves as an advocate for the U.S. defense industry in efforts to compete for overseas procurements. BXA generates high level government-to-government advocacy on behalf of U.S. industry. The agency also serves as industry ombudsman in the interagency community, interjecting economic and competitiveness considerations as well as overall industry concerns into U.S. arms transfer determinations. Return to top of page The Resource Matching Program: BXA's Resource Matching Program is a series of seminars tailored to meet the specific needs of the regions of the United States in which the events are offered. The goal is to help firms that are dependent on U.S. defense contracts to develop new business opportunities in growing domestic and international markets. Firms participating receive "hands-on" guidance from government experts and private sector executives who explain strategies they have successfully implemented. Seminar topics include: International Marketing Assistance Intellectual Property Rights, Patents, and Trade Secrets Regulatory Requirements for Defense Exports ISO 9000 International Fraud and Industrial Espionage Marketing to U.S. and State Governments Federal, State, and Private Sector Financial Assistance Technology Transfer Seminars are held regularly in the western states, including California, Washington, Nevada, and others. They are also held periodically nationwide. Go to our seminar page and select Defense Diversification for a description of each seminar and a current schedule. For a current schedule without a description go to our schedule page . Return to top of page Return to top of section The Competitive Enhancement and Defense Diversification Needs Assessment SurveyProgram: This program rapidly determines the specific needs of individual companies and matches them with federal and state defense diversification and competitive enhancement programs. To participate, a company simply completes a short confidential survey about its operations such as line of business, sales, employment, and research spending, and what type of assistance would benefit it in its diversification efforts. The survey includes a checklist of the types of assistance available such as manufacturing technology development/deployment, product/service development, technology transfer, research and development programs, exporting, financing, marketing, worker retraining, and business development. The information from each survey will be matched with specific agency resources, and forwarded to appropriate members of an Interagency Response Team while providing the firm with a list of which of the 65 participating agencies will be contacting them in the near future. Team members follow up directly with the firm, detailing what services (financial, technical or marketing assistance) they can provide. Firms do not have to be a defense supplier to benefit from this free program. To receive a copy of the Needs Assessment Survey, please use the e-mail order form. You can also download the survey form from the website of our program partners, The Economic Development Administration.

These projects provide needed data and recommendations to government policy makers and industry leaders to help maintain and enhance American defense and economic security. BXA industrial base assessments are typically initiated in one of four ways: Congressional mandate; petition from industry; request from the Defense Department (DOD); or self-initiation. To conduct its assessments, BXA devises technology-specific and industry-specific surveys to collect information related to the health and competitiveness of specific industries that are vital to the national security of the United States. This is done with the assistance of industry experts, both from the private sector and other government agencies. In this way a partnership between industry and government is formed at the beginning of each project, which enhances the quality of the assessment and the effective use of its results. Critical Technology Assessments Section 232 Investigations Defense Industrial Capability Assessments Critical Technology Assessments: A portion of the analytical studies conducted by BXA are mandated by the Congress. This is the case with the critical technology program, created by the Congress in the National Defense Authorization Acts of 1991 and 1993. In these Acts, BXA is directed to work with the Department of Defense (DOD) in conducting in-depth industry assessments of technologies identified by DOD as being most critical to the development of future weapon systems, as well as crucial to the nation's ability to compete in the global economy. The analysis goes beyond solely defense production capabilities. BXA evaluates overall competitiveness, including financial, production, and technical capabilities. In the past few years BXA has published assessments on a number of existing and emerging industries, from advanced composites to superconductivity. The most recent studies are listed below. Click on any title to read a brief summary of the study: Artificial Intelligence (August 1994) Advanced Ceramics (December 1993) Advanced Composites (December 1993) Optoelectronics (February 1994) Superconductivity (April 1994) You can order BXA critical technology assessments at the Commerce Department's National Technical Information Service (NTIS) by calling the NTIS Sales Desk at 703-487-4650 or the Rush Order Desk at 1-800-553-NTIS. You can also order these publications over the internet through NTIS. Critical Technology Assessment of the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Industry (PB 93-192409) August 1994 - Price $95 The BXA assessment of the U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) industry found that while the United States currently leads the world in nearly all aspects of this technology, its leadership position is eroding. Two conditions threaten the country's lead: first, the slow rate of AI commercialization relative to massive research and development (R&D) and expenditures; and second, declines in Department of Defense R&D funding. Cuts in the military budget have reduced overall AI R&D shifted funds away from basic science and long-term projects. The Federal Government sponsored about 75 percent of AI research in the United States between 1989 and 1994; over 80 percent of the Federal total came from the Defense Department. The commercial sector will not come close to replacing these lost R&D funds, particularly for basic research. The Department of Defense is by far the single largest user of artificial intelligence in the world. The military uses AI systems for diagnostics, testing, robotics, target recognition, tutoring, war planning, logistics, nuclear test-ban monitoring, database management, and defense-related manufacturing. Return to top of section for ordering information Critical Technology Assessment of the U.S. Advanced Ceramics Industry (PB 93-182383) December 1993 - Price $95 In this critical technology assessment, it was estimated that the 1990 U.S. market for advanced ceramic components was $3.6 billion. Products destined for electronics end uses account for approximately 80 percent of this figure. Ceramics are used in such electronic applications as ceramic packages, capacitors and sensors. They are also used extensively in structural applications, such as engines, cutting tools, armor, and wear components. Defense applications of advanced ceramics are wide-ranging, covering both electronic and structural applications. Ceramic semiconductor packages, for example, have innumerable uses in defense electronics. Other defense applications include vehicle and personnel armor and aircraft parts. Although commercial markets for advanced ceramics predominate, the industry has been adversely affected by recent cuts in defense spending. The decrease in these markets, combined with a general decline in the economy, resulted in lowered profits and higher debt loads for the industry. The repercussions were significant: defense-dependent firms lacked the financial strength to convert their operations; companies found themselves unable to fund research and development needed to remain competitive; and firms could not afford to maintain their defense production capabilities. Return to top of section for ordering information Critical Technology Assessment of the U.S. Advanced Composites Industry (PB 93-192391) December 1993 - Price $95 The U.S. advanced composites industry was found to be driven by defense aerospace applications, the largest U.S. end-user market of advanced composites, while foreign advanced composite industries are more focused on commercial applications. Reductions in U.S. defense spending, particularly in military aircraft applications, resulted in the downsizing of U.S. industry, declining profits, employment, and private research and development (R&D) expenditures. Recent years have also shown an increased government share of the industry's total R&D, indicating a growing dependency on defense dollars during a time of defense reductions. The implications for the U.S. industry were found to be negative, because of the reliance on U.S. defense business and a difficulty in converting to commercial applications. Return to top of section for ordering information Critical Technology Assessment of the U.S. Optoelectronics Industry (PB 93-192425) February 1994 - Price $95 The Department of Defense (DOD) deemed optoelectronics to be one of the technologies essential to the development of the next generation of weapon systems; however, it is also crucial to the nation's ability to compete in the global economy. In this assessment it was determined that this industry is dependent on single sources of supply - often foreign - for many components, including glass, optical fiber, and electronic circuits. The industry also relies on a wide range of imported machinery and equipment, parts, and raw materials. The report contains a number of other findings and conclusions. Return to top of section for ordering information Critical Technology Assessment of the U.S. Superconductivity Industry (PB 93-192433) April 1994 - Price $95 This assessment utilizes data collected from firms in the domestic superconductivity industry to assess the factors which impact the competitiveness and viability of this important sector. The Department of Defense (DOD) deemed superconductivity to be one of the technologies essential to the development of the next generation of weapon systems; however, it is also crucial to the nation's ability to compete in the global economy. The report addresses a wide range of issues in three broadly defined areas: enabling technologies; components and devices; and systems and applications. Employment grew modestly from 1989 to 1992, while sales to the government grew by 286 percent. These sales, however, were small in relation to the industry's commercial sales. About two-thirds of the industry is adversely affected by reductions in defense spending, in two different ways: directly, because over 50 percent of reported Federal research and development (R&D) funding came from DOD; and indirectly, by restricting defense-oriented customers of superconductivity-related products, restricting these products' sales and thus producers' money for R&D.

EAD analyzes the impact of existing or proposed export controls on the U.S. economy, identifying potential export disincentives that might be modified, reduced, or eliminated in order to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. industry. EAD also analyzes the potential economic impact of export license application decisions on U.S. companies. In addition, EAD has replaced the former Office of Foreign Availability as the organization within BXA that is responsible for conducting foreign availability assessments of national security controlled items.

The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) plays a central role in interagency initiatives to achieve that objective. Foreign defense conversion is also important to expand U.S. trade and exports. It also helps to facilitate the reduction of the NIS defense industrial base, stem the smuggling of nuclear items and other sensitive items, combat pressures for arms sales or other proliferation, and support market reform and privatization. BXA has been the outreach arm to U.S. business and a source of commercial expertise for U.S. defense conversion assistance efforts. BXA assists and promotes U.S. private investment in NIS defense conversion projects in the following ways: Improve Information Flow: BXA publishes a series of Defense Business Directories to disseminate information on business opportunities in the NIS. The directories are intended to facilitate U.S. private foreign investment in defense conversion projects in Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakstan. In June 1995, BXA published a Directory covering over 300 converting Russian defense enterprises. And in June 1996, BXA published a new Ukrainian business directory that includes profiles on over 80 converting Ukrainian defense enterprises. BXA will soon publish a new Russian directory focusing on defense enterprises in the St. Petersburg area. These directories are available on-line electronically and also are distributed in hardcopy to thousands of U.S. businesses. BXA informs U.S. industry about new developments related to defense conversion through its series of industry round tables. Over the past year, BXA has arranged and hosted five industry round tables, with each attracting 40-50 industry representatives. On May 13, BXA held another round table featuring the President of Udmurtiya, an autonomous republic in Russia with the highest concentration of defense industries in the country. Facilitate Business Contacts and Agreements: BXA pursues a number of steps aimed at increasing contacts between potential partners and bringing potential deals to fruition. This includes BXA-organized events such as the recently concluded Entrepreneurial and Defense Conversion Conference in Yekaterinburg, Russia (funded by the Agency for International Development) that was held on May 21-24 and included almost 40 U.S. business representatives interested in pursuing business ventures in the region. It also includes jointly-sponsored events, such as the BXA and Department of Defense co- sponsored conference on Business Opportunities in Ukraine, held June 5-7 near Los Angeles, California highlighting business opportunities with 14 major Ukrainian aerospace, electronics, and heavy equipment industries, and the BXA-DOD co-sponsored Russian Project Finance Conference in New York on June 27-28 that sought to identify sources of financing for U.S.-Russian defense conversion business ventures. BXA also works with hundreds of U.S. company representatives who call in for advice and assistance in removing stumbling blocks to specific deals. Conduct Training: To help remedy NIS managers' continued lack of understanding of Western business practices this, BXA and the Special American Business Internship Training Program (SABIT) are jointly running a special defense conversion program to provide NIS participants with training and exposure to U.S. businesses. Under this program, defense industry executives and local officials are brought to the United States for eight weeks to learn about defense conversion and private enterprise in this country. Since the SABIT defense conversion program began in June 1995, there have been four sessions that have provided training to a total of approximately 80 interns. A large percentage of the interns receiving training have formed some form of business relationship with their company hosts. The next SABIT session is planned for October 1996. Help to Remove Obstacles: BXA also works to improve the overall business environment in the NIS countries and remove stumbling blocks to specific defense conversion deals. Working closely with host government officials through the bilateral Defense Conversion Committees and the Business Development Committees, BXA helps address such issues of concern to defense conversion joint ventures as high and unpredictable taxes and tariff regimes, the progress of privatization, and the need for public availability of NIS legislation and regulations affecting U.S. industry involvement with NIS defense enterprises.

Additionally, the Secretary reports to the Congress annually on the imposition of foreign policy controls. For the last two years, we have published these reports together to reduce paperwork. We sent these two reports to the Congress on January 16. The reports are available on this site in both WordPrefect 6.1 and PDF formats. To read the PDF files, you will need the free Adobe Acrobat Reader. Chapters One and Two comprise the annual report of BXA activities as called for by the provisions of the Export Administration Act. Chapter Three is the foreign policy report called for by the provisions of Section 6 of the EAA. You will find Chapter Three particularly useful since it explains the policy and practice of our export controls which are based upon foreign policy interests. These are many of our controls today. Appendix One goes with Chapter Three and is a summary of public comments we received on the imposition of foreign policy controls. Appendix Two also goes with Chapter Three and is a chart of the member contries in the various multilateral export control regimes as of December 1996.

Key elements of the regulation include the transfer of commercial encryption items from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List, liberalized treatment for recoverable products and a two-year transition period during which non-key recovery 56 bit DES or equivalent strength encryption products may be approved for export based on company commitments to build and market key recovery products and to support a key management infrastructure for electronic commerce. "The new export rules for encryption products will promote the robust growth of international electronic commerce and secure global communications while balancing our nation's economic and national security needs," said William A. Reinsch, Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration announcing the new regulations. "The Administration's policy will help to maintain our nation's share of world computer markets and the jobs that go with it. This flexible, balanced approach can protect individuals' data and their lives and property. To the extent a critical mass of industry cooperates with us, we can collectively achieve our goals," Reinsch continued. The regulation establishes procedures and conditions for companies to follow for approval to export encryption products and creates a new license exception for recoverable encryption products. It spells out time lines for interagency review. In addition, beginning on January 1, 1997, nonrecoverable 56 bit DES or equivalent strength encryption products will also be exportable under a special six month license exception, which can be renewed during the two year transition period. This special license exemption requires a one time review of the product and assurances that satisfactory progress is being made to build and market recoverable encryption products. Finally, the regulation provides for a 45-day period for the public to submit comments.

The Federal Register Notice says: Applicants may submit license applications for exports and reexports of certain encryption commodities and software in unlimited quantities for all destinations except, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan. Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Encryption licensing arrangements may be approved with extended validity periods specified in block #24 on Form BXA-748P. In addition, the applicant must specify the sales territory and classes of end-users. Such licenses may require the license holder to report to BXA certain information such as item description, quantity, value, and end-user name and address. In addition to following this, and all other instructions in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and on form BXA-748P, there are several other things you can do to ensure that your application for an encryption licensing arrangement is reviewed as quickly and efficiently as possible. The following is guidance on how to fill out certain portions of Form BXA-748P for encryption licensing arrangements: BLOCK 9 Put the words "Encryption Licensing Arrangement" in this block, as shown below. BLOCK 18 If you are applying for exports to unknown end users, put the word "various" in the first box of this block. Put the letters "vv" in the country box of this block (this is for computer coding purposes). See below. BLOCK 19 If you are applying for exports to unknown end users, leave this block blank. BLOCK 22 If you are applying for exports of unlimited quantities, put the number "1" in box (e) of this block (see below). This is for computer processing purposes only. You may leave boxes (g) and (h) blank. BLOCK 23 You may leave this block blank. BLOCK 24 As stated in the regulation, specify the sales territory in this block. List specific countries, not regions. Also, specify if you would like an extended validity period. The normal validity period of a BXA-issued export license is two years. If you are selling to certain classes of end users, list them in this block, as stated in the regulation.

U.S. allies "support the concept of lawful access by governments" to encrypted files and communications, reports Ambassador Aaron. He explained that "many governments in the interest of public safety, want stronger controls than we have." "The international encryption market will not be a wide-open affair," he said. Addressing the RSA Data Security Conference, Ambassador Aaron said that as the encryption industry plans for the future, it should "take into consideration the likelihood that lawful access and key recovery will be a growing international requirement." The Administration seeks to encourage the widespread use of encryption where users, in an emergency, can recover access to their keys needed to descramble their data. This would also enable law enforcement, under judicial authority, to gain access to encrypted data, as they do now with unscrambled evidence. Despite our trading partners misgivings about the decision last October to relax U.S. export controls on encryption, Ambassador Aaron says that "all are willing to cooperate with us to work out the needed international arrangements" to make strong encryption work across international borders "while ensuring that public safety is not jeopardized." Ambassador Aaron cited several cases where encryption was used in terrorist plots, drug dealing, child pornography and espionage. He stressed that despite the risks, the Clinton Administration policy on encryption "in no way seeks to expand the powers of law enforcement nor reduce the privacy of individuals. The intent is to maintain, in the face of technological change, the current legal instruments it has." "Domestic use of key recovery will be voluntary, he emphasized. "All Americans will remain free to use any encryption system in the United States." Ambassador Aaron expressed appreciation for the contribution made by private industry to this policy initiative and called for even more dialogue and cooperation. He said that the result of such cooperation "can be a level of privacy and confidentiality never before available to both individuals and business." ### Statement by Ambassador David Aaron US Envoy for Cryptography RSA Data Security Conference, January 28, 1997 International Views of Key Recovery The first thing that I wanted to do in preparing for this assignment was to understand the concerns of industry and the general public. I've had the pleasure of meeting with dozens of US and foreign industry leaders andrepresentitives - not only those in the encryption business per se, but others in the field of electronic commerce, telecommunications, finance and other industries for which secure communications are essential. They have all impressed upon me the crucial importance of robust encryption for the future of their enterprises. Businesses are increasingly reliant on private networks and the internet for theircommunications and operations. As proprietary information and intellectual property istransmitted over these networks, it must be protected by strong encryption. Business is also increasingly multinational in nature. Thus, any system of encryption must be able to operate across national borders. Businesses are becoming more aware of the need to recover encrypted files. Companies simply cannot risk loss of access to their valuable intellectual property because of lost passwords, accidents or, a rogue employee. I have also had the opportunity to meet with representatives of privacy groups. They point out that every day our citizens are electronically transmitting more and more sensitive personal data, including medical, health, and financial information. Such transactions require robust security afforded by encryption. Earlier in my career, I had the experience of working on a Congressional investigation of Government violations of Americans' right to privacy. So I well understand the concerns of privacy advocates. When Americans' fundamental rights are involved, it is understandable that the public will be extremely sensitive and cautious. To enable encryption to be used widely for privacy protection and electronic commerce, rapid development of a support infrastructure is needed. This infrasture must provide the policies, product, and certificate services that will allow encryption to be used, and most important, used WITH CONFIDENCE. The Adminstration supports this requirement, as exemplified by its initiative announced in October to promote the development of an international key management infrastructure. The Administration envisions an infrastructure that, if developed wisely, will offer greater privacy and confidentiality than ever before. It will provide for authenticated transactions, robust confidentiality services, and key recovery features. The latter will enable users, and law enforcement under proper legal authority, the ability to regain access to encrypted data. This approach addresses needs of the user while ensuring the public safety is not placed in jeopardy. While this has been a controversial issue, the ability to protect the rights of Americans flows from successfully fulfilling the basic public safety obligations of government. Already the Justice Department has encountered important examples of instances where encryption has been used by terrorist and criminals. For example, In the Aldrich Ames spy case, Ames was instructed by his Russian handlers to encrypt computer file information to be passed to them. Ramzi Yosef, recently convicted of conspiring to blow up 10 US-owned airliners in the Far East, and his co-conspirators stored information about their terrorist plot in anencrypted computer file. (Yosef is on trial for his role as the mastermind of the WorldTrade Center bombing.) In a child pornography case here in California, one of the subjects used encryption intransmitting obscene and pornographic images of children over the Internet. In a major international drug-trafficking case, the subject of a court-orderd wiretap used a telephone encryption device, significantly impacting the investigation. Some anti-government militia groups are now promoting the use of encryption as a means of thwarting legitimate law enforcement investigations. In several major hacker cases, the subjects have encrypted computer files, to conceal evidence of serious crimes. One of these, Kevin Lee Poulsen, recently pled guilty in Los Angeles and San Jose Federal Courts for among other things, breaking into and manipulating Pacific Bell telephone computers. I cite these examples not in the spirit of argument, but to stress that in developing its policy on encryption, the government has made a good faith effort to balance the obligations and interests involved. And I want to stress that this policy in no way seeks to expand the powers of law enforcement nor reduce the privacy protections of individuals. The intent is to maintain, in the face of technological change, the current legal instruments it has and continues to require - instruments which Congress itself has determined are necessary in the interest of public safety. Business leaders have also made clear to me, and to the Administration, that they believe there exists now a strong international market for robust encryption, and that American industry is in a leading position to respond. But, if American firms are not allowed to meet that demand in a timely way, they are deeply concerned that our leading position in information technology across the board could be jeopardized - even in product areas not incorporating encryption. Thus, industry asked for further export policy liberalization and streamlining of the regulatory requirements. These concerns are being heard in Washington. The Adminstration has taken thefollowing steps - many based on the direct recommendations of industry representatives: First, at the end of last year, jurisdiction for licenses of encryption exports was transferred from the Department of State to the Deparment of Commerce. Commercial encryption is no longer treated as a munition and thereby subject to various foreign policy embargoes. We hope this will both speed up and simplify the tasks of obtaining licenses. Second, and very important, the Administration will license the export of encryptionproducts, of any algorithm and any key length, if they incorporate key recovery. Third, the Administration will also permit the export, over the next two years, of 56-bit DES and equivalent encryption products without key recovery provided exporters make commitments to develop key recovery products. I am pleased to report that already at least 4 vendors have formally filed key recovery commitments and several more companies are in the initial stages of dialogue with the Department of Commerce. And last, a point which is often lost in the debate, domestic use of key recovery will be voluntary as announced by the Vice President last October. All Amercians will remain free to use any encryption system in the United States. However, I must be frank with you. The Administration's agreement to allow the export of DES poses risks to national security and law enforcement, but these are risks that we are willing to accept to support the development of a key management infrastructure with key recovery. In addition to export liberalization, the Administration is also taking other steps inpartnership with US industry to hasten development of key management infrastructure: We have initiated ten US Government pilot projects to demonstrate the practicality of key recovery as part of a key management infrastructure. One pilot which may be of interest to this audience involves the electronic filing of patent applications with the US Patent and Trademark Office, incorporating digital signature and encryption. The Department of Commerce has convened a technical, private sector advisorycommittee to develop a Federal Information Processing Standard for a Federal KeyManagement Infrastructure with a focus on key recovery. We are encouraged by the high degree of industry participation in this activity, which will better ensure a successful outcome. The Administration will use a formal mechanism to provide industry, users, state and local law enforcement, and other private sector representatives with the opportunity to advise on the future of key recovery. Finally, the Clinton Administration will soon propose legislation relating to the provision of commercial key recovery services, including providing penalties for improper release of keys, and liability limitations. To this end, we will be consulting fully and broadly with Congress. As part of this overall effort the President asked me to serve as Special Envoy forCryptography. In accepting this assignment, I have been struck that everyone involved with the encryption issue, whatever their views, recognizes that the international reaction will determine the success or failure of their particular approach. With that common starting point, I though I would share with you the results of my consultations with foreign governments thus far. But before doing so, I think I need to describe my role. A recent publication labeled me the Czar for cryptography. I am not a Czar. For one thing I am mindful of what happened to the real Czar. More important, I report to an interagency group at the deputy Cabinet level. They, under the Vice President, are the real policymakers. My assignment is to explain the US Government's position on this issue to othergovernments and get their views. My goal is an international consensus on the development of a global key management and key recovery architecture -- one that will foster robust and dependable security for the global information infrastructure while protecting public safety and national security. My consultations also focus on the underlying requirements in building such aninternational infrastructure such as cross border certification of public keys and authenticated transactions, principles of interoperability, and key recovery criteria. One of my main messages is that while governments must provide the appropriate policy framework, the task of actually building an international key management infrastructure must lie with the private sector. So far, I have held high level meetings with the governments of France, Great Britain, Germany, Belgium and Canada as well as with the Commission of the European Union. I have also had the opportunity to meet with the representatives of other governments of the OECD in the course of negotiations on cryptography policy guidelines about which I'll say more in a minute. From San Francisco, I will go to Australia and Japan and then return to Europe forconsultations with other governments there. Subsequently, I also plan to consult with emerging market nations in Asia, Africa and South America. So, what I have to report is not a final tally of all governments' views, but I believe it is instructive nonetheless. All governments appreciate the importance of encryption for the future of theireconomies; All recognize the increasing need for privacy protection due to the explosion of electronic commerce; All governments recognize the need for international cooperation to create a KMI and certificate services to facilitate privacy and electronic commerce; All support the concept of lawful access by governments and the use of trusted parties and/or key escrow as a possible mechanism. Many governments, in the interest of public safety, want stronger controls than we have. They have, or are considering, domestic controls on the use of encryption within their borders. Virtually every government has expressed unhappiness with the US decision to release 56 bit non-key recovery products even with key recovery commitments. Several have criticized the absence of internal US controls. They are concerned that the increased availability of such products without key recovery could undermine their ability to protect the public safety within their borders. Also, many suspect that our policy is driven by a desire to obtain a commercial advantage. Nonetheless, all are willing to cooperate with us to work out the needed international arrangements for a global key management infrastructure. In that context, two approaches to the encryption issue appear to be emerginginternationally: one is market-oriented like ours, where governments provide the appropriate policies and regulatory framework to allow for and protect the voluntary use of key recovery. The other, which is not the U.S. approach, is based on government rules and strict controls, including domestic mandatory key escrow for communications. In either case, one of my primary objectives is to ensure that any requirements and limitations imposed in other countries do not discriminate against US companies. An important element in getting to an international consensus on encryption issues has been the development of cryptography policy guidelines at the OECD. The discussions, which began in December 1995, among the 29 member countries, have included representatives from government and business, law enforcement, security, and privacy interests. The guidelines, now in draft, outline basic prinicples for cryptography policy. They cover the issues of trust, choice, market-driven development and standards of cryptographic methods, as well as protection of privacy and personal data, lawful access, liability and international cooperation. As many of you know, we have included as many US business representatives as possible on the US delegation to the OECD meetings on encryption. Though these guidelines are broad in nature and non-binding, our goal is their adoption and application by governments, businesses and individuals in safeguarding electronic transactions, communications and data storage. We expect final approval by governments in the Spring. CONCLUSION In conclusion, I want to underscore that every government I have consulted wants to protect the privacy of its citizens while also preserving lawful access to encrypted materials for public safety purposes. During the negotiation of the OECD Guidelines, delegates were specifically asked if their governments' wished to give up or reject their sovereign rights to lawful access. None did - not even the most ardent advocates of free choice, privacy and unfettered commerce. So from what I can see at this point in my mission, the international encryption market will not be a wide open affair. As you in the encryption industry plan for the future, I would encourage you to take into account the likelihood that lawful access and key recovery will be a growing international requirement. Many companies, including many represented in this audience, have announced efforts to search for key recovery solutions for thier customers, and have provided useful ideas and feedback to the Administration. We are grateful to them and eager to hear more of your ideas and suggestions. I ask the rest of you to consider joining our efforts to develop the framework for an international key management infrastructure that will provide for robust encryption and key recovery for all users. I believe the result of our cooperaton can be a level of privacy and confidentiality never before available to both individuals and business. It can provide the security necessary to make electronic commerce and digital communications powerful engines of economic growth, improving the lives of us all. And as I go forward in my assignment, I want you to know that I am committed tosupport the leadership role of American industry in the highly competitive international arena of information technology. I am eager to work with you and your representatives, and I look forward to seeing you all again.

The Department alleged that Allvac made forty-eight shipments of titanium alloy products from the United States to Australia, China, France, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Taiwan, and United Kingdom and one shipment of a maraging steel product from the United States to Germany, all without the required U.S. export licenses. The shipments occurred from September 1991 to June 1993. The export of these titanium products and the maraging steel product from the United States are controlled for nuclear nonproliferation reasons. Allvac voluntarily disclosed these shipments to the Department, and the Department agreed to suspend payment of $47,500 of the penalty for one year and then to waive payment of that amount provided Allvac commits no violation of the regulations during that period. Commerce's Office of Export Enforcement Washington Field Office investigated the case. Commerce's Bureau of Export Administration administers and enforces export controls for reasons of national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation and short supply. Criminal penalties, as well as administrative sanctions, can be imposed for violations of the regulations.

The Department alleged that in late 1992, Aurora Pump violated the antiboycott provisions on one occasion by agreeing to furnish a statement that a ship carrying goods to Kuwait "is not on the Israel Boycott Bureau black list." The Department further alleged that on six separate occasions during 1992 and 1993 Aurora Pump failed to report to the Department its receipt of boycott-related requests. While neither admitting nor denying the alleged antiboycott violations, Aurora Pump agreed to pay the civil penalty to settle the case. The antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Act and Regulations apply to foreign boycotts fostered or imposed against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The antiboycott provisions prohibit United States individuals and companies from furnishing, or agreeing to furnish, information about any person's business relationships with or in a boycotted country, or with individuals and companies believed to be restricted from doing business with or in one or more countries that participate in the Arab boycott of Israel.

The company also pleaded guilty to attempting another illegal computer export in October, 1992. New World Transtechnology also admitted to falsifying a Shipper's Export Declaration by indicating that a validated license was not needed from the Department when one was required by law. The company did not apply for the license. Charges were filed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Cedric La Rue Joubert as the result of an investigation by Commerce's Office of Export Enforcement field office in Dallas, TX. The computers were shipped to a nuclear equipment factory in the People's Republic of China. Commerce agents seized another computer before it could be shipped to China via Hong Kong.

On October 1, 1996, the Administration announced a plan to make it easier for Americans to use stronger encryption products to protect their privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information. The plan envisions a worldwide key management infrastructure with the use of key escrow and key recovery encryption items to promote electronic commerce and secure communications while protecting national security and public safety. To provide for a transition period for the development of this key management infrastructure, this rule permits the export and reexport of 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength encryption items under the authority of a License Exception, if an exporter makes satisfactory commitments to build and/or market recoverable encryption items and to help build the supporting international infrastructure. This policy will apply to hardware and software.DATES: Effective Date: This rule is effective December 30, 1996.    Comment Date: February 13, 1997.ADDRESSES: Written comments (six copies) should be sent to: Nancy Crowe, Regulatory Policy Division, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Room 2705, Washington, D.C. 20230.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James A. Lewis, Office of Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy Controls, Telephone: (202) 482-0092.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:Background    Following upon the Administration's October 1 announcement, on November 15, 1996, the President issued the Memorandum directing that all encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions List, except those specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for military applications, be transferred to the Commerce Control List. The Memorandum and Executive Order 13026 (November 15, 1996, 61 FR 58767) also set forth certain additional provisions with respect to controls on such encryption items to be imposed by the Department of Commerce. The Executive Order also provides for appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination of encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions List that are placed on the Commerce Control List. In issuing the Memorandum the President stated:    Encryption products, when used outside the United States, can jeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests. Moreover, such products, when used by international criminal organizations, can threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here and abroad, as well as the safety of the citizens of other countries. The exportation of encryption products must be controlled to further U.S. foreign policy objectives, and promote our national security, including the protection of the safety of U.S. citizens abroad.    This initiative will support the growth of electronic commerce; increase the security of the global information infrastructure; protect privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information; and sustain the economic competitiveness of U.S. encryption product manufacturers during the transition to a key management infrastructure. Under this initiative, non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength will be permitted for export and reexport after a one-time review of the strength of the item and if the exporter makes satisfactory commitments to build and/or market recoverable encryption items, to support an international key management infrastructure. This policy will apply to hardware and software and will last through December 31, 1998.    The initiative addresses important foreign policy and national security concerns identified by the President. Export controls on cryptographic items are essential to controlling the spread abroad of powerful encryption products which could be harmful to critical U.S. national security, foreign policy and law enforcement interests. This initiative will preserve such controls and foster the development of a key management infrastructure necessary to protect important national security, foreign policy and law enforcement concerns.    Encryption software can be used to maintain the secrecy of information, and thereby may be used by persons abroad to harm national security, foreign policy and law enforcement interests. As the President indicated in E.O. 13026 and in his Memorandum of November 15, 1996, export of encryption software, like export of encryption hardware, is controlled because of this functional capacity to encrypt information on a computer system, and not because of any informational or theoretical value that such software may reflect, contain, or represent, or that its export may convey to others abroad. For this reason, export controls on encryption software are distinguished from other software regulated under the EAR.    The government recognizes that several factors, including the development of common international encryption policies, the need for an international key recovery infrastructure, and technological change, will influence market development in key recovery products. At the same time, the government is committed to a two-year transition period. The government will continually evaluate progress towards key recovery throughout and beyond the two-year period and will tailor the implementation of its policies in consultation with the public.    This interim rule implements the Administration's policy on encryption exports and reexports. This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by imposing national security and foreign policy controls (``EI'' for Encryption Items) on certain information security systems and equipment, cryptographic devices, software and components specifically designed or modified therefor, and related technology (``encryption items'). ``Encryption items'' subject to the EAR do not include encryption items specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted or modified for military applications (including command, control and intelligence applications). Such items remain on the U.S. Munitions List, and continue to be controlled by the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls. EI controls apply to encryption software transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of the same date.    This interim rule also amends the Export Administration Regulations by requiring a license for exports and reexports to all destinations, except Canada, of certain encryption items controlled for EI reasons. Except as otherwise noted, applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by BXA in conjunction with other agencies to determine whether the export or reexport is consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. Exporters should allow 40 days for the processing of licenses, consistent with E.O. 12981. The licensing policy is as follows:    (1) Certain mass-market encryption software. Certain encryption software that was transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767) and[[Page 68574]]pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date may be released from ``EI'' controls and thereby made eligible for mass market treatment after a one-time BXA review. To determine eligibility for mass market treatment, exporters must submit a classification request to BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption software may be eligible for a 7-day review process, and company proprietary software may be eligible for 15-day processing. See new Supplement No. 6 to part 742 and Sec. 748.3(b)(3) for additional information. Note that the one-time review is for a determination to release encryption software in object code only. Exporters requesting release of the source code should refer to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to part 742. If, after a one-time review, BXA determines that the software is released from EI controls, such software is eligible for all provisions of the EAR applicable to other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-market software. If BXA determines that the software is not released from EI controls, a license is required for export and reexport to all destinations, except Canada, and license applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis.    (2) Key Escrow, Key Recovery and Recoverable encryption software and commodities. Recovery encryption software and equipment controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002, including encryption equipment designed or modified to use recovery encryption software, may be made eligible for License Exception KMI after a one-time BXA review. License Exception KMI is available for all destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and Sudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit a classification request to BXA. Requests for one-time review of key escrow and key recovery encryption products will receive favorable consideration provided that, prior to the export or reexport, a key recovery agent satisfactory to BXA has been identified (refer to new Supplement No. 5 to part 742) and security policies for safeguarding the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext as described in Supplement No. 5 to part 742 are established to the satisfaction of BXA and are maintained after export or reexport as required by the EAR. If the exporter or reexporter intends to be the key recovery agent, then the exporter or reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a key recovery agent identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. In addition, the key escrow or key recovery system must meet the criteria identified in Supplement No. 4 to part 742. Note that eligibility is dependent on continued fulfilment of the requirements of a key recovery agent identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. Since the establishment of a key management infrastructure and key recovery agents may take some time, BXA will, while the infrastructure is being built, consider exports of key recovery encryption products which facilitate establishment of the key management infrastructure before a key recovery agent is named, consistent with national security and foreign policy. When BXA approves such cases, exporters of products described in Supplement No. 4 to part 742 are required to furnish the name of an agent by December 31, 1998. Requests for one-time review of recoverable products which allow government officials to obtain, under proper legal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user, the plaintext of the encrypted data and communications will also receive favorable consideration.    (3) Non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength supported by a satisfactory business and marketing plan for exporting recoverable items and services. Manufacturers of non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength will be permitted to export and reexport under the authority of License Exception KMI, provided that the requirements and conditions of the License Exception are met. Exporters must submit a classification request for an initial BXA review of the item and a satisfactory business and marketing plan that explains in detail the steps the applicant will take during the two-year transition period beginning January 1, 1997 to develop, produce, and/or market encryption items and services with recoverable features. Producers would commit to produce key recovery products. Others would commit to incorporate such products into their own products or services. Plans will be evaluated in consideration of good faith efforts by the exporter to promote key recovery products and infrastructure. Such efforts can include: the scale of key recovery research and development, product development, and marketing plans; significant steps to reflect potential customer demand for key recovery products in the firm's encryption-related business; and how soon a key recovery agent will be identified. Note that BXA will accept requests for classification of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength under this paragraph from distributors, re-sellers, integrators, and other entities that are not manufacturers of the encryption items. The use of License Exception KMI is not automatic; eligibility must be renewed every six months. Renewal after each six-month period will depend on the applicant's adherence to explicit benchmarks and milestones as set forth in the plan approved with the initial classification request and amendments as approved by BXA. This relaxation of controls and use of License Exception KMI will last through December 31, 1998. The plan submitted with classification requests for the export of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength must include the elements in new Supplement No. 7 to part 742. Note that distributors, re-sellers, integrators, and other entities that are not manufacturers of the encryption items are permitted to use License Exception KMI for exports and reexports of such items only in instances where a classification has been granted to the manufacturer of the encryption items. The authority to so export or reexport will be for a time period ending on the same day the producer's authority to export or reexport ends.    Exporters authorized to export 56-bit DES or equivalent strength non-key recovery products in exchange for commitments to key recovery will be allowed to service and support the customers of those products during and after the two-year period. Support and service includes maintenance or replacement of products to correct defects or maintain existing functionality. It also includes upgrades that do not increase the strength of the encryption in the product.    Exporters authorized to export 56-bit DES or equivalent strength non-key recovery products during the interim period may also export under a license additional quantities of those 56-bit DES or equivalent strength non-key recovery products after the two-year period to existing customers. Such sales may be made to the customers of any exporter that was authorized to export such products in exchange for key recovery commitments during the two-year period. The additional quantities sold may not be disproportionate to the customer's embedded base.    (4) All other encryption items--(i) Encryption licensing arrangement. This is intended to continue without change the regulatory treatment of the distribution and warehouse arrangements currently permitted under[[Page 68575]]the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Applicants may submit license applications for exports and reexports of certain encryption commodities and software in unlimited quantities for all destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan. Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Encryption licensing arrangements may be approved with extended validity periods specified by the applicant in block #24 on Form BXA-748P. In addition, the applicant must specify the sales territory and classes of end-users. Such licenses may require the license holder to report to BXA certain information such as item description, quantity, value, and end-user name and address.    (ii) Applications for encryption items not authorized under an encryption licensing arrangement. Applications for the export and reexport of all other encryption items will be considered on a case-by-case basis.    (5) Applications for encryption technology. Applications for the export and reexport of encryption technology will be considered on a case-by-case basis.    Note that all ``EI'' encryption items are not subject to any mandatory foreign availability procedures of the EAA or the EAR. In section 1(a) of Executive Order 13026, the President states:    I have determined that the export of encryption products described in this section may harm national security and foreign policy interests even where comparable products are or appear to be available from sources outside the United States, and that facts and questions concerning the foreign availability of such encryption products cannot be subject to public disclosure or judicial review without revealing or implicating classified information that could harm United States national security and foreign policy interests. Accordingly, section 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (``the EAA'') * * *, all other analogous provisions of the EAA relating to foreign availability, and the regulations in the EAR relating to such EAA provisions, shall not be applicable with respect to export controls on such encryption products.    This interim rule amends part 768, Foreign Availability, to make clear that the provisions of that part do not apply to encryption items transferred to the Commerce Control List.    This interim rule also amends part 734 to exclude encryption items transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List consistent with E.O. 13026 (61 FR 58767, November 15, 1996) and pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of that date from the de minimis provisions for items exported from abroad. This rule also amends part 734 of the EAR to reflect that encryption software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 that has been transferred to the Department of Commerce from the Department of State by Presidential Memorandum will be subject to the EAR even when publicly available. A printed book or other printed material setting forth encryption source code is not itself subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(2)). However, notwithstanding Sec. 734.3(b)(2), encryption source code in electronic form or media (e.g., computer diskette or CD ROM) remains subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(3)). The administration continues to review whether and to what extent scannable encryption source or object code in printed form should be subject to the EAR and reserves the option to impose export controls on such software for national security and foreign policy reasons. Note that there is a new definition of ``export of encryption source code and object code software'' (see Sec. 734.2(b)(9)).    This rule creates a new License Exception KMI for exports of certain encryption software and equipment. This rule also amends part 740 and Supplement No. 2 to part 774 to reflect that encryption software will not be eligible for ``mass market'' treatment under the General Software Note or for export as beta-test software under License Exception BETA unless released from EI controls through a one-time BXA review (refer to new Supplement No. 6 to part 742). Encryption items transferred from the USML to the CCL prior to November 15, 1996 are not controlled for EI reasons. Note that License Exception TMP is available for temporary exports and reexports of encryption items except under the provisions for beta-test software. License Exceptions TMP and BAG effectively replace the Department of State's personal use exemption. Software and technology that was controlled by the Department of Commerce prior to December 30, 1996 are not affected by this rule and will continue to be eligible for the publicly available treatment. Software controlled by the Department of Commerce prior to December 30, 1996 will continue to be eligible for mass market treatment under the General Software Note, and License Exception TSU for mass-market software.    For purposes of this rule, ``recovery encryption products'' refers to encryption products (including software) that allow government officials to obtain under proper legal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user, the plaintext of encrypted data and communications. Such products fulfill the objectives of the Administration's encryption policy. Other approaches to access and recovery may be defined in the future.    This interim rule also amends part 742 to reflect the new combined national security and foreign policy controls imposed by this rule, and adds a new Supplement No. 4 titled ``Key Escrow or Key Recovery Products Criteria'' that includes product criteria, a new Supplement No. 5 titled ``Key Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Criteria, Security Policies, and Key Escrow or Key Recovery Procedures'' that includes interim requirements for key recovery agents, a new Supplement No. 6 titled ``Guidelines for Submitting a Classification Request for a Mass Market Software Product that contains Encryption'' that includes the criteria for the one-time review of classification requests for release of certain encryption software from EI controls, and a new Supplement No. 7 titled ``Review Criteria for Exporter Key Escrow or Key Recovery Development Plans.''    This interim rule also amends part 744 to add a general prohibition in Sec. 744.9 with respect to technical assistance in the development or manufacture abroad of encryption commodities and software controlled for EI reasons and makes conforming changes throughout the EAR.    This interim rule makes conforming changes in part 748 for classification requests, amends part 750 of the EAR to reflect the Department of Justice role in the review of encryption license applications, adds new definitions to part 772, and amends the Commerce Control List (Supplement No. 1 to part 774) by adding new EI controls under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002, and 5E002 for commodities, software and technology that are placed under Commerce Department jurisdiction, consistent with E.O. 13026, by Presidential Memorandum.    In certain cases, semiannual reporting requirements on quantities shipped and country of destination will be imposed on exporters, in order to allow the United States to fulfill the reporting requirements of its international obligations, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement.    The scope of controls on the release to foreign nationals of technology and software subject to the EAR may be amended in a separate Federal Register Notice.    This rule involves no new curtailment of exports, because the transfer or removal of items from the United States Munitions List to the CCL maintains a continuity of controls. Therefore, the[[Page 68576]]provisions regarding the impact of new controls do not apply, and contract sanctity also does not apply to this imposition of controls.    U.S. persons holding valid USML licenses and other approvals issued by the Department of State prior to December 30, 1996 may ship remaining balances authorized by such licenses or approvals under the authority of the EAR by filing Shippers Export Declarations (SEDs) with District Directors of Customs, citing this Federal Register Notice and the State Department license number. Such shipments shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions, including the expiration date, existing at the time of issuance of the State license. Any reports required for distribution and other types of agreements previously authorized by the Department of State, valid at the time of this publication, should be henceforth submitted to the Department of Commerce. Actions pending at the Department of State on December 30, 1996, including pending license applications, must be refiled with the Department of Commerce. Export violations, including the terms and conditions of export, shall hereafter constitute a violation of the EAR.    Consistent with the provisions of section 6 of the Export Administration Act, a foreign policy report was submitted to Congress on December 24, 1996, notifying the Congress of the Department's intention to impose controls on certain information security systems and equipment, cryptographic devices, software and components specifically designed or modified therefor, and related technology that will be controlled on the CCL and that will be subject to new control procedures.    Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August 20, 1994, the President invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extent permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and the EAR in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, notice of August 15, 1995 (60 FR 42767), and notice of August 14, 1996 (60 FR 42527).Rulemaking Requirements    1. This interim rule has been determined to be significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. A cost benefit analysis has been prepared and is available upon request by contacting James A. Lewis at (202) 482-0092.    2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information, subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), unless that collection of information displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694-0048 and 0694-0088. This rule also contains a new collection-of-information requirement subject to the PRA that has received emergency approval under OMB control number 0694-0104. The new information requirement and estimated public burden hours include: marketing plans (40 hours each); semiannual progress reports (8 hours each); safeguard procedures (4 hours); recordkeeping (2 hours); and annual reports (4 hours). These estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to OMB Desk Officer, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.    3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.    4. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military and foreign affairs function of the United States (Sec. 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this interim rule. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule under 5 U.S.C. or by any other law, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) are not applicable.    However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations, this rule is issued in interim form and comments will be considered in the development of final regulations. Accordingly, the Department encourages interested persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible time to permit the fullest consideration of their views.    The period for submission of comments will close February 13, 1997. The Department will consider all comments received before the close of the comment period in developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but their consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not accept public comments accompanied by a request that a part or all of the material be treated confidentially because of its business proprietary nature or for any other reason. The Department will return such comments and materials to the person submitting the comments and will not consider them in the development of final regulations. All public comments on these regulations will be a matter of public record and will be available for public inspection and copying. In the interest of accuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in written form.    Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will also be a matter of public record and will be available for public review and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government or foreign governments will not be made available for public inspection.    The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230. Records in this facility, including written public comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oral communications, may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulations published in Part 4 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Information about the inspection and copying of records at the facility may be obtained from Margaret Cornejo, Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Officer, at the above address or by calling (202) 482-5653.    This rule has been determined to be a major rule as defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 804(2) for purposes of Congressional review under 5 U.S.C. ch. 8. Notwithstanding 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801(a)(3), this rule is effective December 30, 1996 pursuant to authority at 5 U.S.C. Sec. 808(2) as there is good cause to waive the requirement to provide notice and public procedure thereon. This action implements an Administration initiative that is intended to protect the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and streamlines export controls for encryption items. Therefore,[[Page 68577]]notice and public procedure that would delay implementation of this rule is contrary to the public interest.List of Subjects15 CFR Part 730    Administrative practice and procedure, Advisory committees, Exports, Foreign trade, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Strategic and critical materials.15 CFR Parts 732, 740, 748, 750, and 768    Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade, Reporting and Record keeping requirements.15 CFR Part 734    Administrative practice and procedure, Exports, Foreign trade.15 CFR Parts 736, 738, 742, 772, and 774    Exports, Foreign trade.15 CFR Part 744    Exports, Foreign trade, Reporting and Recordkeeping requirements.

(ii) The export of encryption source code and object code software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List (see Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) includes downloading, or causing the downloading of, such software to locations (including electronic bulletin boards, Internet file transfer protocol, and World Wide Web sites) outside the U.S., or making such software available for transfer outside the United States, over wire, cable, radio, electromagnetic, photooptical, photoelectric or other comparable communications facilities accessible to persons outside the United States, including transfers from electronic bulletin boards, Internet file transfer protocol and World Wide Web sites, unless the person making the software available takes precautions adequate to prevent unauthorized transfer of such code outside the United States. Such precautions shall include:    (A) Ensuring that the facility from which the software is available controls the access to and transfers of such software through such measures as:    (1) The access control system, either through automated means or human intervention, checks the address of every system requesting or receiving a transfer and verifies that such systems are located within the United States;    (2) The access control system, provides every requesting or receiving party with notice that the transfer includes or would include cryptographic software subject to export controls under the Export Administration Act, and that anyone receiving such a transfer cannot export the software without a license; and    (3) Every party requesting or receiving a transfer of such software must acknowledge affirmatively that he or she understands that the cryptographic software is subject to export controls under the Export Administration Act and that anyone receiving the transfer cannot export the software without a license; or    (B) Taking other precautions, approved in writing by the Bureau of Export Administration, to prevent transfer of such software outside the U.S. without a license.    12. Section 734.3 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(3) and by adding a note to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) to read as follows:Sec. 734.3  Items subject to the EAR.* * * * *    (b) * * *    (3) Publicly available technology and software, except software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 on the Commerce Control List, that:    (i) Are already published or will be published as described in Sec. 734.7 of this part;    (ii) Arise during, or result from, fundamental research, as described in Sec. 734.8 of this part;    (iii) Are educational, as described in Sec. 734.9 of this part;    (iv) Are included in certain patent applications, as described in Sec. 734.10 of this part.    Note to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section: A printed book or other printed material setting forth encryption source code is not itself subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(2)). However, notwithstanding Sec. 734.3(b)(2), encryption source code in electronic form or media (e.g., computer diskette or CD ROM) remains subject to the EAR (see Sec. 734.3(b)(3)).* * * * *    13. Section 734.4 is amended by revising paragraph (b) and revising paragraph (h) to read as follows:Sec. 734.4  De minimis U.S. content.* * * * *    (b) There is no de minimis level for the reexport of foreign-origin items that incorporate the following:    (1) Items controlled by ECCN 9A004.a; or    (2) ``Information security'' systems and equipment, cryptographic devices, software and components specifically designed or modified therefor, and related technology controlled for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN, 5A002 ECCN 5D002, and 5E002. Certain mass market encryption software may become eligible for de minimis only after a one-time BXA review (refer to Sec. 742.15(b)(1)).* * * * *    (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, U.S.-origin technology controlled by ECCN 9E003a.1 through a.12, and .f, and related controls, and encryption software controlled for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5D002 or encryption technology controlled for ``EI'' reasons under ECCN 5E002 do not lose their U.S.-origin when redrawn, used, consulted, or otherwise commingled abroad in any respect with other software or technology of any other origin. Therefore, any subsequent or similar software or technology prepared or engineered abroad for the design, construction, operation, or maintenance of any plant or equipment, or part thereof, which is based on or uses any such U.S.-origin software or technology is subject to the EAR.    14. Section 734.5 is amended by adding paragraph (c) to read as follows:Sec. 734.5  Activities of U.S. and foreign persons subject to the EAR.* * * * *    (c) Technical assistance by U.S. persons with respect to encryption commodities or software as described in Sec. 744.9 of the EAR.    15.

(Refer to Secs. 742.15(b)(1) and 748.3(b) of the EAR for information on item classifications regarding a one-time BXA review for release from EI controls.)* * * * *PART 742--[AMENDED]    25. Part 742 is amended by revising Sec. 742.15 to read as follows:Sec. 742.15  Encryption items.    Encryption items can be used to maintain the secrecy of information, and thereby may be used by persons abroad to harm national security, foreign policy and law enforcement interests. As the President indicated in E.O. 13026 and in his Memorandum of November 15, 1996, export of encryption software, like export of encryption hardware, is controlled because of this functional capacity to encrypt information on a computer system, and not because of any informational or theoretical value that such software may reflect, contain, or represent, or that its export may convey to others abroad. For this reason, export controls on encryption software are distinguished from controls on other software regulated under the EAR.    (a) License requirements. Licenses are required for all destinations, except Canada, for ECCNs having an ``EI'' (for ``encryption items'') under the ``Control(s)'' paragraph. Such items include: encryption commodities controlled under ECCN 5A002; encryption software controlled under ECCN 5D002; and encryption technology controlled under ECCN 5E002. (Refer to part 772 of the EAR for the definition of ``encryption items'). For encryption items previously on the U.S. Munitions List and currently authorized for export or reexport under a State Department license, distribution arrangement or any other authority of the State Department, U.S. persons holding valid USML licenses and other approvals issued by the Department of State prior to December 30, 1996 may ship remaining balances authorized by such licenses or approvals under the authority of the EAR by filing Shippers Export Declarations (SEDs) with District Directors of Customs, citing the provisions of this section effective on December 30, 1996 and the State Department license number. Such shipments shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions, including the expiration date, existing at the time of issuance of the State license. Violations of such authorizations, terms and conditions constitute violations of the EAR. Any reports required for distribution and other types of agreements previously authorized by the Department of State, valid prior to December 30, 1996, should be henceforth submitted to BXA at the following address: Office of Strategic Trade and Foreign Policy Controls, Bureau of Export Administration,[[Page 68581]]Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Room 2705, Washington, D.C. 20230.    (b) Licensing policy. The following licensing policies apply to items identified in paragraph (a) of this section. This section refers you to Supplements No. 4, No. 5, and No. 7 to this part 742. For purposes of these supplements, ``products'' refers to commodities and software. Except as otherwise noted, applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by BXA, in conjunction with other agencies, to determine whether the export or reexport is consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.    (1) Certain mass-market encryption software. Consistent with E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767), certain encryption software that was transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List pursuant to the Presidential Memorandum of November 15, 1996 may be released from ``EI'' controls and thereby made eligible for mass market treatment after a one-time review. To determine eligibility for mass market treatment, exporters must submit a classification request to BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption software may be eligible for a 7-day review process, and company proprietary software may be eligible for 15-day processing. Refer to Supplement No. 6 to part 742 and Sec. 748.3(b)(3) of the EAR for additional information. Note that the one-time review is for a determination to release encryption software in object code only unless otherwise specifically requested. Exporters requesting release of the source code should refer to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to part 742. If, after a one-time review, BXA determines that the software is released from EI controls, such software is eligible for all provisions of the EAR applicable to other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-market software. If BXA determines that the software is not released from EI controls, a license is required for export and reexport to all destinations, except Canada, and license applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis.    (2) Key Escrow, Key Recovery and Recoverable encryption software and commodities. Recovery encryption software and equipment controlled for EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002, including encryption equipment designed or modified to use recovery encryption software, may be made eligible for license exception KMI after a one-time BXA review. License Exception KMI is available for all destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and Sudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit a classification request to BXA. Requests for one-time review of key escrow and key recovery encryption items will receive favorable consideration provided that, prior to the export or reexport, a key recovery agent satisfactory to BXA has been identified (refer to Supplement No. 5 to part 742) and security policies for safeguarding the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext as described in Supplement No. 5 to part 742 are established to the satisfaction of BXA and are maintained after export or reexport as required by the EAR. If the exporter or reexporter intends to be the key recovery agent, then the exporter or reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a key recovery agent identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. In addition, the key escrow or key recovery system must meet the criteria identified in Supplement No. 4 to part 742. Note that eligibility is dependent on continued fulfilment of the requirements of a key recovery agent identified in Supplement No. 5 to part 742. Since the establishment of a key management infrastructure and key recovery agents may take some time, BXA will, while the infrastructure is being built, consider requests for eligibility to export key recovery encryption products which facilitate establishment of the key management infrastructure before a key recovery agent is named, consistent with national security and foreign policy. When BXA approves such cases, exporters of products described in Supplement No. 4 to part 742 are required to furnish the name of an agent by December 31, 1998. Requests for one-time review of recoverable products which allow government officials to obtain, under proper legal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user, the plaintext of the encrypted data and communications will receive favorable consideration.    (3) Non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength supported by a satisfactory business and marketing plan for exporting recoverable items and services. (i) Manufacturers of non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength will be permitted to export and reexport under the authority of License Exception KMI provided that the requirements and conditions of the License Exception are met. Exporters must submit a classification request for an initial BXA review of the item and a satisfactory business and marketing plan that explains in detail the steps the applicant will take during the two-year transition period beginning January 1, 1997 to develop, produce, and/or market encryption items and services with recoverable features. Manufacturers would commit to produce key recovery products. Others would commit to incorporate such products into their own products or services. Such efforts can include: the scale of key recovery research and development, product development, and marketing plans; significant steps to reflect potential customer demand for key recovery products in the firm's encryption-related business; and how soon a key recovery agent will be identified. Note that BXA will accept requests for classification of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength under this paragraph from distributors, re-sellers, integrators, and other entities that are not manufacturers of the encryption items. The use of License Exception KMI is not automatic; eligibility must be renewed every six months. Renewal after each six-month period will depend on the applicant's adherence to explicit benchmarks and milestones as set forth in the plan approved with the initial license classification and amendments as approved by BXA. This relaxation of controls and use of License Exception KMI will last through December 31, 1998. The plan submitted with classifications for the export of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength must include the elements in Supplement No. 7 to part 742.    (ii) BXA will make a determination on such classification requests within 15 days of receipt. Exports and reexports of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent strength will be authorized under the provisions of License Exception KMI, contingent upon BXA's review and approval of a satisfactory progress report related to the ongoing plan submitted by the applicant. The applicant must submit a letter to BXA every six months requesting approval of the progress report. Note that distributors, re-sellers, integrators, or other entities that are not manufacturers of the encryption items are permitted to use License Exception KMI for exports and reexports of such items only in instances where a classification has been granted to the manufacturer of the encryption items or a classification has been granted to the distributors, re-sellers, integrators, or other entities. The authority to so export or reexport will be for a time period[[Page 68582]]ending on the same day the producer's authority to export or reexport ends.    (4) All other encryption items--(i) Encryption licensing arrangement. Applicants may submit license applications for exports and reexports of certain encryption commodities and software in unlimited quantities for all destinations except, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan. Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Encryption licensing arrangements may be approved with extended validity periods specified by the applicant in block #24 on Form BXA-748P. In addition, the applicant must specify the sales territory and classes of end-users. Such licenses may require the license holder to report to BXA certain information such as item description, quantity, value, and end-user name and address.    (ii) Applications for encryption items not authorized under an encryption licensing arrangement. Applications for the export and reexport of all other encryption items will be considered on a case-by-case basis.    (5) Applications for encryption technology. Applications for the export and reexport of encryption technology will be considered on a case-by-case basis.    (c) Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity provisions are not available for license applications reviewed under this section.    (d) [Reserved]    26. Part 742 is amended by revising Supplement No. 4 and Supplement No. 5, and by adding a new Supplement No. 6 and a new Supplement No. 7 to read as follows:Supplement No. 4 to Part 742--Key Escrow or Key Recovery Products CriteriaKey Recovery Feature    (1) The key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext shall be accessible through a key recovery feature.    (2) The product's cryptographic functions shall be inoperable until the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext is recoverable by government officials under proper legal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user.    (3) The output of the product shall automatically include, in an accessible format and with a reasonable frequency, the identity of the key recovery agent(s) and information sufficient for the key recovery agent(s) to identify the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt the ciphertext.    (4) The product's key recovery functions shall allow access to the key(s) or other material/information needed to decrypt the ciphertext regardless of whether the product generated or received the ciphertext.    (5) The product's key recovery functions shall allow for the recovery of all required decryption key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext during a period of authorized access without requiring repeated presentations of access authorization to the key recovery agent(s).Interoperability Feature    (6) The product's cryptographic functions may interoperate with:    (i) Other key recovery products that meet these criteria, and shall not interoperate with products whose key recovery feature has been altered, bypassed, disabled, or otherwise rendered inoperative; and    (ii) Non-key recovery products only when the key recovery product permits access to the key(s) or other material/information needed to decrypt ciphertext generated or received (i.e., one direction at a minimum) by the key recovery product.Design, Implementation and Operational Assurance    (7) The product shall be resistant to efforts to disable or circumvent the attributes described in criteria one through six.    (8) The product's cryptographic function's key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext shall be escrowed with a key recovery agent(s) (who may be a key recovery agent(s) internal to the user's organization) acceptable to BXA, pursuant to the criteria in Supplement No. 5 to Part 742. Since the establishment of a key management infrastructure and key recovery agents may take some time, BXA will, while the infrastructure is being built, consider exports of key recovery encryption products which facilitate establishment of the key management infrastructure before a key recovery agent is named.    Exporters of products described in this Supplement No. 4 to part 742 are required to furnish the name of an agent by December 31, 1998.Supplement No. 5 to Part 742--Key Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Criteria, Security Policies, and Key Escrow or Key Recovery ProceduresKey Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Requirements; Security Policies; Key Escrow or Key Recovery Procedures    This Supplement sets forth criteria that the Department of Commerce will use to approve key recovery agents to support approval of the export or reexport of key recovery encryption items controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002. Any arrangements between the exporter or reexporter and the key recovery agent must reflect the provisions contained in this Supplement in a manner satisfactory to BXA, in conjunction with other agencies. This Supplement outlines the criteria for employing key recovery agent personnel for key recovery procedures. An applicant for eligibility to export or reexport key recovery items shall provide, or cause the proposed key recovery agent to provide, to BXA sufficient information concerning any proposed key recovery agent arrangements to permit BXA's evaluation of the key recovery agent's security policies, key recovery procedures, and suitability and trustworthiness to maintain the confidentiality of the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext. The key recovery agent, who must be approved by BXA, may be the applicant for the classification request. When there is no key recovery agent involved, or the customer will self-escrow abroad, with or without a legal obligation to the exporter, the customer must be approved by BXA. BXA retains the right, in addition to any other remedies, to revoke eligibility for License Exception KMI if BXA determines that a key recovery agent no longer meets these criteria. The requirements related to the suitability and trustworthiness, security policies, and key recovery procedures of the key recovery agent shall be made terms and conditions of the License Exception for key recovery items. BXA shall require the key recovery agent to provide a representation that it will comply with such terms and conditions.    Note: Use of key recovery agents located outside the U.S. is permitted if acceptable to BXA in consultation with the host government, as appropriate.I. Key Recovery Agent Requirements    (1)(a) A key recovery agent must identify by name, date and place of birth, and social security number, individual(s) who:    (i) Is/are directly involved in the escrowing of key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or    (ii) Have access to key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext, or    (iii) Have access to information concerning requests for key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or    (iv) Respond to requests for key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or    (v) Is/are in control of the key recovery agent and have access or authority to obtain key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext, and    (b) Must certify that such individual(s) meet the requirements of the following paragraphs (b)(i) or (b)(ii). BXA reserves the right to determine at any time the suitability and trustworthiness of such individual(s). Evidence of an individual's suitability and trustworthiness shall include:    (i) Information indicating that the individual(s):    (A) Has no criminal convictions of any kind or pending criminal charges of any kind;    (B) Has not breached fiduciary responsibilities (e.g., has not violated any surety or performance bonds); and    (C) Has favorable results of a credit check; or,    (ii) Information that the individual(s) has an active U.S. government security clearance of Secret or higher issued or updated within the last five years.    (2) The key recovery agent shall timely disclose to BXA when an individual no longer meets the requirements of paragraphs I.(1)(b)(i) or (ii).    (3) A key recovery agent must, to remain eligible for License Exception KMI, identify to BXA by name, date and place of birth, and social security number any new individual(s)[[Page 68583]]who will assume the responsibilities set forth in paragraph I.(1)(a) of this Supplement. Before that individual(s) assumes such responsibilities, the key recovery agent must certify to BXA that the individual(s) meets the criteria set forth in subparagraphs I.(1)(b)(i) or (b)(ii) of this Supplement. BXA reserves the right to determine at any time the suitability and trustworthiness of such personnel.    (4) If ownership or control of a key recovery agent is transferred, no export may take place under previously issued approvals until the successor key recovery agent complies with the criteria of this Supplement.    (5) Key recovery agents shall submit suitable evidence of the key recovery agent's corporate viability and financial responsibility (e.g., a certificate of good standing from the state of incorporation, credit reports, and errors/omissions insurance).    (6) Key recovery agents shall disclose to BXA any of the following which have occurred within the ten years prior to the application:    (a) Federal or state felony convictions of the business;    (b) Material adverse civil fraud judgments or settlements; and    (c) Debarments from federal, state, or local government contracting.    The applicant shall also timely disclose to BXA the occurrence of any of the foregoing during the use of License Exception KMI.    (7) Key recovery agent(s) shall designate an individual(s) to be the security and operations officer(s).    (8) A key recovery agent may be internal to a user's organization and may consist of one or more individuals. BXA may approve such key recovery agents if sufficient information is provided to demonstrate that appropriate safeguards will be employed in handling key recovery requests from government entities. These safeguards should ensure: the key recovery agent's structural independence from the rest of the organization; security; and confidentiality.II. Security Policies    (1) Key recovery agents must implement security policies that assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the key(s) or other material/information required for decryption of the ciphertext.    (a) Procedures to assure confidentiality shall include:    (i) Encrypting all key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext while in storage, transmission, or transfer; or    (ii) Applying reasonable measures to limit access to the database (e.g. using keyed or combination locks on the entrances to escrow facilities and limiting the personnel with knowledge of or access to the keys/combinations).    (b) Procedures to assure the integrity of the database (i.e. assuring the key(s) and other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext are protected against unauthorized changes) shall include the use of access controls such as database password controls, digital signatures, system auditing, and physical access restrictions.    (c) Procedures to assure the availability of the database (i.e. assuring that key(s) and other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext are retrievable at any time) shall include system redundance, physical security, and the use of cryptography to control access.    (2) Policies and procedures shall be designed and operated so that a failure by a single person, procedure, or mechanism does not compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of key(s)or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext. Security policies and procedures may include, but are not limited to, multi-person control of access to recoverable keys, split keys, and back-up capabilities.    (3) Key recovery agents shall implement policies that protect against unauthorized disclosure of information regarding whose encryption material is stored, the fact that key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext was requested or provided, and the identity of a requester. Procedures to assure the confidentiality of this information shall include those described in paragraph II.(1)(a) of this supplement.    (4) Key recovery agents shall provide to BXA prompt notice of a compromise of a security policy or of the confidentiality of key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext.III. Key Recovery Procedures    (1) Key recovery agents shall maintain the ability to make the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext available until notified otherwise by BXA. Key recovery agents shall make requested key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext available, to the extent required by the request, within two hours from the time they receive a request from a government agency acting under appropriate legal authority.    (2) Key recovery agents shall maintain data regarding key recovery requests received, release of key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext, database changes, system administration access, and dates of such events for purposes of audits by BXA.    (3) The key recovery agent must transfer all key recovery equipment, key(s) and/or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext, key recovery database, and all administrative information necessary to its key recovery operations to another key recovery agent approved by BXA in the event that:    (a) The key recovery agent dissolves or otherwise terminates escrowing operations, or    (b) BXA determines that there is a risk of such dissolution or termination, or    (c) BXA determines that the key recovery agent is no longer suitable or trustworthy.Supplement No. 6 to Part 742--Guidelines for Submitting a Classification Request for a Mass Market Software Product That Contains Encryption    Classification requests for release of certain mass market encryption software from EI controls must be submitted on Form BXA-748P, in accordance with Sec. 748.3 of the EAR. To expedite review of the request, clearly mark the envelope ``Attn.: Mass Market Encryption Software Classification Request''.

(2) The product's cryptographic functions shall be inoperable until the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext is recoverable by government officials under proper legal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user.    (3) The output of the product shall automatically include, in an accessible format and with a reasonable frequency, the identity of the key recovery agent(s) and information sufficient for the key recovery agent(s) to identify the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt the ciphertext.    (4) The product's key recovery functions shall allow access to the key(s) or other material/information needed to decrypt the ciphertext regardless of whether the product generated or received the ciphertext.    (5) The product's key recovery functions shall allow for the recovery of all required decryption key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext during a period of authorized access without requiring repeated presentations of access authorization to the key recovery agent(s).Interoperability Feature    (6) The product's cryptographic functions may interoperate with:    (i) Other key recovery products that meet these criteria, and shall not interoperate with products whose key recovery feature has been altered, bypassed, disabled, or otherwise rendered inoperative; and    (ii) Non-key recovery products only when the key recovery product permits access to the key(s) or other material/information needed to decrypt ciphertext generated or received (i.e., one direction at a minimum) by the key recovery product.Design, Implementation and Operational Assurance    (7) The product shall be resistant to efforts to disable or circumvent the attributes described in criteria one through six.    (8) The product's cryptographic function's key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext shall be escrowed with a key recovery agent(s) (who may be a key recovery agent(s) internal to the user's organization) acceptable to BXA, pursuant to the criteria in Supplement No. 5 to Part 742. Since the establishment of a key management infrastructure and key recovery agents may take some time, BXA will, while the infrastructure is being built, consider exports of key recovery encryption products which facilitate establishment of the key management infrastructure before a key recovery agent is named.    Exporters of products described in this Supplement No. 4 to part 742 are required to furnish the name of an agent by December 31, 1998.WT01-B08-214IA096-001028-B015-45http://www.bxa.doc.gov:80/supp5.htm 207.96.70.148 19970215010035 text/html 10412HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Fri, 14 Feb 1997 21:01:36 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 10240Last-modified: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 00:54:18 GMT Supplement No. 5 to Part 742--Key Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Criteria, Security Policies, and Key Escrow or Key Recovery Procedures Supplement No. 5 to Part 742--Key Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Criteria, Security Policies, and Key Escrow or Key Recovery ProceduresKey Escrow or Key Recovery Agent Requirements; Security Policies; Key Escrow or Key Recovery Procedures    This Supplement sets forth criteria that the Department of Commerce will use to approve key recovery agents to support approval of the export or reexport of key recovery encryption items controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002. Any arrangements between the exporter or reexporter and the key recovery agent must reflect the provisions contained in this Supplement in a manner satisfactory to BXA, in conjunction with other agencies. This Supplement outlines the criteria for employing key recovery agent personnel for key recovery procedures. An applicant for eligibility to export or reexport key recovery items shall provide, or cause the proposed key recovery agent to provide, to BXA sufficient information concerning any proposed key recovery agent arrangements to permit BXA's evaluation of the key recovery agent's security policies, key recovery procedures, and suitability and trustworthiness to maintain the confidentiality of the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext. The key recovery agent, who must be approved by BXA, may be the applicant for the classification request. When there is no key recovery agent involved, or the customer will self-escrow abroad, with or without a legal obligation to the exporter, the customer must be approved by BXA. BXA retains the right, in addition to any other remedies, to revoke eligibility for License Exception KMI if BXA determines that a key recovery agent no longer meets these criteria. The requirements related to the suitability and trustworthiness, security policies, and key recovery procedures of the key recovery agent shall be made terms and conditions of the License Exception for key recovery items. BXA shall require the key recovery agent to provide a representation that it will comply with such terms and conditions.    Note: Use of key recovery agents located outside the U.S. is permitted if acceptable to BXA in consultation with the host government, as appropriate.I. Key Recovery Agent Requirements    (1)(a) A key recovery agent must identify by name, date and place of birth, and social security number, individual(s) who:    (i) Is/are directly involved in the escrowing of key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or    (ii) Have access to key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext, or    (iii) Have access to information concerning requests for key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or    (iv) Respond to requests for key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext; or    (v) Is/are in control of the key recovery agent and have access or authority to obtain key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext, and    (b) Must certify that such individual(s) meet the requirements of the following paragraphs (b)(i) or (b)(ii). BXA reserves the right to determine at any time the suitability and trustworthiness of such individual(s). Evidence of an individual's suitability and trustworthiness shall include:    (i) Information indicating that the individual(s):    (A) Has no criminal convictions of any kind or pending criminal charges of any kind;    (B) Has not breached fiduciary responsibilities (e.g., has not violated any surety or performance bonds); and    (C) Has favorable results of a credit check; or,    (ii) Information that the individual(s) has an active U.S. government security clearance of Secret or higher issued or updated within the last five years.    (2) The key recovery agent shall timely disclose to BXA when an individual no longer meets the requirements of paragraphs I.(1)(b)(i) or (ii).    (3) A key recovery agent must, to remain eligible for License Exception KMI, identify to BXA by name, date and place of birth, and social security number any new individual(s)who will assume the responsibilities set forth in paragraph I.(1)(a) of this Supplement. Before that individual(s) assumes such responsibilities, the key recovery agent must certify to BXA that the individual(s) meets the criteria set forth in subparagraphs I.(1)(b)(i) or (b)(ii) of this Supplement. BXA reserves the right to determine at any time the suitability and trustworthiness of such personnel.    (4) If ownership or control of a key recovery agent is transferred, no export may take place under previously issued approvals until the successor key recovery agent complies with the criteria of this Supplement.    (5) Key recovery agents shall submit suitable evidence of the key recovery agent's corporate viability and financial responsibility (e.g., a certificate of good standing from the state of incorporation, credit reports, and errors/omissions insurance).    (6) Key recovery agents shall disclose to BXA any of the following which have occurred within the ten years prior to the application:    (a) Federal or state felony convictions of the business;    (b) Material adverse civil fraud judgments or settlements; and    (c) Debarments from federal, state, or local government contracting.    The applicant shall also timely disclose to BXA the occurrence of any of the foregoing during the use of License Exception KMI.    (7) Key recovery agent(s) shall designate an individual(s) to be the security and operations officer(s).    (8) A key recovery agent may be internal to a user's organization and may consist of one or more individuals. BXA may approve such key recovery agents if sufficient information is provided to demonstrate that appropriate safeguards will be employed in handling key recovery requests from government entities. These safeguards should ensure: the key recovery agent's structural independence from the rest of the organization; security; and confidentiality.II. Security Policies    (1) Key recovery agents must implement security policies that assure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the key(s) or other material/information required for decryption of the ciphertext.    (a) Procedures to assure confidentiality shall include:    (i) Encrypting all key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext while in storage, transmission, or transfer; or    (ii) Applying reasonable measures to limit access to the database (e.g. using keyed or combination locks on the entrances to escrow facilities and limiting the personnel with knowledge of or access to the keys/combinations).    (b) Procedures to assure the integrity of the database (i.e. assuring the key(s) and other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext are protected against unauthorized changes) shall include the use of access controls such as database password controls, digital signatures, system auditing, and physical access restrictions.    (c) Procedures to assure the availability of the database (i.e. assuring that key(s) and other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext are retrievable at any time) shall include system redundance, physical security, and the use of cryptography to control access.    (2) Policies and procedures shall be designed and operated so that a failure by a single person, procedure, or mechanism does not compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of key(s)or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext. Security policies and procedures may include, but are not limited to, multi-person control of access to recoverable keys, split keys, and back-up capabilities.    (3) Key recovery agents shall implement policies that protect against unauthorized disclosure of information regarding whose encryption material is stored, the fact that key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext was requested or provided, and the identity of a requester. Procedures to assure the confidentiality of this information shall include those described in paragraph II.(1)(a) of this supplement.    (4) Key recovery agents shall provide to BXA prompt notice of a compromise of a security policy or of the confidentiality of key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext.III. Key Recovery Procedures    (1) Key recovery agents shall maintain the ability to make the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext available until notified otherwise by BXA. Key recovery agents shall make requested key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext available, to the extent required by the request, within two hours from the time they receive a request from a government agency acting under appropriate legal authority.    (2) Key recovery agents shall maintain data regarding key recovery requests received, release of key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext, database changes, system administration access, and dates of such events for purposes of audits by BXA.    (3) The key recovery agent must transfer all key recovery equipment, key(s) and/or other material/information required to decrypt ciphertext, key recovery database, and all administrative information necessary to its key recovery operations to another key recovery agent approved by BXA in the event that:    (a) The key recovery agent dissolves or otherwise terminates escrowing operations, or    (b) BXA determines that there is a risk of such dissolution or termination, or    (c) BXA determines that the key recovery agent is no longer suitable or trustworthy.WT01-B08-215IA096-001028-B015-78http://www.bxa.doc.gov:80/supp6.htm 207.96.70.148 19970215010048 text/html 8950HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Fri, 14 Feb 1997 21:01:51 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 8779Last-modified: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 00:32:24 GMT Supplement No. 6 to Part 742--Guidelines for Submitting a Classification Request for a Mass Market Software Product That Contains Encryption Supplement No. 6 to Part 742--Guidelines for Submitting a Classification Request for a Mass Market Software Product That Contains Encryption    Classification requests for release of certain mass market encryption software from EI controls must be submitted on Form BXA-748P, in accordance with Sec. 748.3 of the EAR.

Clinton, President of the United States of   America, have decided that the provisions set forth below shall   apply to administration of the export control system maintained   by the Export Administration Regulations, 15 Cfr Part 730   et seq. ("the Ear").  Accordingly, it is hereby ordered as   follows:         Section 1.  Treatment of Encryption Products.  In order   to provide for appropriate controls on the export and foreign   dissemination of encryption products, export controls of   encryption products that are or would be, on this date,   designated as defense articles in Category Xiii of the   United States Munitions List and regulated by the United States   Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act,   22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq. ("the Aeca"), but that subsequently are   placed on the Commerce Control List in the Ear, shall be subject   to the following conditions:  (a)  I have determined that the   export of encryption products described in this section could   harm national security and foreign policy interests even where   comparable products are or appear to be available from sources   outside the United States, and that facts and questions   concerning the foreign availability of such encryption products   cannot be made subject to public disclosure or judicial review   without revealing or implicating classified information that   could harm United States national security and foreign policy   interests.  Accordingly, sections 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of   the Export Administration Act of 1979 ("the Eaa"), 50 U.S.C.   App. 2403(c) and 2405(h)(2)-(4), as amended and as continued   in effect by Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and   by notices of August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996, all   other analogous provisions of the Eaa relating to foreign   availability, and the regulations in the Ear relating to such   Eaa provisions, shall not be applicable with respect to export   controls on such encryption products.  Notwithstanding this,   the Secretary of Commerce ("Secretary") may, in his discretion,   consider the foreign availability of comparable encryption   products in determining whether to issue a license in a   particular case or to remove controls on particular products,   but is not required to issue licenses in particular cases or   to remove controls on particular products based on such   consideration;         (b)  Executive Order 12981, as amended by Executive   Order 13020 of October 12, 1996, is further amended as follows:         (1)  A new section 6 is added to read as follows:    "Sec. 6.  Encryption Products.  In conducting the license   review described in section 1 above, with respect to export   controls of encryption products that are or would be, on   November 15, 1996, designated as defense articles in Category                                    more         	    	      	   	     	       	    (Over)                                  2    Xiii of the United States Munitions List and regulated by the   United States Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export   Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq., but that subsequently are   placed on the Commerce Control List in the Export Administration   Regulations, the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, and   Justice and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency shall have   the opportunity to review any export license application   submitted to the Department of Commerce.  The Department of   Justice shall, with respect to such encryption products, be a   voting member of the Export Administration Review Board   described in section 5(a)(1) of this order and of the Advisory   Committee on Export Policy described in section 5(a)(2) of this   order.  The Department of Justice shall be a full member of the   Operating Committee of the Acep described in section 5(a)(3) of   this order, and of any other committees and consultation groups   reviewing export controls with respect to such encryption   products."         (2)  Sections 6 and 7 of Executive Order 12981 of   December 5, 1995, are renumbered as new sections 7 and 8,   respectively.         (c)  Because the export of encryption software, like the   export of other encryption products described in this section,   must be controlled because of such software's functional   capacity, rather than because of any possible informational   value of such software, such software shall not be considered   or treated as "technology," as that term is defined in   section 16 of the Eaa (50 U.S.C. App. 2415) and in the Ear   (61 Fed. Reg. 12714, March 25, 1996);         (d)  With respect to encryption products described in this   section, the Secretary shall take such actions, including the   promulgation of rules, regulations, and amendments thereto, as   may be necessary to control the export of assistance (including   training) to foreign persons in the same manner and to the same   extent as the export of such assistance is controlled under the   Aeca, as amended by section 151 of Public Law 104-164;         (e)  Appropriate controls on the export and foreign   dissemination of encryption products described in this section   may include, but are not limited to, measures that promote the   use of strong encryption products and the development of a key   recovery management infrastructure; and         (f)  Regulation of encryption products described in this   section shall be subject to such further conditions as the   President may direct.         Sec. 2.  Effective Date.  The provisions described in   section 1 shall take effect as soon as any encryption products   described in section 1 are placed on the Commerce Control List   in the Ear.         Sec. 3.  Judicial Review.  This order is intended only to   improve the internal management of the executive branch and to   ensure the implementation of appropriate controls on the export   and foreign dissemination of encryption products.  It is not   intended to, and does not, create any rights to administrative   or judicial review, or any other right or benefit or trust   responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable   by a party against the United States, its agencies or   instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other   person.

Moreover, such products, when used by international criminal   organizations, can threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here   and abroad, as well as the safety of the citizens of other   countries.  The exportation of encryption products accordingly   must be controlled to further U.S. foreign policy objectives,   and promote our national security, including the protection of   the safety of U.S. citizens abroad.  Nonetheless, because of   the increasingly widespread use of encryption products for the   legitimate protection of the privacy of data and communications   in nonmilitary contexts; because of the importance to U.S.   economic interests of the market for encryption products;   and because, pursuant to the terms set forth in the Executive   order entitled Administration of Export Controls on Encryption   Products (the "new Executive order") of November 15, 1996,   Commerce Department controls of the export of such dual-use   encryption products can be accomplished without compromising   U.S. foreign policy objectives and national security interests,   I have determined at this time not to continue to designate such   encryption products as defense articles on the United States   Munitions List.    Accordingly, under the powers vested in me by the Constitution   and the laws of the United States, I direct that:    1.  Encryption products that presently are or would be   designated in Category Xiii of the United States Munitions   List and regulated by the Department of State pursuant to   the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq.) shall   be transferred to the Commerce Control List, and regulated   by the Department of Commerce under the authority conferred                                    more         	    	      	   	     	       	    (Over)                                  2    in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 (as continued on   August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996), Executive Order 12981   of December 5, 1995, and the new Executive order except   that encryption products specifically designed, developed,   configured, adapted, or modified for military applications   (including command, control, and intelligence applications),   shall continue to be designated as defense articles, shall   remain on the United States Munitions List, and shall continue   to be controlled under the Arms Export Control Act.  The   transfer described in this paragraph shall be effective upon   the issuance of final regulations (the "Final Regulations")   implementing the safeguards specified in this directive and   in the new Executive order.    2.  The Final Regulations shall specify that the encryption   products specified in section 1 of this memorandum shall be   placed on the Commerce Control List administered by the   Department of Commerce.  The Department of Commerce shall,   to the extent permitted by law, administer the export of such   encryption products, including encryption software, pursuant   to the requirements of sections 5 and 6 of the former Export   Administration Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the   regulations thereunder, as continued in effect by Executive   Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 (continued on August 15, 1995,   and on August 14, 1996), except as otherwise indicated in or   modified by the new Executive order, Executive Order 12981 of   December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders and laws cited   therein.    3.  The Final Regulations shall provide that encryption   products described in section 1 of this memorandum can be   licensed for export only if the requirements of the controls   of both sections 5 and 6 of the former Export Administration   Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the regulations   thereunder, as modified by the new Executive order, Executive   Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders   and laws cited therein, are satisfied.  Consistent with   section 742.1(f) of the current Export Administration   Regulations, the Final Regulations shall ensure that a license   for such a product will be issued only if an application can   be and is approved under both section 5 and section 6.  The   controls on such products will apply to all destinations.    Except for those products transferred to the Commerce Control   List prior to the effective date of the Final Regulations,   exports and reexports of encryption products shall initially be   subject to case-by-case review to ensure that export thereof   would be consistent with U.S. foreign policy objectives and   national security interests, including the safety of U.S.   citizens.  Consideration shall be given to more liberalized   licensing treatment of each such individual product after   interagency review is completed.  The Final Regulations shall   also effectuate all other specific objectives and directives set   forth in this directive.    4.  Because encryption source code can easily and mechanically   be transformed into object code, and because export of such   source code is controlled because of the code's functional   capacity, rather than because of any "information" such code   might convey, the Final Regulations shall specify that   encryption source code shall be treated as an encryption   product, and not as technical data or technology, for export   licensing purposes.    5.  All provisions in the Final Regulations regarding   "de minimis" domestic content of items shall not apply with   respect to the encryption products described in paragraph 1   of this memorandum.                                   more                                  3    6.  The Final Regulations shall, in a manner consistent with   section 16(5)(C) of the Eaa, 50 U.S.C. App. 2415(5)(C), provide   that it will constitute an export of encryption source code   or object code software for a person to make such software   available for transfer outside the United States, over radio,   electromagnetic, photooptical, or photoelectric communications   facilities accessible to persons outside the United States,   including transfer from electronic bulletin boards and Internet   file transfer protocol sites, unless the party making the   software available takes precautions adequate to prevent the   unauthorized transfer of such code outside the United States.    7.  Until the Final Regulations are issued, the Department of   State shall continue to have authority to administer the export   of encryption products described in section 1 of this memorandum   as defense articles designated in Category Xiii of the United   States Munitions List, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act.    8.  Upon enactment of any legislation reauthorizing the   administration of export controls, the Secretary of Defense,   the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General shall reexamine   whether adequate controls on encryption products can be   maintained under the provisions of the new statute and advise   the Secretary of Commerce of their conclusions as well as any   recommendations for action.  If adequate controls on encryption   products cannot be maintained under a new statute, then such   products shall, where consistent with law, be designated or   redesignated as defense articles under 22 U.S.C. 2778(a)(1),   to be placed on the United States Munitions List and controlled   pursuant to the terms of the Arms Export Control Act and the   International Traffic in Arms Regulations.  Any disputes   regarding the decision to designate or redesignate shall be   resolved by the President.             	    	      	   	     William J.

The new Executive order relates to my decision to transfer   certain encryption products from the United States Munitions   List administered by the Department of State to the Commerce   Control List administered by the Department of Commerce.    When I made that decision I also decided to amend Executive   Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, which sets forth procedures   for the interagency review and disposition of dual-use export   license applications, to include the Department of Justice   among the agencies that have the opportunity to review such   applications with respect to encryption products transferred   to Department of Commerce control.    Also, in issuing the new order, I provided for appropriate   controls on the export and foreign dissemination of encryption   products transferred to the Department of Commerce.  Among   other provisions, I determined that the export of encryption   products transferred to Department of Commerce control could   harm national security and foreign policy interests of the   United States even where comparable products are or appear to   be available from foreign sources.  Accordingly, the new order   makes clear that any Eaa provision dealing with issuance of   licenses or removal of controls based on foreign availability   considerations shall not apply with respect to export controls   on such encryption products.  Notwithstanding this, the   Secretary of Commerce retains the discretion to consider the   foreign availability of comparable encryption products in any   particular case.

You may also wish to visit our page that provides "Know Your Customer Guidance". The customer or its address is similar to one of the parties found on the Commerce Department's [BXA's] list of denied persons. Case example. The customer or purchasing agent is reluctant to offer information about the end-use of the item. The product's capabilities do not fit the buyer's line of business, such as an order for sophisticated computers for a small bakery. The item ordered is incompatible with the technical level of the country to which it is being shipped, such as semiconductor manufacturing equipment being shipped to a country that has no electronics industry. The customer is willing to pay cash for a very expensive item when the terms of sale would normally call for financing. The customer has little or no business background. The customer is unfamiliar with the product's performance characteristics but still wants the product. Routine installation, training, or maintenance services are declined by the customer. Delivery dates are vague, or deliveries are planned for out of the way destinations. A freight forwarding firm is listed as the product's final destination. The shipping route is abnormal for the product and destination. Packaging is inconsistent with the stated method of shipment or destination. When questioned, the buyer is evasive and especially unclear about whether the purchased product is for domestic use, for export, or for reexport.

Certain provisions in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) require an exporter to submit an individual validated license application if the exporter "knows" that an export that is otherwise exempt from the validated licensing requirments is for end-uses involving nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons (CBW), or related missile delivery systems, in named destinations listed in the regulations. BXA has issued the following guidance on how individuals and firms should act under this knowledge standard. This guidance does not change or revise the EAR. Decide whether there are "red flags." Take into account any abnormal circumstances in a transaction that indicate that the export may be destined for an inappropriate end-use, end-user, or destination. Such circumstances are referred to as "red flags." Included among examples of red flags are orders for items which are inconsistent with the needs of the purchaser, a customer's declining installation and testing when included in the sales price or when normally requested, or requests for equipment configurations which are incompatible with the stated destination (e.g.--120 volts in a country with a standard of 220 volts). Commerce has developed lists of such "red flags" which are not all-inclusive but are intended to illustrate the types of circumstances that should cause reasonable suspicion that a transaction will violate the EAR. If there are "red flags." If there are no "red flags" in the information that comes to your firm, you should be able to proceed with a transaction in reliance on information you have received. That is, absent "red flags" (or an express requirement in the EAR), there is no affirmative duty upon exporters to inquire, verify, or otherwise "go behind" the customer's representations. However, when "red flags" are raised in the information that comes to your firm, you have a duty to check out the suspicious circumstances and inquire about the end-use, end-user, or ultimate country of destination. The duty to check out "red flags" is not confined to the use of general licenses affected by the "know" or "reason to know" language in the EAR. Applicants for validated licenses are required by the EAR to obtain documentary evidence concerning the transaction, and misrepresentation or concealment of material facts is prohibited, both in the licensing process and in all export control documents. You can rely upon representations from your customer and repeat them in the documents you file unless "red flags" oblige you to take verification steps. Do not self-blind. Do not cut off the flow of information that comes to your firm in the normal course of business. For example, do not instruct the sales force to tell potential customers to refrain from discussing the actual end-use, end-user and ultimate country of destination for the product your firm is seeking to sell. Do not put on blinders that prevent the learning of relevant information. An affirmative policy of steps to avoid "bad" information would not insulate a company from liability, and it would usually be considered an aggravating factor in an enforcement proceeding. Employees need to know how to handle "red flags." Knowledge possessed by an employee of a company can be imputed to a firm so as to make it liable for a violation. This makes it important for firms to establish clear policies and effective compliance procedures to ensure that such knowledge about transactions can be evaluated by responsible senior officials. Failure to do so could be regarded as a form of self-blinding. Reevaluate all the information after the inquiry The purpose of this inquiry and reevaluation is to determine whether the "red flags" can be explained or justified. If they can, you may proceed with the transaction. If the "red flags" cannot be explained or justified and you proceed, you run the risk of having had "knowledge" that would make your action a violation of the EAR. Refrain from the transaction, disclose the information to BXA [See how to report a possible violation], and wait. If you continue to have reason for concern after your inquiry, then you should either refrain from the transaction or submit all the relevant information to BXA in the form of an application for a validated license or in such other form as BXA may specify. Industry has an important role to play in preventing exports and reexports contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. BXA will continue to work in partnership with industry to make this front line of defense effective, while minimizing the regulatory burden on exporters.

Export Enforcement Conferences Business Executives Enforcement Teams [BEETs] -- In today's fast-paced and increasingly global business environment, staying on top of the information you need and knowing the rules of the game have become essential for survival. From its inception in 1991, the "Business Executives' Enforcement Team" (BEET) has become the forum for industry executives who need to stay current with the latest in practical, "hands-on" export enforcement topics. Just as important, the BEET provides a direct communication link between the business and the export enforcement communities. That's why BXA's Office of Export Enforcement, formed the BEET, and why more than 2800 business executives have participated in this program, taking advantage of the unique opportunity to present their concerns and communicate directly with senior U.S. enforcement officials to learn about new and ongoing enforcement initiatives. Current BEET membership consists of individuals from various industries located throughout the United States. As Export Enforcement reshapes its mission to reflect enhanced controls on weapons technologies -- chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, and the means to deliver them, interaction with senior corporate officers of industries affected by these controls is especially welcomed.

Franco, of South River, New Jersey, was also denied exporting privileges for five years. Only a few months after Franco's sentencing, an Arizona manufacturer received an order from Franco's firm. Even though the order was a domestic transaction, the manufacturer's export administrator routinely cross-checked the order against its current list of denied parties. The firm discovered that both the name and the address corresponded to a "denied party" -- that is, a person or business which has been denied U.S. export privileges -- and so the firm contacted the Department of Commerce's Office of Export Enforcement. It was a chilly day in October 1992, when Commerce Special Agents from the New York City Field Office visited the United Parcel Service office nearest Franco in South River N.J. They discovered Franco was receiving deliveries from various manufacturers on a weekly and sometimes daily basis. Subsequent inquiries with the U.S. Postal Service also disclosed that Franco had been mailing frequent "express mail export service packages." Further investigation by Commerce Export Enforcement, and a search of Franco's business, revealed additional evidence of violations of the Export Administration Regulations and the July 1992 denial order. On March 9, 1994, Franco was arrested and charged with violating the terms of the 1992 denial order. He was subsequently found guilty, fined $3,000, and served five months imprisonment which was followed by three years supervised release. In addition, he was denied export privileges for an additional ten years. Illegal exporting activities can be stopped by export administrators who check their domestic and overseas orders against the current list of denied parties. When a company discovers it is dealing with a denied party, the export administrator should immediately inform Commerce's Office of Export Enforcement.

Typically such investigations are initiated as the result of a petition from industry. A 232 investigation is similar to other BXA research assessments, as a survey is devised and data collected from the industrial sector in question. The final report, which includes findings and recommendations, is submitted to the President no later than 270 days after the date of initiation. Should the assessment determine that imports represent a threat to national security, the President then has 90 days to determine whether to use his Section 232 statutory authority to "adjust imports." BXA has conducted a number of Section 232 investigations resulting in Presidential action to negotiate voluntary restraint agreements with Japan and Taiwan for machine tools, impose "Buy America" restrictions for military-use antifriction bearings, and most recently, authorizing a $30 million collaborative research and development initiative between the domestic semiconductor ceramic packaging industry and the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), to cite several examples. Section 232 Investigations have been completed on the following industries; click on any title to read a brief summary of the study: Crude Oil and Petroleum Products (February 1995) Ceramic Semiconductor Packages (August 1993) Gears and Gearing Products (July 1992) You can order BXA critical technology assessments at the Commerce Department's National Technical Information Service (NTIS) by calling the NTIS Sales Desk at 703-487-4650 or the Rush Order Desk at 1-800-553-NTIS.

The Effect of Imports of Crude Oil and Petroleum Products on the National Security (PB 95-101382) February 1995 - Price $95 At the request of the Independent Petroleum Association of America and several other industry associations, the Department of Commerce/Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) conducted an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, to determine the effect of imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products on U.S. national security. The report found that since the previous Section 232 Petroleum finding in 1988 (see Effects of Crude Oil and Refined Petroleum Product Imports on the National Security, January 1989), there had been some improvement in U.S. energy security. The breakup of the Soviet Union and the apparent disarray within OPEC have enhanced U.S. energy security. Lower oil prices on balance have benefitted the U.S. economy. However, factors leading toward a contraction of the U.S. petroleum industry and, as a result, a growing import dependence, led BXA to find that petroleum imports threaten to impair the national security. Return to top of page Return to selections for ordering information The Effect of Imports of Ceramic Semiconductor Packages on the National Security (PB 93-192441) August 1993 - Price $95 At the request of Coors Electronic Package Company and Ceramic Process Systems Corporation, the Department of Commerce/Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) conducted an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, to determine the effect of imports of ceramic semiconductor packages on the national security. The report is an economic assessment of the U.S. ceramic semiconductor package industry. It notes that from a military perspective, ceramic packages are a key component of the microelectronic element of virtually every U.S. military system. Defense products account for about 20 percent of all ceramic packages used in the United States. The investigation found that the U.S. industry suffered declines in profitability, capacity, capacity utilization, investment and employment between 1990 and 1992. The report concluded that conditions in the ceramic package industry did not present an immediate threat to national security, but improving the capabilities of the domestic industry was deemed desirable for both economic and national security reasons. Return to top of page Return to selections for ordering information The Effect of Imports of Gears and Gearing Products on the National Security (PB 93-192466) July 1992 - Price $95 At the request of the American Gear Manufacturers Association, the Department of Commerce/Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) conducted an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, to determine the effect of imports of gears and gearing products on the national security. The report was created following a comprehensive mandatory survey of the domestic industry. The report is an economic assessment of the U.S. gear industry. It notes that gears are critical to the U.S. industrial base and are essential to both the construction and performance of nearly all weapon systems and commercial machinery and equipment of all types. The report examines the ability of the domestic industry to meet the defense needs of the U.S., as well as the extent of U.S. dependence on foreign sourced gears and production equipment. It concluded that "it is important for the U.S. to maintain a competitive and technologically viable domestic gear production base." BXA found that gear imports did not represent a threat to U.S. national security. However, BXA encouraged the Department of Defense to carefully consider the national security issued raised in the report and continue its significant effort to support defense-critical gear industry research.

Assessments have been published on such industries as gears, precision optics, robotics, and semiconductor wafer processing equipment, among others, as well as a detailed foreign dependency assessment of three U.S. Navy weapon systems. Most of these studies were conducted at the request of the Defense Department's secretariat or one of its service branches.

National Security Assessment of the Cartridge and Propellant Actuated Device Industry (PB 96-100045) September 1995 - Price $95 This assessment addresses the health and competitiveness of the cartridge and propellant actuated device (CAD/PAD) industry. CAD/PADs are explosive devices used predominantly in weapon systems, performing such functions as aircrew ejection in emergencies, flare ejection, and bomb and missile releases, but also have a growing use in commercial applications, such as automobile airbags, emergency cutting tools, and fire extinguisher actuators. This assessment was undertaken at the request of the U.S. Navy's Naval Surface Warfare Center in Indian Head, Maryland. The Navy initiated the study out of concern for the long-term survival of the firms that supply these products. The assessment found a one-third drop in the number of suppliers, a shrinking defense sector and a growing commercial sector, and that the small suppliers, who were most likely to rely on defense endmarkets, were in the worst financial condition. The study recommended that the Navy initiate bi-annual meetings with industry to build a closer working relationship with the remaining firms, to give information about the potential future demand, and to better understand the problems of industry. It was also suggested that the facility in Indian Head, MD, be used as a pre-shipping test facility, to help alleviate the delays that were uncovered in the study. Finally, the Commerce Department also introduced the remaining CAD/PAD firms to a potential new market, Department of Justice law enforcement programs, which will allow these firms to maintain defense capabilities while exploring other markets. Return to top of page Return to selections for ordering information National Security Assessment of the U.S. Beryllium Industry (PB 93-192458) July 1993 - Price $95 This report was conducted at the request of the Department of the Navy. The Navy sought to determine the percentage of scrap generated by defense contractors' beryllium operations, as well as the procedures for recycling this scrap. The scope of the study was expanded to include: other key beryllium products; a review of economic and trade factors; and how global developments in the former Soviet Union may affect the viability of the U.S. beryllium sector. This assessment found that the importance of beryllium to the defense industrial base lies in its unique properties. These properties enable beryllium to play a central role in our national defense, and have contributed greatly to advances in electronics, optics and telecommunications. The report notes that the United States is by far the world's largest producer, processor and consumer of beryllium related products. The report concluded that the long-term health of the beryllium sector is uncertain. Environmental costs continue to rise faster than revenues, and at margin continue to constrain the market potential of beryllium, at both the manufacturing point and among potential customers. The potential for a surge in supply of beryllium on the world market from Kazakstan has increased. Finally, concerns about the sale of beryllium copper master alloy from the National Defense Stockpile were expressed because of potentially disruptive effects the sale could have on the domestic industry. Return to top of page Return to selections for ordering information National Security Assessment of the Anti-Friction Bearings Industry (PB 93-154474) February 1993 - Price $95 Conducted at the request of the Department of Defense, this report analyzed the impact of the Pentagon's "Buy America" restriction on bearings, reports on the industry's international competitiveness and the growing presence of foreign-owned firms in the U.S. market, and provides comprehensive trade and other economic data benchmarked against trends in the wider economy. The report found that the "Buy America" guidelines had a positive impact on the industry and U.S. national security, and concluded that removing the restriction at this time would have a particularly negative impact on the high-technology superprecision bearing sector. This study demonstrated that the defense-intensive U.S. superprecision bearing sector was most important to national security. The superprecision sector's viability was threatened, however, by decreasing defense budgets, worldwide overcapacity, and the reported difficulty to access foreign markets, particularly Japan. Return to top of page Return to selections for ordering information National Security Assessment of the U.S. Forging Industry (PB 93-183721) December 1992 - Price $95 The Department of Commerce conducted this report at the request of the Department of Defense to determine if "Buy America" restrictions limiting military procurement of certain forgings was still necessary. The result was a comprehensive assessment of policy options available to maintain defense industrial capabilities in an era of decreasing resources. The report was created following a mandatory survey of the domestic industry. This study demonstrated how the viability of an archetypical defense-intensive heavy manufacturing industry is influenced by the decline of its domestic endmarkets, high import penetration, encroaching alternative technologies, and lagging investment and profitability. The study notes that removal of Defense "Buy America" restrictions could jeopardize companies' financial health and/or lead some remaining domestic forging suppliers to exit the defense market. In addition, the study recommends making maximum use of the Department of Defense's MANTECH Programs to assist forging defense suppliers in modernizing. The study also suggested encouraging the forging sector to consolidate into larger, more technically efficient firms. Return to top of page Return to selections for ordering information National Security Assessment of the Domestic and Foreign Subcontractor Base A study of Three U.S. Navy Weapons Systems (PB 93-183739) March 1992 - Price $95 Conducted at the request of the Department of the Navy, this report assessed the extent to which the U.S. Navy relies on foreign suppliers for critical components for its weapon systems. Three representative systems were chosen for analysis: the HARM missile; the Mark-48 ADCAP torpedo; and the Verdin communications system. The study focused on subtier suppliers, the first known study of its kind to do so. Almost 12,000 companies participated in the project. The study found that the supply matrix is not pyramid-shaped as expected but is in fact diamond-shaped, indicating that there is a core group of subtier firms unknown to the Navy that could serve as bottlenecks during a surge in production. Foreign-sourcing was found to increase at the lower tiers of supply but was much lower in general than expected. The number of dependencies were low as well, although there were a total of 115 distinct items reported as dependencies across all tiers and weapon systems. These items varied from raw materials like nickel and chromium to high-tech value-added items such as semiconductor ceramic packaging and needle roller bearing wire rod.

While neither admitting nor denying the allegations, Fluke Europe, B.V., agreed to pay the civil penalty. The company voluntarily disclosed the alleged violations to the Department. The Commerce Department alleged that, on two occasions in 1993, in connection with export transactions to Kuwait, Fluke Europe furnished information about its and other companies' business relationships with companies blacklisted by the Arab League in its boycott of Israel, in violation of the Regulations. The Department also alleged that the company failed, on ten occasions, to report in a timely manner its receipt of boycott-related requests from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as required by the Regulations. The antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Act and Regulations apply to foreign boycotts fostered or imposed against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott under United States law or regulation. The antiboycott provisions prohibit U.S. individuals and companies from furnishing information about any person's business relationships: with or in a boycotted country; with any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country; with any national or resident of a boycotted country; or with any other person known or believed to be restricted from doing business with or in one or more countries that participate in an unsanctioned foreign boycott, such as the Arab League boycott of Israel. U.S. individuals and companies are also required to report to the Department, in a timely manner, each boycott-related request they receive.

Yuchai America is an affiliate of Yuchai Machinery Company, Ltd. of China. The Department alleged that in May, 1994, Yuchai America attempted to export two five-axis milling machines to China without the required validated U.S. export license. In addition, the Department alleged that the company made false and misleading statements of material fact on export control documents. Although these machines were used equipment, they exceeded the technology limits permitted to be exported to China without a validated license. "Exporters of milling machines, even if they are used, may not ignore and violate export control laws," Despres said. "Certain technologically sophisticated machines -- regardless of their age -- remain subject to export controls for national security reasons because they can be used to make parts for weapons systems." While neither admitting nor denying the violations, Yuchai America agreed to pay the civil penalty. The case is a result of an investigation by the New York Field Office of the Department of Commerce's Office of Export Enforcement. The Department of Commerce controls and licenses the export and re-export of dual-use commodities and technical data. Commerce's Bureau of Export Administration maintains and enforces these controls for reasons of national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation and short supply.

The Committee provides advice to DOD on the projected domestic and foreign economic effects of all acquisitions and disposals of materials from the Stockpile that are to be included in an Annual Materials Plan (AMP). The AMP must be approved by Congress. The Committee is now considering DOD's proposed FY 1998 AMP and revisions to the FY 1997 AMP. Public comment on these proposals, reprinted below, must be received by November 1, 1996 for the Committee to fully consider them as it reviews the proposed AMP. Under the authority of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended, DOD maintains a stockpile of strategic and critical materials to supply the military, industrial, and essential civilian needs of the United States for national defense. In selling and acquiring Stockpile materials, DOD has a statutory obligation to refrain from causing undue market disruption, while at the same time protecting the U.S. Government against avoidable loss. Included with the AMP listing of materials are the proposed maximum disposal quantities for each material. These quantities are not sales target disposal quantities. They are only a statement of the proposed maximum quantity of each material that can be sold during a particular fiscal year. The quantity of each material that will actually be offered for sale will depend on the market for the material at the time as well as on the quantity of material approved for disposal by the Congress. Also the AMP listing is a list of new materials presently under consideration by the Congress for disposal authority in both FY 1997 and FY 1998. The Committee is seeking public comment on the potential market impact of the sale of these materials in the event that Congress does grant such disposal authority.

S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Export Administration The following is a copy of a statement on encryption made by Vice President Gore on October 1, 1996 THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Vice President ____________________________________________________________ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: 456-7035 TUESDAY, October 1, 1996 STATEMENT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT President Clinton and I are committed to promoting the growth of electronic commerce and robust, secure communications worldwide while protecting the public safety and national security. To that end, this Administration is consulting with Congress, the information technology industry, state and local law enforcement officials, and foreign governments on a major initiative to liberalize export controls for commercial encryption products. The Administration's initiative will make it easier for Americans to use stronger encryption products -- whether at home or abroad -- to protect their privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information. It will support the growth of electronic commerce, increase the security of the global information, and sustain the economic competitiveness of U.S. encryption product manufacturers during the transition to a key management infrastructure. Under this initiative, the export of 56-bit key length encryption products will be permitted under a general license after one-time review, and contingent upon industry commitments to build and market future products that support key recovery. This policy will apply to hardware and software products. The relaxation of controls will last up to two years. The Administration's initiative recognizes that an industry-led technology strategy will expedite market acceptance of key recovery, and that the ultimate solution must be market-driven. Exporters of 56-bit DES or equivalent encryption products would make commitments to develop and sell products that support the key recovery system that I announced in July. That vision presumes that a trusted party (in some cases internal to the user's organization) would recover the user's confidentiality key for the user or for law enforcement officials acting under proper authority. Access to keys would be provided in accordance with destination country policies and bilateral understandings. No key length limits or algorithm restrictions will apply to exported key recovery products. Domestic use of key recovery will be voluntary, and any American will remain free to use any encryption system domestically. The temporary relaxation of controls is one part of a broader encryption policy initiative designed to promote electronic information security and public safety. For export control purposes, commercial encryption products will no longer be treated as munitions. After consultation with Congress, jurisdiction for commercial encryption controls will be transferred from the State Department to the Commerce Department. The Administration also will seek legislation to facilitate commercial key recovery, including providing penalties for improper release of keys, and protecting key recovery agents against liability when they properly release a key. As I announced in July, the Administration will continue to expand the purchase of key recovery products for U.S. government use, promote key recovery arrangements in bilateral and multilateral discussions, develop federal cryptographic and key recovery standards, and stimulate the development of innovative key recovery products and services. Under the relaxation, six-month general export licenses will be issued after one-time review, contingent on commitments from exporters to explicit benchmarks and milestones for developing and incorporating key recovery features into their products and services, and for building the supporting infrastructure internationally. Initial approval will be contingent on firms providing a plan for implementing key recovery. The plan will explain in detail the steps the applicant will take to develop, produce, distribute, and/or market encryption products with key recovery features. The specific commitments will depend on the applicant's line of business. The government will renew the licenses for additional six-month periods if milestones are met. Two years from now, the export of 56-bit products that do not support key recovery will no longer be permitted. Currently exportable 40-bit mass market software products will continue to be exportable. We will continue to support financial institutions in their efforts to assure the recovery of encrypted financial information. Longer key lengths will continue to be approved for products dedicated to the support of financial applications.

Sigma Chemical agreed to pay a $480,000 civil penalty to settle these allegations. Today's action marks the first settlement with a firm allegedly exporting biological agents illegally. "The U.S. is leading international efforts to forestall the spread of biological weapons. Strong enforcement of export controls on biological agents is an integral part of the Clinton Administration's non-proliferation strategy," Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement John Despres announced. Over 30 countries joined together to create the list of dual-use biological agents, and to require licenses for their export, of which biotoxins are among the most dangerous. Biotoxins can be used in the manufacture of biological weapons, as well as in the research, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The investigation which led to this settlement began in 1992. It was prompted by a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) of U.S. and international efforts to ban biological weapons, requested by then Senator Al Gore. After the investigation by BXA's Chicago Export Enforcement Field Office, the Department alleged that, on 48 separate occasions between July 1992 and January 1993, Sigma exported U.S.-origin biotoxins from the United States to various countries without the required validated export licenses. "Sigma's export compliance system failed to properly interpret and implement the licensing requirements of the Export Administration Regulations," stated Mr. Despres. BXA administers and enforces the Export Administration Act through its Export Administration Regulations, regulating exports and reexports of dual-use commodities, technology and software for reasons of national security, foreign policy, and short supply.
