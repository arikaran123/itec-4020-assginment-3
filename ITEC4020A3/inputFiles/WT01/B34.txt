Wayburn, PhD,Executive Director TELEPHONE SURVEYS These share all of the difficulties of othersurveys besides being an incredible imposition upon the personwho is called. How does the surveyist know that the respondent isnot an insomniac who has gotten to sleep after three days oftorture followed by a remedy that has a window of opportunity toact of five minutes, say, after which arousal means moreinsomnia! How does the surveyist know that the respondent (theperson answering the call) is not the type of person who cannotresist answering his phone because each call may be the goldenopportunity that knocks but once (or because of a compulsivecuriosity about who is calling him); so, even though he is on thepoint of the greatest orgasm of his life, he stops everything andpicks up the devil's invention, the telephone! (Sometimes I thinkthe devil invented the computer too, and I am a computer expert.But, this is only a metaphor.) Stephen Klineberg, who conductsthe Houston Area Survey out of the "prestigious" RiceUniversity, calls numbers at random, so even those with unlistednumbers are not spared. All of this is reprehensible behavior.But, don't worry, they'll get theirs. OTHER SURVEYS, PARTICULARLY MAIL SURVEYS These are usually worse than worthless besidesthe trouble they cause. Of course, only idiots answer them, sothe opinions reflect those of the stupidest people in society, ofwhich the surveyist should be aware. In general (I mean withoutexception), they are invalid for the purposes for which theypretend to be intended. Usually, however, the last question is"Will you send us money?", so we understand their truepurpose. They are just another disgusting sales gimmick. Let me illustrate with a survey I received fromthe Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) only today. Basically, I favortheir cause, although they are extremely conservative in theirdemands and have no philosophy worth mentioning. Presumably,their real purpose is to make their leaders famous. (In America,you are famous or you are no one.) Question 1. Some people believethat heroin and marijuana should be available to citizenssuffering from painful and often terminal diseases. Shoulddoctors be allowed to prescribe such drugs in treating the painand suffering of cancer, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis and otherdiseases? Yes. Sick people deserve to have whatever medicine isavailable. No. Allowing sick people to have these drugs sends thewrong message to the general public. Commentary. If I answer yes, it means Iaccept the medical monopoly on the distribution of drugs. I can'tanswer no; that would be unconscionable. Question 2. The world honors the UnitedStates as a country that respects its citizens and their rightsof privacy. Some people perceive that the search, seizure andtesting for drugs is undermining this American tradition. Do youagree? Yes. The individual rights of our citizens are our mostimportant priority. No. Drugs are so dangerous we may need to sacrificesome of our rights. Commentary. I could answer with a yes;however, a yes seems to indicate that I agree that the world doesindeed honor the U.S. as a country that respects etc. First, theworld does not honor; and, second, this is not a country thatrespects ... But, suppose I were concerned about right-wingmilitias and I approved of the BATF raids on their headquarters.This is not the case, but suppose it were. I don't want just notto be searched for drugs, I want equal rights for drug users - inemployment, housing, education, ... everything AND copiousreparations for the suffering I've had to endure because of thesedraconian, immoral, and irrational laws. Question 3. We spend over $20 billioneach year on drug law enforcement - over two-thirds of the totaldrug control budget. Should other methods such as treatmentprograms and drug education be allocated a higher percentage ofthat budget? Yes. Our tax money would be more effectively spentfunding treatment and prevention programs. No. We should continue funding punitive measures ofdrug enforcement and build more jails. Commentary. If I answer yes, I indicateapproval of treatment and prevention programs, which I thoroughlydiscredited, along with some others, at the 1990 Drug PolicyFoundation. (Nevertheless, the foundation dishonestly persists inits invalid policies - regardless of the outcome of the debatesat that meeting. The DPF has no intellectual integrity.) If Ianswer no, I appear to support law enforcement, and I don't evenapprove of the enforcement of the law against murder! Infact, I know who killed one of my best friends and the policewill never find out from me. Never, but never, go to the police.If you must, handle it yourself. Question 4. According to the Centers forDisease Control, one-third of all AIDS cases started at the pointof a contaminated syringe shared between drug users. Should wetake action to prevent the spread of this deadly disease byallowing IV drug users to exchange used syringes for sterile onesat approved outlets? Yes. Preventing the spread of AIDS is more importantthan a policy of zero drug tolerance of drug users. No. Providing IV drug users with sterile syringes sendsthe wrong message. Commentary. If I answer yes, I appear toapprove of control of some kind over the sale of syringes, whichI don't. The no answer is ridiculous and extremely cruel. Infact, the "wrong" answers are purposely exaggerated tomake the "sucker" more willing to answer the crucialseventh question "right". Question 5. Drug-related theft, violenceand turf wars bring danger to our streets and harm many innocentpeople, including our children. How do you think we should dealwith this growing problem? By taking the profits away through thedecriminalization or legalization of some or all drugs. By being tougher with enforcement and doing whatever ittakes to get drugs out of our country. By developing new methods of control, education andtreatment. Commentary. All three answers areunacceptable. If you can sell anything for profit, you can selldrugs. Actually, though, it's immoral to sell anything or, forthat matter, to accept a return for anything one does, gives, orsays, but one has to understand my entire philosophy tounderstand that. Question 6. The most important policyfor the Drug Policy Foundation to work towards is (check one): Making clean needles available to prevent the spread ofAIDS and other blood-borne diseases. Making drugs like marijuana and opiates available tothe seriously ill. Decriminalizing drug use. Protecting individual rights of Americans. Commentary. None of the above. The DPFshould adopt my policies for drug reform, which includes workingto eliminate capitalism and the profit motive and overthrowingthe government. Anything less is like pissing in the wind. Question 7. Will you support the DrugPolicy Foundation's efforts to mobilize the American people andthe Federal government to examine alternative solutions to thedrug crisis? Yes. Enclosed is my tax-deductible contribution of: $200 $150 $100 $75 $50* $35 $25 _______Other (Please make your check payable to The DrugPolicy Foundation.) No. I can't give my support to DPF at this time.However, I am completing my 1995 Drug Policy Survey and haveenclosed a gift of $12.50 to help with the processing. Commentary. What about the possibilityof sending what I can afford to send: a sincere criticism of theDPF's policy. Why would not this be worth a fortune to a personwho wishes not to persist in error! An honest person would stateat the outset that this is an appeal for money, presumably tomake Arnold Trebach and Kevin Zeese as famous as they can arrangeto become. It's like the joke about the carpenter who wasinformed about a good deed done by another carpenter. "If hedid it," quoth the first carpenter, "he did it to gethis name up." I am the outstanding thinker in drug policy ofwhom I am aware and I read the two proceedings of the DPFsymposia that I attended from cover to cover. (I don't say thisout of egotism; it's a plain statement of fact.) Yet, I havenever received any recognition from Arnold, Kevin, or anyone inthe DPF. They are too busy looking out for themselves. Meanwhile,mediocre individuals receive awards because the DPF gains morefrom giving the award than the recipient does from getting it.Don't worry, I don't bother with that. I don't accept awards. Ihave written a short essay proving conclusively that they areharmful and a significant part of THE problem and, therefore, asignificant part of the drug problem. MARGIN OF ERROR Typically, when the results of one of thesesurveys is published, it comes with a margin of error. Frankly, Idon't know how this calculation is made - perhaps by partitioningthe data. The point is that the margin of error could be 100%because everyone may give Answer A when they really mean AnswerB. It cannot be known how effective these polls are and my guessis that they are considerably over-rated. In any case, they are apublic nuisance with few if any redeeming features in the vastmajority of cases. Moreover, I do not consider surveying to be aqualified scholarly endeavor. In particular, college professorsshould not be able to get away with calling it research.

Wayburn, PhD, Executive Director American Policy Institute, Inc. 2638 Yorktown Apt.294 Houston, TX 77056-4873 TWayburn@aol.com IN WHICH I SAY NOT AT ALL NICE THINGS ABOUT MR. TYRRELL ANDFIND NO FAULT WITH MYSELF "No to Drug Legalization" by R.Emmett Tyrrell, Junior, is a short article that appeared in the AmericanSpectator. It does not have much substance and, in addition,when it raises a point that needs to be proved, it refersgenerally to what someone else has said. This is the weakest formof argument. If a point is needed for the author's thesis, hemight have the courtesy to prove it rather than send the readeroff to yet another author, whose work may be troublesome toobtain. However, the contentions are readily disproved or shownto be irrelevant regardless of the arguments that appearelsewhere in their defense. It is my job, then, to show that thisauthor has no case. On the other hand, my drug policy ispresented elsewhere and, since I am not compelled to proveanything (merely disprove or discredit), a single literaturecitation should satisfy the reader that I really have a positionon this subject that, by the way, fills the vacuum left by Mr.Tyrrell rather nicely. Thus, I am really a creator primarily anda destroyer only secondarily and then only in a very minorcapacity, as Mr. Tyrrell has not provided much of an edifice forthe wrecking ball. IN WHICH I ALLOW MR. TYRRELL TO HANG HIMSELF Tyrrell's argument, which I must assume is aweak attempt at humor or, at least, jocularity, hinges on ahandful of statements that are either patently false, equivocal,or irrelevant. I shall employ these statements as secondarytitles. Drugs kill and enthrall. The impression that Mr. Tyrrell wishes tocreate is that drugs are lethal poison. Why, then, are they neverused to kill rats, insects, or ill-tempered wives? If the State,itself, is doing the killing, the excessive cost due toillegality would not obtain; nevertheless, illegal drugs are notemployed. If cocaine and heroin were lethal poisons, we wouldhave no addicts since users would expire before they becameaddicted. While it is true that one can ingest enough of nearlyanything, even if it recognized as an essential nutrient, e.g.,vitamin , to cause death. The primary function of drugs isnot to kill, but to enhance joy, relieve pain, alleviatediscomfort, and to create altered states of consciousness, etc..Death comes, in most cases, when the substance ingested is notthe substance expected or when the dosage is drasticallydifferent from the dosage expected. These are accidents that donot occur with legal drugs except in a few cases where the legaldrug is much more dangerous than the common favorite illegaldrugs most of which have been part of our culture for thousandsof years and with which we have vast experience. This is animportant point, namely, that cocaine, heroin, marijuana, andeven the relatively modern amphetamines are safer than many newlegal pharmaceuticals in proportion to our greater experiencewith them, provided, of course, that we get what we expect toget, a circumstance that we demand along with legalization. Mr. Tyrrell employs the term enthrallsequivocally. Since we are enthralled by drugs as we would be by agreat love, it is easy to agree that these wonderful, miraculous,divine drugs of antiquity have lost none of their charm with age.It is as though our beloved were snatched from our arms when theword is suddenly used to connote slavery, which we detest. We areno more enslaved by our favorite drugs than we are by ourfavorite foods - or, to bring home the sharp sword of truth, farless than the average employed American is enslaved by his job.The average drug user is free compared to the average corporateemployee. This is the beauty of Jack Nicholson's speech in thepot smoking scene in the film Easy Rider when he tells thebikers that the townspeople fear them because they representfreedom. The druggies of the Beat Generation and subsequentlyhave been symbolic of man's quest for freedom. From among us comethe free spirits of the land. Only the oppressor's iron yoke canbow the heads of those who dare to tread the paths of theliberated criminal saints of the free-wheeling drug culture. Thewhole world knows this is true. It is not as though a drug-free society takesthe fun out of life. Druggies are about as amusing as cadavers. To take the last first, people don't take drugsto amuse squares. As for the first, a drug-free America wouldn'tbe worth living in. Not only would it take the fun out of lifefor artists and other sensitive people, it would destroy nearlyeverything else worth living for including closeness to thetranscendent - whether it's called God or nothing at all. Wheredo these prudes and puritanical control freaks get the idea thatpeople take drugs exclusively, or even predominantly, for fun?Mr. Tyrrell, once and for all, don't knock it until you try it.And, by the way, stay out of my face. I am not bothering you orinterfering with your pursuit of happiness; however insane,ridiculous, and misguided your recreational activities seem to befrom where I sit? For all I care, you can dress up in babyclothes and have your maiden aunt push you around Central Park ina perambulator. I won't call the cops. You strike me as the sortof man who may have played golf. As much as I despise people fortaking so much space that should be available to children andwildlife, I won't take it away from you until someone has noplace at all, be it man or beast. Drugs are indulged in solely to escape fromreality. How would you know? Drugs are "indulgedin" to paint pictures, write books, poems, and, yes, essays.To play music, to have sex, to enjoy the company of one's friendswithout a bunch of puritanical, middle-class hang-ups. To getcloser to God. And for more reasons than can be known in aphilosophy so pitifully tiny that it can be wedged into so narrowa mind. Honestly, Emmett, you say the dumbest things. How many have left in their trail happy,elegant works of art? (A rhetorical question asked without havingobserved an artist at work - presumably.) Let me turn that around. Who has not used drugsand left behind anything worth doing? It's not that every druguser has created great works of art. Many, if not most, havetried, but few succeed. However, with very few exceptions, thoselucky, bless�d ones who have left behind "elegant works ofart" have used drugs. I'll give you one exception: GeorgeBernard Shaw. At least he claims not to have used drugs, but Iremain unconvinced. Of the known drug-using artists, the list islong. Is there any doubt? The arts belong to drug users. Not justjazz musicians. Consider all the writers, poets, painters whohave spoken of their drug use: Coleridge, Poe, etc. Where doesanyone get the temerity to challenge the contributions of drugusers to art! Ah, if only drug users went on strike, art wouldcease and the souls of these Philistines who persecute us woulddry up like the wingsof insects caught in our divine flame. But, scientists, too, have found inspiration indrugs. Consider William Rowan Hamilton, without whom quantummechanics could not have arisen in quite the same way. RichardFeynman admitted using drugs. The list is long and records thenames of some of the brightest stars. I will not "out"living scientists despite what I know. Many of us would beamazed. Those who traffic in drugs are killers. This is an absurd statement on the face of it.Not, that no one who trafficked in drugs has been a killer; but,generally, the killing has been incidental to the illegality. Whois worse (a) a drug dealer who delivers on request a substance toanother man who wishes to ingest it or (b) a chief executive of achemical company who forces everyone in the neighborhood of hisplant to ingest poisonous chemical wastes whether they wish to ornot! The flight from responsibility of drug usersendangers the free society. This is a matter of calling the victim theculprit. The heads of the multi-national corporations are thetrue danger to society. And, if you will pardon me for speakingthe truth, capitalism (American style) is the real danger as itreduces 90% or more of our population to third-world conditionsin its insatiable greed, as it starves the third world to deathand makes armed conflict inevitable. You, sir, are the danger toa far-from-free society. In many areas drugs are so freely availablethey might as well be legal. No sir, the quality is horrible; the expense ispreposterous; and the danger from the police is terrifying. No,no, and no. You and other evil, wicked, vicious authoritariansare winning the war against drug users and dealers, but you willnever stop the flow of drugs. All you can do is increase themisery of the wretched who fall into your clutches. This includesthat middle-class stock-broker who does heroin on the weekend outon Long Island. He, too, knows that he hasn't much of a future tolive for. Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die. But, atleast, his white, middle-class crumbs from the table will buy himdecent drugs. The worst quality drugs go to the ghetto. Ofcourse. The white middle class enjoys a higher quality ofdespair. How gratifying. "But, it is a far, far better thingI do than - what I normally do during the week." Our high prison population is composed ofbrutes who have committed heinous acts and are more likely tocommit such acts on drugs. The evidence shows otherwise. I'll go all theway: the people in prison are the only ones left who can manifesta little honor and refuse to bow to the ruling rich and theirloathsome toadies. The rich steal, but they don't rob. That'sbecause they are afraid of man but not afraid of God. Thecriminal may not - I said may not - be afraid of God , buthe's not afraid of man either. The corporate bums are beneath therespect of reptiles. I won't prove this, but you haven't provedanything either. You had better get your philosophy together andtell us what makes a good society and what makes a bad society. Ireally don't believe you know. But, the next quote from Tyrrellgives us a hint of his abiding faith in the essential equality ofall men (and women?). ...put inferior people on the shelf and out ofsociety. I suppose Poe, Coleridge, Charlie Parker, LouisArmstrong, William Rowan Hamilton, Richard Feynman, and themillions of others who used drugs were inferior to you. You arean exemplary man - a man of lies, deception, of light-hearted andcruel intolerance, a trifler in matters of life and death, awould-be inquisitor, a man of no depth or parts. What kind of mancould have written your little auto-da f�? In your lastparagraph you have said precisely nothing. Is this your idea ofhumor? We are not amused.

For publishingthe review they let me have the book. So here it is,"published" on the net. [in paper: ISBN-0-8126-9169-5 in cloth: ISBN-0-8126-9168-7] The book is published by Open Court Publishing Company,(LaSalle IL, 61301 (c) 1992) edited by Rod L. Evans and Irwin M.Berent with a forward by Linus Pauling and a redundantintroduction by Hugh Downs. The editors are appologetic for beingbiased in favor of some form of legalization and given thearguments they picked favoring the status quo of prohibition it'seasy to see why. I think they tried hard to find good argumentsfor continuing prohibition but it really boils down to acceptinga paternalistic government versus a free society. Out of 11articles favoring prohibition, only 2 were consistent: giventheir basis of argument you could logically reach the sameconclusion. I just happen to disagree with their basis. So there's no confusion, both the editors and reviewer agree,legalization (of some form) is the way to go. In general, the legalizers used facts and talked much aboutmarijuana and the prohibitionists used rhetoric and polls (nobodybelieves the other side so don't listen to them) and talked muchabout heroin and cocaine. Given the skew argument, maybelegalizing hemp really is possible? All other drugs are just amatter of changing a few polls. To this reader, the bestprohibitionist argument was "we have helmet laws, thereforewe can control your mind too." This is true. We ought nothave helmet laws! What follows are my notes of each contributing author. Their efforts were culled from various journals andproceedings from 1988 to 1992. Only one article has never beenpublished before. It was actually my favorite piece. Linus Pauling opens the book with the concept of*orthomolecular substances* as things which the human body hasadapted to over the past million years or so and *drugs* assubstances not normally present. He figures distilled alcohol isonly a few hundred years old so that falls in the category ofdrugs but he says "marijuana and cocaine, and perhaps alsopeyote" should be as available as beer. I hope he meant cocaleaf and not processed cocaine because that would make him ahypocrite, calling distilled alcohol a drug but not processedcocaine! Hugh Downs asks the readers to think about legalization andsuggests a few questions to have in mind while reading the book.The editors then spell out their rational for putting the booktogether the way they did. The book is laid out in 11 chapters ofvarious types of arguments with the first chapter a list ofquestions that Charles Rangle (chairman of the select Committeeon Narcotics Abuse and Control) asked his committee to considerat the behest of Kurt Schmoke's request to investigatelegalization. They are really good questions and he obviouslyignored the answers to stay a prohibitionist. All in all the bookstarts out interesting. Next up was a very abridged version ofNadelmann's 1989 Science article arguing for legalization. I'dread the original so I skipped this. James Wilson (prof. of mang. and public policy at UCLA) mountsa personal attack on Nadelmann and tries to use history of drugsstarting in 1970. Very unconvincing. Then comes Milton Friedman's famous letters to Bill Bennettand the reply. Bennett says "I advocate a larger criminaljustice system to take drug users off the streets." And"drug use is a threat to the individual liberty and domestictranquillity guaranteed by the constitution." Friedmanreplies with a quote from Justice Brandeis: "The greater dangers to liberty lurk in insidiousencroachment by men of zeal, well meaning, but withoutunderstanding." At this point I'm wondering if the prohibitionists haveanybody who can articulate their viewpoint at all with reason. Fortunately Ed Tully and Marguerite Bennett of the FBI show upwith the most consistent argument for the prohibitionists. Theystart out making good points about individual rights versussocial safety. They feel that laws which "protect theindividual" (seat belt and helmet laws) are good things.Using this as a basis they argue well for prohibition. They alsouse several specious arguments about the dangers of marijuanawhich are blatantly false but this does not affect theirarguments. Proves to me that paternalistic society is a badthing. Merrill Smith (U.S. Chief Probation Officer) gives lots ofquotes from professors and medical doctors. Lots more facts thanthe FBI argument and an excellent review of history of how drugswent from the medical domain to the criminal starting from the1890's. John Hill (Law prof. and Ph.D. philosophy) then comes alongwith a really nice libertarian perspective. The book might beworth getting for this article alone. Hill argues for theprinciple of a "zone of privacy". He defines"'privacy' in the jurisprudential sense is that which isbeyond the legitimate concern of the government and itslaws." A couple of quotes I really liked are:"Similarly, monarchists, Marxists, and fascists of variousbrands reject the notion of a private realm of individual choiceas a chimera of modern Liberalism." And "Defenders of azone of privacy, on the other hand, recognize the logical andmoral primacy of the individual over the state. The individual isnot, as it was for Aristotle, a part of the state. Rather, thestate is the creation of the individual and, as such, the servantof individual ends." Right on dude! Hill goes on to study supreme court rullings about privacy andcovers 4 specific areas. He then quotes Mill's definition of'harm to others' and relates all this to drug use. He does notventure a direct opinion towards legalization and tosses out bitsfor debate such as "prohibition might also be warranted inthe case of certain specified drugs that pose a threat to thecontinued autonomy of the individual user." An ivory towerargument but a great place to get definitions and a basis forlegalization. Mark Moore (Harvard Prof. of Criminal Justice) starts off with"In this Article, I note that the 'drug problem' isprimarily a cocaine epidemic." Sets up 6 straw men'alternatives' of legalization and then knocks them down. Veryunconvincing. He blames all of societies problems on drug use.Actually it's kind of sad. Todd Brenner (Lawyer, Notes Editor for Capital Law Review) isvery repetitive of the legalization side. Nadelmann covered thefacts and Hill covered the logic. I didn't finish reading it. Itseemed like 50 pages of the book could have been saved leavingMoore and Brenner out. I then skipped Wisotsky (Law prof. at Nova University) as justanother boring lawyer. [That's part of the reason I'm running foroffice on the Libertarian ticket. I'm sick of lawyer's telling mehow to live my life.] Kurt Schmoke gives a short, succinct and powerful message forlegalization. Bill Bennett (again!?) rantingly replies "lawenforcement works". Is this bias of editors or is therereally no rational explanation of prohibition? Dr. Gazzaniga (psychiatry prof. Dartmouth Med. school) ispublished in interview format. This was interesting to read afterthe previous boring rants and gave a useful counter to the"drugs create crime" falicy. Compares alcohol, tobaccoto crack and cocaine addictions. Gabriel Nahas (pharmacologist and known liar) claims alcohol"does not impair mental acuity" but marijuana does"even in minute quantities". Seeming to admit he has nofacts he says "Only when the vital grass-roots forces ofAmerica feeling their existence threatened, become determined tofight drugs will they be able to wage a war and win it." Hebasically believes propaganda and lies will work forever. Made mewant to puke. Thomas Szasz (psychiatrist prof. from SUNY) follows in typicalgreat style. He has a sharp wit but uses few real facts. He givesa high level abstract argument with some of the best legalizationpropaganda I've seen. He directly ties Hitler's argument of the'dangerous jew' to WoD's 'dangerous drugs'. He says: "Theperennial confrontation between authority and autonomy, thepermanent tension between behavior based on submission tocoercion and the free choice of one's own course in life - thesebasic themes of human morality and psychology are now enacted ona stage on which the principal props are drugs and laws againstdrugs." Kind of made me wonder if the human race is worththe effort I expend on it. David Musto (psychiatry prof. Yale) gives an accuratehistorical perspective. He argues public opinion polls be used todetermine what to do with drugs: "My belief is that thepopular attitude which is growing so powerfully against drug usein this country is in the long run more determinative thanprofits or even foreign supply." He does think "we mustnot again revert to extreme punishments, silence orexaggeration" when discussing drug use. He suggests that thewar should plow ahead as usual because it is working. He ignoreshis own arguments but it ranks up there with the FBI paper as thebest of the prohibitionists. William Buckly (editor National Review) complains that"no politician can be elected who recommends the one thingthat hasn't been tried." They could have picked a betterpiece. I think this could have been left out also. Morton Kondracke (senior editor New Republic) claims that"drugs have been the rage in America only since about1962". He makes the amazing assumption that because alcoholkills 200,000 people per year that legalizing marijuana would dothe same thing and including all drugs he says "the numberof deaths actually could go as high as 500,000 a year." Heconcludes "in the name of health, economics, and morality,there seems no alternative but to keep drugs illegal." The'liberals' are more dangerous than the 'conservatives'! Ms. Taylor Branch (freelance writer) comes at it with aliterary attack. She compares Prohibition to today. She commentson the connection between racism and drugs and why doctors didnot defend use of opium or cocaine. She argues for a "Koopmodel" of legalization: no advertising, no sales to minors,but legal to purchase with warnings that it's bad for you. Sheends with "To fight the entire drug war by Everett Koop'srules would require disciplined courage within individualcitizens and enormous trust between them. But so does thepractice of democracy itself." The book ends with Arnold Trebach (law prof. AmericanUniversity and head of Drug Policy Foundation) throwing a selfpromoting rah-rah. He gives a few good points on how activistsshould push for medical marijuana and heroin and asks that usersbe left alone but dealers still be punished. Argues for politicalreason on the part of legalizers and suggests taking things onestep at a time. The lawyers were definitely boring. Too many words and notenough said. If you've been in the WoD for awhile, this book doesyou no good at all. But their market is the "public"and for that it may be too thick. If the market is libertariansit may sell ok. I just have the feeling that there must be moreto the prohibitionist argument. If there isn't then it should bereally easy to legalize hemp. The major argument is that thegovernment has the power to control individual behavior. This isabsurd. Government can not control its own behavior let alonethat of individuals. This is observed historical fact. I'll besuprised if the book gets wide circulation because it is biasedin favor of legalization. The powers that be are biased againstit. Nahas is right about one point: "Only when the vitalgrass-roots forces of America feeling their existancethreatened" will they fight oppression. If this book reallyrepresents the prohibitionists then they are planting the seedsof their own destruction. And this book documents their demise.

Voth, MD, of Drug Watch International 5/27/96 How this document got here: I was in some private discussions with Dr. Voth, who is avehement opponent of the legalization of marijuana. In the courseof our discussion I pointed to the research which I already haveon this website and asked Dr. Voth to supply any research orreferences which would support his point of view. It took a lotof pestering, but finally Dr. Voth submitted the followingbibliography on marijuana. What is most curious about this bibliography is that much ofit does not support Dr. Voth's point of view. It honestly makesme wonder if he has read the books on his own list. I havespecifically asked him about a few of the books listed here, suchas the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs,but he has never given any indication that he has read them. IfDr. Voth will respond with a list of the ones he claims to haveread, I will post that, too. Statistics: Centrale Recherche Informatie 1993 report, CriminalInvestigation Department. Rotterdam 1993.

Structure This manual is divided into chapters, each chapter addressinga different argument used by the "legalizers." Forexample, Chapter One addresses the argument that legalizing drugswould reduce the addiction rate; Chapter Two addresses the impactthat legalizing drugs would have on the crime rate. Furthermore,each chapter is divided into two parts. The first part, termedthe "Discussion" section, briefly states thelegalizers' arguments and then provides an in-depth analysis ofhow to defeat them. The second part of each chapter is termed the "SummarySheet" section. The Summary Sheet section is designed forpeople who for whatever reason do not have time to read theDiscussion section - for example, those people who actually areinvolved in a debate at that moment. The Summary Sheet section isdivided into two columns, the first titled "If TheySay," and the second called "Then You Say." TheSummary Sheet section basically iterates the factual highlightsof the Discussion section in a format that is easy to "justpick up and use." In both the Discussion and the SummarySheet sections, relevant facts will be footnoted or otherwisecited. This is so that if anyone asks you where you got yourinformation, you will be able to tell them immediately. Appendix One suggests a structured format for an actualpublic debate. Following these rules will prevent the debate fromdisintegrating into a shouting match and a forum for"speeches" from the audience. Finally, an extensive bibliography is provided for yourconvenience should you choose to pursue additional reading. 1 For purposes of this manual, "legalization" meansa policy whereby selling and using drugs is legal."Decriminalization" means a policy whereby penaltiesfor breaking the drug laws are lessened and/or the drug laws arerestricted in scope. See Ralph A. Weisheit and Katherine Johnson,"'Exploring the Dimensions of Support for Decriminalizationof Drugs," Journal of Drug Issues, Winter 1992. That is, ifheroin were legalized, it would be legal to sell or use it. Ifheroin were decriminalized, it technically would be illegal touse it, but (for instance) the penalty for its use would be a $10fine. Another example of decriminalization would be allowing theuse of heroin as a common pain killer in hospitals. Introductory Pointers Before getting to the substance of the legalization debateitself, here are three suggestions for use when debating thelegalizers. 1. Right to expect benefits. As with anypolicy, you have a right to demand that the legalizers prove thatthe benefits of their proposal outweigh its costs. 2. Right to specificity. As with any policy,you have a right to demand that the legalizers provide a specificproposal which to debate. One cannot talk about policy in theabstract. For example, let's say that you were debating whetherthe federal government should cut spending - you have to havesome idea of what is to be cut, how much is to be cut, when it isgoing to be cut, etc. With regard to the legalization debate, youshould ask your opponent these questions at the beginning ofthe debate: What drugs are we talking about? Are they advocating legalization or decriminalization? Are there limitations on who can use these drugs - what about children, pregnant women, prison inmates, police, members of the military, people who drive buses or fly planes, etc.? Are there limitations on the quantity or potency of drugs that the individual can use? Would an unlimited supply of drugs be made available to the habitual users or drug addicts? Who will create, market, and sell the drugs? How much will the drugs cost? Will the drugs be taxed, and if so, at what rate? Will drug addiction be able to be used as a defense in civil or criminal trials? Make sure that your opponent answers these questions early!After all, it is only fair that you know what you are debatingbefore you begin the debate. 3. Right to sources of information. You have a rightto ask the legalizers the source of their data. By the sametoken, they have the right to ask the same of you (and that's whythis manual is complete with footnotes).

Their Argument Proponents of drug legalization argue that legalizing drugswould decrease addiction rates for two reasons. First, theymaintain, people use drugs because they are illegal - thatis, people get a thrill breaking a social taboo. Legalize drugsand the incentive to take them will go away. Second, proponentsof legalization argue that if drugs were legalized, we couldspend the money that we presently spend on the criminal justicesystem on treatment of addicts.2 II. Our Argument Before addressing the particular merits of the legalizationdebate, it is useful to describe just what is an addiction.Addictions are either physical or psychological. Physicaladdiction occurs when the body becomes dependent upon chemicalsor drugs not normally found in the human body and requires suchchemicals in order to sustain basic bodily functions. Take, forinstance, cocaine addiction. Cocaine alters the means by whichbrain cells communicate with one another. Usually, nerve cells(neurons) send signals to one another through chemicalneurotransmitters such as dopamine. Dopamine flows from oneneuron to the other, delivers its message, and returns to theoriginal neuron. Cocaine, however, blocks the dopamine fromreturning to the first cell, and the first cell just keeps firingaway. This explains why cocaine produces such feelings ofpleasure; for lack of a better description, cocaine locks all ofthe user's neurons into an "On" position. The problemoccurs when all of the cocaine has been metabolized by the body.As Professor James Q. Wilson explains, "[w]hen theexaggerated high produced by cocaine-influenced dopamine finallyends, the brain cells may (in ways that are still a matter ofdispute) suffer from an extreme lack of dopamine, thereby makingthe individual unable to experience any pleasure at all."3This is a very simplified model, of course, and different drugsaffect the body in different ways, but a simple fact remains -physical addiction is biochemical in nature and is independent ofsocial, political, or psychological causes. There is another type of addiction, however, that beingpsychological addiction. Unlike physical addiction, whichbasically is a medical condition, psychological addiction occurswhen the individual user feels or is of the opinion that drugsare necessary for his or her life. This is not to suggest thatpsychological addiction is easily dismissed; indeed it can have aprofound influence on how addicts live their lives. Suchespecially is the case when addicts live in a culture thatcontinually reinforces the desirability or necessity of drug use. Let us examine addiction specific to two drugs: cocaine andmarijuana. Although rough, estimates suggest that there arebetween 650,000 and 2.4 million cocaine addicts in the UnitedStates.4 "Cocaine is a much more addictive drug thanalcohol. If cocaine were legally available the number of cocaineabusers would probably rise to...perhaps 20-25million."5Mitchell Rosenthal, President of the Phoenix Housedrug-rehabilitation program states that cheap available drugswould increase addiction; only 10% of drinkers become hooked,while an estimated 75% of regular drug (crack) users could becomeaddicts.6 Scientific studies agree, noting that when givenunlimited access to cocaine, laboratory animals will consumeincreasingly greater amounts until they die.7 That cocaine isharmful to one's health likely will come as a surprise to no one.Dr. Frank H. Gawin, director of stimulant abuse, treatment andresearch at Yale University concludes that cocaine causesdepression, paranoia, and "violent psychoticbehavior."8 What is worse, there is presently no effective,permanent treatment for cocaine addiction.9 Almost everyone would agree that cocaine is a dangerous,addictive drug, but many would be surprised to find that the sameis true of marijuana. Although it is very difficult to determinethe precise number of marijuana users and addicts in the UnitedStates, one fact is clear: marijuana has become much more potentover the last twenty years. Cannabis delta 9tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as "THC," is theactive ingredient in marijuana and other cannabis such ashashish. The THC content in marijuana during the days ofWoodstock was something less than 1%. In 1974, the average THCcontent of illicit marijuana was 0. 36% and by 1984 had increasedto 4.40%.10 In 1992 in Alaska, marijuana was discovered that hada THC content of 29.86%.11 Now stop and think about that for aminute. Today's marijuana may be between thirty to sixty times aspotent as were the joints of the 1960's. This observation gives one pause when we realize that THC isboth dangerous and habit-forming. Marinol, a prescription drugthat is very occasionally used in the treatment of nauseaassociated with chemotherapy, is chemically synthesized THC. Mostpeople are familiar with the information sheets that come withprescription drugs - the pieces of paper that detail theindications and usage of the drug in question, its potentialside-effects, its chemical composition, etc. The informationsheet that comes with Marinol states verbatim, "MARINOL ishighly abusable and can produce both physical and psychologicaldependence .... Patients receiving MARINOL should be closelyobserved."12 The company that produces Marinol goes on toexplain that its THC may cause "changes in mood ...decrements in cognitive performance and memory, a decreasedability to control drives and impulses [and] . . . a full-blownpicture of psychosis (psychotic organic brain syndrome) may occurin patients receiving doses within the lower portion of thetherapeutic range."13 Such warnings should not surprise the scientists who have formany years maintained that the THC contained in marijuana isdangerous. First, in the late 1960's Dr. Robert Heath, thenchairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at TulaneMedical School, found that marijuana affects brain waves anddestroys brain cells.14 Second, a study conducted by Dr. EthelSassenrath at the University of California at Davis between 1974and 1978 found that THC increased the rate of fetal loss (inutero, fetal death) in monkeys by over 300%, while at the sametime decreasing the birth weights in those babies born alive.15Third, a study by Dr. Susan Dalterio, at the University of Texasfound that marijuana decreased testosterone and impaired sexualdevelopment in male mice.16 Finally, a study by Dr. Albert Munsonfound that injections of THC suppressed the immune systems ofmice and made them 96 times more susceptible to the herpesvirus.17 Dr. Charles R. Schuster, former Director of the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse said, "The fact that there are over77,000 admissions a year to treatment programs for marijuana useand that annually almost 8,000 persons require emergency hospitalcare for marijuana use is sufficient evidence of the drugsdangerousness"18 Clearly, drugs such as cocaine and marijuana are, bothaddictive and dangerous. The legalizers likely would admit this,but counter by saying that if we legalized them we would haveless of a problem. This is untrue. Recall from above that legalizers claim that people use andbecome addicted to drugs because of the excitement of breakingthe law - it is the fact that drugs are illegal that causespeople to try them. The data disagree. Robert E. Peterson, FormerDeputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania notes, "70% of highschool students in New Jersey and about 60% of the students inCalifornia said that fear of getting in trouble with the lawconstituted a major reason not to use drugs."19 The legalizers' argument that we should legalize drugs andspend the money we now spend on criminal prosecution on treatmentand rehabilitation also fails. Both proponents and opponents oflegalization are in agreement that legalization almost certainlywould decrease the price of drugs as they became more available.However, basic economic theory states that as the price of acommodity declines, demand for the commodity will increase. Butwhereas the reverse usually also is true (increase price anddemand decreases), it is not so with addictive substances. Thatis, drop the price of a gram of cocaine by 50%, and you will seean increase in use as demand for the product increases. Increasethe price of cocaine by 50%, and you will not see an equaldecrease in demand because addicts will pay the price to sustaintheir addictions. In technical economic terms, the demand foraddictive drugs is elastic with respect to price declines, butinelastic with respect to price increases. Expert opinion supports this hypothesis. Dr. Herbert D. Kleberof the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, ColumbiaUniversity, suggests that legalization of cocaine would result ina five- to six-fold increase in cocaine use.20 Dr. Robert DuPont,former director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse agrees,stating that legalization would increase the number of users ofcocaine and marijuana to between fifty and sixty million, and thenumber of heroin users to around ten million.21 Dr. DuPontconcludes that when one takes into account the health effects ofcocaine, heroin, and marijuana, legalization could result inbetween 100,000 and 500,000 drug induced deaths each year.22Further, you cannot legalize cocaine and control the crackepidemic, for users could easily turn the former into the latter. History also supports the fact that legalization wouldincrease addiction rates. When opium was legal in the UnitedStates at the turn of the century, we had proportionately betweentwo and three times the number of addicts than we do presently.23Furthermore, Dr. Richard Schwartz, Professor of Pediatrics atGeorgetown University School of Medicine, notes that Alaska andOregon, the states that traditionally have had the most lenientdrug laws, also have the highest marijuana addiction rates in theUnited States double the national average.24 Finally, foreign countries that have relaxed drug laws haveseen an increase in addiction rates [see Chapter Three]. In short, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana are dangerous andhighly addictive substances. Scholarly opinion, historicalevidence, and common sense suggest that if these drugs arelegalized, then the rates of addiction will skyrocket, leading tomisery and death. 2 See Chapters Two and Four for additional discussion ofwhether legalizing drugs would indeed allow us to shift resourcesfrom criminal prosecution to treatment and rehabilitation. 3 James Q.

Their Argument Proponents of legalization advance two theories as to howlegalization will decrease crime in the United States, and bothare dependent on the assumption that legalization will reduce thecost of drugs to the user. First, because users will not have tospend as much to support their drug habits, fewer will need tocommit crimes such as robbery and burglary to obtain drug money.Second, because the cost of drugs will decrease, so will the drugsellers' profits. Because drugs will no longer be a profitablebusiness, and because addicts will be able to obtain their drugsfrom legal sources, the current black market suppliers of drugs -gangs, foreign cartels, organized criminals, etc.-will fade away. II. Our Argument Before addressing these theories, it is useful to distinguishbetween three types of drug-related crime. As Professor James Q.Wilson notes [t]he illegality of drugs increases crime, partly because someusers turn to crime to pay for their habits, partly because someusers are stimulated by certain drugs (such as crack or PCP) toact more violently or ruthlessly than they otherwise would, andpartly because criminal organizations seeking to control drugsupplies use force to manage their markets.25 For ease of discussion, this author will refer to the crimecaused by people to pay for their habits as"purchase-related," the crime caused by people whileunder the influence of drugs as "drug-induced," and thecrime caused by organized criminal suppliers of drugs as"black market crime." Let us discuss each in turn. A. Purchase-related crime As stated above, legalizers assume that as legalized drugsbecome less expensive, addicts will no longer have to commitcrimes in order to fund their habits. One immediate difficultywith this analysis is that drugs already are exceptionallyinexpensive. For example, a hit of crack costs about five dollarson the streets of Seattle and about three dollars in other majormetropolitan areas.27 Granted, the pharmaceutical cost of cocainesufficient to make a hit of crack is roughly twenty-five cents.28But to the extent that a legal crack supplier likely would haveto meet government regulations or would have to internalize thecosts of taxes placed upon the legalized drug, some analystsquestion whether it is possible to reduce the currentstreet-price of drugs.29 Nonetheless, let us assume that legal drug suppliers couldundersell the black market by offering cocaine for approximatelyfifty cents a dose. What would happen? As discussed at length in Chapter One, addiction rates wouldskyrocket. This fact is almost indisputable, and even theLibertarian supporters of drug legalization admit that "lowprices would encourage use."30 History is very clear on thispoint as well---once cocaine began being marketed in the highpotency/low cost form of crack, addiction rates did increase.31And when addiction rates increase, so does purchase-relatedcrime. As Elliott Currie explains, "[h]igher levels of druguse do go hand in hand with increased crime, especiallyproperty crime."32 So in reality, legalizing drugs would not decreasepurchase-related crime, but would actually increase it.Three reasons explain why this is so. First, if you decrease theprice of an addictive substance, addicts merely will buy more ofthe less expensive product.33 Second, it is not as ifaddicts steal money only to pay for drugs; likely, they stealmoney to meet living expenses such as food, rent, etc. WilliamBennett notes that "[m]aking drugs legal would just be a wayof subsidizing [addicts] habit. They would continue to rob andsteal to pay for food, for clothes, for entertainment."34 Ofcourse, since there are more addicts, there would be more peoplecommitting purchase-related crimes. Third, one must recall thatpurchase-related crime is not directly related to the cost of thedrug, but instead is indirectly related: the prices of drugsaffect the addiction rate, which in turn affects thepurchase-related crime rate. This point perhaps is subtle, butalso is important. Addicts will pay almost any price for drugs.Thus the question becomes not "What is the price ofdrugs," but instead "How many addicts are there?"Because legalized drugs increase addiction rates,purchase-related crime necessarily increases. B. Drug-induced crime As with purchase-related crime, the price of drugs is notdirectly relevant in determining the amount of drug-inducedcrime, except to the extent that the price affects the number ofaddicts. Undoubtedly, drug-induced crime is a significantproblem, One conservative estimate based upon the Bureau ofJustice Statistics study suggests that with regard to local jailinmates, 15.4% of such inmates tested positive for illegal drugsand an additional 12.1 % tested positive for a combination ofillegal drugs and alcohol.35 Another study conducted by theNational Institute of Justice in 1986 found that for twelve majormetropolitan areas, 70% of inmates tested positive for illegaldrugs.36 The N.I.J. study concluded that "[these offendersdid not commit crimes simply to feed their habits. Drugs changedtheir behavior, enabled and encouraged them to act violently andirrationally."37 Again, these results are unsurprising. Drugs such as crackencourage hyperactive violence.38 If you legalize such drugs andthe addiction rate increases, you will have more people walkingaround more often under its influence. It simply is untenable tosuggest that policies such as legalization that increaseaddiction rates could do anything but increase the frequency ofdrug-induced crime. C. Black market crime As mentioned above, legalizers suggest that if you allow drugsto be sold legally, it would drive out the black market, for thelatter only thrives when people cannot obtain goods throughnormal, legal channels. Such analysis seems attractive at first,but a closer look at the facts will prove that it is bothsimplistic and incorrect. So long as there are any restrictions as to what drugs were tobe legalized, who would be able to buy them, what quantities andpotencies were available, etc., a black market would fill theneed. For example, if the legalizers would limit the sale ofdrugs to those people over twenty-one, then the black marketwould target children. This argument is made by David T.Courtwright, who finds potential black markets for "thoseunder twenty-one, or for public-safety officers, or transportworkers, or military personnel, or pregnant women, or prisoners,or probationers, or parolees, or psychotics. . . . "39 Inorder truly to defeat the black market, one not only would haveto allow anyone to buy drugs, but also would have to make allforms of drugs available. William Rasberry explains that"[i]f marijuana and perhaps heroin are legalized, but notcrack cocaine and violence-inducing PCP, the effect on the crimeassociated with drug trafficking would be minimal." Few, ifany, legalizers would be willing completely to legalize all drugsfor all people - but if they refuse to do so, they cannotjustifiably claim to have made a significant impact on blackmarket crime. Another problem with the legalizers' argument is that many ofthem advocate a policy whereby legalized drugs are taxed in orderto raise revenue for other social programs. But again, if youlegalize drugs and tax them, you will have a black market thatcan sell the same drugs less expensively. The same is true if youstamp a tariff on imported drugs, and history shows this to becorrect. Recall that until the early twentieth century, opiatesand other drugs were legal in the United States. Much of theopium consumed by U.S. citizens was imported from China, and" enlightened lawmakers decided to place a tariff on thedrug as a means of raising revenue. For example, between 1866 and1914, the duty on crude opium was 33%; on ready-to-smoke opium itwas 97%.41 Although these tariffs did produce income, they alsocreated a smuggler's paradise that organized crime syndicatessuch as the Chinese tongs quickly filled. Criminals would smuggleopium into the country, not pay the tariff, and make a higherprofit margin on their goods. Interestingly enough, at the peakof the opium tariffs twice as much opium was smuggled into theU.S. as went through legal channels.42 Thus, history proves thatif you place a tariff on imported drugs - be they legal orillegal - black markets will continue to flourish unabated. Let's return to the simple taxation of drugs produced withinthe United States. Again, the equation is simple - tax equalsblack market - and again, history proves it to be true. Taketobacco for instance. Here is a legal commodity that potentiallycan be taxed by both the federal government and any of the stategovernments.43 Unsurprisingly, some states historically have hadhigher cigarette taxes than others. In 1975, smokers in NorthCarolina would pay thirty-six cents a pack whereas New Yorkershad to pay fifty-four cents.44 Organized syndicates tookadvantage of the situation, buying cigarettes in North Carolinaand selling them in New York for a profit-indeed at one point 50%of all the cigarettes sold in New York City were bootleggedproducts controlled by criminal organizations.45 Thus, proponentsof legalized drugs will never be able to stop the black market,because the federal government, even if it wanted to, could notstop state governments from taxing the drugs at different levels. Finally, with regard to the entire black market theories ofthe legalizers, we have to remember the simple fact thatorganized crime is composed of criminals. Query what the Cali orthe Medellin Cartel would do if they discovered that theircocaine was being under priced by a legal manufacturer (let's saya pharmaceutical company like Upjohn). What is the chance thatthe Colombians would say "Oh well, we just cannot compete inthe market. Let's close up shop and take real jobs."Unlikely. Instead, currently entrenched crime syndicates woulduse violence to ensure their place in the market.46 In the aboveexample, the Cali cartel might destroy Upjohn's laboratories. Orit might murder everyone who sits on their Board of Directors. Orit might take the less glamorous, but certainly more traditional,strategy of telling addicts that if they don't buy their cocainefrom the cartel, they will be killed. In short, the belief thatif we legalize drugs then organized crime will run away with itstail between its legs ignores grim reality. In conclusion, drugs produce three types of crime:purchase-related crime, drug-induced crime, and black marketcrime. To the extent that legalizing drugs would make themcheaper - a point on which all sides of the debate agree - itwould create many new addicts and the incidence ofpurchase-related crime and drug-induced crime would increase.Furthermore, if there were any regulations or taxes of anysort placed upon the legalized drugs, U.S. history provesthat the black market crime would continue. Thus, legalizingdrugs not only does not decrease criminal behavior, it almostcertainly would spur its increase. 25 James Q.

Chapter Two Summary Sheet: Crime and Drug Legalization Ifthey say... If drugs were legalized, addicts would no longer have tocommit crimes to pay for their habit. Thenyou say... Drugs are already so cheap that legalization might not drivethe price down any further. Thus, addicts would still have tosteal. ["No Magic Bullet: A Look at Drug Legalization,"U.S. Dept. of Justice, D.E.A. Demand Reduction Section Positionpaper]. But assuming that legalization would cut the price of drugs,low prices encourage use and addiction. [Timothy Radonich,"Controlling drugs through regulation," NorthwestLibertarian, September 1990.] As addiction rates increased, crime, especially propertyCrime, would increase. [Elliott Currie, "Towards a Policy onDrugs," Dissent, Winter 1993]. As the prices of drugs decrease, addicts will buy more; thus,they will still steal in order to spend the same amount on drugs.[Robert E. Peterson, "Stop Legalization of IllegalDrugs," Drug Awareness Information Newsletter, July 1988]. Addicts would still steal in order to afford food, clothes,entertainment, etc. [William Bennett, "Mopping up after thelegalizers: What the 'intellectual' chorus fails to tellyou," The Washington Times, December 15, 1989]. Ifthey say... If drugs were legalized, drug- induced crime would decrease. Thenyou say... Drug use encourages irrational and criminal behavior. Studiesindicate that as many as 70% of inmates were on illegal drugswhen arrested. [U.S. Dept. of Justice, Office of JusticePrograms, Bureau of Justice Statistics, 'Tact Sheet: Drug DataSummary," Drugs & Crime Data. November 1992;Peter Bensinger, "Arguments Against Legalizing Drugs,"Drug Abuse Update, September 1988]. Recent U.S. experience with crack cocaine clearly proves thatas drugs become cheaper, violent crime increases. [WilliamBennett, "Mopping up after the legalizers: What the'intellectual' chorus fails to tell you," The WashingtonTimes, December 15, 1989]. As legalization of drugs increases the addiction rate [seeChapter One], then we would have more people under the influenceof drugs more often. Ifthey say... Legalizing drugs would end the crime caused by black marketsand organized syndicates. Thenyou say... If there are any restrictions placed upon who may use legaldrugs, such as minors, pregnant women, police, militarypersonnel, pilots, prisoners, parolees, or psychotics, a blackmarket would rise up to fill the niche. (David T.Courtwright,"Should We Legalize Drugs? HistoryAnswers," American Heritage, February/March 1993]. In order to begin to stop the black market, you would have tolegalize crack and PCP. [William Rasberry, "LegalizingDrugs: Let's Get Specific," The Washington Post, November 1,1989]. U.S. history proves that if you attempt to levy tariffs onimported legal drugs, a black market will result due tosmuggling. Such was the case in the early twentieth century whenChinese crime syndicates smuggled opium into the U.S. so as toavoid tariffs. [David T. Courtwright, "Should We LegalizeDrugs? History Answers," American Heritage, February/March1993]. If you tax the legal drugs at all, a black market will result.This is proven by U.S. history, where organized crime wouldsmuggle cigarettes from states with low tobacco taxes into thosewith high tobacco taxes, thus making a profit [Courtwright,citation above]. Organized crime would use violence against legal suppliers inorder to ensure its market share. Criminals would not play by therules. [Christopher Collins and Susan Collins, "WhatSavings?"

Their Argument Proponents of legalization suggest that the experiences ofcountries such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Switzerlandprove the efficacy of legalizing or decriminalizing various typesof illegal drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. Theymaintain that because such drugs are legal, these countries havefewer addicts and less drug-related crime. II. Our Argument The statements of the legalizers here are empirically untrue.As we discuss each country in turn, it will be shown thatlegalization did not work in any of them. A. Great Britain With the report of a government commission known as the BrainCommittee of 1964, England instituted a policy whereby doctorscould prescribe heroin so long as they followed certain treatmentcriteria.47 Previously in England, doctors could prescribe heroinmuch like any other opiate (such as morphine). This allowed a fewunscrupulous doctors to sell ungodly amounts of heroin to membersof the black market.48 Consequently, it was believed that ifheroin were offered at medical clinics according to stringentrules and regulations, addicts would come to these clinics toseek treatment and eventually would overcome their habit. As of 1983, however, England began to phase out these programsof clinically supplied heroin in favor of methadone treatment.49Why? First, according to the reputable British physician journal Lancet,the number of addicts increased 100% between 1970 and 1980.50 Adisproportionate number of these new addicts were between theages of sixteen and seventeen.51 Second, only twenty percent ofall of the addicts in England belonged to the clinicalprograms.52 At first blush, this fact seems strange - why wouldaddicts choose not to participate in a program wherein they getfree methadone? The answer probably lies in the fact thatmethadone does not produce the high that heroin does. Also,addicts probably did not care for the mandatory treatment andrehabilitation facets of the clinical programs. Whatever thereason, by 1985 England had 80,000 heroin addicts, the vastmajority of whom wen not in treatment.53 A third reason why England began to abolish its clinicalheroin program was the fact that not only were there few people,in them, but the programs themselves did not work. According tothe British Medical Journal, more addicts left the programbecause of criminal convictions than because of treatment.54Fourth, even with the clinical programs, heroin addicts had adeath rate twenty-six times the average population. Finally, evenwhen the programs were in operation, Scotland Yard had toincrease its narcotics division 100% in order to cope with theincreased crime rate.56 To summarize, the British experience with decriminalizedheroin in the clinical context was a dismal failure. When expertsfrom British Columbia were debating whether to create a similarprogram, they made the following conclusions that are soimportant as to deserve to be quoted at length: While some success is claimed in terms of reducing theincidence of young users, the following findings have also beennoted: 1) The British approach has failed to attract a majority ofaddicts; 2) Many registered addicts continue to turn to illicit sourcesof drugs; 3) Many registered addicts do not decrease their dosage overtime; 4) Many registered addicts continue to be involved in criminalactivity; 5) Many registered addicts are chronically unemployed or donot earn enough to look after themselves; 6) The death rate of registered addicts is much higher thanthat of the general population and may be higher than that ofNorth American addicts; 7) Since 1960, there has been a dramatic increase in theEnglish addict population; 8) The black market for heroin continues to thrive; 9) Law enforcement appears to remain a necessary, costly andcomplex control measure. In view of the above, it is felt that the application of theBritish approach to British Columbia would present seriousdangers.57 B. The Netherlands Proponents of legalization almost certainly would citeAmsterdam as the drug Mecca of the Western world. Anyone may gointo the restaurants in this city and order marijuana and hashishfrom a menu; further, heroin and cocaine have been decriminalizedfor all practical purposes. The police simply leave the usersalone. Consequently, health officials estimate that Amsterdam has7,000 addicts, 20% of whom are foreigners.58 These addicts areresponsible for 80% of all property crime in the city, thusnecessitating that Amsterdam maintain a police presence fargreater than those of cities of comparable size in the UnitedStates.59 The Dutch have not raised one dollar in tax revenue from drugsales, and drug violators account for 50 percent of the Dutchprison population, a higher proportion than in the UnitedStates.60 The Netherlands is the most crime-prone nation inEurope and most drug addicts live on state welfare payments andby committing crimes.61 Nationwide, the number of reported crimesincreased to 1.3 million in 1992 from. 812,000 in 1981.62 Facedwith public disgust at home over soaring drug related crime andpressure from other European Community countries to strengthendrug laws, Dutch authorities are implementing an aggressiveprogram to reduce drug-linked crimes and disturbances and shownew teeth in combatting illegal drug sales.63 Eberhard van derLaan, leader Of the Social Democrats in the Amsterdam CityCouncil says, "People are absolutely fed up with all thetroubles caused by drug addicts - car windows broken, noise,whole streets almost given up to the drug problem."64Legalization advocates claim that marijuana use in Netherlandshas not increased since the laws were liberalized, but the numberof Amsterdam drug cafes rose from 30 to over 300 in one decade.They also fail to note that daily marijuana use by U.S. youth hasdeclined by 75 percent.65 C. Switzerland Much like Amsterdam, Switzerland until recently followed apolicy of decriminalization. Indeed, a city park in the town ofZurich for many years was allowed to be a haven for drug users -police simply would ignore the problem by claiming that it wasbetter to have all the addicts in one place rather than havingthem roam throughout the entire city.66 Unsurprisingly, inFebruary of 1992 Switzerland ended this experiment withdecriminalization after experiencing an unacceptable increase inuse, violence, crime and health costs and consequences.67Specifically, the number of addicts residing at the park (calledPlatzspitz) jumped from a few hundred in 1987 to over 20,000, byearly 1992.68 Approximately 20% of these addicts were foreignerswho came to Zurich to take advantage of the city's lax druglaws.69 In deciding to close the park, city officials cited theincreased incidence of crime and prostitution--as Andres Oehler,a municipal spokesperson stated, "it was felt that thesituation had got out of control in every sense."70 D. Spain Since 1983 in Spain, it has been legal to use, but not sell,cocaine and heroin. Recently, however, Spanish officials have begun a crack-down on drug pushers dueto a dramatic increase in the addiction rate.71 Unsurprisingly,Spain and Italy, which also legalized use of cocaine and heroin,have the highest rates of both drug use and overdose of allEuropean countries.72 E. China Lest we forget the lessons of history, consider that in thelate 1800's, opium was legal in China. By 1900, ninety millionChinese were addicted to the drug, and it took fifty years ofrepressive police measures and rehabilitation to correct theproblem.73 Today, opium and other addictive drugs are illegal.74 F. Japan In the 1950's, Japan was faced with an epidemic of amphetamineuse that created half a million addicts. Through socializationand policies aimed at both reducing supply and demand, thenumber of addicts was decreased to a few thousand within fouryears.75 A heroin epidemic involving thousands of addicts wasdealt with successfully in the 1960's using the same measures. 76 G. Other countries Throughout recent history, numerous other countries haveattempted legalizing or decriminalizing drugs, all meeting withthe same harmful results. In Egypt in the 1920's, an unrestrictedsupply of cocaine and heroin created an epidemic that eventuallyresulted in the strict prosecution of all addicts.77 In Thailandand Iran, countries that traditionally have had cheap andunrestricted sources of narcotics, the addiction rates have beenand continue to be high.78 Finally, the Republic of Singapore hadto resort to strict law enforcement and mandatory rehabilitationin order to overcome a heroin epidemic.79 Given the experiences of countries such as Great Britain,Switzerland, The Netherlands, China, Japan, Spain, Egypt, Iran,and Thailand, it is little wonder why countries thattraditionally have had lenient drug laws are all moving in thedirection of illegalization. Undoubtedly, the danger that druglegalization presents was foremost on the minds of the numerouscountries - the United States included - that signed the SingleConvention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention onPsychotropic Substances of 1971. And such danger also is why theInternational Narcotics Control Board for the United Nationsconcluded in 1992 that "legalization advocates have not yetpresented a sufficiently comprehensive, coherent or viablealternative to the present system of international drug abusecontrol."80 47 John S.

DiGenova, U.S. Dept. of Justice, Drug EnforcementAdministration, June 3, 1988 (citing British medical journal Lancet);Peggy Mann, "Reasons to Oppose Legalizing IllegalDrugs," Drug Awareness Information Newsletter, September1988.] Only 20% of the addicts in Great Britain joined the clinicalprogram offered by the government. [John S. Russell and AndreMcNicoll, "The British Experience With NarcoticDependency," Province of British Columbia Ministry ofHealth, Alcohol and Drug Commission, April 1978]. More addicts left the British program because of criminalconvictions than because of rehabilitation. [Letter of John Lawn,citation above (citing statement of the British MedicalJournal)] . Heroin addicts in Britain had mortality rates 26 times higherthan that of the average population. [Letter of John Lawn,citation above (citing statement of article published in TheNew Republic)]. Scotland Yard had to increase its narcotics squad 100% inorder to combat the crime caused by the heroin addicts.["Arguments Against Legalizing Drugs," Drug AbuseUpdate, September 1988]. Ifthey say... Experience in Netherlands shows that you can effectivelylegalize drugs without any problems. Thenyou say... The Amsterdam health officials state that the 7,000 addicts inthe city are responsible for 80% of the property crime. (RamonBracamontes, "Marijuana is as easy to buy as icecream," El Paso Times, July 24, 1988]. Because of its drug problem, Amsterdam is required to have apolice force much greater than those of U.S. cities of similarpopulation. [Ramon Bracamontes, citation above]. The Netherlands is the most crime-prone nation in Europe andmost drug addicts live on state welfare payments and bycommitting crimes. [Robert E.

Amsterdam is rethinking its liberal drug policies because ofthe social ills that result there from. [Robert E. Peterson,"Stop Legalization of Illegal Drugs," Drug AwarenessInformation Newsletter, July 1988]. Ifthey say... The Swiss decriminalized drugs without any adverseconsequences. Thenyou say... As of February 1992, Switzerland officially rejected itspolicy of decriminalization. [Roger Cohen, "Amid GrowingCrime, Zurich Closes a Park It Reserved for Drug Addicts,"New York Times, February 11, 1992]. Allowing a city park to be used as a "druglegalized" area of Zurich, the number of addicts escalatedfrom a few hundred to over 20,000 within several years. [RogerCohen, citation above]. Swiss officials now admit that their policy oflegalization-decriminalization served to increase crime,especially property crimes and prostitution. [Roger Cohen,citation above]. Ifthey say... Spain successfully legalized both cocaine and heroin. Thenyou say... Spain, and Italy, the two European countries that legalizeduse of both cocaine and heroin, have the highest rates of bothaddiction and overdose in all of Europe. [Gabriel G. Nahas,"A Battle Won, a Stalemated War and A New Strategy,"(position paper)]. Spain recently has begun a crack-down on drug pushers in thehopes of decreasing addiction and crime. [Robert E. Peterson,"Stop Legalization, of Illegal Drugs," Drug AwarenessInformation Newsletter, July 1988]. Ifthey say... Historically, countries that have legalized or decriminalizeddrugs have not been harmed. Thenyou say... When opium was legal in China at the turn of the century,there were 90 million addicts, and it took China fifty years toeventually solve the problem. [Gabriel G. Nahas, "TheDecline of Drugged Nations," The Wall Street Journal, July11, 1988]. In the 1950's Japan had an epidemic of amphetamine addictionthat it solved within four years by both police enforcement andrehabilitation. [Gabriel G. Nahas, citation above]. When Egypt allowed unrestricted trade of cocaine and heroin inthe 1920's, an epidemic of addiction resulted. [Gabriel G. Nahas,citation above]. In Iran and Thailand, countries where drugs are readilyavailable, the prevalence of addiction has been and continues tobe exceptionally high. [David T. Courtwright, "Should WeLegalize Drugs? History Answers," American Heritage,February/March 1993]. Ifthey say... The international community condones legalized drugs. Thenyou say... Both the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and theConvention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 (both signed by theU.S.) insist that drugs should not be legalized.

Their Argument Proponents of legalization suggest that their policy will savesociety money for several reasons. First, we will not have to paypolice to enforce the present criminal-justice approach to drugusage. Second, we will be able to tax legal drugs, therebyraising revenue. II. Our Argument It should be stated initially that most people misconceive theamount of resources expended under the status quo for drugcontrol. The FY 1994 federal budget allocates $7.51 billion fordrug control (supply reduction) which includes criminal justice,interdiction, international programs and intelligence.81 Stateand local governments spend even more, $12.6 billion a year.82Granted, this is a lot of money, but we should put these numbersin perspective. Americans spend about four billion dollars eachsummer for air conditioning.83 The citizens of Washington Statespend $1.4 billion each year on legal gambling alone.84 Thenational debt numbers in the trillions of dollars. One StealthBomber runs half a billion dollars. Indeed, only 1.4% of totalgovernment spending goes for law enforcement of all types, and anadditional 1.0% for prosecution and prisons.85 Out of this smallpercentage, 12% of spending for law enforcement was allocated todrug control activities, and about 25% of correctional (prison)spending was drug related.86 Only 1.5% of total state and localgovernment spending is attributed to drug control activities.87Thus, when taken in context, it is apparent that the costs ofcriminalized drugs nowhere approaches the financial obligationsof government programs such as national defense, Social Security,or Medicare. More important, if we legalized drugs on the assumption thatby taxing them we could raise large amounts of revenue, we wouldbe sadly mistaken. First, as discussed in Chapter Two, any suchtaxation scheme would perpetuate a criminal black market.Consequently, we would still have to spend money funding police,courts and the like to fight this problem. Second, if alcohol isany indication, we simply would not make that much money bytaxing drugs. The total revenue collected from alcohol taxes atthe federal, state, and local levels amounts to about $13.1billion a year," a paltry sum compared to the social costsassociated with alcohol consumption - something in theneighborhood of $100 billion." Third, how would we structurea tax scheme for drugs? If we wanted to correlate higher taxeswith higher risk behavior, logically we would tax the fifth jointmore than the first (inasmuch as the fifth joint probably is moredamaging to one's health). And wouldn't it cost money to createthe governmental bureaucracy that would handle this taxationpolicy? Thus, we do not spend that much on the drug war in comparisonto other governmental programs, and taxation of legalized drugswould not result in that much revenue. But by far the mostcompelling economic argument against the legalization of drugs isthe social costs associated with such a policy. First, treating drug addicts is enormously expensive. Takecrack babies as an example. In 1988, it cost $2.5 billion for theintensive care needed to keep the babies alive after birth.90 Butthat was just the beginning of the expenses. It is estimated thatit will cost $15 billion to prepare these children forkindergarten,91 and will then cost between $6 billion and $12billion for every year of special learning programs.92 Evenassuming the low-ball figure, the social costs of educating allof the crack babies born in 1988 - not all crack babies, mindyou, just those born that year - will run approximately $90billion by the time they graduate from high school. Now to theextent that legalization will increase the drug addiction ratesenormously [see Chapter One], legalization seems like a veryexpensive policy indeed. And who will foot the bill? Eithercommon citizens will through taxes for government aid programs,or through increased insurance premiums.93 But treatment costs are just the first way in which drugaddiction drains society. Already, drug addicts cost the countryroughly $33 billion dollars a year in lost productivity andjob-related accidents, according to a study conducted in 1987 bythe Research Triangle Institute of Research Triangle Park, NorthCarolina.94 If legalized, addiction rates would increase and thecost would rise to between $140 billion and $210 billion ayear.95 And who will pay for lost productivity and job-relatedaccidents? Consumers will, of course, in the final costs of theproduced goods. Finally we must consider human lives in the economic calculus.As drug abuse causes more job related accidents, more people willbe hurt or killed. Take, for example, the Conrail/Amtrak disasterof January 4, 1987. Because an engineer and a brakeman were highon marijuana, their train collided with another, killing sixteenpeople and injuring 175.96 So go back to the beginning. We spend approximately $20billion a year on drug control activities. If drugs werelegalized, we would see an increase in addiction rates.Consequently we would have more crack babies (the kind thatalready will cost the system $90 billion), decreased productivity(at a cost of between $140 billion and $210 billion), morejob-related accidents, and more dead people. And given thepotential black market effect, it is unlikely that we could raiseeven several billion dollars in tax revenue. From a purelyeconomic standpoint, legalization is not cost effective. 81 "National Drug Control Strategy: Reclaiming OurCommunities from Drugs and Violence," The White House, February 1994. 82 "State and Local Spending on Drug ControlActivities," Office of National Drug Control Policy, October1993. 83 John W.

We spend approximately $20 billion annually on drug control.["State and Local Spending on Drug Control Activities,"Office of National, Drug Control Policy, October 1993]. Americans spend roughly $4 billion every summer on airconditioning. [John W. Wenburg, "Should We LegalizeDrugs?" Position Paper of the Pierce County ProsecutingAttorney]. Less than 3% of total government spending goes for police andprisons, and only 12% of police spending and 25% of correctionalspending is drug related. [Sourcebook of Criminal JusticeStatistics 1986, Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1987 and State andLocal Spending on Drug Control Activities, Office of NationalDrug Control Policy, October 1993]. Many programs such as national defense, Social Security, andMedicare cost much more than what we spend on efforts to controldrugs. Ifthey say... If we legalized drugs, we could raise much revenue throughtaxation. Thenyou say... If you try to tax legalized drugs, you will create a blackmarket. You will then have to allocate resources to the policeand the courts to combat this crime. (See Chapter Two]. This was tried with alcohol. It Failed. Federal, state, andlocal alcohol taxes combined raise approximately $13.1 billiondollars a year, but alcohol extracts over $ 100 billion a year insocial costs such as lost productivity and health costs. [MortonM. Kondracke, "Don't Legalize Drugs," The New Republic,June 27, 1988; Robert E. Peterson, "'Stop Legalization ofIllegal Drugs," Drug Awareness Information Newsletter, July1988]. Ifthey say... Legalizing drugs would save money. Thenyou say... Legalizing drugs would increase the addiction rate.[see Chapter One]. Addicts require treatment, and this is enormously expensive.For example, in 1988 we spent $2.5 billion for intensive care ofcrack babies. It will cost roughly $15 billion to prepare themfor kindergarten. Further, special learning programs will costbetween $6 billion and $12 billion a year for every year afterkindergarten. By the time they graduate from high school, thisyields a total of roughly $90 billion. [A.M. Rosenthal, "HowMuch Is a Baby Worth?" New York Times, December 15, 1989]. If we legalize drugs, it will cost society between $140billion and $210 billion a year in lost productivity andjob-related accidents. [Morton M. Kondracke, citation above]. If we legalize drugs, consumers will bear the ultimateresponsibility for the bill because of increases in insurancepremiums and higher costs of manufactured goods. ["No MagicBullet: A Look at Drug Legalization," Drug EnforcementAdministration Publication]. Legalizing drugs would increase the incidence of drug-relatedaccidents such as the Conrail/Amtrak train crash of January 1987in which 16 people were killed and 175 were injured.

Their Argument Proponents of legalization suggest that the United Statesexperience with alcohol prohibition in the 1920's provides ampleproof of the problems that result when the government attempts tomake a popular substance illegal. Legalizers point to ostensibleincreases in organized crime such as that associated with AlCapone in order to make their point. Basically, they say, it isbetter to legalize, tax and regulate than simply to declare drugsillegal. II. Our Argument The legalizers' arguments here are deeply flawed and merit twoprimary responses: first, the circumstances surroundingProhibition are so different than those of today's world that itpractically is impossible to use its history as a means ofanalyzing present-day policy; second, Prohibition was in factsuccessful and did not create the negative consequences that thelegalizers say it did. But to the first point. David Teasley, an analyst with theCongressional Research Service of the Library of Congress,undertook an in-depth analysis in 1992 entitled, "Druglegalization and the 'lessons' of Prohibition." Teasleyultimately concluded that [A] comprehensive analogy between Prohibition and the moderndrug problem is problematic in at least two major ways. First,between the two eras there are significant differences that tendto undermine the prolegalization analogy. Second, many argumentsof the prolegalizers are weakened by their reliance upon a widelyheld set of popular beliefs about Prohibition rather than uponrecent historical evidence. Such attempts to create this analogybased upon these popular beliefs about Prohibition serve only toconfuse the debate over legalization of illicit drugs.97 Let us examine the differences that Teasley (and others) citebetween the era of Prohibition and the era in which we now live. First, during prohibition the government sought to restrictthe consumption of alcohol although it lacked the moral consensusof the nation. That is, even during Prohibition, most people wereaccepting of alcohol.98 Such is not the case today, for the vastmajority of citizens do feel that illicit drugs should remainillegal [see Chapter Eleven]. Thus, Prohibition went against thenational consensus whereas illegalization of drugs does not. Second, the laws of Prohibition themselves were different thanthose dealing with illicit drugs today. During Prohibition, itwas not illegal to drink alcohol, it was only illegal to sell it.Today, however, it is both illegal to sell and to use illicitdrugs. Consequently, today's laws can target the users whilethose of the Prohibition era could not.99 Third, during the Prohibition era several states did notsupport the federal laws. This fact created tension between thestate and federal governments and hampered effective prosecutionof alcohol distributors. Today, 48 states have signed the UniformControlled Substances Act, and all are in effective agreementwith the federal government in matters of drug policy - astate/federal consensus exists that was not present duringProhibition.100 Fourth, criminal penalties are much more severe today than inthe 1920's. For example, the first-offense bootlegger faced amaximum fine of $ 1,000 or six months in prison. Today, afirst-offense trafficker of cocaine or heroin (of less than 100grams) faces fines up to $1 million and imprisonment for up to 20years.101 Fifth, during Prohibition the United States was a"dry" nation within a "wet" internationalcommunity. Just as the Prohibition policies were counter to themoral consensus within the U.S., they were also at odds with thatof the international community (which explains why so muchalcohol was imported from Canada). But as discussed in ChapterThree, the international community is resolute when it comes todrug policy; in December of 1988 over 80 countries signed theConvention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs andPsychotropic Substances.102 Sixth and finally, the administrativestructure of the government agencies designed to carry out theProhibition laws was narrow, unstable, and filled with politicalappointees. Today's national drug strategy involves over a dozenfederal agencies coordinated by the Office of National DrugControl Policy. In short, the governmental bodies that prosecutetoday's drug violators are much larger, have much betterresources, and are much more professional than their Prohibitioncounterparts.103 Thus, it is factually incorrect for the legalizers toanalogize our history with Prohibition to today's drug policies.They simply do not have that much in common. But should thelegalizers choose to make such an analogy, they also should bemade aware of the fact that Prohibition was on balance asuccessful program. First, use of alcohol decreased significantly duringProhibition.104 This decrease in turn lead to a marked decreasein the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver.105 Also,alcohol-related arrests decreased 50%. 106 Finally, the suiciderate also decreased by 50%.107 A second reason why Prohibition was a successful program isdue to the fact that it did not -- contrary to popular myth --cause an increase in the crime rate. It is true that there was anincrease in the homicide rate during Prohibition, but this is notthe same as an increase in the overall crime rate. Furthermore,the increase in homicide occurred predominantly in theAfrican-American community, and African-Americans at that timewere not the people responsible for alcohol trafficking.108 Thedrama of Elliot Ness and Al Capone largely was just that, dramasensationalized by the media of the time. In short, it is doubtful that one legitimately may analogizeProhibition with our current efforts to control drugs. There aretoo many differences in the laws, the political establishment,the moral consensus, and the international community to make suchanalogizing worthwhile. Nonetheless, the fact remains thatProhibition accomplished many of its goals, improved the healthof the entire nation, and did not cause a significant increase inthe crime rate.

The lessons of Prohibition can be used to analyze the presentpolicies, prohibition in illicit drugs. Thenyou say... Whereas there was not a moral consensus for Prohibition U.S.citizens overwhelmingly are in favor of the the continuedillegalization of illicit drugs. [Robert E. Peterson, "StopLegalization of Illegal Drugs;" Drug Awareness InformationNewsletter, July 1988]. During Prohibition, only the sale, and not the use, of alcoholwas illegal. Today, both sale and use of illicit drugs areillegal. Consequently, present drug policies can target userswhereas Prohibition laws could not. [David L. Teasley, "Druglegalization and the 'lessons' of Prohibition," ContemporaryDrug Problems, Spring 1992]. During Prohibition, there was much tension between federal andstate alcohol policy. Today, 48 states have signed the UniformControlled Substances Act, and the federal and state governmentswork in concert. [David Teasley, citation above]. During Prohibition, criminal sanctions were not extreme - afirst-time bootlegger could receive a $1,000 fine or six monthsin prison. Today, fines for first-time cocaine or herointrafficking are up to $1 million and prison sentences go as highas 20 years. [David Teasley, citation above). During Prohibition, the U.S. was a "dry" country ina "wet" international community. Today, almost allcountries are in agreement that drugs should be illegal, aswitnessed by the fact that 80 countries signed the 1988Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs andPsychotropic Substances. [David Teasley, citation above]. The political administration responsible for enforcingProhibition was small, underfunded, and unprofessional. Incontrast, the current drug control program is run by over a dozenagencies coordinated by the Office of National Drug ControlPolicy. [David Teasley, citation above]. Ifthey say... Prohibition caused more harm than good. Thenyou say... During Prohibition, alcohol use declined significantly [DavidTeasley, citation above]. During Prohibition, incidence of cirrhosis of the liverdecreased by 35%. [Charles Krauthammer, "Legalize? No,Deglamorize," The Washington Post, May 20, 1988]. During Prohibition, the suicide rate decreased 50%. [RobertStutman, "Reasons Not to Legalize Drugs," DrugAwareness Information Newsletter]. During Prohibition, the incidence of alcohol-related arrestsalso declined by 50% [Robert L. DuPont, "The Case AgainstLegalizing Drugs," Drug Awareness Information Newsletter]. Contrary to popular opinion, the crime rate did not markedlyincrease during prohibition. What did increase was the homiciderate (not the same as the overall crime rate) amongAfrican-Americans. And African-Americans had little to do withalcohol trafficking. [David Teasley, citation above]. Mark Kleiman admits that the U.S. experience with Prohibitionis one of the strongest arguments in favor of the continuedillegalization of illicit drugs. [Letter from John C. Lawn toJoseph E. DiGenova, Drug Enforcement Administration, June 3,1988].

Their Argument Proponents of drug legalization advance the argument that tothe extent alcohol and tobacco may be freely consumed, it ishypocritical to make other drugs such as marijuana and cocaineillegal. They cite the individual and social harm caused by bothtobacco and alcohol to support their argument. II. Our Argument Two responses immediately come to mind when addressing thelegalizers' argument. First, simply because we have as a societyhave chosen to legalize some dangerous substances does not leadto the conclusion that we should legalize all dangeroussubstances. Second, the legalizers' argument is logically flawed:When they compare the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco tothat caused by drugs such as cocaine and marijuana they arecomparing apples and oranges (or more specifically, legal toillegal drugs). Alcohol and tobacco are legal, and, according toour analysis in Chapter One [Addiction Rates], are used much morefrequently than illegal drugs. Because their use is greater, theamount of damage they cause will also be greater. But this is notto say that one "dose" of alcohol is inherently moredangerous than one "dose" of cocaine. As James Q.Wilson explains, predictions about the harms of cocaine thatassume its illegality tells us little about what damage cocainewould do if it were legal.111 Thus, the proper analysis is not tocompare damage caused by cocaine to that caused by alcohol underthe present system, but instead is to compare the harm likelycaused by legalized cocaine to that caused by alcohol. But let us look more closely at the legalizers' positionitself. 1. Tobacco. Certainly tobacco kills people.Nonetheless, it is disingenuous to say that as such it is a moredangerous substance than either cocaine or marijuana. For whileit may harm one's health, tobacco does not affect one'sintellectual processing or decision-making ability. As ProfessorWilson explains: Tobacco shortens one's life, cocaine debases it. Nicotinealters one's habits, cocaine alters one's soul. The heavy use ofcrack, unlike the heavy use of tobacco, corrodes those naturalsentiments of sympathy and duty that constitute our human natureand make possible our social life."' Think of it this way: Research fairly convincingly hasdemonstrated that cholesterol is bad for people, and in fact maybe responsible for a large amount of heart disease in the UnitedStates. In essence, cholesterol kills. But to take this premiseand then argue that because we allow people to eat red meat weshould also allow them to smoke crack is both unsophisticated andunpersuasive reasoning. Similarly, to argue that because we donot allow people to smoke crack we should not allow them to eatred meat also displays a rather monumental lack of common sense.And although cholesterol may kill you, it does not lead to thetypes of bizarre, destructive behavior that is associated withmost illegal drugs. 2. Alcohol. Alcohol is somewhat harder to justify, fornot only can it kill people but it does in fact alter one'sbehavior and may encourage antisocial and destructive activity.But again, this admission does not me-an that one must viewalcohol and cocaine as equivalent. First, a far greaterpercentage of people who use cocaine become addicted to thesubstance than do people who use alcohol. Recall that in ChapterOne, we discovered that the addiction rate for cocaine may be ashigh as 75%.113 Conversely, the addiction rate for alcohol isabout 10%.114 One is thus far more likely to becomeaddicted to cocaine than to alcohol. Second, the relapse rate(the percentage of people who quit the drug who later begin totake it again), is much higher for cocaine.115 In short, do not let proponents of legalization argue thatjust because tobacco and alcohol are legal, so too should becocaine and marijuana. First, just because we sanction somedangerous substances does not mean that we should allow all ofthem. Second, it is misleading to compare the damage caused bylegal drugs with that caused by illegal drugs -- instead weshould compare the risks of alcohol and tobacco with those of legalizedcocaine and marijuana. Likely we would find that the latterare much more dangerous than the former. Third, tobacco does not alter one's behavior and encourageviolent behavior as do many illegal drugs. Fourth, alcohol, whileadmittedly dangerous, is much less addictive than presentlyillegal drugs and also is easier to quit once addicted. Do notcompound problems simply because they are difficult to solve-keepillegal drugs illegal and at the same time try to discouragealcohol and tobacco use. 111 James Q. Wilson, "Against the Legalization ofDrugs," Commentary, February 1990. 112 Id. 113 George Church, "'Thinking the Unthinkable,"Time, May 30,1988. 114 id. 115 "Issues and Comments to respond toLegalization of Drugs," Office of Congressional and PublicAffairs Drug Enforcement Administration Publication, May 1988. Chapter Six Summary Sheet: The Role of Alcohol and Tobacco inthe Drug Legalization Debate Ifthey say... Since alcohol and tobacco are legal, marijuana and cocaineshould also be legal. Thenyou say... Just because some dangerous substances are legal does not meanthat all dangerous substances should also be legal. One cannot properly compare the harm associated with tobaccoand alcohol use with the harm associated with cocaine andmarijuana use, because you are comparing legal drugs with illegaldrugs. And as discussed in Chapter One, legalizing a drug makesit more dangerous. (See last paragraph, page 7). Although tobacco harms one's health, it does not alter one'smental processes, nor does it create bizarre, violent behavior.[James Q. Wilson, "Against the Legalization of Drugs,"Commentary, February 1990]. Although alcohol is harmful, it is much less addictive thancocaine: Studies suggest that alcohol has an addiction rate of10%, whereas cocaine has an addiction rate as high as 75%.[George Church. "Thinking the Unthinkable,"'Time, May 30, 1988]. Do not legalize drugs because alcohol and tobacco are harmful:keep illegal drugs illegal and try to decrease use of the others.

Their Argument Proponents of legalization suggest that even if drugs such ascocaine, marijuana, and heroin are not fully legalized, theyshould be made more available as forms of medical treatment. Forexample, legalizers suggest that heroin should be used much inthe same way as is morphine presently and that marijuana shouldbe used in treating glaucoma and the side-effects ofchemotherapy. II. Our Argument In order to fully analyze the debate surrounding the medicaluses of heroin and marijuana, each drug should be discussed inturn. 1. Heroin Heroin is an opiate, as are drugs such as morphine. Legalizerssuggest that because morphine does not always succeed inrelieving the pain of, for example, cancer patients, the onlylogical step is to try heroin. This is factually incorrect. In order to understand why this argument is flawed, one mustknow how heroin and morphine differ from one another. As Drs.Robert McCarthy and Michael Montagne explain, "Kaiko, et al.found that although heroin is more potent - and achieves peakpain control and mood elevation effects faster, both pain controland mood elevation are more prolonged with morphine. "116That is, heroin gives you a quicker "high," butmorphine provides longer-lasting effects. Furthermore, we havemany other opioids available under present pharmaceutical laws.As Professor Arthur G. Lipman explains, [s]ome advocates of heroin legalization argue that it shouldbe available as an alternative opioid because some patientsrespond better to one opioid than another. That is true. However,we already have a variety of opioids commercially available inthis country. If a patient does not respond to morphine asexpected, it would be more logical to use a chemically differentopioid (e.g., hydromorphone, methadone) than a morphine product[such as heroin]. Therefore, the argument for heroin is notlogical. 117 Not only is Professor Lipman's argument medically sound, butit makes common sense. Heroin and morphine have similar chemicalstructures. If morphine does not work for a given patient, itmakes more sense to try an opioid with a different chemicalconstruct than to give them a drug very similar to the one thatis not working. These two facts----that heroin does not produce as constantand prolonged a treatment as does morphine, and that many otheropioids presently exist that can do the job better than heroin inthe event that morphine does not work - help to explain why thevast majority of medical society members do not favor the use ofheroin as a form of therapeutic treatment. The British doctorswho initially suggested the viability of therapeutic herointreatment long ago reversed their position.118 And althoughMaurice Bectel, President of the American PharmaceuticalAssociation, admits that problems do exist in the treatment ofcancer pain, these problems stem largely from the fact that"physicians fail to prescribe proper dosages of existingmedications, not because of the lack of availability ofheroin."119 Indeed, as Professor Lipman correctly notes,"[i]f the energy devoted to legalizing heroin wereredirected toward better use of available opioids, patients wouldbenefit.120 But not only is allowing the therapeutic use of heroinunnecessary, it also could create other problems. For example,increased medical use of heroin increases the risk of"diversion"-- that the patients would sell their heroinon the black market.121 Also, if pharmacies routinely stocked asupply of heroin, it would increase the risk of burglaries. Thisfact gives one special concern when one notes that fully 50% ofburglaries against pharmacies are committed with the intention ofstealing controlled substances.122 In short, Lipman concludes that "[m]isinformation aboutheroin has clouded the issue, but there is valid, published scientific evidence that unequivocallyrefutes the argument that heroin should be legalized."123 116 Robert L. McCarthy and Michael Montagne, "Theargument for therapeutic use of heroin in pain management,"American Journal of Hospital Pharmacists, May 1993. 117 Arthur G. Lipman, "The argument against therapeuticuse of heroin in pain management," American Journal of Hospital Pharmacists, May 1993. 118 Id. 119 Robert L.

Lipman, "The argument againsttherapeutic use of heroin in pain management," AmericanJournal of Hospital Pharmacists, May 1993. 121 Id. 122 Id. 123 Id. 2. Marijuana a. Treatment for glaucoma Glaucoma is a disease in which the fluid pressure within theeyeball (known as the intraocular pressure) increases and therebydamages the optic nerve, potentially causing blindness.Legalizers advance the claim that marijuana can decrease theintraocular pressure and thereby prevent blindness. Let's look atthis claim. First, the studies that the legalizers cite for support oftheir propositions assume the use of THC itself rather thanmarijuana.125 Thus while one may claim that THC decreasesintraocular pressure, it is not technically correct to claim thatmarijuana does as well. Second, even if marijuana does decrease intraocular pressure,it does so only at high dosages - in order to get the benefits,you have to stay stoned all day. Doctor Keith Green suggests thatin order to decrease intraocular pressure, one would have tosmoke the equivalent of six joints a day.126 Michael Van Buskirk,Director of Glaucoma Services and Chairman of the Department ofOphthalmology at Devers Eye Institute agrees, stating that"[a]lcohol also produces a profound reduction in . . .intraocular pressure. 'Me recommendation to use marijuana isexactly analogous to the recommendation to ingest alcohol andmaintain a state of drunkenness to treat glaucoma."127 Third, even if marijuana successfully combats one symptom ofglaucoma - intraocular pressure - it does so at the expense ofexacerbating another symptom. For while marijuana may decreaseintraocular pressure, it also decreases blood pressure (and thusblood flow) to the eye. Carl Kupfer, director of the National EyeInstitute, explains: For the optic nerve to be properly nourished, there, must bean adequate amount of blood flowing to that nerve at all times,so that if we have a drug that both lowers intraocular pressureas well as blood pressure, we may be interfering with the supplyof blood to the optic nerve, and therefore even though thepressure in the eye may decrease, such a patient will not beprotected against losing visual function from the glaucomaprocess.128 Thus, marijuana at best alleviates one problem of glaucomawhile increasing the risk of another. And in order to evenaccomplish this ambivalent goal, one must stay stoned the entireday. It is no surprise, then, that experts such as Doctor Greenconclude that "marijuana. . . has little potential future asa glaucoma medication."129 b. Treatment for chemotherapy Proponents also suggest that marijuana is useful to combat theside-effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting. Tosupport their position, they cite a study conducted by MarkKleiman which found that 40% of cancer specialists hadrecommended marijuana to relieve chemotherapy nausea. 130 First, the Kleiman study is flawed statistically andmethodologically. 57% of the doctors that Kleiman sentquestionnaires to did not even bother to return them. Also,Kleiman does not document the number of questionnaires that werereturned unanswered. Further, Kleiman does not document thenumber of questionnaires that expressed no opinion as to thetherapeutic use of marijuana. Once all of these factors areconsidered, Kleiman's "40%" acceptance rate would be nomore than 15%, and, according to Dr. Richard Schwartz, ClinicalProfessor of Pediatrics at Georgetown University School ofMedicine, is "probably much less."131 Second, the nation's top cancer experts reject marijuana forchemotherapy treatment. As David Ettinger, professor of oncologyat the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine notes,"There is no indication that marijuana is effective intreating nausea and vomiting resulting from radiation treatmentor other causes. No legitimate studies have been conducted whichmake such conclusions."132 Doctor John Laszlo, VicePresident of Research for the American Cancer Society agrees thatthere is insufficient evidence to suggest that marijuana is auseful chemotherapy treatment.133 Third, the National Cancer Institute itself notes that"other antiemetic agents such as ondansetron,metoclopramine, droperidol, etc. have been shown to be moreuseful than marijuana-related compounds as first linetherapy."134 Thus, while there is no evidence to prove marijuana's use inchemotherapy, there are numerous alternative drugs that obviatethe need to even pursue research on the subject. c. Treatment for AIDS Proponents of legalized drugs next suggest that marijuana isuseful in treating AIDS both because it relieves pain and becauseit stimulates appetite. Unfortunately, marijuana would actuallyexacerbate the health risks associated with AIDS. First, studiesconducted at the Virginia Medical College suggest that the THC inmarijuana damages the immune system, making the patient moresusceptible to colds, viruses, and influenza while at the sametime increasing the severity of any illnesses that the patienthas.135 Clearly, the last thing that a patient with AIDS needs isto have his or her immune system weakened. Second, the marijuanasmoke itself is damaging to the AIDS patients. As Dr. SoniaBuist, Professor of Medicine at Oregon Health Sciences Universityexplains, "I cannot support the use of marijuana to treatpatients with this condition [AIDS]. Furthermore, I wouldmaintain that its use is contraindicated because marijuana smokeis extremely irritating to the airways and may add additionalpulmonary problems in these very susceptibleindividuals."136 d. Treatment for multiple sclerosis Proponents of legalization finally argue that marijuana isuseful to stop the spasms caused by multiple sclerosis. Expertson MS absolutely reject this proposition. In fact, the scientificopinion may be summed up by Dr. Donald Silberberg, Chair of theDepartment of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania Schoolof Medicine and Chief of the Neurology Service at the Hospital ofPennsylvania, when he states that I have not found any legitimate medical or scientific workswhich show that marijuana... is medically effective in treatingmultiple sclerosis or spasticity.... The long-term treatment ofthe symptoms of multiple sclerosis through the use of marijuanacould be devastating. . . . The use of (marijuana), especiallyfor long-term treatment ... would be worse than the originaldisease itself." Having proved that marijuana is not effective in the treatmentof glaucoma, the treatment of chemotherapy side-effects, thetreatment of AIDS, or the treatment of MS, we should discuss theevidence that suggests that marijuana is harmful to one's health.Recall the material presented in Chapter One [Addiction Rates]that suggested that marijuana caused numerous health problems.Let us expand upon the inquiry. First, Swedish researchers foundthat people who smoked pot fifty or more times were six times aslikely to develop schizophrenia. The study specifically foundthat marijuana increased the incidence of schizophrenia not onlyin those patients who were predisposed to the illness, but alsoin those who were not.138 Second, physicians in 1986 beganreporting cases of lung, head, neck, tongue, and respiratorytract cancer in patients aged 17 to 39.139 Third, maternal use ofmarijuana increases the risk of childhood leukemia by 1,000%.140Fourth, marijuana exposure produces abnormalities similar tothe Fetal Alcohol Syndrome but at five times the rate of alcohol.141 Thus, not only is marijuana not a good medical treatment, butit also causes schizophrenia, cancer, leukemia, and childhoodabnormalities. Consequently, it is unsurprising to learn that"marijuana has been rejected as medicine by the AmericanMedical Association, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, theAmerican Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmologyand the American Cancer Society. Not one American healthassociation accepts marijuana as medicine."142 124 Purnell and Gregg (1975); Perez-Reyes et al.(1976); Merritt et al. (1980); Green and Roth (1982); Jay andGreen (1983). 125 Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition;Remand; 21 CFR Part 1308 [Docket No. 86-22), 1986. 126 Id. 127 Sandra Bennett, "Therapeutic Marijuana: Fact orFiction," Drug Awareness Information Newsletter, July 1992. 128 Cannabis and Society, Chpt. 5, p. 453 (citing CarlKupfer). 129 Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition; Remand;21 CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22], 1986. 130 "Study. 40% of doctors favor some use of pot,"Press & Sun-Bulletin, May 1, 1991. 131 Sandra S.

Chapter Seven Summary Sheet: Medical Uses of PresentlyIllegal Drugs Ifthey say... We should allow for therapeutic use of heroin. Thenyou say... Morphine provides longer-lasting, more consistent pain reliefthan does heroin. [Robert L. McCarthy and Michael Montagne,"The argument for therapeutic use of heroin in painmanagement," American Journal of Hospital Pharmacists, May1993]. If morphine does not work for a given patient, you should notuse- heroin, which is chemically very similar to morphine, butinstead should use a different opioid such as methadone. [ArthurG. Lipman, "The argument against therapeutic use of heroinin pain management," American Journal of HospitalPharmacists, May 1993]. The British doctors who initially advocated the therapeuticuse of heroin long ago reversed their position. [Lipman, citationabove]. The American Pharmaceutical Association admits that there areproblems in pain management, but that they are due to thetendency of doctors to fail to prescribe sufficient dosages ofpresently available opioids, not because of the unavailability ofheroin. [Lipman, citation above]. Allowing the therapeutic use of heroin increases the risk ofdiversion-i.e. that patients will sell their drugs on the blackmarket rather than using it themselves. (Lipman, citation above], Allowing pharmacies to stock heroin likely would 'increase therisk of robbery, especially when one considers that 50% of allpharmacy burglaries are committed to steal controlled substances.[Lipman, citation above]. Ifthey say... Marijuana should be used to treat glaucoma. Thenyou say... The studies which assert that marijuana helps to decreaseintraocular pressure were conducted with THC, not with marijuanaper se. [Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition;Remand; 21 CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. In order to see a significant decrease in intraocularpressure, you would have to smoke so much marijuana that youwould be stoned all day. [Scheduling Petition, citation above]. In fact, alcohol also decreases intraocular pressure. But aswith marijuana, you would have to consume so much that you wouldbe drunk all day. [Sandra S. Bennett, "TherapeuticMarijuana: Fact or Fiction," Drug Watch, July 1992]. Although marijuana may reduce one symptom of glaucoma(intraocular pressure), it also exacerbates another problem.Specifically, marijuana decreases blood pressure and hence. bloodsupply to the optic nerve- Because the optic nerve no longerreceives an adequate blood supply, it can be just as damaging toeyesight as the high intraocular pressure itself. [Bennett,citation above (citing Michael Van Buskirk, Director of GlaucomaServices and Chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at Devers Eye Institute)]. According to Doctor Keith Green, who serves or has served onthe boards of eight prestigious eye journals, "Marijuana ...has little potential future as a glaucoma medication."[Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition; Remand; 21CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. Ifthey say... Marijuana should be used for therapeutic treatment of theside- effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting. Thenyou say... The study that the legalizers will probably cite-the oneconducted by Mark Kleiman, which says that 40% of doctorsquestioned supported the therapeutic use of marijuana for cancerpatients--is methodologically flawed. Specifically, its returnrate (number of questionnaires returned), was only 42%, whichraises the strong potential of response bias. Also, Kleiman did notinform the reader how many of the people who did return thequestionnaire did in fact answer the questions. As one expert inbio-statistics concluded, "The report seems simple andcareless. - This is mere propaganda, and will be seen as such bythe informed reader." [Robert E. Peterson, "StudentExercise for Marijuana Activist Group Given National MediaAttention to Influence Court Case," Drug PreventionNewsletter, June 1991). As David Ettinger, professor of oncology at the Johns HopkinsUniversity School of Medicine notes, "There is no indicationthat Marijuana is effective in treating nausea and vomitingresulting from radiation treatment or other causes."[Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial, of Petition; Remand; 21CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. The National Cancer Institute concluded that other drugs suchas ondansetron, metoclopramine, droperidol, etc. are more usefulfor treating chemotherapy than is marijuana. [Janet Lapey,"Marijuana As Medicine Refuted by NIH Scientists," DrugWatch, August 1992]. Ifthey say... Marijuana is a useful treatment for AIDS patients. Thenyou say... Studies show that marijuana actually damages one's immunesystem and makes one more susceptible to colds, viruses, andinfluenza. [Guy A. Cabral, Marijuana and Virus Infections,Southeast Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and CommunitiesNewsletter]. Marijuana actually increases the health risk to AIDS patientsbecause the smoke causes pulmonary problems. [Sandra S. Bennett,"Therapeutic Marijuana: Fact or Fiction, "Drug Watch,July 1992]. Ifthey say... Marijuana is a useful treatment for MS(multiple sclerosispatients). Thenyou say... According to Doctor Donald H.

Their Argument Although proponents of legalization do not rely upon thisargument very much any more, a traditional response of thelegalizers was that "It's my body and I have a right to dowith it as I please so long as I'm the only one affected."This is called the Individual Autonomy argument. II. Our Argument The obvious flaw with the Individual Autonomy argument, andthe reason why it is not used much any more, is the simple factthat drug use does affect other people. Indeed, this entiremanual is in large part a collection of reasons and examples asto how drug use affects not only the individual, but alsoinnocent third-parties and society at large. But for the sake ofclarity, let us iterate and expand upon these points. First, drug use increases crime - and consequently harms otherpeople - in at least three different ways. For a discussion ofthis, please see Chapter Two. Second, drug use by pregnant women causes in utero damage tothe fetus. Children born of cocaine mothers have three times themortality rate and four times the low birth-weight as childrenborn of normal mothers.143 Similarly, "coke babies"tend to have emotional traits similar to those found in peoplewith antisocial personality disorders.144 Unfortunately, the samemothers who are most likely to damage their children in this wayare also the least likely to seek professional help andtreatment.145 Third, drug abuse closely correlates to child abuse. Forexample, in Philadelphia, cocaine is implicated in half of thecases in which parents beat their children to death, and in 80%of all abuse cases. 146 In the District of Columbia, 90% of thosereported for child abuse were substance abusers. 147 In 1984 theLegal Aid Society in New York City handled 3,3 10 abuse andneglect cases in the city. By 1989 it was handling more than24,000.148 What happened? Crack did, beginning in 1985. Sixtypercent of abuse and neglect cases involved drug allegations. 149The number of children wounded and killed by stray bullets intragic drive-by shootings pales in comparison to the impact ofcocaine in the over 1,200 child abuse murders in 1989.150 Butthese problems are not mere statistics - they are horror stories.In San Francisco, a woman who was freebasing cocaine gave birthto twins on her living room floor. She continued to freebase andlet her children die unattended. Fourth, drug use, like alcohol use, is responsible for a largepercentage of automobile accidents in the United States. InMaryland, 32% of car crash victims tested positive formarijuana.152 Fifth, drug use among pilots and train operators also leads toaccidents. Recall the Conrail disaster discussed in Chapter Four,wherein 16 people were killed and 175 were injured because thetrain operators were high on marijuana. Furthermore, a studyconducted by Stanford University found that 24 hours aftersmoking one joint, pilots could not safely land a plane.153 Sixth and finally, consider all of the economic and socialcosts associated with drug use in our society-costs that equate to tens of billions of dollars inlost productivity, higher taxes, and increased insurancepremiums. In short, few people use the Individual Autonomy argument anymore because it is painfully obvious that drug use affects not only the individual user,but also the user's family, innocent third parties, and societyas a whole. 143 Ken Auletta, "Six doses of reality are injected inthe argument for legal drugs," New York Daily News, December 17, 1989 (citing Dr. Karla Damus,director of research and epidemiology for the Bureau of MaternityServices). 144 Id. 145 James Q.

[KenAuletta, "Six doses of reality are injected in the argumentfor legal drugs," New York Daily News, December 17, 1989(citing Dr. Karla Dainus)]. Drug use causes child abuse.

Their Argument This chapter deals not with an argument of the legalizers perse, but instead their implicit belief that legalizing drugs would not have a profound effect onother facets of law and public policy. II. Our Argument Basically, we have three concerns here. First, can drug use be used as a defense in criminal or civilproceedings? That is, can a person accused of a hit-and-run accident escape liability by notingto the court that he was on cocaine at the time? Second, what will be done with the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA)? As its name suggests, the FDA isresponsible for testing the safety of food and drugs in theUnited States. For example, the FDA banned the use of Red Dye #2a number of years ago because it caused cancer (this is why therewere no red M+M's in most of the 1980's - it was not until thecandy producer came up with a noncarcenogenic dye that theystarted making them again in the late 1980's). Similarly, the FDAbanned the use of the substance known as Laetrile when itdetermined that this supposed drug had absolutely nopharmacological effects. But if we allow the legal sale of drugssuch as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and PCP - that unquestionablyare dangerous - how can we justify allowing the FDA to exercisequality control over any other type of drugs? To allow the saleand use of cocaine while still granting the FDA power toregulate, say, food additives such as saccharine is like banningslingshots but allowing people to carry automatic assault rifles.So if we legalize the sale and use of clearly dangerous drugs, itseems that to be logically consistent we would have to close downthe FDA and let everyone have access to every type of drug. Andgiven legalized drugs it also seems hypocritical to have any typeof quality control on food additives or food products moregenerally. A third and final concern is the legal liability of thecompanies that would manufacture and sell the newly legalizedcocaine, marijuana, heroin, and PCP. This is a very importantargument, and in order to fully understand its magnitude we mustmention what are known as "Dram Shop" laws. If not inname, we are all familiar with what a Dram Shop law is - it is alaw that says that if bartenders continue to serve alcohol topeople that they know are already drunk, and that drunk personlater goes out and commits a crime such as drunk driving, thenthe bartender or the bar can be held responsible. So the questionremains: would producers and sellers of legalized drugs beresponsible for the actions of the people who ingest them? If theproducers and sellers would not be liable, we have aserious ethical problem inasmuch as they could destroy peoples'lives with impunity in the name of profit and not be held morallyaccountable. But if the producers and sellers would be liable --that is, a Dram Shop type of law would apply to them --we wouldprobably have very few companies willing to market and selldrugs. Put differently, if a given drug company knew that itcould be hit with a ten million dollar lawsuit when one of itsclients goes and kills someone (or damages property, etc.), isthat company likely to stay in business? Not likely. The companylikely would decide that the costs of doing business outweigh thepotential benefits and thus would close down shop. For proof ofthis point ask yourself the following: How many companies arethere in the U.S. today that manufacture and sell asbestosinsulation? Answer: probably none. In short, there are many legal and political issues that wouldhave to be dealt with if we legalized drugs, and nowhere in the legalizers' literature have theycome up with adequate answers to these problems. Chapter Nine Summary Sheet: Legal Issues Surrounding theLegalization of Drugs Theysay... We can legalize drugs without any legal difficulties. Thenyou say... If we legalize drugs, will drug use be able to be used as adefense in criminal and civil trials? If we legalize drugs, would not we logically have to closedown the Food and Drug Administration and dispense with all lawsregulating the safety and quality of drugs, food additives andfood products? If we legalize drugs, would manufacturers and sellers beliable for the actions of the people whom they sell drugs to? Ifnot, isn't there an ethical problem here? If so, can werealistically expect anyone to enter the drug business?

Their Argument Some extremists in the drug legalization debate suggest thatwe should legalize hemp - the plant from which we get marijuana -because hemp could be used as fiber to make clothing,alternatives to lumber, paper products, and the like. II. Our Argument Some of the arguments of the legalizers are at least plausible(plausible, but wrong). This is not one of them. The argumentthat we should grow hemp for fiber is completely absurd. First,if hemp is such a good all-purpose fiber, why isn't any countryin the world seriously growing it? Second, there was a time inthe U.S. when it was legal to grow hemp (before 1937), and no onedid. By 1937, so few people chose to grow hemp that it wasn'teven mentioned in Department of Agriculture or Department ofCommerce reports.154 If it is such a good idea, why didn't anyonedo it when they could have? Finally, assume (although this assumption is contradicted byhistory) that hemp could provide all of the environmentalbenefits that the legalizers claim. These benefits would stillhave to be weighed against the costs of allowing farmers to growthousands, if not millions, of acres of marijuana. It would beimpossible to have a policy that allowed the legal sale of hempfor fiber but not for smoking, for one simply could not enforceit. (By comparison, think of how plausible a policy would be thatsaid farmers could grow wheat to make bread but not to makebiscuits). Thus, in order to get the supposed benefits of"hemp as fiber," you would also have to allow people touse it as marijuana. But when we recall all of the harmsassociated with marijuana use - medical problems, lostproductivity, increased accidents, increased crime, etc. - wefind that even granting the supposed benefits of"hemp as fiber," these benefits are still outweighed bythe negative consequences of such a policy. Thus, the "hemp as fiber" argument is disproved byboth history and the fact that no other countries are seriouslyconsidering it as an option. But even granting the legalizersarguments here, the costs of such a policy still would clearlyoutweigh the benefits. 154 For proof of this fact the reader is invited to scan anyAgriculture or Commerce reports from 1916 to 1937. Chapter Ten Summary Sheet: Environmental Issues and theLegalization of Drugs Itthey say... We should grow hemp and use it as fiber, thus achievingenvironmental benefits. Thenyou say... When farmers could do this in the early twentieth century inthe U.S., no one did. [Reports of the Departments of Agricultureand Commerce, 1916-1937.] If it is such a good idea, why aren't any other countries inthe world doing it now? Even if we granted the supposed benefits of "hemp asfiber," (which we should not), the costs of such a programwould still clearly outweigh the benefits.

Their Argument The final argument of the legalizers is one of hopelessness -the status quo obviously is not working because we are spendinglots of money on the problem, and it is not yet solved.Therefore, any policy is preferable to the present one. II. Our Argument Such cynicism is understandable - drugs are a pervasiveproblem in our culture. But legalization is not the answer, andin order to prove this we should look at two points: first, thatthe problem is getting better, and second, that many other viablesolutions besides legalization exist. 1. The Problem is Getting Better A mere purview of the facts proves that our problems withdrugs are not as bad as they used to be. For example, in 1979 thepercentage of 12 to 17-yr. olds who said they had used anyillicit drug in the past month was 17.6%. In 1992, it was down to6.1%. Similarly, the percentages for ages 18-25 yrs. dropped from37. 1 % to 13.0%. 155 Cocaine use is also down. In 1982 thepercentage of 18-25 yr. olds reporting past month use of cocainewas 6.8 %. In 1992 the figure had dropped to 1.8%.156Unfortunately, the 1993 data show a bottoming out and reversal ofthis trend, which has been linked to a softening attitude aboutthe dangers of drug use.157 Not only is drug use down, but public opinion has crystallizedinto a "no drug tolerance" position. One Gallup pollreported that over 80% of Americans said legalizing drugs was abad idea.158 A large majority said they feared legalization wouldlead to increases in addiction, drug overdoses, drug-relatedcrime and drug use in schools. 159 Furthermore, a study conductedin 1990 showed that 89% of the population would be willing to pay highertaxes to support the War on Drugs. 160 And as discussed above,children and adolescents have become less tolerant of drug use.As a letter to the New York Times on May 7, 1988, written by aclass of 14 and 15 yr. olds explained, "America is in a'moral rut' and ... drug abuse is one of the maincauses."161 Thus, not only is drug use declining, but public opinion growsincreasingly hostile to any such behavior. No wonder so fewpeople favor legalization these days. 2. Alternative Solutions These facts are not to suggest, however, that we should becomecomplacent in our efforts. Drug use continues to be a severesocial problem, and we should always be on the lookout forinnovative policies. Here are just a few ideas. First, we should continue our reliance on strong legalsanctions to deter drug use. That is, keeping drugs illegal doesdecrease their use. As one commentator noted, 70% of high schoolstudents in New Jersey and 60% of those in California said thatfear of getting in trouble with the law was a primary reason not to use drugs.162 Not only do legalsanctions keep people from trying drugs in the first instance, but they also help to get people off themlater. A study conducted by Douglas Anglin of UCLA noted that the potential success rate oftreatment programs depends largely on how long the patientremains with the program. The longer you stay, the better yourchances of recovery. And Anglin also found that people who entertreatment under legal compulsion (i.e., a court order) stay inthe program longer.163 Thus, legal sanctions eventually correlate to treatmentsuccess rate. Second, we should continue to decrease social tolerance fordrug use at all levels of society and at all levels of drug use.As former DEA Administrator Jack Lawn said, "Here's what itmeans in shirt sleeve English. [The] public is telling the druguser, 'What you're doing is not just your business. It's criminaland it's unacceptable. Get help and get treatment if you need it,or face the consequences. We don't want to be hard-hearted, butthis problem exists only because you and people like you keep italive. The rest of us don't want to put up with itanymore'". 164 Third, we should use education to encourage people not to usedrugs. Educating the youth is one of society's most importantresponsibilities, and nowhere is the need for education greaterthan to teach children about the dangers of drug use.165 Suchpolicies are working with regard to smoking, for as Kurt Schmokeadmits, "[t]he number of people smoking continues to fallbecause of a concerted public education campaign about the healtheffects of smoking."" Fourth, we should encourage private enterprise to adoptworkplace rules restricting drug use. By implementing policiessuch as drug testing, businesses can greatly reduce drug usewhile at the same time increasing their productivity. Forexample, Hoffman Construction of Portland, Oregon, implementeddrug policies and decreased workers' compensation claims by 17%.Indeed, by year three, Hoffman had reduced its workers'compensation costs by almost 90%.167 Perhaps the governmentcould use tax credits to encourage businesses to promote drugpolicies. Fifth, it is possible that the growing health-consciousness inthe United States today (favoring more exercise, lesscholesterol, less alcohol and smoking, etc.) will go a long wayin and of itself to decrease drug use.168 Finally, we may be able to turn to science for help. Somescholars are proposing the use of biotechnology to eradicate drugcrops while at the same time planting more socially useful plants(wheat, soybeans, corn, etc.). 169 In the final analysis of the legalization debate we mustremember that drug abuse is a long-term problem: it took China over fifty years to kick its opiumaddiction.170 And granted, drug use still takes far too large a toll on the United States. But when weconsider the decreasing tolerance for, and use of, drugs in ourcountry, as well as the numerous alternatives we are pursuing andhave yet to pursue, it seems clear that legalization of drugs isnot the answer. 155 "Preliminary Estimates from the 1992 NationalHousehold Survey on Drug Abuse," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, June 1993. 156 Id. 157 "Monitoring the Future Study - 1993," Universityof Michigan Institute for Social Research, Jan 27, 1994.

Chapter Eleven Summary Sheet: "Anything Is Better ThanWhat We Are Doing Now", Hopelessness, Drug Control, andPotential Solutions Ifthey say... Any policy is better than the status quo. Thenyou say... Drug use has been declining: in 1979 the percentage of 12 to17-yr. olds who said they had used any illicit drug in the pastmonth was 17.6%. In 1992, it was down to 6.1%. Similarly, forages 1825 yrs. use dropped from 37. 1 % to 13.0%. In 1982 thepercentage of 18-25 yr. olds reporting past month use of cocainewas 6.8%. In 1992 the figure had dropped to 1.8%. [PreliminaryEstimates from the 1992 National Household Survey on DrugAbuse," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, June1993]. Public tolerance for drug use is declining. One Gallup pollreported that over 80% of Americans said legalizing drugs was abad idea- A large majority said they feared legalization wouldlead to increases in addiction, drug overdoses, drug-relatedcrime and drug use in schools. [David Zucchino, "A Push toMake Drugs Illegal," Philadelphia Inquirer, July 5,1992]. In fact, 89% of the public would be willing to payhigher taxes to support the War on Drugs. [Ralph A. Weisheit andKathrine Johnson, "Exploring the Dimensions of Support forDecriminalizing Drugs," Journal of Drug Issues, Winter1992]. Other solutions besides legalization exist: We should continue to employ legal sanctions against drugusers for two reasons. First, studies of high school studentssuggest that between 60% and 70% cite not wanting to get introuble with the law as a reason not to use drugs in the firstplace. [Robert E. Peterson, "Stop Legalization of IllegalDrugs," Drug Awareness Information Newsletter, July 1988].Second, the use of legal sanction is a good means of keepingaddicts in treatment programs for longer periods of time, thusincreasing the probability of successful treatment [James Q.Wilson, "Against the Legalization of Drugs,"Commentary, February 1990]. We should continue to decrease social tolerance for any andall drug use at any and all levels of society. We should promote drug awareness education as a means odeterring use, as is presently being done successfully withregard to tobacco use. We should use tax incentives to encourage businesses to adoptdrug policies such as those of a Portland, Oregon business thatdecreased its workers' compensation claims 90% in three years.["Position Paper In Opposition To The Legalization ofDrugs," Regional Drug Initiative Task Force, September1990.] The general health-consciousness sweeping the country may go along way to decreasing casual drug use. [Ralph A. Weisheit andKathrine Johnson, "Exploring the Dimensions of Support forDecriminalizing Drugs," Journal of Drug Issues, Winter1992]. We should research ways in which biotechnology could be usedto eradicate drug crops and replace them with socially usefulgrowth such as wheat or corn. [Gabriel Nahas, "A Battle Won,A Stalemated War, and A New Strategy," Position Paper]. We should remember that drug use is a long-term problem thatwill take a long time to solve: it took China 50 years to kickits opium addiction.

Morgan, M.D. and Lynn Zimmer, Ph.D. The Partnership for a Drug-Free America, in cooperation withthe National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the White HouseOffice of Drug Control Policy, recently announced a new anti-drugcampaign that specifically targets marijuana. Instead offeaturing horror tales of marijuana-induced insanity, violenceand birth detects, this campaign is built upon the premise thatreducing marijuana use is a practical strategy for reducing theuse of more dangerous drugs. The primary basis for this "gateway hypothesis" is arecent report by the center on Addiction and Substance Abuse(CASA), claiming that marijuana users are 85 times more likelythan non-marijuana users to try cocaine. This figure, using datafrom NIDA's 1991 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, isclose to being meaningless. It was calculated by dividing theproportion of marijuana users who have ever used cocaine (17%) bythe proportion of cocaine users who have never used marijuana(.2%). The high risk-factor obtained is a product not of the factthat so many marijuana users use cocaine but that so many cocaineusers used marijuana previously. It is hardly a revelation that people who use one of the leastpopular drugs are likely to use the more popular ones -- not onlymarijuana, but also alcohol and tobacco cigarettes. The obviousstatistic not publicized by CASA is that most marijuana users --83 percent -- never use cocaine. Indeed, for the nearly 70million Americans who have tried marijuana, it is clearly a"terminus" rather than a "gateway" drug. During the last few years, after a decade of decline, therehas been a slight increase in marijuana use, particularly amongyouth. In 1994, 38 percent of high school seniors reported havingever tried the drug, compared to about 35 percent in 1993 and 33percent in 1992. This increase does not constitute a crisis. Noone knows whether marijuana use-rates will continue to rise. Buteven if they do, it will not necessarily lead to increased use ofcocaine. Since the 1970s, when NIDA first began gathering data, ratesof marijuana and cocaine use have displayed divergent patterns.Marijuana prevalence increased throughout the 1970s, peaking in1979, when about 60 percent of high school seniors reportedhaving used it at least once. During the 1980s, cocaine useincreased while marijuana use was declining. Since 1991, whendata for the CASA analysis were gathered, marijuana use-rateshave increased while cocaine use-rates have remained fairlysteady. The over-changing nature of the statistical relationshipbetween use-rate for marijuana and cocaine indicates the absenceof a causal link between the use of these two drugs. Therefore,even if the proposed Partnership campaign were to be effective inreducing marijuana use it would not guarantee a proportionalreduction in the number of people who use cocaine. To the extentanti-drug campaigns are effective, they seem to be most effectivein deterring those people who would have been fairly low-levelusers. There is no reason to believe that anti-marijuana messagesof any sort would deter many of those marijuana users --currently 17 percent of the total -- who also develop an interestin cocaine. Nor is there reason to believe that the Partnership's newcampaign will actually reduce the overall number of marijuanausers. For a decade now, American youth have been subjected to anunparalleled assault of anti-drug messages. They have seenhundreds of Partnership advertisements, on television and in theprint media. They have been urged to "just say no" byrock stars, sports heroes, presidents and first-ladies. They havebeen exposed to anti-drug educational programs in the schools.Yet this is the same generation of young people that recentlybegan increasing its use of marijuana. It seems unlikely thatmany of them will be deterred by hyperbolic claims of marijuana'sgateway effect, particularly when it contradicts the reality ofdrug use they see around them. If the creators of American drug policy are truly interestedin reducing the risk of marijuana users using other drugs, theyshould take a closer look at Holland, where drug policy since the1970s has been guided by a commitment to diminishing anypotential gateway effect. Wanting to keep young marijuana usersaway from cocaine and other "hard drugs," the Dutchdecided to separate the retail markets by allowing anyone 18years of age or older to purchase marijuana openly ingovernment-controlled "coffee shops" which strictlyprohibit the use and sale of other drugs. Despite easy availability, marijuana prevalence among 12 to 18year olds in Holland is only 13.6 percent -- well below the 38percent use-rate for American high school seniors. More Dutchteenagers use marijuana now than in the past; indeed, lifetimeprevalence increased nearly three-fold between 1984 and 1992,from 4.8 to 13.6 percent. However, Dutch officials consider theirpolicy a success because the increase in marijuana use has notbeen accompanied by an increase in the use of other drugs. Forthe last decade, the rate of cocaine use among Dutch youth hasremained stable, with about .3 percent of 12-18 year oldsreporting having used it in the past month. In the United States, the claim that marijuana acts as agateway to the use of other drugs serves mainly as a rhetoricaltool for frightening Americans into believing that winning thewar against heroin and cocaine requires waging & battleagainst the casual use of marijuana. Not only is the claimintellectually indefensible, but the battle is wasteful ofresources and fated to failure.

The Drug Education Project (DEP) is an attempt to clear up themisinformation being propagated in the U.S. by organizations andindividuals more interested in creating works of propaganda andfear than objective pieces of education. DEP is founded upon thesame two basic principles Andrew Weil bases his book, FromChocolate to Morphine, upon: (1) "People make decisions onthe basis of information available to them. The more accurate theinformation, the better their decisions will be" [68, p.179]; and (2) "There are no good or bad drugs; there areonly good and bad relationships with drugs" [68, p. 27].This leaflet is the first in a series of sixteen that willattempt to summarize for everyone what science has to say aboutdrug use. The grunt work has been done for you. DEP only requestsof you an open mind and the time required to read these leaflets. What is this leaflet all about? This leaflet is intended for informational purposes only.

"There is an outright propaganda campaign being presentedthrough the informational media, and there is no challenge beingbrought by those who know the facts and should be insisting onadherence to the truth." - Alexander and Ann Shulgin, PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story, p.442 Health Risk Myths and Realities MarijuanaOverdose No evidence exists that anyone has ever died of a marijuanaoverdose [61, p. 53 - 54]. Tests performed on mice have shownthat the ratio of cannabinoids (the chemicals in marijuana thatmake you stoned) necessary for overdose to the amount necessaryfor intoxication is 40,000:1 [1]. For comparison's sake, thatratio for alcohol is generally between 4:1 and 10:1 [61, p.227-228]. Alcohol overdoses kill about 5,000 yearly [3] butmarijuana overdoses kill no one as far as anyone can tell. BrainDamage Marijuana is psychoactive because it stimulates certain brainreceptors, but it does not produce toxins that kill them [7](like alcohol), and it does not wear them out as other drugs may[57]. There is no evidence that marijuana use is a cause of braindamage. Studies by Dr. Robert Heath claimed the contrary inexperiments on monkeys [4], but Heath's work has been sharplycriticized by the Institute of Medicine and the National Academyof Sciences on three primary counts: its insufficient sample size (only four monkeys), its failure to control experimental bias, and its misidentification of normal monkey brain structure as "damaged" [5]. A far superior experiment by the National Center forToxicological Research (NCTR) involving 64 rhesus monkeys thatwere exposed to daily or weekly doses of marijuana smoke for ayear found no evidence of structural or neurochemical changes inthe brains of rhesus monkeys [6, 58]. Studies performed on actualhuman populations will confirm these results, even for chronicmarijuana users (up to 18 joints per day) after many years of use[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In fact, following the publication of two1977 JAMA studies, the American Medical Association (AMA)officially announced its support for the decriminalization ofmarijuana. Contrary to a 1987 television commercial sponsored by thePartnership for a Drug-Free America (PDFA), marijuana does not"flatten" brain waves either. In the commercial, anormal human brain wave was compared to what was supposedly the(much flatter) brain wave of a 14-year-old high on marijuana. Itwas actually the brain wave of a coma patient [2]. PDFA liedabout the data, and had to pull the commercial off of the airwhen researchers complained to the television networks [62, p.74]. In reality, marijuana has the effect of slightly increasingalpha-wave activity. Alpha waves are generally associated withmeditative and relaxed states which are, in turn, oftenassociated with human creativity [13]. Memory Marijuana does impair short-term memory, but only duringintoxication. Although the authoritative studies on marijuana useseem to agree that there is no residual impairment followingintoxication [5, 6, 13], persistent impairment of short-termmemory has been noted in chronic marijuana smokers up to 6 and 12weeks following abstinence [70]. HeartProblems It is accepted in medical circles today that marijuana usecauses no evident long-term cardiovascular problems for normalpersons. However, marijuana-smoking does cause changes in theheart and body's circulation characteristic of stress, which maycomplicate preexisting cardiovascular problems like hypertension,cerebrovascular disease, and coronary atherosclerosis [5, p. 72].Marijuana's effects upon blood pressure are complex andinconsistent [5, p. 66 - 67]. Hormones Chronic marijuana use has not been found to alter testosteroneor other sex hormone levels, despite the conclusions of Dr. R.C.Kolodony's 1974 study. Seven similar studies have been performedsince then, the most recent by a Dr. Robert Block at theUniversity of Iowa [14], and none have reproduced Kolodony'sresults. In contrast, heavy alcohol use is known to lower thesesame testosterone levels [65]. ReproductiveDamage No trustworthy study has ever shown that marijuana use damagesthe reproductive system, or causes chromosome breakage. Dr.Gabriel Nahas reached the opposite conclusion in his experimentsperformed in the early 1980s, but did so in part using the invitro (i.e., in test tubes and petrii dishes) cells of rhesusmonkeys. His rather unjustified claim that these changes wouldalso occur in human bodies in vivo (in the body) was criticizedby his colleagues and, in 1983, he renounced his own results. Studies of actual human populations have failed to demonstratethat marijuana adversely affects the reproductive system [61, 5].Wu et al. found in 1988 a correlation between marijuana use andlow sperm counts in human males. But this is misleading because(1) a decrease in sperm count has not been shown to have anegative effect on fertility, and (2) the sperm count returned tonormal levels after marijuana use had ceased [5]. Claims that marijuana use may impair hormone production,menstrual cycles, or fertility in females are both unproven andunfounded [43]. TheImmune System Studies in which lab rats were injected with extremely largequantities of THC have found that marijuana (in suchunrealistically huge quantities) does have an"immunosuppressive effect" in those lab rats, in thatit temporarily shuts off certain cells in the liver calledlymphocytes and macrophages. These macrophages are useful infighting off bacterial, not viral, infections. But this is onlyfor the duration of intoxication [46]. There also exists someevidence that marijuana metabolites stay in the lungs for up toseven months after smoking has ceased, possibly affecting theimmune system of the lungs (but not by turning the cells off)[47]. This said, doctors and researchers are still not sure thatthe immune system is actually negatively affected in realisticsituations since there are no numbers to support the idea [15].In fact, three studies showed that THC may have actuallystimulated the immune system in the people studied [16, 17, 18]. BirthDefects Unlike alcohol, cocaine, and tobacco, studies show that thereexists no evident link between prenatal use of marijuana andbirth defects [5, p. 99] or fetal alcohol syndrome [72] inhumans. In fact, marijuana use during the third trimester hasbeen found to have a positive impact on birthweight [73]. It isknown that Delta-9-THC does enter the placenta [45], so mothersare advised against consuming large quantities. Cancer Smoking marijuana has the potential to cause both bronchitisand cancer of the lungs, throat, and neck, but this is generallyno different than inhaling any other burnt carbon-containingmatter since they all increase the number of lesions (andtherefore possible infections) in your airways. There are acouple of studies that claim on the basis of carcinogens thatsmoking marijuana is worse for your body than smoking a cigarette[44], but these are rather simplified. There are actually somevery convincing reasons to believe that smoking cigarettes isrelatively more dangerous to the body than smoking marijuana onmore than one count: (1) It is accepted by a growing number ofscientists today that all American cigarettes contain significantlevels of polonium-210 [22], the same sort of radiation given offby the plutonium of atom bombs (ionizing alpha radiation). Itjust so happens that the tobacco plant's roots and leaves areespecially good at absorbing radioactive elements fromuranium-containing phosphate fertilizers that are required byU.S. law, and from naturally occurring radiation in the soil,air, and water [48]. It is the opinion of C. Everette Koop thatthis radioactivity, not tar, accounts for at least 90% of allsmoking-related lung cancer [29]. Other estimates that have beenmade are, about 50% according to Dr. Joseph R. DiFranza of theUniv. of Mass. Medical Center [48] and according to Dr. EdwardMartell, a radiochemist with the National Center for AtmosphericResearch, 95% [35]. Dr. R.T. Ravenholt, former director of WorldHealth Surveys at the Centers for Disease Control, agrees withthe risk, asserting that "Americans are exposed to far moreradiation from tobacco smoke than from any other source"[49]. Supporting the radioactivity notion is the finding that (a)Relatively high levels of polonium-210 have been found in bothcigarette smoke [59] and the lungs of both smokers and nonsmokersalike [60]; (b) Smokers of low-tar-and-nicotine cigarettes die oflung cancer just as much as smokers of other cigarettes [39]; andalso, (c) Even the most potent carcinogen that has been found incigarettes, benzopyrene, is only present in quantities sufficientto account for about 1% of the lung cancer cases that occur fromsmoking[49]. Whydon't you know any of this? Because the tobacco industry is suppressing the information.(2) Tobacco smoke is theorized to work as a kind of"magnet" for airborne radioactive particles such asradon, causing them to deposit in your lungs instead of on walls,rugs, or draperies [48]. (3) Tobacco, unlike marijuana, containsnicotine, which may harden arteries and cause many of the casesof heart disease associated with tobacco use. It also breaks downinto cancer-promoting chemicals called N Nitrosamines whenburned, and perhaps even when it is inside the body [37]. (4) THCis a bronchial dilator, which means it works like a cough drop byopening up your lungs and therefore aiding in the clearance ofsmoke and dirt. Nicotine has the exact opposite effect. (5)Unlike the chemicals in marijuana, nicotine has a paralyzingeffect on the tiny hairs along the body's air passages. Thesehairs normally work to keep foreign matter out of the lungs. Thismeans that carcinogenic tar from cigarette smoke is relativelymuch harder to purge from your lungs than is that from marijuana.And finally, (6) Marijuana users smoke significantly less thancigarette smokers do because of both marijuana's psychoactiveproperties (this is called "auto-titration") andnicotine's high potential for physical addiction [21]. It isimportant to note that the NCTR study found no signs of lungcancer in its autopsied rhesus monkeys who had smoked marijuanafor one year [6]. Smoking cigarettes and smoking marijuana negatively affectdifferent areas of the body, and therefore cause differentproblems. But everything considered, marijuana-only smokers whoaverage 3 - 4 joints per day show similar symptoms to cigarettesmokers who polish off 20 in a day [74]. Although one well-donestudy tells us that frequent marijuana smokers have a 19% greaterrisk of respiratory diseases than people who smoke nothing at all[66], it seems that neck and throat cancers are much more likelyto result than lung cancer or emphysema. This is because, unliketobacco, marijuana does not penetrate deeply into the lung. Inorder to minimize the risk of acquiring neck or throat cancerfrom marijuana smoke, it is best to (1) avoid as much as possiblecigarette-smoking and heavy drinking while smoking marijuana, and(2) eat plenty of vegetables (such as carrots, broccoli, squash,and sprouts) or vitamin supplements of beta carotene, vitamins A,C and E, and selenium [65]. These are believed to impede cancer'sprogress. In addition, there are actually things that can be done toreduce and even entirely eliminate the bodily harm that maypotentially result from smoking marijuana. This is possiblebecause all of the principle psychoactive ingredients ofmarijuana (THC and the cannabinoids) are neither mutagenic(gene-mutating) nor carcinogenic (cancer-causing) [65]. Legalizing marijuana would make (better) water bongs andmarijuana foods, drinks, and pills both less expensive and moreaccessible. Smoking marijuana through a water-filled bong willcool the smoke and there is reason to believe that it will filtersome of the carcinogens [69, 36]. Eating or drinking marijuanaeffectively eliminates all negative effects. In addition, it isconceivable that an aerosol contraption or vaporizer, commonlycalled a tilt pipe, could easily be constructed that wouldsurpass joints in efficiency, match them in onset and control ofeffects, and yet would be effectively harmless to the body. FatCells One of the more ridiculous myths being circulated is thatmarijuana stays in your fat cells and can keep you high formonths. Even though they may have similar names, the psychoactiveTHC (Delta-9-THC) is different from the metabolites (forinstance, 11-OH-THC and 11-nor) that your body breaks it downinto in that the latter will not get you stoned. It is themetabolites that stay in your fatty cells and show up on drugtests. Your body is depleted of Delta-9-THC only hours afteringestion [40, 41]. Other MJ Myths and Realities AmotivationalSyndrome Amotivational syndrome is defined as a condition in which aperson loses ambition or motivation to complete tasks that hewould normally like to have completed. Claims made in the 60'sthat marijuana use resulted in amotivational syndrome werepredominantly founded on stereotypes. But more recently, thecarefully-designed NCTR study has actually confirmed thesesuspicions under certain conditions. It found that marijuana usemay consistently produce something akin to amotivational syndromein adolescent monkeys. It did not however prove that marijuanamakes adolescents apathetic or depressed. A full recovery tonormal motivation levels was typically observed to occur betweentwo to three months following cessation of exposure. For unknownreasons, one monkey was observed to never fully recover.Surprisingly, the willingness to work appeared to be equallyaffected in both the daily and weekend rhesus smokers in thestudy [6]. Other studies have failed to prove amotivationalsyndrome in adults [42], so there is much reason to believe thatthis effect only occurs during adolescent use. MarijuanaPotency Marijuana is not significantly more potent today than it hasbeen in the past [23]. It is generally agreed that this myth wasthe result of bad data. The researchers making the claims used astheir baseline the THC content of marijuana seized by police inthe early 1970's, which had deteriorated since then because ofpoor storage conditions [23]. In reality, it seems that domesticmarijuana's average potency probably doubled in the 70's with theadvent of sinsemilla, but has remained more or less constantsince then [65]. Scare tactics claiming that marijuana potencyhas increased are rather irrelevant anyways since marijuana userstypically stop smoking when the desired effect is achieved (onceagain, "auto-titration"). Contrary to one of DARE'sallegations [28], it is generally agreed that marijuana does notcreate a tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, or physical dependencein the user. Lester Grinspoon adds, "there are many whoassert that there is nevertheless drug dependence because of[marijuana's] capacity to generate psychic dependency. However itis not at all clear that this type of dependency is essentiallyany different from that which a man may develop with respect tohis trousers, his automobile, or his wife" [61, p. 234]. Driving Driving in any inebriated state is adding complication to whatalready amounts to a constant life-threatening situation. Thatsaid, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration(NHTSA) summarized all of its studies by saying that there was"no indication that marijuana by itself was a cause of fatalaccidents," and that alcohol was by far the "dominantproblem" in drug-related accidents [32]. The VictorianInstitute of Forensic Pathology and Monash University'sDepartment of Forensic Medicine in Melbourne, Australia havefound that drivers who use cannabis are actually less likely tocause fatal accidents than drug-free drivers, and are no morelikely than other drivers to be killed or seriously injured inroad accidents [33]. One experiment tested marijuana-intoxicateddrivers on both a closed course and on a crowded city street. Itfound that the elements of driving most affected wereconcentration and judgment [52]. An experiment involving adriving simulator that tested actual driving ability according tohow many mistakes are incurred by sober, drunk, and high subjectsfound that marijuana, unlike alcohol, does not significantlyaffect driving ability. It was found that these results hold truefor even higher doses (within reason) and inexperienced marijuanausers. In fact, the only significant difference reported by thestoned subjects was an altered perception of time, whicheffectively made them drive relatively slower [50]. A similarstudy found that marijuana additionally impairs the driver'sability to attend to peripheral stimuli [71]. One theoryattempting to explain these surprising findings states thatmarijuana users, in instances requiring seriousness, are in factable to willingly "bring themselves down," such thatthey are no longer high [51]. Studies that in the past have shownthat marjuana-intoxicated drivers cause significantly moreaccidents than sober drivers are typically unreliable on one ormore of the following counts: (1) They use drug tests todetermine whether or not a person is high, and drug tests in useonly indicate use over the past 30 days; (2) Some studies havenot corrected for alcohol use, or do not provide a control group;and (3) In many studies there were relatively more stoned driverskilled, but it was not their fault. And when the police"culpability scores" were tallied and factored in,marijuana was generally not to blame for the accidents. It mustbe emphasized however that one study shows that daily marijuanasmokers tend to have a 30% higher risk of injuries than non-users[66]. In fact, accidents resulting from intoxication are thoughtto be "the number one hazard of marijuana use" [67]. TheGateway Effect Marijuana use has not been found to act as a gateway drug tothe use of harder drugs. Studies show that when the Dutchpartially legalized marijuana in the 70's, heroin and cocaine usesubstantially declined, despite a slight increase in marijuanause [24]. If the stepping stone theory were true, use should havegone up rather than down. In reality, it appears that marijuanause tends to substitute for the use of relatively more dangeroushard drugs like cocaine and heroin, rather than lead to theiruse. Thus, oftentimes strict marijuana laws themselves are themost significant factor involved in moving on to harder drugslike cocaine. Such is the case in Nevada and Arizona, the statestoughest on marijuana use [65]. A recent study by ColumbiaUniversity's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse attempts toshow, like many past studies have, that marijuana users are morelikely to use heroin or cocaine. But what the study actually doesshow is that a large number of heroin or cocaine users have usedmarijuana, not the reverse. What is not mentioned is that just asmany or even more had probably also drank alcohol, smokedcigarettes, had sex, or eaten sandwiches prior to their hard druguse. In fact, a National High School survey tells us that in1990, 40.7% of all high school students had tried marijuana orhashish at least once, whereas only 9.4% and 1.3% had ever usedcocaine and heroin, respectively [25]. Thus, at maximum, only 23%of marijuana users go on to use cocaine, and only 3% go on to useheroin. Thus, the stepping stone theory fails on even empiricalgrounds. Marijuanaand Crime DARE literature would have you believe that there exists astrong correlation between marijuana use and juvenile and youngadult crime [28]. And a recent study attempts to present a linkbetween marijuana use and violence by stating that 2/3 of allstudents who admit to taking a gun to school at least once hadsmoked marijuana. In fact, DEA head Thomas Constantine recentlystated in a Washington Times interview that "Many timespeople talk about the nonviolent drug offender. That is a rarespecies. There is not some sterile drug type not involved inviolence who is contributing some good to the community; that isridiculous. They are contributing nothing but evil." Butthese allegations are unsupported by research because testresults show that changes in personality resulting from marijuanause, even though they are not relatively significant, includeamong other things a lessening of aggressive trends [34]. Andlarge population studies such as the La Guardia report [10] havefound that, if anything, marijuana use inhibits antisocialactivity such as violence [20]. The drug-inspired violence myth,including a comprehensive history of its conception, is discussedat great length in Lester Grinspoon's book, where it is shown tobe based largely on a distorted Persian story that is hundreds ofyears old [61]. The problem inherent in drawing conclusions basedon correlations such as the 2/3 statistic above is that causalitycannot be inferred from correlation. In other words, there is noway of determining whether marijuana use contributed in some wayto the existence of certain traits of marijuana users, i.e.bringing a gun to school, or, as seems entirely more likely,people with such traits are drawn to marijuana use. One studyfound that chronic marijuana users had significantly higher WAISIQ scores (113.08) than both moderate users (102.15) and nonusers(103.26) [30]. It is simply impossible to make sense of suchstatistics as presented. References [1] Mikuriya, T.H. "Historical Aspects of Cannabis Sativain Western Medicine," New Physician, 1969, p. 905.

Individuals have to speak out of strongconviction, and congregational beliefs are strengthened in aconfirmation of faith and shared attitudes. In recent years, theexperiences described above have been characterized by animportant cohesive element, a shared litany. Since 1984, when urine testing of unimpairedcivilian workers began to expand rapidly, its public supportershave used a common set of statements, ideas, and statistics tojustify the imposition of the forced detection and testing ofurine for illegal drugs. The use of this religious language isnot without a purpose. Litany is seldom questioned, nor is thespeaker of litany often called upon to prove the truth of hisstatements, even when they involve things material and notspiritual. I believe this common set of statements used by thosejustifying and selling urine tests is repeated, polished, andaccepted with a minimal offering of proof. In this article, Iwill identify these statements, search for their sources, andexamine their accuracy. II. THE FIRESTONE "STUDY" Obviously, statements concerning the jobperformance of drug users have an impact on their employers. Fromthe earliest days of the debate, a series of statistics aboutdrug-using workers, their poor productivity, and high cost tother company have been presented. In one of the first proceedingsof a meeting directed to the issues of drug abuse in theworkplace, Robert Angarola and Judith Brunton stated: A recent study....suggests that drug users werealmost four times as likely to be involved in a plant accidentand were two and one-half times as likely to be absent from workfor more than a week than employees who did not use drugs. Drugusers were five times as likely to file workers' compensationclaims and they received three times the average level of sickbenefits. (1) Further, the drug users were "repeatedlyinvolved in grievance procedures." The Angarola-Bruntondocument was published in 1984 but they and others had begunmaking the remarks frequently by then In 1987 testimony before the U.S. House ofRepresentatives, by Mark de Bernardo of the United States Chamberof Commerce: 'recreational' drug users are -----2.2 times more likely to request earlydismissal or time off... --3.6 times more likely to injure themselves oranother person in a workplace accident --5.0 times more likely to file a worker'scompensation claim. (3) For at least five years, these statistics andothers like them have been voiced and published by testingadvocates, although seldom with de Bernardo's decimal-pointprecision. Those whom I have quoted seem to be referring to anyuser of illegal drugs and de Bernardo specifically speaks ofrecreational drug user. Yet, one might wonder how these data weregathered, particularly since drug testing in the workplace isproposed to uncover the secret user. How were these usersdescribed by Angarola and de Bernardo (and many others) found andanalyzed? The answer, as is often the case is simple. They werenot. The most important source for dissemination ofthese statistics seems to be the Drug Abuse and AlcoholismNewsletter of Dr. Sidney Cohen. (4) This monthly newsletter iswidely distributed and has been collected and published. In theAugust 1983 newsletter, Cohen discussed a study by the FirestoneTire and Rubber Company and constructed the quotable statementswhich have appeared and reappeared: "Drug users were fivetimes as likely to file a Workers' Compensation claim, and theyreceived three times the average level of sick benefits."(5) The Firestone "Study" has never beenpublished. Thus, Cohen's newsletter seems to be the source of allsuch statements. Yet, Cohen gave no attribution nor sources, andwhen I wrote to him in 1985 he answered that he did not have acopy of the study and suggested I write Firestone. After a numberof calls and queries I received a two page document fromFirestone's Medical Director, E. Gates Morgan. The report apearsto be an in-house newsletter. (6) In it, a Mr. Ed Johnson isinterviewed about the Employer Assistance Program("EAP") at Firestone. There are some statementspertaining to absenteeism, but these are not documented, and moreimportantly, refer only to a few alcoholics who have been servedby the Firestone EAP. The statistics generated (if thesecalculations based on alcoholics were actually made) have nothingto do with drug users, recreational or otherwise. The statistics cited about absenteeism andworkers' compensation claims may have been derived frominterviews with alcoholic workers enrolled in the EAP atFirestone. These people were not identified by urine testing foralcohol, but were referred because they or others perceived thattheir lives were falling apart. They, unlike workers randomlytested for drug use, were dysfunctional. To use them as ajustification for testing unimpaired workers is like demandingthat all workers have mandatory periodic rectal temperaturestaken because a case of tuberculosis was found in the workplace. III. THE RTI STUDY FOR DIMINISHED PRODUCTIVITY The Research Triangle Institute("RTI") of North Carolina issued a report in 1984 thatattempted to calculate the economic cost to society of alcoholand drug abuse and mental illness. (7) It appears to be thesource of the claim that drug abuse costs the United Statesthirty-four billion dollars a year in lost productivity. (8) This claim seems to indicate that somehowindividual worker productivity was assessed by some quantitativemeasure and was noted to be seriously diminished. I often ask mystudents how they would design a study which might quantify theeffect of drug use or abuse on productivity and they generateinteresting ideas and designs. None, however, have ever come upwith anything as creative as the RTI report. The National Institute on Drug Abuse("NIDA") Household Survey is the actual source of theRTI statistics. (9) The RTI analysis itself does not include anystudies about productivity, dor does it document that drug usewas associated with any diminished productivity. The RTI reportrelied on the 1982 version of the Household Survey, whichincluded a question to the adult (older than eighteen years ofage) respondents about daily marijuana use. If the respondentstated that he or she had ever used marijuana daily for twenty orthirty days in one month, this respondent's household income wascompared to another household without a daily user. The userhouseholds were estimated to have a household incomeapproximately twenty-eight percent less than those householdsthat did not have such an interviewee. According to the RTIreport: "These result have been used to calculate thereduced productivity due to daily marijuana use. Once again, theprevalence rates of ever using marijuana daily in the labor forceby age and sex groups....were applied to the number of persons inthe labor force from those groups that experiencedreducedproductivity. This number was multiplied by the expectedproductivity in the workplace and in the household and then bythe impairment rate (27.9 percent) to produce the final value:The loss due to marijuana abuse was estimated at $34.2 billionfor 1980." (10) This somewhat opaque quotation means that the$34 billion "lost" to drug-induced diminishedproductivity and the one-third reduction is productivity of thedrug user come from a very unusual calculation. The homes withdaily users had a reduced household income. Because the dailyusers all were between eighteen and thirty-four years of age, theproportion of the work force represented by them was multipliedby total income expected and this was multiplied by the reductionfigure to generate the $34 billion guess. I have never seen apublished analysis of the RTI study. It is a complex and detaileddocument of one hundred thirty-seven pages whose appendicesnumber nearly one hundred thirty more. Although many of itsassumptions regarding the cost of alcohol and drug abuse arequestionable, I have focused only on the loss of productivityformulation. The reduced income figure itself may beincorrect. It relies upon reports from interviewees that theyused drugs and relies upon their estimates of household income.The income data were grouped in seven broad categories withintervals as broad as $10,000. (11) To generate the reductionfigure with categories like this amounts to measuring centimetersusing a device graduated in meters. The control households weregenerated by selecting a household whose respondent resembled themarijuana use respondent. This meant that the two respondentsresembled each other in regard to age, education, marital status,and occupation. (12) The similarities did not include race,location, or nonchildren resident(s) in the household. Therefore,a twenty-four year-old single black, high school graduatebrick-layer who smokes marijuana and lives with his grandmotherand uncle in Harlem, could have his family income compared to atwenty-four year-old single white, high school graduate,brick-layer living with his parents in an affluent New Jerseysuburb. If the household in Harlem had a lower income, it wouldbe attributed to diminished productivity caused by marijuana use. As the RTI authors noted, however, theassociation between marijuana use and reduced income is notnecessarily causal. (13) Although age and occupation weresimilar, the user may not have concerned himself with income andmay have made other job choices. (14) Moreover, the heavy use ofmarijuana could have been secondary to job loss in a pooreconomy. This manipulation, which assigned lostproductivity to sometime past heavy use of marijuana, did notshow any association with current use of marijuana (or any otherdrug), nor could it show any productivity decrease due to pastuse of any other drug. It also could not show any effect of anydrug use in any person greater than age thirty-five. (15) Thus,according to the study, regular use of marijuana in the past onthe part of females aged twenty-five to thirty-four cost thenation $2,396,000,000. (16) However, marijuana use by femalesgreater than thirty-four, cost the nation nothing. (17) In malesaged twenty to twenty-four, regular marijuana use in the pastwould have cost the economy $6,723,000,000. (18) On this basis,however, any use of cocaine, prescription drugs, or phencyclidine(PCP) by this group cost the nation nothing. Of course, the studyreally does not indicate this because its inadequacy preventedany such calculations. Its inadequacy regarding the marijuanacalculations should be viewed in the same fashion. To stand infront of an audience and say that drug use cost the nation $34billion dollars in decreased productivity is foolish andimproper. Readers may have noted that the past paragraphsfollowed the mode of the RTI report and used income andproductivity as equivalents. I do not believe they areequivalents. Are those who choose to work in positions where theyearn less than the maximum possible less productive? If so, ajudge is less productive than a practicing lawyer, a medicalschool professor is less productive than a practicing physician,a farmer is less productive than a florist, and an elementaryschool teacher is less productive than an owner of a day-carecenter. IV ILLEGAL DRUG USE IS DECLINING In an affidavit filed in support of the federalgovernment's attempt to promote urine testing of certain federalemployees under the President's executive order, J. Michael Walshcharacterized the drug problems in America as pervasive:"Overall, 70.4 million Americans age 12 and over 37% of thepopulation have used marijuana, cocaine or other illicit drugs atleast once in their lifetime. Nineteen percent of the populationage 12 and over 36.8 million have used illicit drugs at leastonce in the past year, and 12 % at least once during the monthprior to being surveyed." (19) Walsh himself later notes that of the 70.4million Americans who have tried an illicit drug at least once intheir lives, for most (sixty two million) that drug wasmarijuana. (20) Many of the proponents of testing use such data.Proponents, however, do not often seem to notice that this samedata reveals that almost fifty percent of those who have everused an illegal drug at least once have not used an illegal drugin the past year and perhaps never will again. (21) The sources of these data are important andinteresting and merit careful attention. There are two importantsurveys funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse from whichmost of our knowledge about the use of illegal drugs in theUnited States is derived. These surveys are the NationalHousehold Survey and the annual High School Senior Survey. (22)Both surveys, however, were not constructed to signal seriousheavy drug use: "The unique contribution of serveys of thegeneral population lies in their ability to furnish prevalenceestimates that include many forms of drug use that never come tothe attention of medical and legal authorities.....Surveyresponses permit classification of drug-using behavior along acontinuum of involvement, substituting empirical for arbitrarydefinitions of medically or socially pathologic conditions, andemphasizing the typical nature of the phenomenon rather than itsmost dramatic manifestations." (23) These words from the forward to the NationalHousehold Survey published in 1983 seem particularly calm in thelight of the frequent repetition of its glaring numbers to induceemployers and others to join in the zealot's game. The NationalHousehold Survey is a general population survey of householdmembers aged twelve and above and has been conducted every two tothree years since 1971. It excludes individuals ininstitutionalized settings (colleges, prisons, military bases)and, therefore, as conservative. Because each respondent givesgeneral data, it can monitor trends by age and sex and otherdemographic variables. The annual High School Senior Survey obtainsself-reported information from approximately 130 high schools inthe continental United States. Between 16,000 and 18,000 seniorsare surveyed. In addition, the investigators construct a subsample of individuals from each class who are followed, yieldinga longitudinal study. These two surveys do not yield a horriblestory of an American decline into profligate drug use, butexactly the opposite. Table I depicts data from the HouseholdSurvy regarding marijuana use over time. (24) Since 1979, thedata indicate a significant decline in use among the twoimportant youth groups. In the eighteen to twenty-five group, thepercentage of the population that had ever used marijuanadeclined from 68.2% to 60.5% Those who had used marijuana in theyear preceeding the survey declined from 46.9% to 37% and in thelast month preceeding the survey, from 35.4% to 21.9%. (Unable to duplicate Tables, charts, and graphswhich follow in original text) These national trends also are reflected in theHigh School Senior Survey (Table II). (25) The apex of marijuanause in this group also was noted in 1979 and has steadilydeclined. Marijuana use in the month preceeding the survey fellfrom 33.7% to 23.4%. Daily use has steadily declined from 10.3%to 4.0% During the growing clamor to test workingAmericans, interest in marijuana, the most widely-acceptedillegal drug, has declined, and declined significantly. This factis not stressed by those frequently quoting the two surveyinstruments. The use of cocaine shows a different but stillhopeful pattern. Between 1974 and 1985, the lifetime prevalenceof cocaine use increased from 5.4 million users to 22.2 millionusers. (26) However, the trend in the High School Senior Survyshowed a distinct leveling off between 1982 and 1985 with aslight decrease. (27) In 1987, cocaine use by high schoolstudents and young adults dropped twenty percent. (28) Again, aquarter of those reporting cocaine use had not used the drug inthe last year. The decline noted for marijuana has occurred inmost drug categories in the High School Survey including adecline in current and daily use of alcohol.

INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND RAILROAD EMPLOYEES Among the fears fueling the drive to test isthe specter of industrial accidents and the likelihood ofintoxicated workers harming other workers and the public. Thelack of data that drug use in industry is harmful or an importantcause of accidents does not deter the frequent attribution ofaccidents to drug use. Nowhere is this discussion more focusedthan on transportation. It is impossible to raise arguments abouttesting without provoking commentary on intoxicated airplanepilots and locomotive engineers. Perhaps the strongest impetus totesting occurred on January 4, 1987, when a Conrail engineer, wholater tested positive for marijuana, ignored a number of warningdevices and pulled his train into the path of an AmtrakMetroliner. (30) Sixteen people were killed. (31) From February 10, 1986 to January 15, 1987,under the auspices of the Federal Railroad Administration("FRA"), most American rail carriers conducted anincident-based testing program. Any train accident or incidentassociated with a fatality, injury, or nontrivial property damageresulted in the testing of all operating personnel--- includingthe train crews, dispatcher, and policemen. One hundredseventy-five events in the year led to the testing of 759employees. (32) Of the 759 employees sampled, 43 tested positivefor controlled substances including alcohol. (33) Of theforty-three positives, the drugs identified were as follows:Alcohol = 9 (1.2%) Illicit drugs = 29 (3.8%) Other controlledsubstances = 14 (1.8%). (34) The FRA made public the specific results onlyfor the alcohol and illicit drug positives, so it was notpossible to know which licit drugs (one assumes obtained byprescription) were identified in the fourteen workers. Of thetwenty-nine (3.8%)positives for illicit drugs, eighteen had onlyTHC carboxylic acid (marijuana metabolite). five had onlybenzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite) and six had both. (35) Oneindividual who tested positive for methamphetamine also hadtested positive for marijuana and is included in the eighteen.Despite its listing as illicit, methamphetamine is stillavailable in the United States as a licit appetite depressant. The FRA document correctly noted that these"data are not conclusive of alcohol/drug role in industrialaccidents." (36) Indeed, of the twenty-nine, at least sevenhad job classifications which would seem to place them at adistance from operating decisions (track patrolman, ticket taker,conductor, road master). (37) This costly program is not citedfor what appears to be significant evidence that illicit drugs donot play an obvious role in industrial rail accidents.Furthermore, there is no reason to believe that an investigationof other industrial accidents would yield a different picture.VI. MARIJUANA ISSUES Because most workplace positives are due tomarijuana metabolite and most arguments revolve around theputative dangers of off-the-job marijuana use, the details ofcannabinoid testing are important. A review of these details is,however, beyond the scope of this article. (38) However, threepoints involving marijuana that are commonly used to provoketestingt merit some discussion. First, the fat storage andcarry-over effect of marijuana. Second, the airplane simuatortesting study. Finally, the growing potency of domesticallyavailable marijuana. A. Fat Storage and Effect The persistence and storage of THC and othercannainoids after use is subject to much discussion andmisunderstanding. Figure 1 depicts the length of time THC remainsin the plasma after an individual smokes marijuana containingdelta-9-THC (the intoxicating ingredient in marijuana). (39) Thepattern of distribution follows, with some simplification, whatpharmacologists refer to as a two-compartment model. The druginitially enters the blood stream (compartment I) and then israpidly distributed to the deep compartment II, which is most ofthe body. The initial rapidly declining concentration curverepresents the disappearance from the blood stream throughdistribution. (Unable to show Figure 1) Three to four hours after the initialingestion, the concentration of delta-9-THC has fallen below 2-5ng. ml in the blood. (40) This concentration represents theminimal effective concentration. (41) Below this concentration inthe blood, the drug exerts no demonstrable effect. We assume thatlike other drugs, the concentration has fallen so that thecomplementary concentration in the brain and other receptortissue is below the threshold which will produce an effect.However, delta-9-THC remains in the body. The second phase of the disapearance curve isnearly level because its decline is so gradual. This phaserepresents to some degree the drug's redistribution fromcompartment II to compartment I. This slow decline is used tocalculate the terminal half-life (T 1/2) of THC. A lowconcentration, say 1.0 ng ml, will take more than twenty-fourhours to fall to .05 ng / ml. (42) Actually, it probably takeseven more time, but an accurate calculation is difficult becauseof the inability to measure extremely low concentrations. This slow decline is the source of thepopularly-held concept that THC persists in the body's fat. Fromthis another speculation usually follows. The speculation is thatthe THC still is exerting some effect. Current evidence simplysays this is not so. There are many speculations about thelong-lasting effects of THC, but in the nearly thirty years sincedelta-9-THC was discovered, nothing has been verified. The brainactually contains little fat and there is no evidence to supportthe idea that the drug particularly persists there. Frequentusers will carry the drug and its metabolites with them--even tothe workplace--but they also will carry some amount oforganochlorine pesticide, lead, and the hydrocarbon solvent usedat work. We might better and more profitably examine the longterm effects of these substances. B. Airplane Simulator Testing In Private Pilots To justify the intrusion of testing, studiespurporting to show a lasting effect of marijuana have been widelycited. Marijuana users and their defenders frequently state thatmarijuana use-off-the-job is no different than alcohol useoff-the -job. The effects of marijuana and the selectiveimpairment generated by its use dissipate within three to fourhours and generally correlate with the decline in serumtetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to levels of less than 5 ng / ml. (43)The studies of Herbert Moskowitz and Robert Petersen thatindicate impairment of some psychomotor function for up to eighthours (44) are puzzling and not entirely scientificallyacceptable. However, assuming they are correct, they still do notindicate that off-the-job drug use causes on-the-job impairment.A study by Dr. Jerome Yesavage is another matter. (45) This studyusing flight simulators has been widely discussed and previouslyused as a strategic justification for urine testing. (46) Thestudy identifies significant impairment twenty-four hours aftersmoking marijuana in a group of volunteer pilots who performed ona flight simulator. (47) These conclusions are striking and havenot yet been replicated or confirmed. After careful analysis of the article, I thinkthat the experimental methodology was so flawed that the studydoes not prove impairment at twenty-four hours. (48) Briefly, thestudy was uncontrolled and, therefore, scientifically unreliable.The subjects were studied with no placebos or attempts to concealthe active treatment. Subject efforts at a control run werecompared to their efforts after they, and the investigators, knewthat they had consumed an active drug. This violates elementaryrules of study design and constitutes a serious flaw in thestudy. The study also fails to deal with the characteristics andprior drug experience of the volunteers, the issues of repeatedtesting and training upon the simulator, and the generation of alarge number of simulator-generated measures some of which mayhave varied by chance. (49) C. THC Content (Potency) of DomesticallyAvailable Marijuana A commonly stated and widely accepted belief isthat marijuana's past record of causing minimal harm to users wasbased on the use of low-grade material. Many plants, particularlythose growing wild, have a low content of delta-9-THC. (50) It isoften stated that the THC content has increased greatly. In fact,critics and proponents of testing sound like dealers extollingthe power of Hawaiian and California grown material. "Aglance at the percentages of THC in confiscated marijuanawould....[indicate] that marijuana is now as strong as hashish inTHC content," (51) This particular claim also has beendifficult to document. However, NIDA has funded a THC analysisprogram at the University of Mississippi since 1980. Under theprogram, the University analyzes plants received chiefly by lawenforcement agents, both federal (Drug Enforcement Agency) and avariety of city and state criminal agencies. The accompanyingtable lists the findings since 1980. (52) Year # of samples Mean THC% 1980 35 4.64 1981129 2.92 1982 148 2.57 1983 387 1.98 1984 330 2.55 1985 842 2.211986 800 1.86 1987 (Sept 100 2.5 The sampling is irregular but chiefly reflectsmaterial seized by these agencies from the back yards, frms, andeven indoor hydroponic systems of growers. The most suspect year,1980, of course, is the only one in which the mean percentageexceeded three percent. There has been no real change andcertainly no real increase in marijuana potency in the 1980's. Interestingly, significant variation in THCcontent of marijuana does not necessarily result in greaterdelivery. In a study of the delivery of THC into smoke understandard conditions, 16-19% of the THC content of a cigaretteactually appeared in the smoke. (53) Increasing the THC contentunder some circumstances did not influence delivery. For example,cigarettes carefully prepared to contain 1.6% THC and 3.1% THCdelivered the same amount of THC in smoke. (54) VII. CONCLUSIONS This article has examined a series ofrationales for the imposition of urine testing onto unimpairedAmerican workers. I have tried in good faith to examine thearguments from the perspective of empirical studies andappropriate analysis. I have accused, not subtly, the proponentsof testing of zealotry and improper use of statistics and data tosupport a moral stance. To some degree my bias as a civillibertarian has affected my evaluation. In the long run, however,the truth about this conflict will depend upon ideas and data andnot biography. Urine testing is a wrong-headed intervention intothe lives of some by those with power over them. It is not asearch for illness but a search for deviance conducted in anun-American manner. Drug abuse is a specter of the 1980'sresembling the specter of domestic communism of the 1950's. Underthe guise of helping, the proponents of testing are creatingenormous harm. Urine testing is simply drug abuse abuse. FOOTNOTES 30. Se N.Y. Times, Jan. 5, 1987, at 1, col. 2. 31. Id. 32.

The fraction ofcompanies that subject employees or job applicants to testing hasjumped from 21 percent in 1986 to more than 50 percent last year,according to the American Management Association. The trend seemslikely to continue: a majority of the respondents to a recentGallup poll favored random drug testing of all workers. What underlies the broad acceptance of apractice that conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scaliahas called a "needless indignity?" One factor may bethe alarming statistics cited by testing advocates to demonstratethe high costs of drug abuse. Examination of some of these claimssuggests that they do not always accurately reflect the researchon which they are based. In fact, some of the data could be usedto "prove" that drug use has negligible or evenbeneficial effects. Consider these examples. Last year President George Bush declared that"drug abuse among American workers costs businesses anywherefrom $60 billion to $100 billion a year in lost productivity,absenteeism, drug-related accidents, medical claims andtheft." Variants of this statistic abound in discussionsabout drug abuse and are commonly repeated without qualificationby the media. Yet all such claims derive from a single study, onethat "was based upon assumptions which need additionalvalidation," according to an assessment last year by NIDA,the chief federal agency sponsoring research on substance abuse. The study grew out of a survey of some 3,700households by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in 1982. TheRTI group found that the average reported income of householdswith at least one person who admitted to having ever usedmarijuana daily (20 days or more in a 30-day period) was 28percent lower than the average reported income of otherwisesimilar households. The RTI researchers defined that differencein income as "loss due to marijuana use"; the totalloss, when extrapolated to the general population, came to $26billion. The researchers then added on the estimated costs ofdrug-related crime, health problems and accidents to arrive at agrand total of $47 billion for "costs to society of drugabuse." This figure-- "adjusted" to account forinflation and population increase -- represents the basis ofBush's statement, according to Henrick J. Harwood, who headed theRTI study and is now in the White House drug-policy office. The RTI survey included questions on currentdrug use (at least once within the past month). Yet according toHarwood there was no significant difference between the income ofhouseholds with current users of any illegal drug -- includingmarijuana, cocaine and heroin -- and the income of otherwisesimilar households. Does this mean that current use of even harddrugs -- as opposed to perhaps a single marijuana binge in thedistant past -- does not lead to any "loss"? "Youwould be on safe ground saying that," Harwood replies. Officials of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce havetestified before Congress and at national conferences on drugabuse that employees who use drugs are "3.6 times morelikely to injure themselves or another person in a workplaceaccident....[and] five times more likely to file a workers'compensation claim." The pharmaceutical giant Hoffmann-LaRoche, which is leading an antidrug campaign among businesses(and has a big share of the drug-testing market), alsopromulgates this claim in "educational" literature. In fact, the study on which the claim is basedhas "nothing to do with [illegal] drug users,"according to a 1988 article in the University of Kansas LawReview by John P. Morgan of the City University of New YorkMedical School. Morgan, an authority on drug testing, has tracedthe Chamber of Commerce claim to an informal study by theFirestone Tire and Rubber Company of employees undergoingtreatment for alcholism. In an interview with SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, J.Michael Walsh, who heads NIDA's applied research division and isa strong supporter of workplace testing, singled out two studiesthat he said showed drug users are more likely to causeaccidents, miss work and use health benefits. The studies weredone at two utilities: the Utah Power and Light Company and theGeorgia Power Company. The 12 workers in Utah and the 116 inGeorgia who served as the primary research subjects were tested"for cause": they had either been involved inaccidents, exhibited other "problem" behavior(commonly, high absenteeism) or submitted to treatment foralcoholism or drug abuse. Critics point out that it should not beterribly surprising if these subjects exhibited the cited traitsat a higher-than-average rate. What may be surprising is that, according to areport published by NIDA last year, Utah Power and Light actually"spent $215 per employee per year less on the drug abusersin health insurance benefits than on the control group."Those who tested positive at Georgia Power had a higher promotionrate than the company average. Moreover, Georgia workers testingpositive only for marijuana (about 35 percent of all thepositives) exhibited absenteeism some 30 percent lower thanaverage. Nationwide, Morgan says, marijuana accounts for up to 90percent of all positive findings, both because it is by far themost widely used illegal drug and because it persists in urinefor up to a month (compared with two days for most other drugs). Perhaps the study most publicized of late bytesting proponents involves employees of the U.S. Postal Service.The service tested 4,396 new hirees in 1987 and 1988 and --keeping the test results confidential -- tracked the performanceof positives (9 percent of the total) and negatives. By lastSeptember, the service reported, 15.4 percent of the positivesand 10.5 of the negatives had been fired: the positives had alsotaken an average of six more sick days a year. This study may be distorted by more subtlebiases --related to race, age or gender --than those displayed bythe utility studies, according to Theodore H. Rosen, apsychologist and a consultant on drug testing. Indeed, Jacques L.Normand, who headed the study, acknowledges that minority postalworkers tested positive at a much higher rate than nonminorityworkers and that previous studies have shown minorities to havehigher absenteeism. Morgan points out, moreover, that the PostalService study (like all those cited above) has not been publishedin a peer-reviewed journal. In fact, he says, only one studycomparing the work of drug-test positives and negatives haspassed peer review. Last year, in the JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNALMEDICINE, David C. Parish of the Mercer University School ofMedicine in Georgia reported on a study of 180 hospitalemployees, 22 of whom had tested positive after being hired.Parish examined supervisor evaluations and other indexes andfound "no difference between drug-positive and drug-negativeemployees" at the end of one year. He noted, however, that11 of the negatives had been fired during that period and none ofthe positives. Proponents of testing often imply that drug useamong workers is growing. A Hoffman-La Roche brochure, forexample, quotes Walsh pronouncing that "the problem of drugabuse has become so widespread in America that every company mustassume that its employees will eventually be faced with asubstance abuse problem." Yet in 1989 NIDA reported thatillegal drug use has been decreasing for 10 years and that thedecline has accelerated over the last five years. From 1985 to1988 the number of current users (at least once in the lastmonth) of marijuana and cocaine dropped by 33 and 50 percent,respectively. To be sure, a subset of this group of currentusers is increasing: NIDA estimated that from 1985 to 1988 thenumber of people using cocaine at least once a week rose from647,000 to 862,000 and daily users increased from 246,000 to292,000. NIDA found that addiction to cocaine (including"crack") is particularly severe among the unemployed --who are beyond the reach of workplace testing. Clearly, the U.S. has a drug-abuse problem.Could it be that neither indiscriminate testing of workers --which could cost upward of $500 million this year -- nor thedissemination of alarmist information by testing advocates ishelping to resolve that problem?

Drug testers may be a little upset bysome of its conclusions, since the study raises importantquestions about the scientific rationale for workplace drugtesting. Workplace drug testing is a very big business.The study group estimates that the United States is spending atleast 1.2 billion dollars per year on drug testing (24 milliontests per year at an estimated total cost of $50 each), notcounting any money spent on time lost from work attributable tothe testing process. Statistical evidence from a variety ofsources suggest that, except for alcohol, drug use in theworkplace has been steadily decreasing for the last 15 years (thepercentage of heavy drinkers in the population appears to beunchanged). In 1990, the overall rate for workers admitting tohaving used an illicit drug some time during the preceding monthwas 7%. However, today in some areas, such as the air transportand nuclear industry, the rate is well below 1%. No study has ever demonstrated that thisdecrease is due to the work testing program, nor has it beendemonstrated with any certainty that, in commonly used doses, anyof the widely abused drugs significantly impacts on jobperformance. There is, however, good evidence that drug users aremore likely to be absent from work, and there is also goodevidence that alcohol abuse is associated with increasedoccupational injuries. The committee felt that much of the datareviewed for its report was flawed, or at least of dubiousstatistical power, and they concluded that "the preventiveeffects of drug-testing programs have never been adequatelydemonstrated." As Craig Zwerling pointed out in a recentissue of JAMA, Journal of the American Medical Association (272[18] 1467-1468), the conclusion reached by the study group wasthe same as that reached in a 1992 study, namely that there was"almost no credible warrant of effectiveness." Zwerling also went on to note that "alarge industry of drug testers has arisen with a financial stakein expanding the market for workplace drug tests. The industryincludes the companies that manufacture the equipment andchemicals used in drug testing, the laboratories that carry outthe test, the companies that collect the urine specimens, themedical review officers (MRO's) who review the test results, andthe consultants who advise companies on drug testing." The study was sponsored by NIDA (NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse) and the results have been published inbook form by the National Academy Press. The full title is"Under the Influence?

But who is going to put up the money to do the studies?NIDA has just as big a vested interest in maintaining the statusquo as the drug testing companies, and the reagent manufacturers.In fact, it may be too late to ever do the studies that wouldjustify the money and effort being spent on these programs.

But how true are these claims, which seem toenjoy the support of reputable scientific re- search?Underexamination these claims are proven to be nothing more than agreedy scam designed to expand the bureaucratic empires andprofits of a few by sacrificing the most fundamental liberties ofthe many. ILLICIT DRUG USERS WORK MORE Contradicting the "unproductive druguser" stereotype, while the National Household Sur- vey onDrug Abuse [1] finds that 71% of il- licit-drug users areemployed, U.S. Depart- ment of Labor statistics [2] show thatonly 65% of those 20 and over are employed. From the data we canextrapolate that the aver- age illicit-drug user is more likelyto be employed than the average person [3]. The evidence suggests that, while not favor-able to police-state mega profits, the most true-to-lifestereotype could be: "The pro- ductive and motivated druguser." Why might this be so? It's possible that thedesire for the reward of drug intoxication acts as astrongerincentive to work more (in an effort to earn the money necessaryto purchase the drug-reward) than non-drug rewards act as anincentive for nonusers to work more. Such is Economics 101: thehigher the reward, the higher the output to acquire it; or, thesweeter the carrot on the stick, the faster the horse will runafter it. ILLICIT DRUG USERS COST LESS & WORK HARDER The journal SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN [4] cited astudy of workers at two utility companies: Utah Power & Lightand Georgia Power Company. The workers who tested positive forillicit drugs were found to (a) cost employers $215 less perworker per year in health insurance, and (b) have a higher rateof promotion. Work- ers testing positive for cannabis only had anabsentee rate 30% lower than average. The logical conclusion:illicit users were less costly to employers while at the sametime being more productive and reliable. More for less! -- nowthere's a deal. The JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE [5]published a study that found "no difference betweendrug-positive and drug-negative em- ployees."However, thestudy's author ob- served that during the study, 11 of the non-users were fired while none of the users were fired. Ironically,once the study end- ed, all of the users could have been firedfor using the "wrong" drugs, regardless of theirproductivity and professionalism. The claim that illicit-drug use costs busi-nesses X billion dollars per year, is der- ived from a 1982 studyby the Research Tri- angle Institute. The study found that house-holds with at least one member who used can- nabis daily at somepoint in their life had a 28% lower income than the averagehouse- hold income. Yet the study also showed that thosecurrently using any illicit drug had an income equivalent to theaverage [4]. If we conclude that because cannabis use pre-ceded a lower income, therefore, cannabis use caused a lowerincome(a post hoc ergo prop- ter hoc fallacy), then we must alsoconclude based on the data that if you used cannabis in the past,you should start using it again to increase your income tocurrent-user rates. Interesting to note:if current drug users earnmore than former users, this supports the theory that drugrewards are a more powerful incentive for work than nondrugrewards. THE RIGGING OF RESEARCH In an effort to push Congress to pass manda-tory illicit-drug-testing legislation, U.S. Chamber of Commerceofficials, in testimony before Congress, claimed that researchshowed illicit-drug users were "3.6 times more like- ly toinjure themselves or another person in a workplaceaccident...[and] five times more likely to file a workers'compensation claim." However, as SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN [4]observed: In fact, the study on which the claim is basedhas "nothing to do with [illicit] drug users,"according to a 1988 article in the University of Kansas Law Re-view by John P. Morgan of the City University of New York Med-ical School. Morgan, an author- ity on drug testing, has tracedthe Chamber of Commerce claim to an informal study by the Fire-stone Tire and Rubber Company of employees undergoing treatmentfor alcoholism. ^^^^^^^^^^ Using the devastating effects of thegovern- ment subsidized drug alcohol to initiate a leg- islativepogrom against safer, albeit, illicit drugs -- an obvious andshameless scam. This scam is promoted not only by governmentalinterests in an effort to expand bureaucratic empires,but also byprivate interests in an effort to maximize profits, as theSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN observed: "The pharmaceutical giantHoffman-La Roche, which is leading an anti- drug campaign amongbusinesses (and has a big share of the drug-testing market), alsopromul- gates this claim in 'educational' literature." SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN observed other errors inthe research promoted by the GovtMedia that purports to show thatdrug users are bad for business. For example, a study that founda higher absentee rate among users failed to note that most usersin the study were minor- ities, and minorities have an absenteerate, regardless of drug use, identical to the rate observed inthe study.Logic therefore dic- tates, contrary to the GovtMedia'sconclusion, that NO statistically significant correlation betweendrug use and absenteeism was found. CONCLUSIONARY OVERVIEW Ultimately, the drug-testing and drug-rehab-ilitation program is a massive cannabis-user- identification andreeducation pogrom. This is because 90% of drug-positive urinetests are for cannabis, which is due to the fact that inactivemetabolites of THC remain in the urine for up to 30 days after asingle use, whereas most other drugs are out of the system in aday or even less. But why sacri- fice primary liberties forcannabis control? Not only is cannabis one of the safest knowndrugs [6], and, as we have just observed, is correlated to betteremployee performance, but there is no established correlationbet- ween cannabis and motor-skill impairment; thus, unlike legalalcohol, it cannot even be said to impair driving skills, whichis a major drug testing pretext. Observing the safety of cannabisuse, the National High- way Traffic Safety Administration [7]said: No clear relationship has ever beendemonstrated between mari- juana smoking and either serious- lyimpaired driving performance or the risk of accident involve-ment... [T]here is little if any evidence to indicate thatdrivers who have used marijuana alone are any more likely tocause serious accidents than drug free drivers. The most exhaustive review of the researchclearly confirms that there is simply no compelling case for theintrusive Orwellian surveillance of private activity that is im-posed by drug testing.As Dr. John Morgan, director ofpharmacology at City University of New York Medical School,wisely observed: Urine testing is ... a method for surveillance,not a tool for safety. Indeed, drug testing is not about safety or jobperformance; drug testing is a necessary feature of theSurveillance State that is now being built around us to ensuretotal cradle- to-grave surveillance and control of workers. While it's been said that those who are will-ing to give up liberty for safety will soon have neither,in thecase of illicit-drug testing -- which cannot even promise improv-ed safety -- we can say that those who are willing to give upliberty for nothing will soon have only that for which theysurrend- ered their priceless liberty: nothing. ________________________________________________________________________ [1] National Household Survey on Drug Abuse,1995. http://www.health.org/pubs/95hhs/any.htm [2] U.S. Department of Labor statistics, 1996. ftp://stats.bls.gov/pub/news.release/History/empsit.100496.news ftp://stats.bls.gov/pub/news.release/empsit.txt [3] The USDL statistics [2] indicate that theEmployment Population Ratio (EPR) for all men and women ages 20and above is 65%.

Wouldthis give the illicit users an unfair advantage in this analysis?No, because the EPR for ages 18-19 is roughly 1 to 3% lower thanfor ages 20 and above (likely due to being in school);this lowerrate of employment for ages 18-19 would serve only to lower theil- licit-user EPR results.Therefore, the inclu- sion of ages18-19 in the NHSCA study must lo- wer, NOT inflate, the higherrate of employ- ment measured among illicit users.

The Untold Costs of Drug TestingAbuse Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Miscellaneous Statements on DrugPolicy URINALYSIS OR UROMANCY? THE UNTOLD COSTS OFDRUG TESTING ABUSE Dale Gieringer, Ph.D., A paper for the Drug Policy FoundationPublished in "Strategies for Change: New Directions in DrugPolicy (1992) Among the impositions on personal privacyintroduced in the Reagan-Bush era, few are more intrusive butless questioned than drug urinalysis. Relatively unknown at thestart of the eighties, urinalysis has now become a condition foremployment in over half of America's major companies, as well asfor insurance, child custody, security clearance, and freedomfrom jail on probation or parole. While urinalysis has beenchallenged by civil libertarians, courts have generally upheld itin the face of strong public support. Opponents have objectedthat drug testing is an unwarranted violation of privacy and asearch without probable cause, bu supporters have successfullycountered that the supposed hazards of drug abuse necessitateurine testing. What is all too rarely challenged in this debateis the scientific rationale of urinalysis as a means of detectingdrug abuse in the first place. The facts that urinalysis does notdetect whether someone is impaired or under the influence ofdrugs; rather it detects the presence of non-psychoactive drugmetabolites that may linger in the system days or weeks afteruse. In this respect urinalysis differs from the familiar alcoholbreathalyzer and blood tests, which detect whether one isactually under the influence (as it turns out, alcohol is uniquein this regard: for other drugs, there is no simple relationbetween impairment and concentration in bodily fluids). Thus itis not only possible, but entirely likely that someone whoseurine tests positive for drugs is altogether competent andunimpaired. As it happens, urinalysis is particularlysensitive to marijuana, a single use of which can registerpositive for as long as a week, long after any effects havevanished; heavy users may register positive for as long as 4-6weeks. Thus, urinalysis precludes even the most innocent, weekendsmoking of marijuana as "drug abuse." Ironically,urinalysis is considerably more tolerant of harder drugs such ascocaine and heroin, which generally wash out in 2-3 days at most.Other commonly used psychoactive drugs, including nicotine,tranquilizers, and psychedelic drugs such as LSD are generallynot tested for. Above all, urinalysis doesn't detect America'snumber one drug of abuse, alcohol. Thus urinalysis in no wayassures a drug-free workplace. Instead, it encouragessubstitution of alcohol and other non-tested drugs for marijuana,cocaine, opiates and amphetamine. Drug urinalysis is therefore an inherentlyflawed technology. On one hand, it arbitrarily treats even themost occasional marijuana users as "drug abuse,"despite the substantial evidence that moderate marijuana use isharmless. On the other hand, it ignores flagrant alcoholism. Theupshot is that urinalysis disqualifies many productive, competentworkers who enjoy non-traditional drugs in their free time, whilecompletely ignoring the majority of drug abusers, who arealcoholics. All of this raises obvious questions about the valueof drug urinalylsis. Morally, urinalysis can be compared to randomlysearching workers' homes and garbage cans and branding themalcohol abusers if empty liquor bottles are found. Though itmight seem that Americans would strenuously object to suchwarrantless searches of their homes, polls have shown strongpublic support for searching their bladder contents, especiallyin jobs deemed safety-critical. URINALYSIS: AN UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGY Despite the public support for drug testing,urinalysis is a remarkably unproven technology. Were urinalysis alife-saving new drug, it would have had to undergo years ofpainstaking premarket testing in order to meet FDA regulations,requiring it to be proven fully "safe and effective" inrigorous, double-blind studies. Yet the fact is that urinalysishas been imposed on millions of American workers involuntarilywithout so much as a single scientifically controlled study toshow that it is a safe or effective means of promoting workplacesafety. Moreover, unlike drug consumers, urinalysis subjectsreceive no warning labels informing them of what they are beingtested for, nor of the risks, accepted usage or implications ofthe tests. A close inspection of the evidence for drugtesting shows that it rests largely on exaggerated, distorted andunfounded claims, as shown in critical reviews in ScientificAmerican and elsewhere. (1) For instance, testing advocates havecited a Research Triangle Institute survey purporting to showthat the income loss due to marijuana use was some $26 billion;yet the same data showed no difference at all in income betweennon-users and current users of marijuana or other drugs. Other,non-peer-reviewed studies by employers have likewise beenmisinterpreted to support urinalysis: for instance, a pair ofstudies at Utah Power and Light Co. and Georgia Power Co.purporting to show that drug users pose a high risk of accidentsand absenteeism only looked at users who had exhibited problembehavior on lthe job. Not surprisingly, this population had worsethan average work records. Nonetheless, Utah Power found thaltdrug users cost $215 less in health insurance benefits, whileGeorgia Power found lower rates of absenteeism in workers whotested positive only for marijuana! Only a handful of published studies havecompared the performance of drug-positive workers with others,with similar, mixed results. A one-year follow-up study of 180new employeees at a Georgia hospital found no relationshipbetween drug screen results and subsequent job performance. Itconcluded, "The data presently available do not support thethesis that positive drug screening predicts poor jobperformance." (2) Nonetheless, the U.S. government hasrecently ordered random testing of its VA hospital employees. Themost extensive and widely cited research on workplace drugtesting comes from the U.S. Postal Service, which tracked the jobperformance of new employees according to prior drug screenresults. Test results were not used in hiring decisions, but wereevaluated to determine their relation to job performance one yearlater. The first study, which tracked the performance of 2533postal workers in Boston, reported that drug-positive workers hada statistically 50% higher rate of dismissals, reprimands,injuries, accidents and absenteeism. (3) However, the authorsnoted that this difference was "much less than previouslyestimated." Looked at another way, the Boston data actuallyshowed that the great majority of drug-positive users werereliable: fully 86% of marijuana-positive workers werediscipline-free after one year, versus 91% for non-users; 74%were accident-free, versus 81% for non-users; and 71% were stillon the job, versus 81% for non-users. Thus, on the average,marijuana-positive workers were 90% as reliable as clean-urineones. Surprisingly, cocaine-positive workers fared even better,being over 95% as reliable in most categories. The Bostonfindings regarding accidents and injuries were subsequentlycontradicted by a second, larger, study of 4,396 postal workersnationwide, which found no relation at all between drug testresults and injuries or accidents. (4) The Boston accidentfindings had previously been criticized on methodologicalgrounds. The second Postal Service study did find that those whotested positive for illicit drugs had a 50% higher rate ofabsenteeism and dismissals. Yet once again, they showed thatdrug-using workers were largely reliable: drug users had a 93.4%attendance record, versus 95.8% for others, and 85% of users kepttheir jobs, versus 89.5% of non-users. The Boston data were later analyzed in acost-benefit study, which found that drug screening would bemarginally economical, to the tune of about $162 perdrug-positive worker rejected. (5) However, the authors cautionedthat these results were highly sensitive to variations in theextent of drug use and cost of urine testing, and that there werelikely to be many situations where drug testing was notcost-effective. They concluded that companies "shouldcarefully weigh the costs and benefits" in their particularindustry. Had the authors examined the second Post Service study,they would presumably have found even slimmer benefits from urinetesting, since there would have been no savings from accidents orinjuries. Furthermore, their analysis undoubtedly overstated thepotential value of drug urine testing, since they assumed thatall drug-positive workers would be screened out. In practice,however, drug-using workers are apt to avoid detection, either bydiscontinuing use temporarily beforehand or by other evasiontechniques described below. VICTIMS OF URINALYSIS While the benefits of drug testing to employersappear dubious and unproven, the costs to the workforce havescarcely been examined at all. Nonetheless, it is clear thaturinalysis imposes significant costs on workers. To begin with,it forces millions of innocent employees to submit to scrutiny ofintimate bodily fluids in a way that many regard as degrading andobnoxious. This is especially trying for the unfortunate minoritysufering "blushing kidneys," who are unable to produceurine on demand. At least one urinalysis victim has even beenhospitalized for water poisoning after being required to drinkthree liters of water in order to make her give urine. (6) Urinalysis is especially burdensome andoffensive to those otherwise responsible, productive workers whodo not abuse drugs on the job but enjoy indulging them in theirfree time at home. Principal among these are the nation's 20 or30 million marijuana users, the great majority of whom areoccasional users. (7) Due to the oversensitivity of urine teststo marijuana, pot smokers constitute the great majority ofurinalysis victims: up to 90% of drug-positive test results arefor marijuana. (8) Urinalysis forces these workers either to giveup a valued pleasure, or to risk losing employment, insurance, orother benefits and rights. California NORML (National Organization for theReform of Marijuana Laws) is one of several organizationsoffering drug testing advice via a telephone hotline, over whichwe have received scores of complaints from victims of drugtesting abuse. Included are truck drivers, airline attendants,office workers, mechanics, nurses and other employees withimpeccable work records, who have lost long-held jobs on accountof their urine chemistry, often against the wishes of their ownsupervisors and co-workers. One urinalysis victim, Mike Beatty, says helost $500,000 in Air Force retirement benefits after dischargedfor using marijuana solely on the evidence of one bad urine test.Beatty says that he used to smoke pot regularly, but like mostfellow servicemen gave it up when urine testing was instituted.Nonetheless, he relates, he continued to socialize with potsmokers, and had the misfortune of accidentally consuming amarijuana brownie at a party shortly before a drug test. Beattysays that before his discharge he was "humiliated" byAir Force personnel with sexual aspersions and investigationsinto his wife's private sex life. Another urinalysis victim named Don was firedfrom an ARCO truck driving job after 19 years on the job."It didn't even occur to me that I had a problem." hesaid. "I thought they were looking for coke." Don, whohad an excellent work record and seniority, complains that ARCOnever explained the implications of its drug testing policy.After losing his job and pension benefits, he was forced to sellhis house and settlle for a much lower-paying job. "You cancount me as a victim of drug testing," he says. "Jim is outstanding at what he does,"reads the employee evaluation file of another urinalysis victim,a tractor trailer driver who was fired under Department ofTransportation drug testing regulations. "Excellent safedriving awareness," "great initiative,""demonstrated dedication and consistency," read othertestimonials in Jim's file. Jim, who admits t being a weekendmarijuana smoker, was fired after five lyears on the job despitehaving the highest possible job safety rating with his company."My employer couldn't believe it," says another womanwho was fired from a job with a major retail store after failinga surprise drug test. Like many other drug testing victims, thewoman was tested after being "promoted" to a higherposition. "Drug testing has destroyed my attitudetowards my job and my government," says another utilityworker, who was forced into an "employee assistanceprogram" for a positive urine test. "They treat me likea drug addict," he says, echoing the complaint of many potsmokers, "and they go home and get drunk every night." DEALING WITH DRUG TESTS The most common question received on theCalifornia NORML hotline is how to deal with a urine test formarijuana. The most obvious advice is to abstain from suspectsubstances before the test. Many callers are surprised to learnthat occasional, weekend use typically washes out in as few as2-5 days. Most regular smokers commonly pass within a couple ofweeks, though very heavy use can be detected for as long as sixweeks. However, exceptions can occur. NORML has heard fromcallers who have reported flunking as long as 10 days after asingle, isolated use, while other, regular smokers have beenknown to pass within hours of last use. Such reports onlyemphasize the essential capriciousness and unreliability of drugurinalysis. For pot smokers facing drug tests on shortnotice, the simplest and most effective advice is to drink largevolumes of liquids immediately before the test. The purpose ofthis is to dilute the concentration of drug metabolites in theurine below the threshold of detection (usually 100 nanograms permilliliter for the commonly used EMIT test). Test subjects arealso advised to avoid giving urine that has accumulated in thebladder overnight, since this tends to be high in metabolites. Although reliable information on urinalysisevasion is hard to come by, reports from undergroundinvestigators agree that urine dilution can be quite effective.Most regular smokers are able to pass within a week or two, andsometimes much sooner, though exceptions occur. (9) Dilution canbe boosted by taking diuretics, which stimulate urination;however, the most effective of these are available only onprescription. A number of diets and wash-out regimes have beenproposed for persons who have several days to prepare; however,none of these have been scientifically validated. It is possiblefor laboratories to detect dilute urine by special tests forspecific gravity, creatanin content, etc.; however, such testsare expensive and rarely used. On rare occasion, subjects areasked to take a second test after submitting a sample that hasbeen found to be too watery. Of course, this gives them more timeto clear up. Becuase urine dilution is far from 100%reliable, especially for regular users caught unawares, there isa natural demand for surer methods. Many users experiment withoral "drug screens" that are rumored to avert positiveurine tests. Included are certain vitamins, vinegar, zincsulfate, and goldenseal root, as well as some overpriced specialformulas and herb teas sold on the underground market. Despiteglowing testimonials from some lucky users, these nostrums haveno good scientific foundation and have been found to beunreliable in underground investigations. A more reliable, if ethically dubious, way tofoil urine tests is to furtively tamper with the sample. Onepopular trick is to adulterate the sample with one of a number ofhousehold products that are known to interfere with the commonEMIT test so as to produce a false negative for marijuana. (10)Popular adulterants include detergent, salt, bleach and Dranocrystals, which can be concealed under the fingernails. However,such substances may be detectable by sight or smell by diligentlab technicians. A more sophisticated, less easily detectedadulterant is currently sold on lthe underground market. (11) andhas been proven to be quite reliable at producing false negativesfor marijuana (the manufacturer was compelled to move operationswhen the Texas legislature passed a bill outlawing sale of urineadulterants) (12) Another, more cumbersome trick is to substituteclean urine for one's own when delivering the sample. Asurprising number of American workers appear to have riggedthemselves up with substitute urine samples by methods elaboratedin Abby Hoffman's book, "Steal This Urine Test." (13)In order to discourage such cheating, many labs now measure thetemperature of each sample. Another, surer safeguard against tampering isto require that subjects be carefully observed during urination.However, aside from the armed forces and criminal justice system,few testers resort to such extreme measures. Most testsaccordingly provide leeway for evasive sleights of hand. Oneregrettable side-effect of drug testing is thus to favor thosemore unscrupulous drug users who are willing to resort totampering and similar evasion techniques, whereas honest usersmust either give up or face the risk of being fired. In a similarway, dishonesty is favored on questionnaires asking about illicitdrug use: those drug users who are honest about their use areroutinely turned down, with the result that only dishonest usersare hired. PRE-EMPLOYMENT TESTS In general, the common pre-employment urinescreen is by far the easiest kind of test to deal with, insofaras prospective employees need only avoid incriminating substancesfor the time they are on the job market. However, a surprisingnumber of ignorant job applicants are unaware that they should beprepared for urine tests in the first place. Most pot smokersappear to have little problem abstaining for job tests, given thelow addictiveness of marijuana. Only rarely has California NORMLencountered long-term heavy users who complain of difficulty ingiving up pot for a while. Nonetheless, pre-employment tests can still bea problem even for moderate users if they happen to encounter asurprise job opportunity. In addition, many companies requiredrug screens of employees when they are promoted. As a result,many workers whose efforts have won them a promotion end up beingfired instead on account of bad urine chemistry. Employees mayalso face urine tests unexpectedly when their company is sold tonew management. In such cases, the new owners may demand a suddenspot urine check of the entire workforce, effectively purging itof anyone who has had the bad luck to indulge a suspect substancetoo recently. Victims of such abuses generally have no legalrecourse against dismissal, and can also expect to loseunemployment benefits. NORML has heard from many otherwise blamelesspot smokers who have lost jobs thanks to drug testing. Few casesbetter illustrate the absurd lengths to which urinalysis iscarried than that of a newly "promoted" radioprogrammer who found himself fired for a positive marijuana test.The employee, who admitted to being a weekend pot smoker, hadbeen working for a San Francisco "60's golden oldies"FM station! Many NORML callers complain of having beencoerced into drug testing programs they don't understand orapprove of, with little explanation of how the policy will beadministered. "It was very manipulative," recounts onewoman concerning her employer's efforts to make her sign a formconsenting to urinalysis. "They told us of course wewouldn't be randomly tested; we would only be tested oncause," she relates, "But the form specifically statedwe would agree to random testing." Many employees receive nodisclosure statements at all, leaving them vulnerable toarbitrary decisions. Some workers complain of being fired for asingle bad test, after being given the impression that they wouldbe eligible for a rehabilitation program instead. Many employeescomplain about being "singled out" for drug testsbecause they are unpopular with their supervisor or manager.Others report being told by their managers that they will beprotected from urine tests because they are valued employees.Some employees receive advance warning about impending tests,giving them time to prepare; others are taken by surprise. Because blood and urine samples are used formany other medical tests, subjects do not necessarily know whenthey are being drug tested. A Nevada mother told the NORMLhotline that she had been unwittingly blood-tested for marijuanain a maternity ward, in what she had been told was a blood testfor AIDS. She said her family was subsequently visited byplainclothes police demanding that they refer their newborn to ahospital ward for drug-addicted babies, or else give up custody.Another woman relates giving a urine specimen for what she wastold was a pre-employment drug test, and losing the job when theemployer inspected it to find out that whe was pregnant instead! (Continued) URINALYSIS OR UROMANCY PART II RANDOM URINALYSIS By far the most dreaded and intrusive form ofdrug testing is the random test, which is specifically designedto take workers by surprise. Under random testing, workers may becalled on to provide a urine sample at any time, typically on nomore than an hour or two's notice (however, in some shops,workers have been known to receive as much as a weeks' advancealert). A corollary of random urinalysis is to prevent workersfrom using any marijuana, even at home on weekends, at the riskof losing their jobs. While private employers have tended to shy wawyfrom random testing on grounds of expense, government drugwarriors have successfully campaigned to impose random testingthrough federal regulations. Random urinalysis is now requiredfor the military, many public employees and contractors, and thenation's entire interstate transportation workforce -- includingnot only airline pilots, train engineers and truck drivers, butalso flight attendants, mechanics, and gas pipeline workers. The NORML hotline receives many complaintsabout random testing from transportation workers. Most not onlyresent the intrusion on their private lives, but also insist thatillicit drug abuse is not a safety problem. "Alcohol is theworst abused drug, especially pilots," says one angry flightattendant, a view repeatedly expressed by others in the industry. According to air industry spokesmen, not asingle passenger airline crash had been attributed to alcohol ordrug abuse. (14) Administration officials lamely pointed to a1988 plane crash in Durango, Colorado, in which the pilot's bloodshowed evidence of cocaine use. Yet investigators determined thatthe pilot was not high at the time of the crash, and it was theco-pilot who was controlling the plane at the time of the crash!(15) The fact that drug testing is widely opposed by the veryairline workers whose lives are most at stake would seem to raiseobvious questions about the supposed dangers of drug abuse in theair industry. Drug testing of transportation workers wasmandated by Congress in response to a highly publicized 1987train collision in which 16 passengers were killed. (16) Theaccident was blamed on the negligence of an engineer andbrakeman, who were determined to have been smoking marijuanashortly before the crash. A subsequent investigation revealedthat both men had an extensive record of drunken driving offensesand were known to be problem drinkers. Furthermore, some of thetrain's safety equipment had been disabled. The engineer admittedto culpability for ignoring warning signals, but denied thatmarijuana had anything to do with the accident. An investigationby the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that therailroad should undertake management reforms and equipmentimprovements, but did not recommend drug testing. Nonetheless,Transportation Secretary James Burnley argued for drug testing,pointing to evidence that a significant percentage ofaccident-involved rail personnel tested positive for drugs. (17)In fact, however, Federal Railroad Administration statisticsshowed that only 4-6% of "reasonable cause" urine testswere positive for drugs or alcohol, (18) half of what might havebeen expected for a normal cross-section of the workforce! (19) The ultimate impact of random testingregulations remains to be seen, as testing is still being phasedin within the transportation industry. Many workers haveresponded by adjusting their drug use, however grudgingly. Otherspersist in risking a urine positive, relying on one or anotherevasion techniques to minimize their risks. Relatively few areactually caught: airlines report fewer than 1% of employees testurine positive. (20) Included are an unfortunate number of veryoccasional users: NORML has heard from more than one flightattendant dismissed for indulging a rare joint with an oldfriend. Many workers report turning to alcohol as asubstitute for marijuana. "I'm drinking a lot morenow," says one trucker, echoing a common complaint of manydrug-tested workers who say they use pot to control alcoholism.Other drug-tested workers report widespread alcohol abuse amongtheir fellows: "You see guys stumbling in here drunk fromthe management on down," says a Customs employee,"There are guys drinking alcohol first thing in themorning." Another employee told NORML that workers at hisjob had started smoking heroin instead of pot. Meanwhile, in themilitary, LSD is said to have become the illicit drug of choicedue to its relative undetectability. (21) It is tempting tospeculated that recent reports of a parallel upsurge in alcoholand LSD use among young persons reflect a broader social trendcreated by the incentives of drug urinalysis. (22) URINALYSIS: "ON-CAUSE" OR NO CAUSE? In many workplaces, employees are subject to"on-cause" testing whenever they have an accident.While such testing might seem unobjectionable, it is often abusedso as to inculpate innocent workers. For instance, a dieselmechanic told NORML that he had been ordered to take a urine testfollowing a minor workplace accident on a Friday, and that hisdrug test was scheduled for Monday, three days after theaccident. The worker was rightly concerned that he might be firedbecause he had recently smoked marijuana at home. Ironically,however, three days would have been ample time to pass the testhad he actually been under the influence of any otherdrug--cocaine, heroin, alcohol or speed--at the time of theaccident! In another case, a woman reported that herhusband, a print shop worker with eight years' seniority, hadflunked a drug test for marijuana after receiving a minor fingercut in an accident caused by another worker. Not only was herhusband fired for an accident that wasn't his fault, but thefamily also lost health insurance coverage for their son, who hadserious medical problems costing $1200 per month. Like otherurine testing victims, the woman charged that the company hadfinancial motivations to fire her husband, namely the family'sinsurance costs. Urinalysis abuse is a phenomenon that extendsbeyond the job market. For instance, some insurance companiesrequire drug urinalysis as part of their physical exams.Applicants are routinely denied insurance if they are found touse marijuana, despite the fact that there is not an iota ofactuarial evidence showing marijuana adversely affects lifeexpectancy. Urinalysis has also come to figure in custodybattles between estranged couples. One husband told CaliforniaNORML that he had been directed by a court to submit tourinalysis after his wife had accused him of being a marijuanasmoker, a condition widely presumed to compromise parentalfitness. He complained that he was given no time to prepare forthe test, despite the fact that his wife, who had demanded thetest, had three weeks to prepare a clean sample of her own. Another arena where urinalysis is widely abusedis the prison system, where it is often imposed indiscriminatelyas a condition of probation or parole. As a result, manynon-violent offenders face substantial prison time for simplysmoking a joint. For instance, a California woman with a longhistory of medical marijuana use for migraines was sentenced to 8months in jail on charges of marijuana transportation. The judgeexplained that he could not give her a suspended sentence becausein that case she would be subject to drug testing, which shewould almost certainly fail, thereby ending up with a substantialsentence. Drug use violations have been reported to constitute45% of all parole violations in California, which in turn accountfor nearly half of all prison admissions. (23) The use ofmarijuana screening appears especially dubious in light of thefact that marijuana tends to suppress violence, whereas thenearest substitute, alcohol, tends to aggravate it. California NORML has heard from several medicalmarijuana patients with drug testing problems. "Pot makes mefeel better," complains a government worker with psoriaticarthritis, "I can't take alcohol." Other patients arethreatened with drug testing programs following convictions formarijuana offenses. Although marijuana is not an approvedmedication, patients may be able to pass urinalysis by obtaininga prescription for Marinol, the government-approved syntheticmarijuana substitute. Since Marinol reacts exactly likemarijuana, patients could presumably obtain a medical exemptionfor a positive urine test. Unfortunately, however, prescriptionsfor Marinol are not easy to come by and federal regulationsforbid its use outside of cancer chemotherapy. One common concern about drug testing is thedanger of "false positives," in which subjects areerroneously accused of drug use. Contrary to rumor, neitherpassive smoking nor drug interactions are likely to cause falsemarijuana positives. Only in the most unlikely conditions, suchas sitting for hours on end in a closet full of heavy potsmokers, has passive smoking been shown to produce a level ofurine metabolites high enough to be detected on the standart EMITtest. (24) Likewise, no drug is known to cause a false positivefor marijuana, but certain over-the-counter medicines can triggerthe test for amphetamines and poppy seeds can be confused withopiates (it used to be that ibuprofen interfered somewhat withmarijuana tests, but this problem has been fixed). (25) Suchproblems are supposed to be sorted out by medical reviewofficers, the reliability of whom can only be speculated on.However, NORML has not heard any complaints about false positivesfrom drug interactions. The important question remains whether falsepositives may be caused by lab error. Early surveys of drugtesting labs reported remarkably high error rates. However,industry and government have taken steps to insure against falsepositives for the sake of public credibility and liability. Byrequiring accurate gas chromatograph confirmation tests ofpositive samples and regulating the chain of custody, selectedlabs have demonstrated false positive rates as low as zero in10,000 -- 48,000 samples in proficiency tests (false negatives,in which drug use is not detected, run around 3%) (26)Nonetheless, given the profusion of unregulated labs, highererror rates may well be common. It should be noted that even iffalse positives occur in as few as one in 100,000 tests, hundredsof Americans per year can expect to be falsely branded as illicitdrug users. California NORML has heard from three or fourpersons claiming to be victims of "false positives" formarijuana. Claims of this kind are by nature suspicious anddifficult to verify. On one occasion, however, I personallyobserved what appeared to be a serious lapse of security in alocal clinic that administers drug tests to probationers forlocal corrections authorities. I had come there to have someexperimental specimens tested, and was told to place them on ashelf. While I waited for an attendant to record and label thesamples, a nurse came in and deposited another unlabeled specimenjar on the shelf next to mine. Had I not brought the situation tothe attendant's attention, it would have been child's play toswitch and mislabel the samples by error or mischief. UROMANCY: AN OBSOLESCENT TECHNOLOGY? The full toll of drug urine victims has yet tobe scientifically investigated. Nothing is known about the numberof false positives, nor the number of responsible workersdisqualified for urine positives, nor the costs to theirfamilies, the economy, and welfare roles, nor the extent to whichdrug urinalysis has aggravated abuse of alcohol, tobacco andother untested drugs. As for the purported benefits of testing,these too are unclear. Given the potential for drug substitution,however, it may be doubted whether they will prove significant.Indeed, a pair of recent studies suggest that the recent declinein marijuana use has led to an increase in drug-abuse emergenciesand auto fatalities due to alcohol and other drugs. (27)Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics lhas reported a jump injob-related sickness and injuries to a record 6.8 million in1990, or 8.8 out of 100 workers, the highest rate since 1979,before drug testing began! All of this raises obvious questionsabout the purported benefits of drug urinalysis. Insofar as theevidence for drug testing rests more on faith than science, itmight aptly be called "uromancy." The case for drug urinalysis is furtherundermined by the fact that there exist alternative means fordetecting impairment. Most promising of these are performancetests, which measure reaction time, alertness, and agility atvarious tasks. Computer-based performance tests are now on themarket and have started to be used in some workplaces. (28)Performance tests have the obvious advantage of measuring actualimpairment, regardless of the cause. Unlike urinalysis, they candetect problems caused by alcohol and other, untested drugs, aswell as stress, fatigue, and emotional distress. In addition,they have the important advantage of disregarding privatebehavior that is irrelevant to job performance. Another, often ignored alternative tourinalysis is blood testing. Although blood tests are even morephysically invasive than urine tests, they provide a much betterindication of current impairment, since they detect the activepresence of psychoactive drugs in the system rather than inactiveurinemetabolites. Because blood tests are less sensitive tobehaviorally irrelevant, past drug use than urine tests, they arecommonly used in forensic studies of accident victimes todetermine whether the subject was under the influence of drugs.Unfortunately, blood tests are at best an imperfect indicator ofintoxication for drugs other than alcohol, and it is impossibleto determine fixed thresholds for impairment. In the case ofmarijuana, THC blood levels decline quite rapidly to negligiblelevels in as little as two hours for occasional lusers, althoughchronic users can manifest detectable levels for a couple ofdays. Blood tests may therefore offer a useful way for occasionaldrug users to establish their innocence of being under theinfluence. The case can be made that any worker accused ofon-the-job drug abuse should have the option of taking a blood orimpairment test to prove his or her competence (in California,motorists accused of driving under the influence of drugs havethe option of blood or urine tests; unfortunately, few if anydrivers understand the dramatic differences in sensitivit;ybetween the two). Another, more sinister alternative tourinalysis is hair testing, which is even more sensitive to pastdrug use than urinalysis. Promoters claim to detect drug use formonths and even years, far longer than any pharmacological impacton health. Despite the fact that hair testing has unresolvedtechnical problems and is considered to be an unproven technologyby the scientific community, (29) it is already being marketedand used by some private employers and has been boosted byfederal officials like Drug Czars William Bennett and BobMartinez. The one advantage of hair testing is that is is lessinvasive of bodily privacy than blood or urine testing, althoughsome persons, such as those of the Sikh religion, object tohaving their hair disturbed. However, because hair testing isalso much more indiscriminate than other technologies indistinguishing harmless drug use from abuse, it poses enengreater potential costs to society, the economy, and civilliberties. The choice betwee hair testing and performancetesting marks a crucial crossroads for the nation's drug policy.While the outcome remains to be seen, there are good reasons tothink that urine and hair testing will eventually be rejected forall but forensic purposes, given their basic inability to measurecompetence. Drug urine testing is perhaps best understood as atool for imposing social conformity that has aptly been describedas "chemical McCarthyism." (30) Like the loyalty oathof the fifties, urinalysis seeks to impose "politicallycorrect" attitudes in the workforce. As drugs have replacedCommunism as domestic enemy number one, so the question,"Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communistparty?" has been replaced by, "Are you now or have youbeen the user of a controlled substance?" When the currentanti-drug hysteria subsides, the absurdity of this question willbecome apparent. Technologically, drug urine testing can best becompared to that other tool of McCarthyism, the polygraph. Likethe polygraph, drug testing rests on the spurious premise thatthe human mind can be read via crude physiological measures. Likethe polygraph, drug testing is inherently misleading andendangers innocent parties. Time has revealed the polygraph to bean essentially flawed technology, and it has now been outlawedfor most purposes (ironically, by the very same Congress thateagerly embraced random urinalysis). In the fullness of time, itcan be expected that the same will happen to drug urinalysis. Asthe costs of drug testing are examined more closely, it is apt tobe seen that human beings are best judged by their perormance,not the chemicals in their urine.

Kenney, Ph.D. The University ofMemphis Memphis, Tennessee, USA 38152 gkenney@memphis.edu December, 1996 INTRODUCTION The use of psychoactive substances has beencited by drug enforcement officials as a cause of criminalbehavior. Apart from the manufacture, sale, and/or delivery ofillicit substances, substance *use* has been regarded as aprimary precipitant of criminal behavior, especially violentbehavior (e.g., Drug Enforcement Administration, 1994). To date,however, it seems that such assertions have been based onanecdotal evidence, with little, if any, empirical support. Evendata from the federal government fails to support such a link.For example, during 9 contemporaneous reporting periods between1972 and 1990, the correlations between adolescent (ages 17 andyounger) violent, property, and overall crime rates and meanadolescent (ages 12-17) usage rates for 10 substances (both licitand illicit) were .09, .27, and .20, respectively (Federal Bureauof Investigation, 1972-90; National Institute on Drug Abuse,1991). These correlations can hardly be viewed as suggestive ofany meaningful relationships between crime and substance use.Such evidence, however, is circumstantial. Other indicators areneeded to establish any real relationship, whether large orsmall, between crime and drug use. The purpose of this study was to excavate thebody of recent scholarly research in this domain for any evidenceconcerning the role of substance use in criminal acts perpetuatedby adolescents and to summarize these findings usingmeta-analysis (Wolf, 1986). METHOD & PROCEDURES Scholarly research products of a primary naturewere gleaned from social science databases (includingDissertation Abstracts International, Educational ResourcesInformation Clearinghouse, PsycLit, and metropolitan Memphis,Tennessee, book holdings). The search was limited to studiesconcerning adolescent criminology reported between 1981 and 1995. Resultant inferential statistics from eachstudy pertaining to general delinquency, reoffense, and/orviolence as each related to substance use were converted toeffect sizes in the form of r using Wolf's (1986) formulae. The rstatistic, here used as an effect size, remains essentially acorrelation coefficient which ranges from -1.0 to +1.0, where-1.0 constitutes a perfect negative relationship, +1.0constitutes a perfect positive relationship, and 0.0 constitutesabsolutely no relationship. A squared correlation coefficient(r^2) represents the percentage of shared variance among thevariables in question. RESULTS Fifteen (15) primary research studies werefound which met the aforementioned criteria (see Table 1). Ofthese, 13 were conducted in 10 states in the United States, and 2were conducted in Canada. There were 6 research articles fromrefereed journals, 6 dissertations/theses, 2 unpublishedconference research presentations, and 1 unpublished researchreport. A total of 3,583 adolescent offenders were involved inthese 15 studies. The mean unweighted r for the relationshipbetween adolescent crime and substance use was .22 (df = 13, notsignificant), with a median of .17, and a range of .00 to .68.The amount of shared variance between overall adolescent crimeand substance use was about 5%. The strength of these effect sizeestimates was considered low. Only 4 of the studies investigated therelationship between adolescent violent crime and substance use(total number of offenders studied was 834). The mean unweightedr for these studies was .10 (df = 13, not significant), with amedian of .08, and a range of .07 to .15. The amount of sharedvariance between violent adolescent crime and substance use was1%. These effect size estimates were considered very low.

Studies listedchronologically. Two-letter locale codes refer to states in theUSA. No discernible temporal pattern was observed.Overall, the correlation between year of study and effect sizeestimate was .02 (df = 13, not significant), which was consideredvery low. Among 7 studies conducted in the"north" (i.e., Canada, Idaho, Iowa, Massachusetts, andWashington) the mean unweighted effect size was .23 (df = 5, notsignificant), with a median of .25, and a range of .00 to 55.This effect size was considered low. Among 8 studies conducted inthe "south" (i.e., Florida, Georgia, Maryland,Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia) the mean unweighted effect sizewas .22 (df = 6, not significant), with a median of .16, and arange of .00 to .68. This effect size was considered low. Theeffect sizes based on geography were not considered to besubstantially different. Gender, ethnocultural heritage, propertycrimes, and particular substances used were not evaluated becausethese variables were seldom noted in more than a few of theselected studies. CONCLUSIONS The relationship between adolescentcrime and substance use was found to be small. Overall, substanceuse accounted for only about 5% of the variance associated withoverall adolescent criminal behavior, and less than 1% of thevariance associated with adolescent violent behavior. Thesefindings were remarkably similar to those involving federalgovernment data noted earlier. Neither temporal nor geographicpatterns were observed concerning the effect size estimatesreported in the 15 studies. Therefore, assertions about the precipitousrole of substance use in adolescent crime do not appear to besupported by the body of recent scholarly research in this area.Similar investigations concerning adult crime and substance useare warranted before any definite conclusions may be reachedabout this controversial issue. It is clear, however, thatadolescent substance use, though a crime in and of itself, is notfundamentally related to broader indices of adolescent crime. REFERENCES Anderson, D. G. (1991).

Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Miscellaneous Statements on DrugPolicy 1994 American Management Survey on workplacedrug testing. The following is taken from the 1994 AmericanManagement Survey on workplace drug testing. (Unpublished) The survey responses are for January 1994 andrepresent the American Management Association (AMA's) corporatemembership of 7000 U.S. organizations, which employ in total aquarter of the American workforce. According to the survey. . . . The percentage of companies that drug testemployees rose from 84.8 % (January 1993) to 87.2% (January 1994)This represents an increase of over 300% since 1987. Business category is the most important factorin the occurrence of testing programs. The two categories mostlikely to test are manufacturing firms (93%) and transportationcompanies (92%). Size also plays a role -- 91% of organizationswith more than 1000 employees test, though smaller ones aren'tfar behind (81%). Geographically, there are fairly substantialvariations too: companies in the desert and mountain states ofthe West are the most likely to test (91%), while companies inNew England are the least likely (68%). 53% of companies that test do so undergovernment mandate. The test-positive rate, which had fallensteadily since 1989, levelled in 1993, at 2.5%. The AMAattributes this not to lesser use, but to the fact thattest-positives rates fell consistently only as the testing poolincreased -- the levelling in 1993 and 1994 reflects thelevelling in the growth of testing programs. There is a direct correlation between theincrease in testing and the decrease in test-positive rates.According to the AMA, this is not because testing acts as adeterrent to drug use, but rather because as more employees arebeing tested for reasons other than suspicion of use, thetest-positive rate would naturally fall. Among companies that perform random testing,the 1993 test-positive rate was 2.1%. Among those companies thattest only for cause, the rate was 11.1%. Companies that offer drug education programs aswell as testing have lower test-positive rates than those thatprovide only testing. Only 5% of companies neither test employees noroffer drug education programs. Action on test-positive employees: 31% ofcompanies dismiss test-positives, and more than half of theseoffer no other alternative. The rest regard firing as a lastresort, after counselling and disciplinary actions have beentrlied. 68% of companies test new hires. Tests arerarely given as part of the application process per se; insteadtesting occurs when the applicant has already been offered thejob. The offer is then conditional on the applicant passing thetest. 1% of companies that test new hires will hiretest-positives on a probationary basis; 95% specifically statethat test-positives will not be hired, the rest take otheractions, such as retesting at a later date. METHODS -- 82.1% use urine testing. 12.9% useblood testing. 1.1% use hair testing. 0.9% use performancetesting. Of those who use urine testing, only 70% retestan initial positive with a more rigorous, confirmatory test. 13%repeat the same procedure on the same sample. 5% take and test anew sample. 7% perform no validation. Only 79% of those that urine test useNIDA-certified labs. Only 48% use a medical review officer (MRO)to analyze test findings, judge them against the testee's medicalhistory, and render a verdict. Only 6% of firms that test pay lower insurancepremiums because of their programs. "It may seem reasonable to assume thatdrug testing has a deterrent effect on drug use. . . . However,no finding of this eight-year AMA survey effort can confirm as astatistical certainty that testing does in fact deter use. . . .Testing cannot and should not be expected to take the place ofgood supervision. The American Management Association hasconsistently advised that. . . . Actions regarding employeediscipline be performance-based."

Last summer it became apparentthat many peole were cheating by adding solutions of concentratedglutaraldehyde (Urinaid) to their voided sample. New data,presented in February at the annual meeting of the AmericanAcademy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS), suggests that there is asimpler way to foil urine screening tests: drink lots of water. Dr. Edward Cone of the Addiction ResearchCenter (ARC) in Baltimore, described the results of a study hehad undertaken at the request of Donna Smith, Acting Director ofthe Department of Transportation's (DOT) Office of DrugEnforcement. Smith was concerned that advertising claims for someherbal teas and "internal cleansing" agents mightactually be true. Cone was at first skeptical, but, as hereported at the AAFS meeting, the study was a"sleeper." Cone set up a series of experiments designed toassess the effect of various measures on "in vivoadulteration." Two of the most popular "teas" werechosen for study; Naturally Klean Herbal Tea" and"Golden Seal" root capsules. Healthy drug-freevolunteers with a history of recent drug use were recruited forthe study. They were housed in a closed ward for six weeks. Theparticipants were tested under a number of different protocolsduring that six week period. At 9:00 AM on the morning of Day One the studysubjects smoked a standardized marijuana cigarette (3.58% THC).On Day Three they snorted 40 mg of cocaine. Twenty three hoursafter each drug was given, they drank one of the followingcombinations: (1) "Naturally Klean Herbal Tea" in onegallon of water, (2) one gallon of water without any"cleansing agent" (3) one gallon of water with 50 mg ofhydrochlorothiadize (a diuretic), (4) four "GoldenSeal" capsules and one gallon of water, or (5) twelve ouncesof water. Each participant was tested under each protocol and allof the urine was collected. The urine specimens were then tested by EMIT IIassay for cannabinoids at a 50 ng / ml cutoff, and cocaine at a300 ng / ml cutoff. Specific gravity and creatinine content wasmeasured for each sample, and the two indicators were found toco-vary almost identically. Just drinking 12 ounces of water wasenough to cause a significant decrease in both specific gravityand creatinine, but not enough to cause a negative test response.For example, urine cannabinoids levels which were higher than10,000 ng / ml dropped to the low 100's after drinking 12 ouncesof water. After drinking a gallon of water, with or without oneof the "cleansing agents" added, it only took an hourfor the specific gravity to drop to less than 1.005. When one gallon of water was drunk, not onlydid specific gravity fall to very low levels (creatinine<20,and specific gravity <1.003), but the marijuana assay turnednegative and stayed that way, even after specific gravity levelshad returned to normal! The cocaine tests turned negative for afew hours, but then turned positive again. The same results wereobserved whether or not tea was used, however, when diureticswere given, the test for both cannabinoids and cocaine turnednegative and stayed that way. Cone concluded that "drug test outcome ishighly susceptible to water dilution; and the effects of dilutionare reflected concurrently in creatinine and specific gravitymeasures." COMMENT: This observation will cause someconsternation in the drug testing community, and create moreproblems than glutaraldehyde and Urinaid adulteration did. It isnot that difficult to develop detection strategies for chemicalslike glutaraldehyde. That may explain why the practice is alreadystarting to disappear, but setting standards for dilution will bemuch more difficult. Eventually, it may be necessary to measuredrug / creatinine ratios to rule out dilution. Since tests mayremain negative even after the specific gravity returns towardnormal, it appears that low specific gravities cannot be reliedupn to reveal "adulterated" specimens.

Schaffer recently.Clifford Schaffer is the co-author of the Resolution for aFederal Commission on Drug Policy, the now famous HooverResolution that seeks to end the violence caused by the infamouswar on drugs. I long ago realized that a shooting war waged against amedical condition is inappropriate. I have never reallyunderstood why it is that so many individuals in the governmentcould have chosen such an ill-advised and disastrous course, andperhaps I never will understand. But Mr. Schaffer tells me thatthe situation is worse than I had imagined. I should say at the outset that I learned that CliffordSchaffer is the man who coined that most quotable of quotes,"More Colombians die from American tobacco than the numberof Americans who die from Colombian cocaine." I have foundthis particular fact a sobering notion to ponder and haverepeated it, even on this program. Now that I know the source, heshould get credit. His letter contained many such startling factsabout the bloody and unjust "war against drugs" --facts that made me stop and wonder why we continue to fight it.Mr. Schaffer tells me that in six short years, in the year 2000,the United States of America will have a prison population biggerthan all the Nazi concentration camps put together. Let's put this projection into perspective. Mr. Schaffer says,"Right now we have about 1.3 million people in prison. Morethan 600,000 of them are there for non-violent drug offenses. Forevery person who died from illegal drugs last year, 150 peoplewent to prison. Most of them were black men." The expense of maintaining a prison population is staggering.If nearly half of them don't belong there, then something isterribly wrong. As the drug war escalates, more prisoners will be taken andmore dead and wounded will litter our streets. Remember, by theyear 2000 we will have more prisoners than all the Naziconcentration camps combined. Mr. Schaffer's prediction seemsalmost incredible, but one look down the street will convincealmost anybody that America is a dangerous place. Many foreigngovernments routinely issue warnings to their traveling citizensthat America is a dangerous place. We are, after all, at war. Drug warriors justify their war against the American people byclaiming that certain illegal drugs are killing our children,killing adults, and generally ruining our society. But look atthe figures on drugs and death. In a typical year, theapproximate number of people who die from taking cocaine hoversaround 2,500 people. Heroin deaths are less than that, at about2,000. To give some perspective to these numbers, it's useful tobear in mind that 2,000 people die every year from takingaspirin, too. Aspirin can cause catastrophic intestinal bleedingand death. And can be easily used to that effect, legally, bysuicides. Tobacco which, so far, is still a legal drug, kills around400,000 people every year. The government supports tobaccoproduction, and helps to sell American tobacco products aroundthe world. Another 50,000 people die from sidestream tobaccosmoke. These deaths occur in people who don't smoke at all; theyjust happen to inhale other people's smoke. Ironically, tobaccois considered such an acceptable drug that, according to PeterMcWilliams, four major tobacco companies (in other words, drugdealers) became "partners" in the anti-drug groupPartnership for a Drug-Free America. Every year, approximately 10,000 people die from prescriptiondrugs. Some of these deaths are due to miscalculatedself-medication; others are due to interaction with existingmedical conditions (or with other drugs) that were unforeseen orignored by the prescribing physician; and I'd guess that some ofthese deaths were intentional suicides too. The total number of deaths due to all the illegal drugscombined is about 4,500 people. Now compare 4,500 deaths with thenumber of deaths due to prescription drugs, alcohol (which isabout 80,000 people), tobacco, over-the-counter aspirin, andsidestream smoke. The total number of deaths due to these legaldrugs is well over 500,000 people -- every year. Themulti-billion dollar drug war ignores the half-a-million deathsdue to legal drugs and instead makes the illogical claim that4,500 deaths due to illegal drugs justifies a multi-billiondollar shooting war. So far, I have not mentioned marijuana. Marijuana is illegaland tens of thousands of non-violent people are in prison becauseof it. There are no deaths attributed to marijuana use. Nobodydies. In fact, Mr. Schaffer tells us that "Even the DEAitself says that there has not been a recorded death due tomarijuana in the history of the United States." Apparently, millions of Americans continue to smoke marijuanaregardless of the law and regardless of the war waged againstthem. Neither prohibitive law nor official brutality seems tohave it's intended effect. There is something else about marijuana which grabs ourattention. Marijuana is also a pharmaceutical drug that hasestablished therapeutic use in a variety of medical conditions.But, since it is caught up in the hysteria of the drug war,doctors are prohibited from conducting research on marijuana andpatients are deprived of its benefits. A recently published book called Marihuana, the ForbiddenMedicine tells all. The authors of this book are Lester Grinspoonand James Bakalar. Dr. Grinspoon is a medical doctor and anassociate professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School.Mr. Bakalar is an associate editor of the Harvard Mental HealthLetter and a lecturer in law in the Department of Psychiatry atHarvard. The authors record a surprising number of therapeutic uses formarijuana -- the list considers more than twenty years ofresearch. Marijuana counteracts the violent effects ofchemotherapy used in cancer treatment --- and to those who saythat marijuana must be bad because it is smoked and smoking isbad, Dr. Grinspoon points out that the more powerful strains ofmarijuana found today actually require less smoking to obtaintherapeutic levels. Patients consistently report that syntheticversions do not work. The pressure on the eyes resulting from glaucoma is relievedwith marihuana use. The amelioration of other conditions, too,are on record; and conditions that include epilepsy, multiplesclerosis, paraplegia and quadriplegia; AIDS; chronic pain;migraine; pruritis; menstrual cramps and labor pain; and evendepression and other mood disorders. It makes you stop and think. Here is a weed, growing wild thatmillions use whether there is a law against it or not. It killsno one. It has been in continuous use for about 5,000 years thatwe know of, and it has recognized medical applications. And yetthe government is waging a deadly and expensive war against it. This mystery deepens considerably when we learn that thegovernment sits on an impressive pile of studies that recommendthe decriminalization of, not only marijuana, but of severalother drugs as well. In 1944, there was the LaGuardia Committee Report; in 1967there was the Baroness Wootton Report published by the governmentof Great Britain. In 1969, the Canadian government published theReport of the Canadian Government Commission of Inquiry into theNon-Medical Use of Drugs. In 1972, there was Dealing with DrugAbuse: A Report to the Ford Foundation. Also in 1972 theConsumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs came out. In 1973, the US Federal Government itself published the Reportof the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse. In 1980,the United States Drug Abuse Council published The Facts AboutDrug Abuse. In 9182 there was An Analysis of Marijuana Policy andmost recently, the state of California's study titled, The Reportof the California State Research Advisory Panel. All of these official studies urge decriminalization. The alsoadd the sensible caution that all drugs are dangerous drugs. Manydrug war proponents are aware of these studies but mysteriously,they continue a reign of bloodshed in spite of the evidence. Theycontinue to panic the nation with myths and half truths aboutdrug use. Based on fictions, and fallacies, the drug warriorsextract billions of dollars from the public treasury and ruin thelives of people who, in many cases, are already in ruinouscondition and need medical attention. At the beginning of their book, Dr. Grinspoon and Mr. Bakalarquote another, earlier Harvard professor, Alfred North Whitehead.Whitehead said, "The rejection of any source of evidence isalways treason to that ultimate rationalism which urges forwardscience and philosophy alike." Many Americans are in step with this sentiment and condemnthose people who champion violence and drug hysteria ascommitting precisely this kind of treason. The evidence thaturges use to decriminalize drugs and stop the violence isplentiful. I find it hard to imagine that the drug warriors are really sodull-witted that they cannot grasp this evidence or that theycannot grasp the findings of their peers. In fact, it is entirelypossible that some of them actually do grasp the facts anddishonestly argue against them. But why would anyone do that? Dr. Grinspoon and Mr. Bakalar make a fascinating suggestion asto why this could be true. They say, "Attitudes towardminorities, work, worldly success and failure, sex and familylife may be the real issues in the controversy about drugs. Drugsare symbols charged with cultural tension. Repressed anxietiesmay be displaced onto drug users as a form of scapegoating." The authors point out that "We do not fine or jail thepatients of someone who practices medicine without a license, orthe customers of a manufacturer who disobeys consumer protectionlaws, yet mere possession of cannabis and other illicitpsychoactive drugs is a Federal crime. The metaphor of war israrely invoked in the name of consumer protection but constantlyused in the assault on psychoactive drugs. The reason is thatlaws controlling these drugs are ultimately aimed not at consumerprotection but at containing what is believed to be a threat tothe social fabric and moral order." But, in light of all the government studies, and the growingnumber of Americans who have signed the Hoover Institution'sResolution for a Federal Commission on Drug Policy, it is rightto wonder if the drug soldiers themselves might not have fallenover on the wrong side of the moral fence.

(1991) "There are two aspects to phencyclidine (PCP)intoxication that have warranted particular attention by thegeneral public, as well as by law-enforcement and clinicalpersonnel. Both aspects concern the relationship betweenphencyclidine abuse and aggressive behavior. There are reports ofincreased aggressiveness and 'super-human' strength that developin some people who take phencyclidine. Recent studies, including those of men arrested for criminalactivity in Washington D.C. and New York City (Wish 1986) andevaluations of published clinical reports of phencyclidineintoxication (Brecher et al. 1988), indicate that ifphencyclidine induces violent, criminal behavior, it does so onlyextremely infrequently. Although Wish (1986) noted that most men who had urinespositive for phencyclidine were younger than those who had takenno drugs or other drugs, their crimes were likely to be lessaggressive than the crimes of those who had not takenphencyclidine. Khajawall et al. (1982) found no difference in the behavior ofclients admitted for phencyclidine detoxification and thoseadmitted for opioid detoxification. Thus, phencylidine-inducedaggression appears to be a rare phenomenon, if it occurs atall." cited references: Wish, E.D.

The largest cash crop of California, Oregon andHawaii and second nationally behind corn. One plant costs $200 togrow, worth up to $2500. 25% is grown in US national forests, often booby-trapped. In 1975 worth $400 per pound, now $3500 perpound. In Ohio in 1987 25% of plants confiscated, about 255000 plants left or $540 million. Hashish...made in Pakistan/Afganistan and imported.Deteriorates at about 10% per month. Hash Oil is the concentrated form which is put on a cigaretteto double the potency. PHARMACOLOGY More carcinogens than tobacco. More lung irritation thantobacco. More number of carcinogens than tobacco. If ingested has erratic absorption and is deactivated in the liver like narcotics are...thus less potent but longer high. If smoked, about 100% of the THC is absorbed into the pulmonary system and then into the fatty system ie. brain, testicles and ovaries, heart. See reddened eyes and increased heart rate due to THC. ANIMAL STUDIES THC attaches to the cerebellum, spinal cord and hippocampus. Hippocampus is responsible for short term memory. If removed-- global amnesia. THC in rats causes brain cell death. Monkey studies...smoke 5 days/week x 1 year then free x 1 year caused profound lack of interest in learning and nomemory. Same experiment smoking weekend only caused moderade damageand loss of memory. These were permanent changes. Does it do this in humans? Our current users will be the guinea pigs for this experiment. Scientists expect the answerto be yes. EFFECTS IN HUMANS Affects behavioural mood and memory functions. Decreasescerebral blood flow while smoking. Of students failing or leaving school, 1/25 were not pot users, 3/5 of students regularly smoking pot failed. Flight simulator and pilors after 1 cigarette...each pilot did significantly worse with one pilot missing the runway. Significantly, all pilots thought they were doing very well. The single greatest risk factor for cocaine abuse is marijuana use before age 15. AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME 1. Loss of interest, apathy, desire to work 2. Fatigue, loss of energy/tiredness 3. Depression/attacks of rage when provoked 4. Slovenliness in habits and appearance For chronic users, clearly has been shown that memory testsand auditory and visual retention tests were poorly done evenafter 6 weeks of sobriety. In a study of alcohol/pot related accidents, suggested pot maybe responsible for more accidents than alcohol (due to impaired judgement etc) In a number of cases, heavy use 4-5x a week up to 15cigarettes per cay caused amnesia for the first 7-8 days of sobriety. Amnesia was not recognized by the user. Sheba=PCP added. Smells like embalming fluid Few drops of vinegar in urine will give negative marijuanatest Drug screen 50-75 level CANNOT BE PASSIVE. No false positives.It is like a fingerprint. In a job screen should always do a confirmation titer if a screen is positive. CHEMICALS IN MARIJUANA 421 chemicals. 65 are different cannabinols which are psychoactive (delta-nine most) Others include non-cannabinols such as toxins, carcinogens (such as tar, just like the tar onthe road) and inactive or potentiating agents Alcohol takes 6-8 hours to get out of body THC is fat-soluble, and 50% will be in the body 1-2 weekslater. May take up to 4 months to get all out. Heavy use for 6-12months will give positive drug screen 4-6 weeks later. A chronic pot user is raraly sober. Subclinical intoxication. 2-3 times a week sufficient for this. Level released from fat as acute level drops. Stored in all fat and also in the basic building cells of the body. Damage is DOSE RELATED. Depends on frequency and on concentration. The more mature the person the less permanent damage. Symptoms are insidious and subtle and can parallel adolescent adjustment symptoms. THC exaggerates thesesymptoms, makes them more profound and often permanent. Saturation inthe brain causes memory impairment, concentration impairment and motivation impairment. Can be a major personality change. Asthe brain level decreased THC moves from other body fat to thebrain to keep the brain saturated. Can actually prevent thecognitive changes needed for an adolescent to change to an adult,leaving him/her with poor social judgement, poor attention span,confusion and anxiety and loss of train of thought. Occasionallyproduces hyperactive/aggressive/agitated person instead of apathy. This damage can occur in MONTHS rather than years. ALL USERS REGARDLESS OF AGE AND ABILITY HAVE DECREASED ABILITY INCOMPARISON TO THEIR POTENTIAL ABILITY. Regression to immaturity can occur and can be irreversible. A teenager can develop, for example,a mental age of 11 and thus not be able to complete school work causing a dropout from school. Pot more potent than in past years, age of onset much earlier and thus the profile of a marijuana user is changing. a) much higher suicidal ideation and depression b) 1/3 show borderline schizophrenia traits with disorganized thought patterns. c) Paranoia increasing d) Lots of similarities to a senile adult. Difference in time perception (10 minutes seems like 1 hour). Erratic junk foods. Poor judgement. Cannot self-correct. Much like Altzheimer's disease. e) As use continues with subacute intoxication, decreasing cognitive ability, decline in emotional life, much increase in stubbornness. More fatigue, decreased ability to do complex tasks, no self-insight, no idea of time and dates, impairedshort- term meory and occasionally long-term as well. With Moderatedose get profound gross impairment of motor skills. (See how muchlike brain-damaged adult?) With high dose can get hallucinations. Feel that THC may be the cause of massive adolescentpsychiatric problems. MUCH PROOF HERE and much refusal of the user to take this information seriously...still relying on the informationfrom the 1960s that THC was not harmful. User does not wish to look the data straight in the eyes. Major driving impairments..."behavioural toxicity".The stoned person does not perceive the dangers. He can brieflyhide the influence and pay attention but easily loses focus. Coming down from a high may be the worst for motor skills.Occasionally get a triggered unexpected after-high. 39% more likely to have a driving accident if smoke THC and drive. Reckless driving, failure to yield, failure to stop. How to tell if the memory/behavior is THC? STOP for two months and see if symptoms go away. MARIJUANA ADDICT 1. First stage is exposure. 2. Second stage...the person learns the mood swing, starts touse it as a drug and seek it and plan for its use = second stageof addiction. 3. Third stage..user becomes preoccupied with the mood swing. Develops tolerance. May use 3-4 x per day up to 15 per day =much increased tolerance. Develops a preoccupied with chemical dependence life style. 4. In the fourth stage the addict is using the drug to beNORMAL. Uses first in the AM, last at night, using it just tofunction. *Stages three and four...the patient usually cannot stop onhis own but needs a formal treatment program. For those who have smoked more than 1000x in three or fouryears: 70-80% have tried cocaine 1/3 have tried heroin Only 0-1% of heroin users never smoked pot. The percentage of use of cocaine is directly related to the frequency of use of pot. In stage four with increased tolerance the addict uses more of the higher grade THC, starts mixing drugs, seeks out moreheavy using friends. The addict is very seriously disabled withsocial and psychological disabilities, panic attacks, nausea et.c Ego deterioration develops (with the denial that the drug causesthe problem, it follows that the person himself must be causingthe problem. This brings out guilt and shame which recycles to useof more drugs). See social and school deterioration, dropping off team, dropping hobbies. Finally psychotic-like fog in thinking. **This can last as long as two or more years after drugcessation. SYMPTOMS CHECKLIST FOR LEVEL OF ADDICTION Three predominant symptoms are a) progressive chemical use b) chemically oriented lifestyle c) increasing tolerance Parents should be aware...addicted teenager will use avoidance techniques, visine in eyes, frequently changes the room (moredrug oriented pictures etc) dropping grades. Often a strong family history of chemical dependency oralcohol dependency. Usage of THC not hereditary but the addiction development probably is. TREATMENT Marijuana is an isolator. Questions asked are "Where didyou get it" and "How can I get some". NOT a drugthat explores feelings. Feelings (mad glad sad) tend to be suppressed. Treatment must explore feelings and teach its vocabulary.Group therapy can help. Treatment must teach alternative ways to cope...how to handle a headache (user does not handle pain well...has avoided the feeling of pain in the past). Must set rules and limits. Must address the amotivational syndrome in the treatment program. Avoid the assignment to "read a book and write how totalk with people" but give the assignment to DO the behavior.Remember the immaturity and the age level caused by the drug whenmaking assignments. Treat the denial. "No big thing" is not true. Youhave school failures, family dysfunctions etc. Work with the twenty harmfuls to get to deal in reality. encourage that what is real within the group can occur outsideof the group as well.

The statements made about marijuana range from laughable toridiculous. None of them, that I can find, are supported by anykind of scientific evidence, except maybe for that stuff aboutthe red eyes. They even say that marijuana use causes weightloss! Curiously, they do not mention "the munchies." Readers are encouraged to write to the Lions Club at theaddress below and correct their misinformation by pointing tothese web pages. Marijuana is made from the leaves, small stems, and floweringtops of the Cannabis sativa plant. Marijuana, also called pot,grass, weed, is usually smoked in a loosely- rolled joint or in apipe. It has a sweet, lingering odor. Marijuana causes the user to experience a feeling ofwell-being---of detachment from ordinary circumstances. This"high" is usually followed by feelings of depression. Marijuana is not just one substance; it contains more than 400chemicals. The most widely known compund in this group iscommonly called THC (delta- 9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol). THC is the primary mind-altering ingredient in marijuana. Aportion of THC is absorbed into fatty tissue in the brain andreproductive organs, and in most other organs as well. It takesthe body at least 30 days to eliminate all effects of smoking onemarijuana joint. Marijuana is up to ten times more potent today than that whichwas produced in the 1960s. Some experts previously thought Marijuana to be harmless. Itis now known that the reasons users can stop smoking withoutfeeling severe withdrawal symptoms is because of the body'sstorage of THC. Effects of Marijuana on the body * Marijuana reduces brain energy, impairing the users' abilityto remember, feel, think, anticipate, and predict. * Because THC is stored in fatty tissues and works like atime-release capsule, regular marijuana smoking produces aconstant state of sedation. * Since THC remains in the center of motivation of the brain,it weakens the users' ability to live drug-free. * The lungs of marijuana smokers are highly susceptible toemphysema and bronchitis. * Research shows that marijuana contains cancer-causingagents. * Marijuana impairs normal sexual development in both malesand females. * Heartbeat rate increses by as much as 50% through marijuanause. Results are chest pains, and possible heart disease. * Regular use causes a decrease in the blood supply to theheart, and diminishes white cell production. * The body adjusts to regular use, making it essential toincrease the amount used in order to achieve a "high". * Continual marijuana use deteriorates the body's immunesystem. Symptoms of Marijuana use * Marked change in behavior patterns * Carelessness about personal appearance * Lack of motivation * Reduction of short-term memory * Excessive irritability * Red eyes and fatigue * Abrupt mood changes/outbursts of anger * Less concern for the feelings of others * Bouts of depression/paranoia * Inability to react quickly/decreased coordination * Inability to get along with family/co-workers/peers * Loss of weight * Sleeplessness [to go with the fatigue I suppose] * Short concentration-span * Highly susceptible to common infections * Expressionless speech/blank stares * Faulty perception (cannot accurately judge distances, speedor time) * Decreased academic or work performance Marijuana connection Some researchers have found a direct link between increasedmarijuana use, and --juvenile and young adult crime such as theft --truancy and school drop-out rate --psychiatric referrals of adolescents and young adults --cases of teenage chronic organic brain syndrome (burnout) Lions Drug Awareness Program Since its inception in 1984, the Lions Drug Awareness Programhas emphasized prevention through education. Lions are workingtogether to join families, educators, and other key leaders in aconcentrated effort to create drug-free communities. Lions' primary focus is Lions-Quest "Skills forAdolescence," and Lions-Quest "Skills forGrowing." These positive prevention curricula spanKindergarten through eighth grade, and are helping young peoplechoose healthy lifestyles.

YES, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE! BEER vs. ILLEGAL DRUGS ============================================================================== Beer is a legal beverage, which, |consumed in moderation, is consistent with a healthy lifestyle. In fact, a number of scientific studies have associated moderate beer consumption with healthy benefits, including a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease - an issue that deserves further study. On the other hand, marijuana, crack, cocaine, and heroin are illegal ubstances that are destructive to the user's health regardless of the frequency of use. Beer is produced by a legal, strictly regulated industry that employs hundreds of thousands of Americans, provides billions of dollars annually in state and federal taxes and directly contributes $44 billion to the American economy each year. Crack, cocaine and heroin are produced by a totally-unregulated industry that pays no taxes and makes no positive contribution to society or our economy. Beer is almost always consumed as a refreshment. Marijuana, crack, cocaine and heroin are used to radically alter the normal physical and emotional state. The vast majority of beer drinkers consume beer responsibly and moderately. There is no such thing as responsible or moderate use of marijuana, crack, cocaine amd heroin. Brewers spend literally millions of dollars annually sponsoring a variety of public education programs that promote responsible consumption of alcoholic beverages. These programs are working. On the other hand, the marijuana, crack, cocaine and heroin industry does everything in its power to promote illegal use, abuse, and addiction, particularly among our youth. The brewing industry continually funds educational programs designed to prevent underage persons from drinking and to teach them about the proper role of alcohol in our society. The illegal drug industry recruits children from schoolyards to be users children from schoolyards to be users and sellers. High school-age children are a primary target of drug dealers, whose objective is addiction. There is nothing inherently wrong with our product. Beer is awholesome beverage that can add to the quality of life whenconsumed in moderation, as intended. No one in the brewingindustry promotes abuse. We do everything in our power to ensurethat beer plays a positive role in our society and it is usedresponsibly. Beer: A Good Part of the Good Life.

He said it caused an"extremely nervous semi-hysterical condition". In 1936,an article in the American Journal of Nursing claimed that amarijuana taker "will suddenly turn with murderous violenceupon whomever is nearest to him". Tea and marijuana havethree things in common: they alter the moods of those who takethem, they are regarded as tolerable safe, and they areaddictive. Attitudes to addiction are complicated and oftencontradictory. Tea and marijuana are in themselves fairlyharmless, yet tea is generally legal and marijuana is not.Tobacco and cocaine are harmful but, again, tobacco is almostuniversally allowed, whereas most readers of The Economist livein countries which may imprison you for possessing cocaine. Throw in the joker of addictions which come not in syringes orcigarettes, but in casinos and computer cartridges, and you havea fine arena for combat between libertarians and puritans. This battle, always lively, has just become hotter. On April28th Bill Clinton appointed Lee Brown, a former policeman, asAmerica's new "drug tsar", and thus leader of theworlds toughest prohibition programme. Ten days before, Italianshad voted to move in the other direction by scrapping theharshest measures of their drug laws. Such boldness is rare. The attitude of most electorates andgovernments is to deplore the problems that the illegal drugtrade brings, view the whole matter with distaste, and sit on thestatus quo--a policy of sweeping prohibition. Yet the problemscannot be ignored. The crime to which some addicts resort tofinance their habits, and in which the suppliers of illegal drugshabitually engage, exacts its price in victims' lives, not justmoney. The illegal trade in drugs supports organised crime theworld over. It pulls drug-takers into a world of filthy needles,poisoned doses and pushers bent upon selling them more addictiveand dangerous fixes. Yet most people still balk at exploring ways in which a legalregime might undermine such effects. Their refusal owes somethingto a distaste for addiction in itself. This is an argument shotthrough with inconsistency. The strongest disapproval often comesfrom those who scream about liberties if their own particularindulgences--for assault rifles, say--are attacked. Addiction tocigarettes is reckoned to be the chief avoidable cause of deathin the world. Alcohol deprives boozers of their livers and theirmemories, and ends the lives of all too many innocents who getsmashed on the roads by the inebriated. Yet here the idea ofdissuasion within the law is broadly accepted. A much sounder basis for doubt is the worry that legalisationwould increase drug-taking, and that rising consumption andaddiction would overwhelm the gains to be had from getting drugswithin the law. Yet legalisation should not be taken to mean alawless free-for-all, with no restraint on the supply or use ofdrugs. Done properly, it would allow governments to take controlof the distribution and quality of these substances away from thecriminals. Quality control is decisive, because much of thedamage done by drugs bought on street corners is caused byadulterated products; in much the same way, carelessly distilledhooch can cause blindness. Supply would be regulated by a system of government licencesanalogous to those already in force for tobacco and alcohol (andwhich would serve, among other things, to keep drugs out of thehands of children), backed by strict policing and heavypenalties. The toughness of the regime would rise with theaddictiveness of the drug in question--a light touch formarijuana, an extremely dissuasive one for heroin.Suchlegalisation would not magically dispense with the need forpolicemen, but it would make the needed policing more manageable. Particularly in the business of softer drugs, where the taxescan be lower and the restrictions less onerous, and where thefirst trial steps towards legalisation should take place, itwould undermine the "risk premium" that provides drugcartels with their profits. Taxes raised on what is reckoned tobe the world's largest untaxed industry would help governmentsspend money on treatment and education, which would do more goodthan the billions currently spent on attempting to throttle thecriminal supply of drugs of all sorts. The Quest for Soma There is another consideration, one for the future. Theillegality of drugs, coupled with distaste for pleasurableaddiction, is skewing research. Progress is being made byscientists in understanding both what causes the pleasure ofdrugs and what makes the pleasure so hard to give up. Currentlysuch research is obliged to have only one aim--unhooking existingaddicts. It might have another. In many areas of pharmacology,researchers are exploring the idea of "designer drugs",chemicals tailored to fit harmlessly into human biochemistry.Addiction research should be encouraged to do the same: to movebeyond devising better therapies for those who wish to kick thedrug habit, into the invention of safer, more effective and lesshabit-forming highs. At the moment it cannot, for a safe drugequals a "substance abuse" equals a crime. The fact remains that any legal regime which lowers theeconomic incentive for drugs-crime will surely boost drugconsumption. The question is by how much. One possible pointer isthat, when asked, people say it will not rise a lot. In opinionpolls, Americans generally insist that they would not bepersuaded by legalisation to try drugs they are not taking now.There is some reason to believe them, despite the first instinctto be sceptical, since they already have access to plenty ofmindbending substances, from alcohol and tobacco to diet pills. Then there is reassurance from experiments. The Americanstates that decriminalised marijuana during the 1970s saw nodivergence in the consumption of the drug from that inneighbouring states which continued to prohibit it. Extensiveexperience with decriminalisation in Holland shows that not onlyis there no accompanying surge in consumption--allowing for theinrush of addicts from more restrictive countries--but relatedcrime falls when drugs are legalised. One further argument is used by defenders of the status quo.They say that, even if the case for exploring legalisation wereconceded by governments, public resistance would doom the idea.This is hardly surprising, given the way governments the wouldover have for decades hammered home the dogma of prohibition. Amore rational discussion could do much to change public opinion.Only a few years before alcohol prohibition was repealed in theUnited States in 1933, public sentiment was similarly dominatedby the opinions of the country's prohibitionist leaders. There are signs that public instincts are changing. In recentmonths a growing number of federal judges and lawyers have voicedtheir exasperation with America's approach to drugs. Theirobjections led politicians in Washington to hold a meetingearlier this month to rethink the country's failed drugspolicies. Janet Reno, the attorney-general, started the day bedescribing her doubts about America's current approach. It ended,significantly, with a discussion of the merits of legalisation.Neither Mr. Brown nor Ms. Reno, and certainly not their boss Mr.Clinton, has so far supported legalisation. But they have donewhat no American administration has dared do in livingmemory--set the scene for a proper debate. Drugs policy: The enemy within A quiet revolt has been taking place in courtrooms acrossAmerica. It has been led by judges disillusioned with thecountry's war on drugs. On April 29th Harold Greene, a prominentfederal judge in Washington, ruled that important elements of themandatory sentencing laws for drugs offenders wereunconstitutional. Less than two weeks earlier, two senior federaljudges, Jack Weinstein, and Whitman Knapp, of New York, hadannounced that they would no longer preside over drugs cases. Inrecent months, a number of federal judges have taken such astance. It might be a sign, much further down the road, of achange in policy. Lee Brown, the former New York police chief whowas appointed as "drug tsar" by Bill Clinton on April28th, is thought to be a good appointment. Apart from that, MrClinton has not done much with drugs policy. Granted, he has beenin office a short while, and has had much to occupy him. But hisdrug-policy staff has been cut, and the budget request he hassent to Congress looks just like the one sent by George Bush. Hehas asked for much the same amount of money, divided up in thesame way: two-thirds of the money to criminal-enforcementefforts, one-third to treatment. Some had hoped for a change of emphasis. Although the"war on drugs" was first promoted by Richard Nixon in1972, it was not until George Bush's term that the war began inearnest. Mr Bush appointed though-talking drug tsars and spent$40 billion to attack traffickers abroad and punish pushers andusers at home. The result has been disappointing. cocaine isavailable about as freely and cheaply today as in 1989.Drug-related violence in the cities is still high.The mostpraiseworthy part of the Bush policy was a drop in overallcocaine-taking. But hard-core addicts, who account forfour-fifths of all consumption, are taking as much as ever. MarkKleiman, of Harvard University, argues that Mr Bush's policies,put in place soon after the peak in cocaine's popularity, didlittle to affect a decline already under way. Changing fashion(including the recent surge in heroin-taking) probably deservesthe credit for that. If casual consumption of cocaine is down, it may well be theresult of education and treatment programmes rather than criminalenforcement. But enforcement has been, and remains, the core ofAmerican policy. Presidents, naturally, do not want to be seen tocondone the taking of drugs; the public temper is for stiffpenalties and the locking up of offenders, not tender care. Butthe effect of the policy, as the American Bar Association pointedout in a recent report, is that the country's prisons are fillednot only with drug-handlers but also with drug-takers, and cannotcope with the numbers. Neal Sonnett, the head of the ABA'scriminal-justice section, notes with particular alarm the sharprise in incarceration of low-level drug offenders, which hashindered efforts to fight more serious, and violent, crime. Hethinks the criminal-justice system may be "on the point ofcollapse". If it is, it will be for reasons to do withoverall levels of sentencing for many sorts of crimes, not merelythose related to drugs. But such arguments livened up a drugsmeeting held in Washington on May 7th to rethink America'spolicies. At the start of the day Janet Reno, theattorney-general, admitted dissatisfaction with the presentemphasis on enforcement efforts, and suggested the mandatorysentencing guidelines might be reviewed. The speech confirmedhints from Mr. Clinton that, despite his status-quo budget, heplants to cut back on enforcement efforts, especially overseas,in favour of trying to reduce demand at home. Another significantaspect of the meeting was the openness of debate. Prohibition wasnot unquestioningly supported. Ethan Nadelmann, a drugs expertwho heads the Princeton Working Group, which is developingalternative ideas to prohibition, notes that legalisation ofdrugs was given a serious hearing. The way forward, he believes,is towards "harm reduction". Such efforts, like the onesupported by Kurt Schmoke, the mayor of Baltimore, build onprogrammes from parts of Europe and Australia which treatdrug-taking not as a criminal matter, but more as an issue ofpersonal choice and public health. A small chorus has applauded such a shift in resources,arguing that prohibition of drugs will always fail so long asAmericans remain so determined to get hold of them. Mr. Clinton,who got himself in plenty of trouble during the campaign for notinhaling marijuana, is unlikely to go that far. High and hooked A better understanding of how addictions work could providebenefits for science, for medicine and for recreation In 1964 Aryeh Routtenberg stuck electrodes into the brains ofhis experimental rats. The electrodes were so positioned thatcurrent flowing though them caused a particular pleasure. For onehour a day, each rat could control this current by means of alever in its cage. Another lever, which also worked for just thatone hour, controlled the food supply. There was no contestbetween the levers. The rats, too busy mainlining current to stopfor food, wasted away to ecstatic death. The link between pleasure and addiction is not always soextreme, but more mundane addictions have brought about millionsof less dramatic deaths outside the laboratory, and caused untoldmisery and pain. The substances to which people get addicted,though, also bring great pleasure to billions--some addicted,some not. They are the basis of several multi-billion dollarindustries around the world. Some 60m Americans smoke tobacco;three-quarters of West European adults drink alcohol; no oneknows how many people around the world consume caffeine in tea,coffee or cola. Figures for illegal drugs are harder to come by,but around 2m Americans are thought to take cocaine, and manymore than that have smokes marijuana. Not all the people who indulge in these tastes areaddicts--that is, they do not depend on their habit in a way thatseems clearly abnormal to the bulk of people who do not sharetheir tastes. Though almost everyone who smokes tobacco ishooked, drinkers are not necessarily alcoholics and not allheroin users are hopeless junkies. Pleasure and the addictionneed not come together--either can be present without the other.yet the two are obviously connected. Neuroscientists are nowusing the tools of molecular biology to find the links betweenthem, deep in the recesses of the brain. The kick from cocaine The cerebral nooks and crannies of interest are those betweennerve cells--synapses. To jump over the gap between two cells, anerve impulse has to be translated from electricity to chemicalsand back. The first cell releases a chemical called aneurotransmitter into the synaptic gap. These molecules are thenpicked up by receptor proteins on the surface of the second cell.The neurotransmitter fits the receptor as a key fits a lock. Theunlocking of the receptor leads to the creation or suppression ofa nerve impulse in the second cell. There are many different types of neurotransmitter, and thusof synapse; different pathways in the brain need their differentproperties. It is by subverting some of these synapses, and thussome of the brain's pathways, that drugs produce pleasure. it isthrough changing them in a more fundamental way that the drugscause addiction. The first evidence for this is almost 20 years old. Recentlyit has started to pile up quite quickly. In 1975 Solomon Snyder,at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Hans Kosterlitz of theUniversity of Aberdeen in Scotland and John Hughes ofParke-Davis, and English pharmaceuticals company, found out howheroin, then drug-du-jour for worried policy-makers, works. Dr.Snyder discovered there was a receptor protein in mammalianbrains which heroin would stick to. Dr. Kosterlitz and Dr. Hughesreasoned that nature was unlikely to have produced such a lockwithout also evolving a key. Working independently, they found a chemical in the body thatfitted into the same receptor as heroin; Dr. Kosterlitz named it"endorphin". This type of neurotransmitter (there are,it turns out, at least three different endorphins) damps downpain by suppressing the signals which transmit it; it alsoprovides feelings of well-being. heroin acts as an ill-fittingkey which can open the lock but cannot then be withdrawn. Thesynapse is over-stimulated. Unusually pleasurable sensationsresult. If you replace heroin and endorphins with nicotine and theneurotransmitter acetylcholine, or with caffeine and adenosine,or Valium and gamma-amino butyric acid, or marijuana andanadamide, the same story can be told. Other drugs work inslightly more subtle ways. Alcohol does not mimic aneurotransmitter, but at least some of its effects come frommessing up the same synapses that heroin works on. Cocaine, whichhas replaced heroin as the drug of concern in America, and hasthus been extensively researched, works on nerves that use theneurotransmitter dopamine. These nerves are found in, among otherplaces, the mesolimbic system--the part of the brain which seemsto generate emotion. Cocaine subverts the pathway not by bindingto dopamine receptors, but by sticking to a molecule called,inelegantly, the dopamine re-uptake transporter. Nerve cells, canny little things, recycle theirneurtransmitters. Receptor molecules spit out theirneurotransmitters once they have served their purpose, and thecell whence they came mops them up for reuse. Block thisre-uptake, and the transmitters will just sit in the synapticgap, stimulating the receptors again and again and again. Anotherstrategy is to jam the re-uptake system open, so that dopamineflows though it the wrong way all the time, keeping the gapsuffused with the neurotransmitter. That is what amphetamines do. The fact that amphetamines and cocaine work in similar wayswill come as no surprise to anyone who has tried both. The natureof the high a drug provides depends on the type ofneurotransmitter it interferes with. but the brain is a complexplace; the separate systems within it that use differentneurotransmitters all interact. A drug acting on one set ofsynapses can have secondary and tertiary effects all over theplace. That is why drug experiences are so varied. The range ofthings that can be addictive, though, is wider even than therange of available drugs. Foreign bodies in the synapses are notan absolute prerequisite for an addiction. Something asstraightforward as healthy exercise can, in the extreme, hook. Inthe case of exercise it appears that the body becomes addicted tothe endorphins it produces to ameliorate the pain and stress. Other behaviours that carry an intensity with them--and thuspresumable overstimulate some parts of the brain's wiring--canproduce similar effects, though the synapses involved have yet tobe charted. Gambling has many of the characteristics of drugtaking--a euphoric high, and a craving in the addict. Some peoplebelieve themselves addicted to sex; lawyers in England recentlyconvinced a jury that a teenage hacker was addicted to computing. It is easy to see some such "addictions" as excuses,especially as the term resists strict definition. But addictionto chemicals is clearly real, and there seems no reason tobelieve that compulsive chemical-taking is necessarily in adifferent class from other acquired compulsive habits. Anyway,chemical dependency is easier to study than other sorts. That iswhy it has been possible to locate the roots of pleasure in thesynapses--and why it has been possible to find the roots ofwithdrawal there, too. Cold turkey Clinically, addiction can be characterised by two things:craving and withdrawal. Craving is still the subject of a certainamount of scientific handwaving. The best the psychologists cando is describe the process as one of positivereinforcement--which means that if you like something, you willtend to do it again. Having their receptors overstimulated issomething people tend to like a lot. How this "liking"translates into neural circuitry is not yet clear. Withdrawal, the physical and mental turmoil that follows whenan addiction is interrupted, is proving more tractable toexperimental analysis. A suggestive picture of how it works canbe pieced together, as long as you do not mind taking the piecesfrom different studies of different drugs: work on cocaine byNora Volcow at Brookhaven National Laboratory, among others; oncocaine and amphetamines by Bruce Cohen of McLean Hospital inBoston; on heroin by Zvi Vogel at the Weizmann Institute inRehovot in Israel and Antol Shofelmeer at the Free University inAmsterdam; an on benzodiazepines (such as Valium) by Erick Sigelat the University of Berne. Again, the synapse is the scene of the action. Most biologicalsystems have feedback mechanisms that help smooth out the littlefluctuations that life throws at them. Synapses are no exception.The receiving cell can adjust itself to changes in the behaviourof the transmitting cell in two ways. It can finetune the signalthe receptors pass on, and it can change the number of receptors.The receptor molecules are conduits for information, with one endoutside the cell and the other inside. When a neurotransmitterattaches itself outside, the part on the inside changes itsshape. In this new shape, it can accommodate molecules calledG-proteins, which hang around inside the cell. These G-proteinsare, themselves, also shape-changers. Interacting with thereceptor activates the G-proteins; these then head off to spreadthe word via yet more molecules, called second messengers. the second messengers tell the cell about the signal from theneurotransmitters. One part of the cell that listens is thesystem which sends out and suppresses nerve impulses. Anotheravid audience is made up of the enzymes which add phosphategroups to proteins, some of which help in the production ofimpulses. More messages make them more active, and more likely toadd phosphate to receptor molecules. A phosphorylated receptor isan unhappy receptor. It is reluctant to accommodate G-proteinsand thus to bring information in from the outside. The nucleus,which controls the production of proteins, and also listens tothe second messengers. Lots of chatter from them suggests to thenucleus that there are too many receptors at the synapse, so itbrings their manufacture to a halt. Insert an addictive drug intothe system and the din from the second messengers becomesdeafening. The result is fewer receptor molecules. Both thephosphorylation of receptors and their absence means that ittakes more of the drug to obtain the same effect. Those highdoses, in turn, lead to even less sensitive synapses. And theyalso lead to synapses that can no longer function without thedrug. The cell gets used to damming the flood of drug-inducednoise in order to be able to deal with the faint whispers ofreality that float on top of it. Remove the drug, and the normalsignals can no longer get over the barrier that has been erected.The system goes from getting too much of the neurotransmitter'seffects to not enough; heaven turns to hell. Put this way, the molecular picture seems obvious. It fitswith a common experience of addiction, that of needing to do moreand more of the drug just to keep from feeling bad. Of course, itcannot be that simple--after all drugs that work on the sameneurotransmitter may vary in their addictiveness. And peoplevary, too, in their susceptibility to addiction. Then again,addictions to substances that affect different types of synapsecan be quite similar--and some people seem to be prone toaddiction per se, rather than just to have a weakness for aparticular substance. And the fact that addiction remains afterwithdrawal has ended--a fact attested to at Alcoholics Anonymousevery day--suggests there is a more general problem to look at. Dopamine heads For more evidence that addictions have something in common inthe way they act on the brain as a whole, no matter whichpathways they stimulate, look at the pictures on this page. Edythe London, who works at America's National Institute onDrug Abuse, studies glucose metabolism in the brains of peoplewith addictions. Glucose is the body's principal fuel, so its useis a good index of how active an area is. Dr London's picturesshow that, in certain parts of the brain, addicts use lessglucose than non-addicts do. The difference applies regardless ofwhat drug is being used, and it is still visible when they arenot under the influence. Other clues to a general theory of addiction have ledresearchers to focus on the dopamine system--even when looking atdrugs which do not affect dopamine receptors. There is evidencethat many, and possibly all, addictions affect the dopamine cellsin the brain's mesolimbic system. In the case of cocaine thiseffect is direct, which may account for the drug's peculiarpotency. for other drugs it seems to be indirect, brought aboutby connections between the dopamine system and the otherneurotransmitter systems. Inside the dopamine system, the researchers' attention haslighted on D2. it should come as no surprise by now to hear thatD2 is a protein found in synapses, one of the three differentreceptor proteins for dopamine. The detailed make-up of theseproteins can vary from person to person--variation that comesfrom differences in the gene which describes the protein. So thedifferent variants of D2 are inherited. It was inheritance that led the researchers to D2. In the1970s a series of Danish studies compared the children andstep-children of alcoholic fathers. The former proved more likelyto succumb to the same addiction. This, and the evidence thatidentical twins are more likely to share an alcoholic fate thanare non-identical twins, suggested that genes were playing arole. In 1990, to great excitement, Kenneth Blum of theUniversity of Texas at San Antonio, and Ernest Noble of theUniversity of California, Los Angeles, announced that they hadfound a gene peculiarly common among alcoholics. It described aform of the D2 receptor known as A1. This was challenged by several researchers, most notablyKenneth Kidd, of Yale. Dr. Kidd points out that different ethnicgroups have different frequencies of A1, which could confuse thestatistics. Others, convinced by Dr. Blum, Dr. Noble andsubsequent work, have suggested that A1 frequencies may actuallyexplain differences in alcoholism between ethnic groups, thoughthis is far from certain. In 1992 George Uhl, of Johns Hopkins,found that a second variant of D2, known as B1, seemed peculiarlycommon in people addicted to tobacco, cocaine, heroin,tranquillizers, marijuana and amphetamines as well asalcohol--almost the whole list of commonly addictive substances.This is at least as controversial as the original finding; itsmeaning is not clear, nor is the nature of the difference betweenthe different D2s. To link small variations in a single protein with theexistence of an all-purpose "addictive personality" isto go a long way too far. But there is evidence in one case for alink between personality and withdrawal symptoms--and to linkwithdrawal symptoms to specific molecules is not too farfetched.About 40% of people prescribed courses of benzodiazepines totreat anxiety or insomnia can suffer some withdrawalsymptoms--souped-up versions of the symptoms the drugs are usedto treat--after the course of medication is finished. PeterTyrer, who worked at St. Charles' Hospital in London, has foundthat the people who suffer withdrawal share not a specificprotein, but rather specific personality traits: insecurity,inability to make decisions, an over-reliance on the opinions ofothers. Spot them, and you can save people from withdrawal. Better living through chemistry The links between proteins, the lowly building blocks of thebrain, and personalities, the high abstractions of the mind, areundoubtedly going to be convoluted--but evidence from both endssuggests they are there to be found. What are the pharmaceuticalcompanies, to which this should be of interest, doing about it? Some work is going into drugs to treat drug addiction.Naltrexone keeps heroin from activating endorphin receptors,without activating them itself. Methadone works in the same wayas heroin, but less effectively; it thus provides a way offheroin that minimises withdrawal symptoms. Similar approaches tococaine are being tried. Drugs which act on dopamine pathways ingeneral may have widespread effects on addiction. but drugs to defeat dependence are not the only possibilities.Some of the damage that comes from drug addiction, especially thephysical damage, comes from secondary aspects of the drug. Lungcancer, for examples, is caused by the substances that accompanynicotine in tobacco smoke, not by nicotine itself. It might bepossible to get rid of some of these problems without getting ridof the pleasure, even if it is not possible to get rid of theaddictions. Another option is to develop tests which could tellpeople if they were at risk of falling under a particular spellso that they could choose their pleasures wisely. Eventually, an understanding of neurotransmitters, receptors,G-proteins, and second messengers might allow pleasure andaddiction to be decoupled--or at least allow withdrawal to besuppressed. Though, on the face of it, the effects that causepleasure in the short term are those that cause addiction in thelong term, there is a lot of variability in the system that mightbe exploited. Techniques like those used to target specificdopamine receptors in the treatment of Parkinson's disease,might, at least in principle, be used to fine tune a drug'seffects at the synapse and produce low-addiction highs. And puresubstances tailored to neurotransmitter sites would have a goodchance of being free of unpleasant side effects elsewhere in thebody. That would not create a brave new world; it might, perhaps,create a slightly happier one.

Although limited in scope -- the only drugs mentioned wereheroin, cocaine, amphetamine, and marijuana, with the focus beingon heroin -- I found the quality of the show very encouraging. I encourage everyone to contact ABC News and commend them forairing this special. For those who missed it, I have provided asynopsis below. Note: quotes are not necessarily verbatim; Names may bemisspelled. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ AMERICA'S WAR ON DRUGS: SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS: A SUMMARY ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ STATED PURPOSE: The claimed purpose of the show was 'not to advocate specificpolicy' but to 'open up the discussion' and consider newapproaches, as this issue 'deserves debate'. It advised viewersnot to dismiss approaches just because they seem too radical. TOPIC: The show focused on those approaches to the drug problem knownas 'harm reduction'. Although marijuana was touched on severaltimes, the focus was on 'hard drugs' such as heroin. FORMAT: The show was composed primarily of excerpts of interviews withvarious people, primarily advocates of harm reduction, stitchedtogether with narrative by Catherine Cryer and footage of policeraids, prisons, people shooting drugs, etc. It is sprinkled with assertions by drug war zealotextraordinaire William Bennet, which are in most cases followed by refutations which lookmuch more reasoned. SUMMARY: The show opened with some observations: * We are losing the 'War on Drugs'. * There is a striking lack of public debate about alternativesto current policies. * The crime problem cannot be addressed without addressing thedrug problem. and some facts: * The 'War on Drugs' is the longest running war in US history. * Over 300,000 people are in prison for drug law violations. * There are as many illegal drugs on the streets today asever. It then interviewed Jim Montgomery, a paraplegic who wassentenced to life imprisonment for 2 ounces of cannabis (laterreduced to 10 years) in Oklahoma. (He had no prior criminalrecord.) He smokes marijuana to relieve the pain of his brokenback. It quotes his attorney pointing out that violent offenders arereleased from jail to make room for people like Jim Montgomery. Next, three influential advocates of harm reduction in the USAare introduced: Conservative California Judge James Gray: * declares the War on Drugs has turned into a war on ourpeople. * points out nothing is accomplished by imprisoning drugusers. * favors government regulated distribution of drugs coupledwith education. Baltimore mayor Kurt Shmoke: * points out violence in the drug trade is caused by profits,not by drugs themselves. * advocates taking the profit out of drug distribution,through government distribution and a focus on education andtreatment. * points out only 20% of addicts can get treatment. New Haven police chief Nick Pastor: * is shown interacting with inner-city youth talking aboutdrugs. William Bennet summarizes the prohibitionist mindset: 'You will never persuade the citizens of this country thatdrugs should be legalized.' 'It (drug use) is a deadly andpoisonous activity.' 'We must never admit defeat in the war ondrugs.' 'People should be imprisoned for long periods of time forusing drugs.' Next it moves to Europe and looks at the experiences with harmreduction in Holland and Britain. Holland * Use of cannabis is tolerated (scenes of people smoking up incoffee shops). * Tolerance of cannabis is attributed for the prevention ofthe use of hard drugs by youth. * A large proportion of crime is caused by foreign touristscomming from countries with more repressive drug policies. * Prosecution is reserved for large distributors, not users ofeven hard drugs. * Since free needle exchanges were introduced the HIVinfection rate among IV drug users dropped from 11% to 4%, nowone of lowest in world. * Public policy seeks to keep addicts healthy, productivecitizens. * There is still a black market in hard drugs, which manybelieve will not be eliminated until complete legalization isimplemented. * Holland is pressured by the US to roll back its harmreduction policy. Britain * Heroin maintenance, which seeks to stabilize and helpaddicts by providing pharmaceutical heroin, is practiced. * The physical health of junkies is ruined by adulterants inillicit heroin. (Pharmaceutical heroin can be used lifelong without medicalconsequences.) * People on heroin maintenance are able to lead relativelynormal healthy lives. * If given a chance, most people mature out of addiction, soheroin maintenance buys time, allowing the user to build a life as an alternativeto addiction. * A 15-fold reduction in crimes by addicts on heroinmaintenance has been documented. * Many on heroin maintenance are eventually successful inkicking the addiction. Back to the USA ... treatment: * America's lack of commitment to treatment is highlighted. * The success rate of treatment (American style) is at best25%. AIDS infection * Ethen Nadelman, a harm reduction proponent, questions themorality of policies which result in IV drug users getting HIV, perhaps infectingtheir lovers and children, and producing a huge economic burdenon society. * A study of the effectiveness of needle exchange programs inNew York shows a drop in HIV infection among IV drug users from6% to 2%. Marijuana * Dr. Lester Grinspoon, (author of Marijuana ForbiddenMedicine (not mentioned)) dispels gateway theory of cannabis. He says cannabis is 'lessof a problem than tobacco or alcohol by orders of magnitude'. * US Government reports dispel gateway theory. * The 1972 Schafer Commission, appointed by Richard Nixon,recommends the legalization of the possession and sale of smallquantities of cannabis. * The partial adoption of this strategy in California savedbillions of dollars. * The nation's leaders purposely ignore findings of SchaferCommission. William Bennet again 'law enforcement is very effective prevention' 'harm reduction policies would immediately lead to 50 millionhard drug users in the USA' * These assertions are both made to look rather dubious bysubsequent rebuttals. Drugs and children * PDFA commercials initially had "great impact" indiscouraging drug use. * The lack of education has recently led to increased useamong kids. (These two points I take issue with, as I attribute theincrease to a loss of credibility brought about by exaggeration in 'drugeducation'.) * Due to prohibition there are pushers in schools - drugs arereadily available in spite of (or because of) prohibition. Memorable metaphor Kurt Shmoke describes the drug war as a 'domestic Vietnam'.

Yet patients worldwidecontinue to be undertreated and to suffer unnecessary agony by Ronald Melzack RONALD MELZACK, who has been studying the neurophysiology ofpain for 35 years, is E. P. Taylor Professor of Psychology atMcGill University and research director of the Pain Clinic at theMontreal General Hospital. After earning a Ph.D. in psychologyfrom McGill in 19S4 and accepting fellowships in the U.S. andabroad, he joined the faculty of the Massachusetts institute ofTechnology in 19S9. There, he and Patrick D. Wall begandiscussions that led to the 196S publication of their now famous,gate control" theory of pain. He returned to McGill in1963. This is his third article for ScientificAmerican. "Pain" as Albert Schweitzer once said, "is amore terrible lord of mankind than even death itself."Prolonged pain destroys the quality of life. It can erode thewill to live, at times driving people to suicide. The physicaleffects are equally profound. Severe, persistent pain can impairsleep and appetite, thereby producing fatigue and reducing theavailability of nutrients to organs. It may thus impede recoveryfrom illness or injury and, in weakened or elderly patients, maymake the difference between life and death. Sadly, there are some kinds of pain that existing treatmentscannot ease. That care givers can do little in these cases isterribly distressing for everyone involved but is certainlyunderstandable. What seems less understandable is that manypeople suffer not because their discomfort is untreatable butbecause physicians are often reluctant to prescribe morphine.Morphine is the safest, most effective analgesic (painkiller)known for constant, severe pain, but it is also addictive forsome people. Consequently, it is typically meted out sparingly,if it is given at all. Indeed, concern over addiction has led many nations in Europeand elsewhere to outlaw virtually any uses Of morphine andrelated substances, including their medical applications. Everwhere morphine is a legal medical therapy, as it is in GreatBritain and the U.S., many care givers, afraid of turningpatients into addicts, deliver amounts that are too small orspaced too widely to control pain. 'Yet the fact is that when patients take morphine to combatpain, it is rare to see addiction-which is characterized by apsychological craving for a substance and, when the substance issuddenly removed, by the development of withdrawal symptoms (forexample, sweating, aches and nausea). Addiction seems to ariseonly in some fraction of morphine users who take the drug for itspsychological effects, such as its ability to produce euphoriaand relieve tension. Furthermore, patients who take morphine for pain do notdevelop the rapid physical tolerance to the drug that is often asign of addiction. Many people who are prone to addiction quicklyrequire markedly escalating doses to achieve a desired change ofmood, but patients who take the drug to control pain do not needsharply rising doses for relief. They may develop some toleranceinitially, but their required dose usually rises gradually andthen stabilizes. I do not suggest that morphine be prescribed indiscriminately.I do urge lawmakers, law-enforcement agencies and health-careworkers to distinguish between the addict who craves morphine forits mood-altering properties and the psychologically healthypatient who takes the drug only to relieve pain. Morphine is a constituent of opium, which has been a medicaltherapy for longer than 2,000 years, since at least ancient Romantimes. Opium is made by extracting a milky juice from the unripecapsule, or seedpod, of the poppy Papaver somniferum (grownabundantly in many Middle Eastern countries) and then drying theexudate to form a gum. This gum-the opium-can be eaten as is oradded to a beverage. By the 16th century opium was being carried by traders toEurope and the Orient. At about that time an opium-containingmixture called laudanum became a popular remedy in Europe forvirtually all ailments. Later, smoking opium and tobacco togetherbecame yet another popular way to obtain the drug's benefits. Soon after the turn of the 19th century, a young Germanpharmacist named Friedrich W. A. Serttimer isolated morphine fromopium and identified it as opium's major active ingredient.Morphine's production was followed in 1832 by the isolation ofyet another opiate, or opium derivative: codeine. In the mid-19th century the introduction of the hypodermicneedle made it possible to administer large amounts of drugs byinjection. The standard approach to morphine therapy for ongoingpain (left) calls for injections pro re nata (PRN), or "asneeded.' In practice this means injections are given only inresponse to pain; also, if the pain returns before four to sixhours have passed the patient often has to wait for help. By thetime the next injection is delivered, the pain may be so severethat quite a large dose is needed, leading to mental clouding andother side effects, such as nausea. A more enlightened approach(right) seeks the actual prevention of pain and thus helps easethe fear of recurring agony. The morphine is given orally (in adose tailored to the patient's needs) every four hours or evenmore frequently if a shorter schedule prevents pain moreeffectively. Because the doses are frequent, they typically canbe relatively low, which reduces the incidence of side effects. Improved technology, which enabled a drug's effects to be feltquickly, led in many regions of the world to the readyprescription of injected morphine for severe pain. At the sametime, more and more people began taking morphine for itsemotional effects, and the number of addicts rose. Eventually a search began for drugs that had morphine'sanalgesic properties but were not habit-forming. This questresulted in the production of heroin, a synthetic compoundsimilar in activity to morphine but soon found, disappointingly,to be quite as addictive. Various other opioids (chemicals withactivity similar to that of opium) were then introduced,including methadone and meperidine (Demerol). Like the opiates,many of the opioids relieve pain, induce changes in mood and,unfortunately, are addictive to some extent. Inevitably, the rising abuse of narcotics (by which I meanopiates and opioids) and of other mood-altering drugs spurredcountries throughout the world to adopt antidrug regulations. Atthe same time, the extremely cautious administration of narcoticsfor pain became commonplace. Today morphine therapy for pain is generally restricted to twogroups of patients. It is prescribed over relatively shortperiods for hospitalized individuals who have discomfort causedby surgical incisions, and it is given over potentially longerperiods to ameliorate the pain suffered by burn victims or peoplewho have incurable cancer. In many hospitals the standard prescription order says"PRN" (pro re nata, or "as needed"). Thisorder essentially means that the drug is given orLiy after painreturns. Typically, it is delivered by injection into a muscle orunder the skirt. The result of the PRN approach is often a confrontationbetween the patient and the care giver, who expects morphineanalgesia to last for four to six hours. The patient, whose painhas returned earlier than expected, is in agony and pleads tohave the next injection. The health-care worker, fearful ofcausing addiction, refuses to comply. When the pain is finallytreated, it may be so severe that a large dose has to be given,which increases the likelihood of side effects, such as mentalclouding and nausea. Particularly when a patient has a terminalIllness, the issue of addiction is meaningless, and delayingrelief is cruel. There is another, more humane way to treat pain, one that isslowly gaining acceptance. In this approach doses are givenregularly, according to a schedule that has been actuallytailored to prevent recurrence of the individual's pain. Thus,pain is controlled continuously; a patient does not wait fordiscomfort to return before receiving the next dose. This enlightened, preventive approach evolved from pioneeringwork first undertaken some 20 years ago by Cicely M. Saunders, anEnglish physician who established the first modern center devotedto caring for people who are dying of cancer or other dis. eases:St. Christopher's Hospice in London. Saunders urged physicianscaring for terminally ill Patents to face reality and palliate-torelieve Pain, nausea and other discomforts instead of makingfutile attempts to cure disease. The final days or weeks of aperson's life, she believed, should be a time of peace andcomfort, spent as pleasurably as possible in the company offamily and friends. To achieve this aim, Saunders prescribed the Brompton mixture,a version of a liquid analgesic that had been used for advancedcancer by several London hospitals, including the Brompton ChestHospital, since the late 19th century. The mixture (made ofmorphine, cocaine, chloroform water, alcohol and flavoring syrup)had been eclipsed by injectable morphine, but Saunders realizedthat an orally delivered compound would allow many patients tospend a number of their last days at home; a visiting nurse wouldsimply monitor them, making sure their pain was controlled. Morphine has since been found to be the only importantingredient in the Brompton mixture, and so today patients who aretreated with the preventive approach to pain take morphine alone,either as a tablet or mixed into a beverage. An initial dose of10 milligrams is typically given and repeated every four hours.Then, over the course of perhaps several days or weeks, the doseand timing are adjusted until a maintenance regimen isestablished that controls pain around the clock without producingmental clouding and other side effects. For patients who have cancer, an approach emphasizing painprevention is particularly wise. Pain and the fear of pain areperhaps their greatest source of suffering. In the early stagesof the disease, some 80 percent of people have pain resultingfrom the cancer itself or from the procedures designed to arrestits spread. By the time the cancer has reached its final stages,about 70 percent of people report pain, which tends to be intenseand persistent. About 80 to 90 percent of cancer patients treated with thepreventive approach obtain satisfactory relief, reporting thattheir discomfort is consistently bearable or, more frequently,gone. Roughly half of the remainder obtain relief with theaddition of other therapies. This success rate is remarkable inview of the destructiveness of cancer and the severity of thepain associated with it. Treatments continue to improve. There are now special capsulesthat release morphine slowly and so need to be taken only a fewtimes a day. Also available are electronically controlled,portable pumps that deliver a steady infusion of medication underthe skin. Enough evidence has now been collected to demonstrate that thetraditional, PRN approach, based as it is on the fear ofaddiction makes little sense. Study after study of patients whosepain is most often treated with narcotics-namely, cancerpatients, bum victims and those hospitalized for surgery-hasshown that the patients who develop rapid and marked toleranceto, and dependence on, the narcotics are usually those whoalready have a history of psychological disturbance or substanceabuse. Let us first consider the problem of marked tolerance, whichnot only is a sign of possible addiction but is also a medicalconcern in its own right because the risk of side effectsincreases as the dose increases. For instance, delivery ofextremely large amounts of morphine can induce coma and seriouslyimpair respiration. Robert G. Twycross, now at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford,England, has shown that relatively little tolerance develops inpatients with cancer lvh( take individually adjusted doses ofheroin several times a day over long Periods. The patientsdeveloped some tolerance to the drug initially, so that the doseshad to be gradually raised over the first 12 weeks, but painrelief was achieved without producing serious side effects. Thenthe doses held fairly stable for months. Balfour M. Mount, one of my colleagues at McGill University,and I recently found similar results when we studied tolerance tomorphine in patients who spent more than a month in thePalliative Care Unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal.(This unit, established by Mount, was the first service forpalliative care at a large general hospital.) The patients in ourstudy, who took the drug by mouth answered a pain-evaluatingquestionnaire that I developed with Warren S. Torgerson of JohnsHopkins University. The overall intensity of the pain was rankedon a scale ranging from no pain (0) to pain that is mild (1). Discomfort(2). distressing (3), horrible (4) or excruciating (5). About 5 percent of the patients had persistently high painlevels (3 or higher). The remaining 95 percent had excellent paincontrol without requiring rapidly escalating amounts of morphine.Increase in pain, usually a sign of disease progression after amaintenance program has been established, was the mostcommon. reason for a rise in dose. Patients who found that theirdiscomfort had decreased either spontaneously or because oftreatment, such as reduction of a tumor by radiation-usuallyrequired less medication John F. Scott of the Elizabeth Bruyere Health Center in Ottawaalso uncovered little evidence of addiction when he analyzed manystudies examining withdrawal symptoms in patients atcancer-treatment clinics. He reports that "if a cancerpatient no longer requires a narcotic for pain control, a gradualreduction in dose will prevent any withdrawal symptoms, althoughthese are usually mild or absent even after abruptdiscontinuance." Any physical dependence is generallyovercome without difficulty when doses are reduced over a periodof days. FORMALIN TEST measures the analgesic (painkilling) effects ofmedications on so-called tonic, or persistent pain. A dilutesolution of formaldehyde and saline is injected under the skin ofa rat's paw, inducing pain that lasts for about 90 minutes. Therat licks its paw repeatedly, which is a sign of moderate pain (apain rating of 3). Then. after a while, the animal holds the pawin the air (a rating of 2), steps on it gingerly (a rating of 1)and finally walks normally (a rating of 0). In this test, ratstreated with morphine develop little tolerance to the drug'sanalgesic effect; that is, they do not require ever-increasingdoses to obtain relief. This finding is consistent with theresults of clinical studies showing that patients who takemorphine for persistent pain do not acquire marked tolerance anddo not become addicted. Studies of patients who received narcotics while they werehospitalized have also uncovered little evidence of addiction. Inan extensive study Jane B. Porter and Hershel Jick of the BostonUniversity Medical Center followed up on 11,882 patients who weregiven narcotics to relieve pain stemming from various medicalproblems; none of the subjects had a history of drug dependence.The team found that only four of the patients subsequently abuseddrugs, and in only one case was the abuse considered major. Equally persuasive are the results of a survey of more than10,000 burn victims. These individuals, who were studied bySamuel W. Perry of New York Hospital and George Heidrich of theUniversity of Wisconsin at Madisom underwent debridement, anextremely painful procedure in which the dead tissue is removedfrom burned skin. Most of the patients received injections ofnarcotics for weeks or even months. Yet not a single case oflater addiction could be attributed to the narcotics given forpain relief during the hospital stay. Although 22 patients abuseddrugs after they were discharged, all of them had a history ofdrug abuse. Further evidence that narcotic drugs can be administered forpain without causing addiction comes from studies of"patient-controlled analgesia" in surgical patients andthose hospitalized for bums. in such studies patients push abutton on an electronically controlled pump at the bedside togive themselves small doses of morphine (through an intravenoustube). When these devices were introduced, there was considerablefear that patients would abuse the drug. Instead it soon becameclear that patients maintain their doses at a reasonable leveland decrease them when their pain diminishes. Studies that explore how morphine produces analgesia arehelping to explain why patients who take the drug solely torelieve pain are unlikely to develop rapid tolerance and becomeaddicted. On the basis of such studies, my former student FrancesV. Abbott and I proposed in 1981 that morphine probably has aneffect on two distinct pain-signaling systems in the centralnervous system and that one of these-which gives rise to the kindof pain typically treated with morphine-does not develop muchtolerance to the drug. Our proposal grew out of my efforts to develop a test inanimals that would accurately determine the effectiveness ofanalgesic drugs on the kind of pain most often requiringnarcotics in human patients: the prolonged, or "tonic,"kind that persists long after an injury is suffered. This is thesort of pain that chronically bedevils cancer patients. When aninjury first occurs, it gives rise to what is called phasic pain,which is brief and rapidly rises and falls in intensity. (Thepain felt the instant a finger is cut would be called phasic.)Such phasic pain is usually followed by the tonic kind. For many years investigators interested in measuring theanalgesic effects of drugs subjected rats to what is called thetail-flick test. After a rat is injected with a test drug, itstail is immersed in hot water; the time between immersion andwhen the rat flicks its tail out of the water is measured as anindex of pain. When morphine's effectiveness was examined withthis test, investigators repeatedly found evidence of markedtolerance: the animals required ever-increasing doses in order tokeep the tail in the water for a given time. Such results wereinterpreted to mean that human patients in pain would readilybecome tolerant to morphine and so would become addicted to thedrug. There is a major problem with the tail-flick test, however. Itgives rise to suddenly rising, phasic pain, which is not the kindfor which morphine is usually prescribed. To gain moreinformation about the effects of analgesics on persistent, tonicpain in humans, John O'Keefe, David Dubuisson and Stephen G.Dennis, who were then my students, developed what is called theformalin test. A small amount of formalin-formaldehyde diluted insaline-is injected under the s1cin of a rat's forepaw. When theanimal is not given an analgesic, the formalin produces moderatepain that lasts for about 90 minutes, as evinced by the animal'stendency to lick the paw and a reluctance to put weight on it. Ifa drug soothes the hurt, the animal puts weight on the paw morequickly. With the formalin (tonic-pain) test, Abbott and I (laterjoined at McGill by our colleague Keith B. J. Franklin)discovered that rats developed relatively little tolerance to theanalgesia produced by successive injections of morphine. The mostlogical explanation for the different degrees of tolerance foundin the tail-flick and formalin tests was that phasic and tonicpain are invoked by two distinct neural systems that havediffering tolerance to morphine. Other lines of evidence added support to this idea. Forinstance, Dennis and I examined the effect on pain of severaldrugs that interact with morphine (or that alter pain in theirown right) in both the tail-flick and the formalin tests. Theresults were striking. Drug effects that we found in One testwere absent or even reversed in the other. For example, drugsthat reduced morphine analgesia in one test either had no effector enhanced the analgesic effect in the other test. if the neuralsystems that respond to phasic and tonic pain were one and thesame, the effects of the drugs on morphine's activity should havebeen identical in both tests. My colleagues and I think we now know which of the many neuralpathways in the spinal cord and brain constitute the twopain-signaling systems that are sensitive to morphine. We alsoknow something about their functioning and how they are affectedby morphine. In both systems, information about pain is deliveredto the dorsal horns (wingshaped regions) of the spinal cord byperipheral neurons emanating from the skin and other body tissues[see illustration on opposite page]. Ascending neuronsoriginating in the dorsal horns then relay the pain signalsupward through the spinal cord to various parts of the brain. The pain-signaling system that my colleague and I think ismost associated with sudden, phasic pain is called the lateralsystem. The name derives from the simple fact that the system'stracts, which project to the sensory cortex, pass through thebrain stem at a position to the side of the brain stem's centralcore. The system that is probably responsible for persistent,tonic pain is called the medial system; its tracts pass throughthe central core of the brain stem. Among the more salient properties of the lateral system arethe rapid conduction of impulses and an organization that mapsthe relative position of body sites. These properties wouldenable the system to give rise to sudden, sharp pain in a readilyidentified spot in the body. Kenneth L. Casey of the Universityof Michigan at Ann Arbor and I have proposed that the lateraltracts also account to a great extent for the sensory qualitiesof pains, such as throbbing or burning. The activity of the lateral system is apparently dampenedrather quickly, which would' explain why phasic pain oftensubsides promptly. The inhibition is accomplished by a system ofneurons that originates in what is called the periaqueductal graymatter in the part of the brain stem known as the midbrain. Thisdescending system sends signals downward to the dorsal horns,where it inhibits the transmission of pain signals from theperipheral nerves to ascending tracts. After an injury, it isapparently activated by the body's own optoids (enclorphins andenkephalins). if, as we suggest, the lateral system carries thesignals that give rise to sudden phasic pain, then it is notsurprising that the system is naturally subject to powerfulinhibition. Sudden pain from a newly acquired injury could welloverwhelm an animal, preventing it from fighting, running forcover or burrowing to escape a predator during an emergency. The other pain-signaling system the medial system-differs fromthe lateral system in many ways. For example, a number of itstracts send impulses to the limbic system which comprises thesubcortical regions of the brain involved in motivation andaffect. Hence, we think the medial system controls the emotionalcomponent of pain, producing qualities one might describe aswretched, terrifying, vicious and the like. The system alsoinfluences the actions one takes in response to such feelings. Because the medial system conducts signals relatively slowlythrough many small neurons, it is not well suited for providingprecise information during emergencies. Instead it is more suitedfor producing diffuse, unpleasant feelings for some time after aninjury has occurred. Such feelings would help ensure that, havingsurvived an immediate threat, a wounded individual would feelmiserable and so remain inactive long enough to heal. Where does morphine exert its effects? In both the lateral(phasic-pain) and the medial (tonic-pain) systems,morphineclearly has some direct effect at the dorsal horns. It is alsowell known that morphine can activate the descending inhibitorysystem originating in the periaqueductal gray matter. Abbott andothers in my laboratory have found that this descending systemhas a greater impact on the lateral system than on the medialsystem, which suggests that much of morphine's power over sudden,phasic pain is mediated by the descending neural tracts. TWO SYSTEMS of neurons evoke pain: a medial system (pink),which passes through the central core of the brain stem, and alateral system (orange). Both are bilateral, consist ofseveral tracts and relay to higher centers the pain signals thatcome into the dorsal horns of the spinal cord. The medial systemIs thought to be most responsible for persistent (tonic) pain.Because it sends signals to the limbic system of the brain, Whichinfluences emotions, it is also believed to give rise to theaffective component of pain (reflected by such descriptions as ftfrightful" or "cruel"). The lateral system isthought to be most active during phasic pain, which is sudden andsharp. Because it sends signals to the sensory cortex, itprobably gives rise to such sensations as cramping or stinging.Morphine can inhibit both systems, but the medial (tonic-pain)system develops much less tolerance to the drug's analgesiceffects than does the lateral (phasic-pain) system-which mayexplain why patients who take morphine for persistent (tonic)pain do not develop great tolerance to it. Morphine producesanalgesia in part by inhibiting the flow of pain signals from theperipheral nerves to the ascending pathways; it acts directly atthe dorsal horns and also activates a descending inhibitorysystem (blue) that originates in the midbrain. Morphine also actsat sites above the periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain,including the limbic system and the habenula. which has stronglinks to both the medial and Umbic systems. Such activityapparently contributes to the drug's analgesic effect onpersistent pain. Morphine's analgesic activity certainly is not confined to thedorsal horns and the midbrain. For instance, strong evidenceindicates that morphine acts on the limbic system, which is knownto play a major role in both pain and pleasure. Such activitycould well dampen the pain sensations produced by the medial(tonic-pain) system, which sends a great many impulses to thelimbic system. A recent study by S. Robin Cohen, my student, and myself lendsadditional support to the idea that morphine's influence over themedial system derives in part from activity above the midbrain.We injected morphine into the habenula, a small region of thebrain (just behind the thalamus) that has strong links with thelimbic system and a part of the medial system in the midbrain.The injections produced analgesia in the formalin test but not inthe foot-flick test (similar to the tail-flick test), whichsuggests that morphine acts at the habenula and that, when itdoes, it inhibits the medial but not the lateral system. This finding and others indicate that more research should bedevoted to areas above the midbrain if investigators are to gaina fuller understanding of how morphine eases persistent, tonicpain without inducing tolerance to repeated doses of the drug. In view of the complexity of the neural mechanisms of pain, itis not surprising that morphine's ability to produce analgesiahas been found to vary greatly from person to person. Animportant message emerging from studies of such variation is thatthe need for a high dose is not necessarily a sign of addiction. In one such study involving cancer patients, Robert Kaiko, nowat the Purdue Frederick Company in Norwalk, Conn., and Wscolleagues at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center foundthat to achieve a given level of analgesia, less morphine wasneeded by older patients than by younger patients, and less wasneeded by blacks than by whites. Similarly, patients with dullpain needed less morphine than did those with sharp pain, andpatients with stomach pain needed less morphine than did patientswith pain in the chest or arm. Genetic factors might also influence an individual's responseto the analgesic power of narcotics, as Anthony L. Vaccarino (mystudent), R. Andrew R. Tasker, now at the University of PrinceEdward Island, and I learned recently when we examined theeffects of morphine and its antagonist naloxone in a strain ofmice specially bred for studies of immunologic function weunexpectedly found that the "antagonist" actuallyenhanced morphine analgesia and produced analgesia on its own inrats subjected to the formahn test. These surprising findings,which so far have been documented only for this strain of mice,are clearly the result of a genetic anomaly. The discovery of a genetic influence on morphine's actionsraises the possibility that susceptibility to addiction mightalso have a genetic component in some people. Evidence collectedby other groups is consistent with. that idea, although littlework addresses the problem directly. There is no way to identify patients who might be geneticallypredisposed to morphine addiction, but I must emphasize againthat a person's psychological history is indicative of risk. Morethan 50 percent of narcotics abusers have had bouts of majordepression, and 87 percent have a history of psychiatricdisorder. Society's failure to distinguish between the emotionallyimpaired addict and the psychologically healthy pain sufferer hasaffected every segment of the population. Perhaps the mostdistressing example is unnecessary pain in children Manyhealth-care workers undertreat pain in youngsters, not onlybecause of fear of addiction but also because of the mistakenbelief that young children do not feel pain as intensely asadults. In a classic study, Joann M. Eland and Jane E. Andersonof the University of Iowa found in 1977 that more than half ofthe children from four to eight years old who underwent majorsurgery-including limb amputation, excision of a cancerous neckmass and heart repair-were given no medication for relief oftheir postoperative pain; the remainder received inadequatedoses. When 18 of the children were matched with adults whounderwent similar procedures, the children as a group were foundto have been given a total of 24 doses of analgesic drugs,whereas the adults were given a total of 671 doses. The elderly also pay the penalty of ignorance. In a study ofpostsurgical pain my colleagues and I found that surgical wardscontain two basic populations: a young and middle-aged group thatrecovers quickly and an older group whose pain remains severe andlingers for many days beyond the normal three- to four-dayrecovery period. Despite the persistent, high level of pain inthese older patients (presumably because of complications thatarise after surgery) and despite the longer recovery period, theydo not receive larger doses or a higher daily amount ofmedication. About 30 Percent of the patients on a surgical wardat any time fall into this older category; they thus represent asubstantial number of people who suffer needlessly high levels ofpain. The pain suffered by bum victims is known to be agonizing, andyet it too, tends to be poorly controlled. Manon Choiniare of theBum Center at the Hotel Dieu in Montreal and I found that even inthe best bum facilities-those with highly capable, compassionatephysicians, nurses, physiotherapists and others-pain levels arehigh. Our study of 30 consecutive patients who underwentdebridement and physiotherapy (exercise to prevent loss of jointflexibility) classified the severity of pain on the basis of thePain questionnaire I developed with Torgerson. We discovered thatduring treatment in the first two weeks, 23 Percent had severe("horrible") pain, and 30 percent had extremely severe("excruciating") pain. Even when the Patients were atrest, 13 percent of them reported having severe pain, and another20 percent said they had extremely severe pain. These data, bythe way, were obtained from patients who were already medicatedaccording to standard textbook recommendations (that is, the drugorder said "PRN"). For many patients who are hospitalized for surgery or bums orwho have terminal cancer, the prescription is clear: a preventiveapproach to pain should be instituted to maximize theeffectiveness of narcotics therapy. What, though, should be donefor people who suffer from debilitating chronic pain but who donot have a fatal illness? These people have traditionally beenexcluded from longterm therapy with narcotics, again for fearthey would become addicts. Consider the case of a 26-year-old athlete who sustained amajor spinal injury that caused him to suffer from excruciatingpain in the back and legs. The pain rendered him unable to work,and he became a burden to himself, his family and society, whichpays his medical bills. His physician discovered that small dosesof morphine taken orally each day (the way cancer patientsreceive them) obliterated the pain. With the help of themedication, the young man resumed working and made plans to marryhis childhood sweetheart, who was accepting of his injury. One day, however, the physician was accused by his regionalmedical association of prescribing narcotics for a purposeunapproved by the association and of turning the patient into anaddict. Fearful of losing his medical license, the physicianstopped prescribing the drug. (Where morphine administration isallowed by law, physicians can technically prescribe it at will,but they are in fact restricted by the regulations of medicalsocieties, which control licensing.) Of course, the young man's pain returned. In desperation, heturned to other physicians and was rebuffed. He then sank rapidlyinto depression and again became mired in helplessness andhopelessness. It was once unthinkable to give narcotics indefinitely topatients who were not terminally ill. Yet studies designed toexamine addiction specifically in such patients are beginning toshow that for them, as for the standard candidates for narcoticstherapy, these drugs can be helpful without producing addiction. In one recent study Russell K. Portenoy and Kathleen M. Foleyof SloanKettering maintained 38 patients on narcotics for severe,chronic noncancer pain; half of the patients received opioids forfour or more years, and six of these were treated for morethan seven years. About 60 percent of the 38 patients reportedthat their pain was eliminated or at least reduced to a tolerablelevel. The therapy became problematic in only two patients, bothof whom had a history of drug abuse. With cautious optimism, Portenoy and Foley suggest thatmorphine might be a reasonable treatment for chronic pain in manypatients who are not terminally ill. They point out the problemsthat may accompany narcotics maintenance therapy, and theyprovide careful guidelines for monitoring patients. Studies suchas theirs are doing something in medicine that is akin inaeronautics to breaking the sound barrier. They represent abreakthrough to a reasoned, unbiased examination of theeffectiveness of narcotics in patients who have rarely beenconsidered for such therapy. Among the critics of long-term narcotics therapy for suchpatients are physicians and others who fear that people willsimply be given a prescription for a drug and will never receivethe advantages of a multidisciplinary approach to the care ofpain. Yet both approaches are compatible; in fact, theycomplement each other. For the future, many more well-controlled studies are neededto provide data on the long-term effects of narcotics on chronicnoncancer pain. At the same time, medical and government agenciesmust provide the authorization and funds for such studies to takeplace. The goal is nothing short of rescuing people whose livesare now being ruined by pain. FURTHER READING NARCOTIC ANALGESICS IN CLINTCAL PRACTICE. R.

We are an organization of patients who suffer from chronicpain, their families, the physicians who treat them, and otherinterested citizens. Why is there a need for this organization? There is a crisis in pain treatment in the United States.Many, if not most, patients who are in severe pain find it almostimpossible to get adequate pain medication. My own mother hascalled me asking me if I would understand if she committedsuicide because of her pain. Why don't more people know about this problem? The first reason is that pain patients report thatother people don't want to hear about it. The truth is that it isvery wearing and burdensome psychologically to listen to thetruth about another person's pain, especially when that pain issevere enough that it has caused them to consider suicide. I haveheard from many of them, and I can confess honestly that it ishard to listen to them sometimes, even when you want to help. Ifit is that tiring for me - and I am not in pain - it must be farworse for them. The second reason is that it is hard to be a force forany kind of change in the world when you are in so much pain thatit is difficult to get out of bed, or even move. As bad as thesituation is, there is very little these people can do about it. The third reason is that they die - often because ofthe pain directly when they commit suicide. No one is counting ontheir votes in the next election. How did this happen? The primary reason is the War on Drugs. The drive to restrictnarcotics and other drugs went overboard on this issue from itsvery inception. We have had such a "moral" and legaldrive against narcotics, that it has made it impossible forpatients to get them, even when there is a severe need, and theyare the cheapest, safest, and most effective medicines for pain. The Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 contained a provision whichspecifically allowed doctors to continue prescribing thesemedicines, "in the legitimate practice of medicine". Atthe time the law was written, this clause was intended to allowthe use of narcotics for legitimate medical purposes, such aspain control. However, the drug enforcement officials of the timerealized that, if doctors were allowed to prescribe drugs as theysaw fit for the best interests of their patients, this opened thedoor to heroin maintenance programs, if the doctors thoughtheroin maintenance was in the medical interests of the patient. Therefore, the drug police obtained a court ruling that noprescription of narcotics such as would fit within a"legitimate" medical practice. This created a completeprohibition of some drugs which are recognized safe and effectivemedical pain relievers, such as heroin. After the law was passed, there was considerable protest fromthe medical community about the laws and the way they were beingenforced. To silence the opposition, the drug enforcement policearrested about 3,000 doctors nationwide, focusing on thosedoctors who were involved in drug addiction treatment and weremost vocal against the laws. That campaign against doctorscreated a legacy that has lasted into modern times. Aren't these drugs addictive? Yes, these drugs are addictive for some people. See BasicFacts About the War on Drugs for rankings of addictive qualities.As with all drugs, the great majority of people who use them,particularly for medical purposes, do not suffer from addiction.Major studies of the medical use of drugs such as morphine hasshown that the addiction rate for the medical use of these drugsis under one percent. In all cases, doctors report that they areable to treat the addiction by gradually tapering off themedicine. Where can I learn more about the problem?

It is the first formal statement of its kind in the nationmade by a licensing board. This statement was adopted after a year of testimony athearings held by the Board's Task Force on AppropriatePrescribing and a day-long "Summit," sponsored byGovernor Wilson, involving scores of experts from around thecountry. At the Board's July 28-29 meeting the members will considerformal adoption of a set of guidelines based on this policystatement. The guidelines. once adopted, will be published in theOctober Action Report and other publications read by physicians. Introduction The 1993 report of the Medical Board to the Governor signalleda new beginning in the history of medical regulation inCalifornia. An important part of this initiative isimplementation of the recommendations made by the Board's TaskForce on Appropriate Prescribing, chaired by Jacquelin Trestrail,M.D. The Task Force was established to look into"malprescribing," one of the fastest growing categoriesof physician discipline. The Board continues to be concerned thatcontrolled substances are subject to abuse by individuals whoseek them for their mood altering and other psychologicaleffects, rather than for legitimate medical purposes. The Board is also concerned about effective pain managementand the appropriate medical use of controlled substances. Duringthe Task Force's public meetings, the members heard testimonythat some physicians avoid prescribing controlled substances,including the "triplicate" drugs, for patients withintractable pain for fear of discipline by the Board. The TaskForce recommended that the Board take a pro-active approach toemphasize to all California physicians that it supportsprescribing of opioid analgesics (narcotics) and other controlledsubstances when medically indicated for the treatment of pain,including intractable pain. After careful review of this matter,the Board concurs with the following statement. This statement is consistent with good medical practice,protection of public health and consumer interests, withinternational treaties, federal and California law, including theCalifornia Intractable Pain Treatment Act. THE PAIN PROBLEM The Board recognizes that pain, whether due to trauma,surgery, cancer and other diseases, is often undertreated.Minorities, women, children, the elderly and people with HIV/AIDSare at particular risk for under treatment of their pain.Unrelieved pain has a harsh and sometimes disastrous impact onthe quality of life of people and their families. While some progress is being made to improve pain and symptommanagement, the Board is concerned that a number of factorscontinue to interfere with effective pain management Theseinclude the low priority of pain management in our health caresystem, incomplete integration of current knowledge into medicaleducation and clinical practice, lack of knowledge amongconsumers about pain management, exaggerated fears of opioid sideeffects and addiction, and fear of legal consequences whencontrolled substances are used. PAIN MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY IN CALIFORNIA Principles of quality medical practice dictate that citizensof California who suffer from pain should be able to obtain therelief that is currently available. The Board believes that theappropriate application of current knowledge and treatments wouldgreatly improve the quality of life for many California citizens,and could also reduce the morbidity and the costs that areassociated with uncontrolled pain. In addition to making this statement, the Board will take anumber of steps to help make effective pain management a realityin California. The Board has provided information to all statephysicians about new clinical practice guidelines for painmanagement that have been prepared by a panel of expertssupported by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. TheBoard also co-sponsored and participated in the March 18, 1994Pain Management and Appropriate Prescribing Summit in conjunctionwith the Department of Consumer Affairs on removing impedimentsto appropriate prescribing of controlled substances for effectivepain management. Further, the Board will develop guidelines tohelp physicians avoid investigation if they appropriatelyprescribe controlled substances for pain management. THE APPROPRIATE ROLE OF OPIOID ANALGESICS There are numerous drug and non-drug treatments that are usedfor the management of pain and other symptoms. The propertreatment of any patient's pain depends upon a careful diagnosisof the etiology of the pain, selection of appropriate and costeffective treatments, and ongoing evaluation of the results oftreatment. Opioid analgesics and other controlled substances arcuseful for the treatment of pain, and are considered thecornerstone of treatment of acute pain due to trauma, surgery andchronic pain due to progressive diseases such as cancer. Largedoses may be necessary to control pain if it is severe. Extendedtherapy may be necessary if the pain is chronic. The Board recognizes that opioid analgesics can also be usefulin the treatment of patients with intractable non-malignant painespecially where efforts to remove the cause of pain or to treatit with other modalities have failed. The pain of such patientsmay have a number of different etiologies and may require severaltreatment modalities. In addition, the extent to which pain isassociated with physical and psychosocial impairment variesgreatly. Therefore, the selection of a patient for a trial ofopioid therapy should be based upon a careful assessment of thepain as well as the disability experienced by the patientContinuation of opioid therapy should be based on the physician'sevaluation of the results of treatment, including the degree ofpain relief, changes in physical and psychological functioning,and appropriate utilization of health care resources. Physiciansshould not hesitate to obtain consultation from legitimatepractitioners who specialize in pain management. The Board recommends that physicians pay particular attentionto those patients who misuse their prescriptions, particularlywhen the patient or family have a history of substance abuse thatcould complicate pain management The management of pain in suchpatients requires extra care and monitoring, as well asconsultation with medical specialists whose area of expertise issubstance abuse or pain management The Board believes that addiction should be placed into properperspective. Physical dependence and tolerance are normalphysiologic consequences of extended opioid therapy and are notthe same as addiction. Addiction is a behavioral syndromecharacterized by psychological dependence and aberrant drugrelated behaviors. Addicts compulsively use drugs for nonmedicalpurposes despite harmful effects-, a person who is addicted mayalso be physically dependent or tolerant. Patients with chronicpain should not be considered addicts or habitues merely becausethey are being treated with opioids. PAIN MANAGEMENT, CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND THE LAW The laws and regulations of the federal government and theState of California impose special requirements for theprescribing of controlled substances, including requirements asto the form of the prescription document, so as to prevent harmto the public health that is caused when prescription drugs arediverted to non-medical uses. For example, it is illegal toprescribe controlled substances solely to maintain narcoticaddiction. However, federal and California law clearly recognizethat it is a legitimate medical practice for physicians toprescribe controlled substances for the treatment of pain,including intractable pain. The Medical Board will work with the Drug EnforcementAdministration, the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement, the Office ofthe Attorney General, the Board of Pharmacy and its owninvestigators in an attempt to develop policy and guidelinesbased on the physician's diagnosis and treatment program ratherthan amounts of drugs prescribed. Concerns about regulatory scrutiny should not make physicianswho follow appropriate guidelines reluctant to prescribe oradminister controlled substances, including Schedule 11 drugs,for patients with a legitimate medical need for them. A physicianis not subject to Board action when prescribing in the regularcourse of his or her profession to one under the physician'streatment for a pathology or condition and where the prescriptionis issued after a good faith examination and where there ismedical indication for the drug. Good faith prescribing requiresan equally good faith history, physical examination anddocumentation. The Medical Board may identify a pattern of controlledsubstance use that merits further examination. A private,courteous and professional inquiry can usually determine whetherthe physician is in good faith appropriately prescribing forpatients, or whether an investigation is necessary. The Boardwill judge the validity of prescribing based on the physician'sdiagnosis and treatment of the patient and whether the drugsprescribed by the physician are appropriate for that condition,and will not act on the basis of predetermined numerical limitson dosages or length of drug therapy. The Board hopes to replace practitioners' perception ofinappropriate regulatory scrutiny with recognition of the Board'scommitment to enhance the quality of life of patients byimproving pain management while, at the same time, preventing thediversion and abuse of controlled substances.

Lance Barnett, Ph.D., Interim Director Department of Consumer Affairs July 29, 1994 To: All Participants of the Summit on Effective PainManagement Re: Summit Report from the Summit on Effective PainManagement: Removing Impediments to Appropriate Prescribing We are pleased to share with you the final Summit Report fromthe Summit on Effective Pain Management. This report was producedthrough the joint efforts of many summit participants, sponsors,and the summit planning committee. Although the report processtook longer than we anticipated, we felt it was necessary andimportant to include input from all participants who providedexcellent, thoughtful and feasible recommendations to address theissues and concerns brought to the table at the Summit. Two important outcomes resulted from the Summit: 1) A productive, positive coalition has been created to focusattention and to direct actions to pain management problems andissues. This coalition of health care practitioners, professionaland public educators, academicians, professional associationrepresentatives, pharmaceutical manufacturer representatives,health care consumers, pain patients, regulators and legislatorsis unique and unprecedented. The group now has an opencommunication channel with each other and critical sectors suchas regulators, which can make the necessary changes to improvepain management. 2) Due tlo the Summit, many pain management activities havebeen undertaken and that is a major achievement. The MedicalBoard of California and the Board of Registered Nursing haveadopted policies on pain management. The Board of Pharmacy is inthe process of establishing a similar policy and has agreed tounderwrite a feasibility study to implement an electronicmonitoring system of controlled substances prescriptions byDecember 1, 1994. The Summit has been an effective forum to exchange ideas andinformation, share solutions and take action. We thank all of youwho took the time to give us your comments and input for thedraft report. This Summit Report reflects the energy, interestand dedication that the participants demonstrated throughout theentire summit process. Please feel free to contact Lowayne Shieh at 91 6-324-0794 orother members of the Summit Planning Committee (roster includedin report) if you have questions or comments.

Unrelievedpain impedes recovery from surgery, injury, or illness;interferes with physical functioning and productivity; destroysthe quality of life; and increases the use and cost of healthcare services. However, the reality is that many effective treatments areavailable. Drug treatments include the opioid analgesics andother controlled substances that are the cornerstone of acute andcancer pain management and are also useful for carefully selectedpatients with chronic, noncancer pain. There are also nondrugtreatments, including physical and psychological approaches, thatare effective in pain management. Many patients do not receive effective treatment. Pain isundertreated in our society for many reasons: the low prioritygiven to pain management by our health care system; failure todiagnose pain properly; lack of awareness that much pain can berelieved; incomplete application of existing knowledge;exaggerated fears of addiction; and problems with government andprivate sector attitudes toward controlled substances, healthcare, and reimbursement. Pain is also more likely to beundertreated if the patient is minority, female, elderly, or achild. Significant and widespread concern about the undertreatment ofpain in California has united many diverse groups in the lastseveral years. The Legislature, state agencies, associations ofprofessionals, and concerned health care professionals have takenmajor steps toward effective pain management. The Governor,through the State and Consumer Services Agency, convened thisSummit to examine why pain is undertreated in California and toinitiate collaborative efforts to remove the impediments toappropriate pain management. On March 18, 1994, more than 120 representatives from thehealth, education, legislative, regulatory, and public sectorsexamined the barriers to effective pain management. Participantsmade a number of recommendations that are detailed later in thisreport, including: Inform patients that they are entitled to quality painmanagement and should have informed consent on the choice oftreatment plans for their pain. Establish accountability in the health care system for theassessment and management of pain. Examine the extent to whichinadequately or improperly managed pain leads to additionalhealth care costs, including lack of recovery, slower recovery,and unnecessary and extended hospitalization. Have regulatory boards adopt policies that foster appropriateuse of controlled substances in pain management. Includequestions about pain on licensing examinations for health careprofessionals. Revise laws and regulations that: impede timely access to painmedications by patients; contain confusing standards such as"excessive prescribing;' and appear to ban prescribingcontrolled substances to patients in pain with a history of drugabuse. Replace the triplicate prescription system with an electronicprescription monitoring system as soon as possible. Develop clear standards for evaluating and investigatinginappropriate prescribing methods. Promote ongoing communication among regulators, health carepractitioners, and law enforcement agencies involved inmonitoring or investigating prescription medication. Improve peer review of pain management and general prescribingpractices. Ensure that all patients-receive adequate pain treatmentregardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity, or medical condition. Assure that health care coverage includes pain 'managementservices and medications. Work with California's InsuranceCommissioner and others, including third party payors, Medi-Cal,and MediCare, to examine and remove impediments to: reimbursementfor pain medications; pain assessment; and appropriateconsultation and treatment, including exclusion or limitation onconditions covered or amount of medication covered. Develop a more active role for pain medication manufacturers,including better, more readable drug information, consumerbulletins, and telephone services. Accelerate the education of the public, patients, regulators,and health care professionals about pain management. OVERVIEW OF PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES The Summit helped to identify public policy issues relating tothe management and treatment of chronic pain within California'shealth care, regulatory, and law enforcement environment: 1. California citizens experience significant undertreatmentof acute,cancer-related pain, postoperative pain or other pain,including chronic, nonmalignant pain. 2. There are many important nonpharmacologic methods fortreating pain, but controlled substances, including opioids, playa critical role in pain management. Regulatory mechanisms muststrike a balance between providing timely access to morphine andother Schedule 11 controlled medications that relieve chronicintractable pain, while preventing diversion of those medicationsfor nontherapeutic uses. Currently, there are both government and private sectorimpediments to patients receiving sufficient, timely, andappropriate treatment. There is also a persistent problem withdiversion of some controlled substances from legitimate channels.And at least some current regulatory practices are not achievingtheir purposes. 3. A coalition has emerged that believes that all patientshave a right to adequate pain management and should participatein decisions regarding the treatment and management of theirpain. However, it is not yet current practice for all health careproviders, in all health care settings within the State, toactively involve patients and their caregivers in deciding thecourse of pain management treatment, whether by medication ornonmedication techniques. 4. Patients and their caregivers, health care professionals,and government agencies lack up-to-date knowledge regarding painmanagement and appropriate use of controlled.substances. IMPEDIMENTS To APPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING Pain Assessment Lack of recognition of patient rights and professionalresponsibilities. Lack of interdisciplinary assessment. Failure to use simple, standard assessment techniques alreadyavailable. Development of Treatment Plans Low priority of pain management in the health care system. Financial disincentives by payors. Fear of regulatory intrusion. Prescribing Pain Medication Outdated triplicate prescription system. Unwarranted fears of addiction and side effects. Inadequate use of allied health professionals in long-termcare and hospice settings. Failure to serve the underserved population adequately, suchas rural or inner city patients. Administration of Pain Treatment to the Patient � Regulatory delays in the delivery of medication topatients. � Payor restrictions on payment for pain-related services. � Limited patient and professional knowledge about painmanagement techniques. � Incomplete planning for discharging patients. Ongoing Evaluation Infrequent dialogue between patients and their health careproviders. Diversion of Pain Medication to Nontherapeutic Uses Inability to analyze and use information captured byregulatory and investigative agencies. IMPEDIMENTS To APPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING Summit participants addressed the significant undertreatmentof acute, cancer related and other pain, including chronic,nonmalignant pain. Participants recognized that every person orentity that is involved in providing care or that regulateshealth care practitioners must acknowledge that patients have theright to receive and participate in appropriate pain management. A variety of regulatory and nonregulatory factors may impedeeffective pain management. These factors are arranged in sectionsthat roughly parallel the delivery of pain care to patients. Impediments to Pain Assessment Patients, their family members, and allied health careprofessionals assess and report pain. However, patients are oftenunaware of their rights and responsibilities regarding painmanagement, including that pain can usually be treated anddoesn't have to be the "price" of illness or disease. Many chronic-pain patients believe that health care providersoften presume to know how much pain their patients experience,don't really believe what their patients say, or are not asinterested in treating the pain as they are in treating thedisease. Patients report pain but often are not provided withuniversal tools such as pain assessment questionnaires ormethodologies that provide physicians with feedback toappropriately manage treatment. Nurses, pharmacists, and others in the patient-care chain arecritical to the management of pain, including properadministration of pain medication, reporting changes in thetolerance to medication, and triggering timely followupassessment. This interdisciplinary, ongoing pain assessment iscritical but is often weakened by caregivers, professionals, andnonprofessionals alike, who are not familiar with their role inpain management. Impediments to Development of Treatment Plans Pain management is a low priority in the health care system.Medication and nonmedication approaches to managing pain and itsside effects are often afterthoughts in developing a patient'streatment plan because of outdated knowledge of and attitudestoward pain management, as well as an antiquated approach toprescribing controlled substances. Financial disincentives by payors can needlessly limit andbias pain treatment. Insurance company managers and otherpersonnel lack an understanding and acceptance of pain managementwhich can result in: denial of coverage; lack of access tocertain pain management procedures and medication; or use of moreexpensive and often less effective treatments. Additionally, as long as physicians are fearful of regulatoryintrusion, they will continue to undertreat pain. Fear ofreprisal often overrides appropriate, aggressive use of drugs. Impediments to Prescribing Pain Medication The triplicate prescription system-which must be used whenSchedule 11 controlled substances are prescribed-is outdated,impractical for many modern health care settings (especiallylong-term care), and generally ineffective for monitoring andcontrolling diversion of medications for nontherapeutic purposes.Because of the administrative complexities of and impliedintimidation by the triplicate system, almost half ofCalifornia's physicians have chosen not to seek prescribingprivileges for Schedule 11 medications. This system of oversightis often viewed as persecution by physicians and pharmacists, andthe result is that patients in pain suffer. Unwarranted fears of opioid addiction and side effects stillexist among practitioners, and especially among the public,patients, and their caregivers. As the Medical Board ofCalifornia, in its statement 'Prescribing Controlled Substancesfor Pain,' concluded, minorities, women, children, the elderly,and people with HIV/AIDS are at particular risk forundertreatment of their pain. State law implies that drug addicts should be treateddifferently for pain or not treated for pain at all. Laws andregulations are inflexible in addressing this population ofpatients. Impediments to Administration of Pain Treatment Summit participants gave many examples of how the triplicateprescription system also delays the delivery of medication topatients. First, over half of California physicians do not writetriplicate prescriptions. Both prescribers and pharmacists findthe triplicate form cumbersome and time-consuming to use andprocess. Even minor errors can invalidate the triplicate,requiring that the entire process be repeated. Pharmacies experience a delay in the receipt of Schedule 11opioids due to minor, inadvertent discrepancies on DEA form 222that can compromise patient care. In emergency circumstances, therequirement that the distributors and manufacturers receive DEAForm 222 prior to the shipment of Schedule 11 drugs can result inpatient hardship. Third-party payors often restrict payment for pain-relatedservices, especially for Medicare and Medi-Cal patients. Patients' and caregivers' knowledge of pain management and theappropriate use of controlled substances and other painmanagement techniques is limited. Educational materials availableto prescribing physicians for distribution to their patients areequally limited. This intensifies patient and caregivermisgivings and misunderstandings and complicates compliance andeducation issues. When patients leave hospitals and are transported to otherfacilities, continuity of pain treatment is frequently ignored.Patients frequently do not receive an adequate supply ofmedication for effective pain management. Impediments to Ongoing Evaluation Pain management, whether drug or nondrug-based treatment,requires that patients and their health care providers discusswith each other the effectiveness of various treatment methodsand dosage levels. Payors are often unwilling to reimburse healthprofessionals for sufficient ongoing pain evaluation, and in someinstances set artificial limits on the amount of drug and nondrugtreatments, services, or both. Diversion of Pain Medication to Nontherapeutic Uses Participants recognized that drug diversion is a problem inCalifornia that must be controlled. Participants. validated theneed for vigilance and oversight but stressed the importance ofbalancing that need with relieving the suffering of people inpain. Regulators, health care professionals, and patients agree thatthe current regulatory structure fails to provide good data thatcan identify and reduce diversion. There is limited ability to analyze information captured bythe regulatory system in a timely manner and use it to controldiversion. SUMMIT RECOMMENDATIONS Participants recognized that any solution to the problem ofinadequate pain management requires the cooperative efforts ofregulators, practitioners, patients, payors, and the public toeducate themselves regarding the nature of pain, the extent ofpain, and pain management itself. Participants acknowledged that drug diversion is a problem inCalifornia which must be controlled. Participants discussed thenature and extent of statutes and regulation, and the regulatoryand law enforcement activity that is necessary to control theproblem without hampering medical care. The following sections categorize the recommendationsaccording to the groups that the summit participants believe arethe best, most effective agents for change. Each section includesconsensus recommendations, as well as other input that wasreceived but to which not everyone agreed. Recommendations for Legislators to Consider Our legislators should provide continuing leadership for painmanagement by assessing the value of laws, regulations, andpolicies concerning the prescribing, dispensing, or administeringof controlled substances. Legislators should strike a balancebetween the efficacy of identifying and controlling abuses, thescope of the problem, and interfering with legitimate medicalcare. The following legislative changes were recommended: Replace the requirement for a special, state-issuedprescription form (triplicate system) with electronic monitoringof controlled substances prescriptions that can foster better,more effective pain management and better diversion detection.Ensure that any such system is based on sound principles, such asthose set out in the model Uniform Controlled Substances Act andin the report of the Controlled Substances Prescription AdvisoryCouncil. The Board of Pharmacy has agreed to underwrite thefeasibility study to implement this recommendation, and thereport will be due December 1, 1994. Electronic monitoring must be able to track diversion ofcontrolled substances by prescribers, pharmacists, and patients. Until the triplicate system is replaced, reduce the burden onphysicians, pharmacists and patients to avoid disrupting goodpain control. For example, no triplicate should be needed ifthere is a written order in medical records of a licensed healthcare agency. Similarly telephone or faxed prescriptions should beaccepted under certain circumstances. Revise laws and regulations to reflect the current practicesof those involved in pain management, especially in emerginghealth care settings. (increased costs of hospitalization haveencouraged the use of nonhospital settings. Today we see greaterreliance on skilled nursing facilities, long-term carefacilities, and earlier release to home settings.) Eliminate the apparent prohibition on prescribing controlledsubstances to those with a history of drug abuse. People in painshould receive effective treatment regardless of whether theyhave a dependency problem. Clarify or eliminate confusing or outdated statutoryprovisions, including "clearly excessive prescribing ordispensing" of controlled substances and the use of theterms "addict" and "habitual user." Evaluate mail-order restrictions on drugs, includinglimitations on the number of doses, and the impact of suchrestrictions on patient well-being. Identify funding sources for the Food and Drug Section of theCalifornia Department of Health Services to eliminate delays inthe evaluation of new drugs and devices. Other Input for Legislators to Consider Oklahoma and several other states have approved coordinatedlegislation and regulations that streamline the regulatorymechanism, yet provide good data with which to control possiblediversion of medications. California can and should use thesemodels as a starting point for improving the effectiveness of itsregulatory mechanisms. In long-term care, hospice care, and certain other health caresettings, other health professionals are closer to patients thanphysicians. These health professionals should be considered forprivileges to legally prescribe or regulate the dosage ofcontrolled substances in response to a patient's daily medicalcondition. Address issues of personal liability and prosecution forprescribing a Schedule II opioid for treatment of acute pain(i.e., postoperative), chronic intractable pain, or cancer painto a patient with a known substance abuse history. Ensure that individuals who are prescribed opioids for chronicpain are not denied employment or discharged solely based on drugscreening that is used increasingly. as an employment screeningtool. Create, by statute, a positive legal duty to effectively treatpain and suffering, such as: Doctors (e.g., MD, DO, DIVID, DPM)have a duty to effectively treat the pain and suffering of apatient. Effective pain and suffering treatment is that providedby current clinical practice guidelines on pain management issuedby the US Department of Health and Human Services, or thatfollowed by clinicians who specialize in pain management. Doctorshave a duty to effectively treat pain, including appropriatereferral to and periodic review by clinicians who specialize inpain management. Create a controlled substances credential for physicians thatrequires ongoing education in pain management and appropriateprescribing. Legislate pain management education as a requirement forlicensure. Be careful what we legislate. Develop a standard that isissued and administered by boards, but one that is not toolegislatively detailed that we might regret it later. Incorporate the White House model on Electronic Data Transfer(EDT) programs. Health care facilities should demonstrate a minimum standardof pain management by the end of 1996, using federal guidelinesas reference standards. Recommendations for Regulators to Consider Develop and promote positive statements on pain management andthe appropriate use of controlled substances by the medical,nursing, pharmacy, dental, podiatry, physician assistant andosteopathic boards, and the Department of Consumer Affairs. Anexample of such a statement is the draft policy statementcirculated to Summit participants by the Medical Board ofCalifornia on May 6, 1994 (see attachment). The Board ofRegistered Nursing has also adopted a pain management policy (seeattachment). When electronic monitoring is implemented, take intoconsideration the unique needs of specialty practices and painpatients. Some patients need high doses of opioids for extendedperiods. Take into consideration that unusual prescribing practices aresometimes necessary to take care of patients in pain. Develop and communicate to licensees clear standards forevaluation and investigation of inappropriate prescribing anddispensing. Avoid standards that rely on volume or duration ofprescribing without taking into account the nature of theprescriber's practice and the condition for which a particularcontrolled substance is prescribed. Ensure that government uses consultants and experts who arecurrently involved in either pain management or the licensee'sfield of practice. Promote ongoing communication among regulators, practitioners,and legislators, so that all are sensitized to the impact of painmanagement laws and regulations. Likewise, maintain communicationand cooperation among the various regulatory and law enforcementagencies involved in monitoring or investigating prescriptioncontrolled substances practices. Ensure that neither laws and regulations nor health carefacility policies interfere with the ability of patients,especially cancer patients who are discharged from one facilityto another or from a facility to home care, to have anuninterrupted supply of adequate analgesics. Include questions on pain management in health careprofessional licensure examinations and encourage revision ofprofessional school curricula to include adequate coverage ofpain management in Undergraduate and postgraduate training. Simplify and clarify federal policy regarding the use offederal controlled substance order forms, including emergencytransfer of controlled substances from a manufacturer ordistributor to pharmacies which have run out of a controlledsubstance. Examine other federal provisions which governemergency supplies of controlled substances. Clarify federalenforcement policy governing minor, inadvertent errors oncontrolled substance order forms. There was a clear consensus at the Summit that professionaleducation in pain management techniques and appropriateprescribing is a critical component of addressing these issues.There was not, however, consensus on whether this continuingeducation should be mandated by regulation or legislation. Otherinput on this topic included: Legislation requiring physician education or competence inpain management will likely breed resentment and reducedeffectiveness. A better strategy would be to encourageeducational attempts to improve the skills of training andpracticing physicians by engaging the profession in a positiveprogram to find a solution that will improve the care of theirpatients. This summit is a landmark for pain education and treatment.However, until state boards put their licensed members on noticethat a lack of basic knowledge about pain, pain assessment,drugs, and treatment is not the standard of practice for patientcare, little will change. Even federal guidelines have not had animpact. The state should mandate that all licensed members mustdemonstrate updated basic pain management skills by a set date -say 1996. There would be a vertical learning curve - which wouldresult in less patient suffering, less pain related medicalcosts, less time spent time away from work, and savings forprivate and government payors. Currently, medical professionals must acquire extensive,additional education to learn the multitude of regulatorystatutes. This is a real disincentive to learn or change practiceif that change increases liability. A teacher at an academicmedical center can teach the clinical issues to students andpractitioners, but they are 're-educated' by regulatory issuesand concerns shared by practicing colleagues. Just as real estate brokers and lawyers are required to have acourse in ethics as part of their mandatory continuing educationrequirements, licensed health care professionals should have amandatory course in effective pain management or aself-assessment test on pain management as part of theirlicensing requirements. Other input on the triplicate system included: Until the triplicate program is replaced, could the Bureau ofNarcotic Enforcement send the triplicates preseparated and inlarger quantities to prevent the need for monthly, half-yearly,or yearly prescriptions orders, which are not in a patient's bestinterest? It is interesting that the only members of the participatingpanel who are in favor of triplicates are the lay members. It isdifficult enough to obtain a sufficient supply of triplicatesthat are received in a timely manner and are reliable andreproducible. It takes more than four minutes to properly fillout a triplicate and most MDs cannot allow a patient to talkwhile the triplicate is being written for tear of making anerror. Other Input for Regulators to Consider Phone authorization is not a solution in many cases. As apharmacist who has worked in a community pharmacy, you do notknow all the MDs who may call your pharmacy. As a pharmacist, youand your staff's safety is always in the back of your mind. Ifsomeone you do not know calls asking it you carry triplicatedrugs, you say 'no.' It only takes looking down one shotgunbarrel for you to tell a white lie. For phone authorization towork, it is imperative to educate MDs to talk with pharmacists intheir area and let them know their prescribing patterns. Ifcommunication between MDs and pharmacists occurs, obtaining thesemedications in California will be much easier. Long-term care, home health and hospice practitioners needauthorization for an emergency controlled substances kit. A72-hour supply of Schedule 11 drugs should be available forhospice, long-term care, and home health settings. Nurse practitioners often serve as the most accessible primarycare providers for people in California's rural communities.Eight states currently allow prescribing of controlled substancesby nurse practitioners. Can California follow their lead? I practice medicine in a large group, and my patients' recordsare typed and quite complete. When I am away, some of thepatients for whom I care run out of medication and call one of mypartners for a refill. The rule that there must be a "goodfaith' exam if more than 72 hours of pain medication are to beprescribed is a great imposition on my patients, who, by lawmust: 1) make an unnecessary and expensive trip to the physician;or 2) try to get by for however long it is until I return. Thisrule should be revised to at least encompass situations in whichadequate records are available. Reviews should be performed by those who have knowledge of andare sensitive to the practice setting being investigated.Reviewers should be practicing in the same medical area. Require health care facilities to demonstrate minimumstandards of pain management for licensure after 1996. U.S.Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for Acute andCancer Pain Management can be used as reference standards. Recommendations for Consumers and Their Caregivers toConsider Summit participants agreed that consumers will get changes inpain management when they demand them. They can't wait forphysicians to provide those changes. For example, detection ofbreast and prostate cancer are areas where consumers havedemanded and received changes in standard practice from theirphysicians. Ensure that patients are informed of their rights, includingthe alternatives for pain management and treatment, and that theyexercise informed consent. Ensure that every patient knows he orshe is entitled to receive adequate treatment for pain and tohave his or her reports of pain believed. Ensure that patients ortheir caregivers receive adequate consultation about drug therapyfrom the prescriber, dispenser, or other qualified health careprofessional. Make use of the many consumer publications and groups,including those which target special groups such as minorities,women, children, and the elderly, to communicate rights topatients, their caregivers and the public. Distribute the Agencyfor Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) patient guidelines topharmacies and to other appropriate health care settings,including all cancer care facilities. Ensure that misinformation based on race, ethnicity, gender,and age factors does not affect the treatment of pain. Educate members of the media, including television, print, andradio about the importance of pain management as a part of thehealth care reform agenda. The public and private sectors must work together to useconsumer research to develop a campaign the public will accept. Other Input for Consumers and Their Caregivers to Consider The message of the war on drugs is adversely affecting publicattitudes toward medical use of controlled substances. We need torecognize that substance abuse is primarily a medical, not acriminal, problem. Recommendations for Health Care Professionals to Consider Increase and improve the education of health careprofessionals, including: current standards of pain management,available tools to assess the nature and severity of pain, andpatients as the best source of information about their pain. Recognize that proper management of pain often includes bothdrug and nondrug therapy, and proper initial and ongoingassessments, including: (1) more individualized pain treatmentthat is based on a patient's report, presenting condition, andcurrent and past physical, social, and psychological conditionand treatment; (2) standardized questionnaires assessing thephysical, psychological, social, and cultural factors affectingpain, administered by appropriately trained health carepersonnel; and (3) interdisciplinary involvement by doctors,nurses, pharmacists, psychotherapists, and others. Better professional and ongoing education on adequate painmanagement is critical and must include: � Education on patient rights to pain management andmedication; � Revision of professional school curricula to includeadequate coverage of pain management issues in undergraduate andpostgraduate training; � Offering enough continuing education programs that addressthe issues of physicians whose knowledge is dated; and � Education on nondrug pain management techniques beyondmedication. A number of comments argued for mandating pain managementeducation, but Summit participants did not come to a consensus onwhether mandates were the most appropriate way to motivatephysicians and other health care professionals. Recommendations for Payors to Consider Summit participants generally agreed that pain management isgiven a very low priority by payors. The comment that bestreflects the discussion is "they think they [payors] aresaving money, but they're not." Payors should assess the total cost of leaving their patientsin pain. They should update their policies, standards, andguidelines for reimbursement to reflect that effectively managedpain can return patients to active, productive lives. Suchassessment and change can result in lower total health carecosts. Work with California's Insurance Commissioner and others,including both public and private third party payors, to examineways to remove impediments to reimbursement for pain medications,pain assessment, appropriate consultation, and treatment,including exclusions of or limitations on conditions covered oramounts of drugs covered. Examine the extent to which inadequately or improperly managedpain leads to additional health care costs, including lack ofrecovery, slower recovery, unnecessary hospitalization andextended hospitalization. The State Insurance Commissioner should begin a dialogue withpayors who do business in California to initiate the studiesrecommended above to assess whether payors' pain managementpractices require regulation. Other Input for Payors to Consider Payors impose more prior approval requirements for painmanagement than for other procedures. Measure the outcome of patients treated for intractable painthrough the increased use of Health Assessment Questionnaires(HAOs). Many authorities (e.g., J.F. Fries, T. Pincus, etc.) haveshown that these instruments are accurate, reproducible andstatistically superior to many more commonly used medical tests.Unfortunately the insurance industry, which will pay for MagneticResonance Imaging (MRI), will not pay for the administering andgrading HAQs. Many comments mentioned unreasonable and clinicallycounterproductive Medicare guidelines for reimbursement of painmanagement visits and medications. One example is: Medi-Cal patients are subject to limited reimbursement ofnarcotics, and these limits must be addressed. I have had limitedincome Medi-Cal patients who are forced to choose between buyingpain agents and other necessities. For example, reimbursement islimited to acetaminophen and aspirin with codeine. Recommendations for Law Enforcement Agencies, including theEnforcement Divisions of Regulatory Bodies, to Consider Publish and circulate the enforcement philosophy and stateboard guidelines (such as those recently issued by the MedicalBoard of California) to reduce fear of inappropriate punishmentamong ethical members of the medical community and to increasefear of discipline or arrest among those diverting narcotics fornontherapeutic uses. Other Input for Law Enforcement Agencies, Including theEnforcement Divisions of Regulatory Bodies, to Consider Punish only those who really need punishment. Read and enforcethe spirit of the law, rather than fostering fear of the letterof the law. Experts in pain management must communicate with regulatorsand law enforcement professionals to curb abuses. Diversion may not be as big a problem as many think. Apharmacist in a San Diego hospital once estimated that the legalsupplies of all opioids in the pharmacies in San Diego would notsupply San Diego street addicts for twenty four hours. Ongoing, mandatory interagency cooperation is essential. Recommendations for Manufacturers to Consider Participants felt drug manufacturers should be full members ofany coalition interested in finding more effective treatments forpeople in pain. Participants recommended that manufacturersshould be more proactive in educating patients, includingdeveloping better, more readable drug information, consumerbulletins, and telephone services. These recommendations included: Have health care providers and consumer advocacy groupsprovide manufacturers with input on what types of consumerinformation to develop. For example: print inserts in large type,develop simpler language, include benefits not just potentialcomplications, and sponsor consumer bulletins. Provide telephone assistance numbers so that patients cancontact knowledgeable health professionals in addition to theirprimary health care provider, or give patients the names ofadvisory groups and consumer advocacy groups. Expedite delivery of pain medication to the patient, whichwill require improved efficiency of tracking mechanisms withfederal and state regulators, especially for emergency suppliesof medication. One participant noted a patient w as deniedemergency supplies of medication that were legally prescribedbecause of a typographical error on the IDEA form 222. DEA'senforcement penalties are overly punitive for minor recordkeeping discrepancies. Broaden the manufacturers' role in professional education,from specific use of medication to basic pain management skills. Note that manufacturers can and do support legislative effortsas well as outcomes research. PRIOR AND ONGOING PAIN MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 1990 Senator Leroy Greene sponsored the Intractable Pain TreatmentAct in 1990, making California the second state to specificallyrecognize by statute the importance of the use of controlledsubstances in the treatment of intractable pain. 1992 In December 1992, a professional symposium on pain management,including regulatory impediments, was held at the University ofCalifornia at San Francisco. Senator Robert Presley sponsored a resolution that establishedthe Controlled Substances Prescription Advisory Council (Council)to examine the triplicate prescription program, alternativemethods of monitoring and enforcing the laws, and regulationsgoverning drug diversion. 1993 Senator Leroy Greene sponsored legislation in 1993 thatrequires the Medical Board of California to ensure that itslicensees are made aware of the Intractable Pain Treatment Actand federal clinical practice guidelines for the treatment ofacute, post-surgical, and cancer pain. Assembly Member Jack O'Connell sponsored Assembly ConcurrentResolution (ACR) 34 in 1993. The resolution directs the MedicalBoard of California to conduct and complete a survey of medicalschool curricula to determine whether medical students receiveadequate training in pain management and palliative care of theterminally ill. The resolution also directs the Board todetermine whether physicians and surgeons adequately understandpain management and palliative care for the terminally ill and toreport their recommendations to the Legislature for modificationsin medical school curricula to ensure physicians and surgeonshave adequate training this area. In December 1993, the Council issued a landmark report,recommending the implementation of electronic monitoring ofcontrolled substances prescriptions in place of the triplicateprescription program and numerous reforms of laws, regulations,and practices governing drug diversion monitoring, investigation,and enforcement. It recognized the importance of using controlledsubstances for medical purposes and the problem of undertreatingpain as well as the problem of abuse of controlled substances. In early 1993, a forum on pain management and regulatoryissues was proposed and was in initial planning stages at theDepartment of Consumer Affairs, when the Medical Board ofCalifornia's task force issued its report. In February 1993, the University of California at Los Angelesheld a symposium on barriers to effective health care; in October1993, a similar program entitled "Cancer Pain, Opiates andthe Law' was held at the California Cancer Center in Fresno. InNovember 1993, a similar program was held at Cedars-Sinai in LosAngeles, at which time the Southern California Cancer PainInitiative was organized. During 1993, the Medical Board of California established atask force on appropriate prescribing. Its report recommendedthat a pain forum be held and that the Board create a statementon the need for effective pain management. [The draft statementwas circulated to Summit attendees, and the final statement -wasadopted in May 1994 (see attachment); the Board is now adoptingGuidelines for Pain Management; the Board of Registered Nursinghas also adopted a policy and curriculum guidelines on painmanagement (see attachment); the Board of Pharmacy is in theprocess of doing so.] Assembly Member Richard Polanco sponsored Assembly Bill (AB)2155 in 1993 which would have established a pain managementcommittee to, among other things, clarify standards forappropriate procedures and techniques for the management ofacute, chronic, or intractable pain, study the impact of thetriplicate prescription program on prescribing and dispensing forpain, and examine the adverse impact of the undertreatment ofpain. The Governor vetoed AB 2155 but agreed that the proponents ofsuch a committee made: "...a compelling argument that themedical community and law enforcement community need to worktogether in a cooperative fashion to make certain patients arereceiving medically necessary pain treatment..... The Governor directed the State and Consumer Services Agencyto establish a committee with representatives from various healthboards to work with the Attorney General "...on appropriatepain management procedures and recommendations on how to overcomethe obstacles that contribute to inadequate pain management.' 1994 The March 18, 1994 Effective Pain Management Summit is theresult of the Governor's mandate, and a culmination of the manyother activities and legislation described above. The Medical Board of California, along with the CaliforniaMedical Association, the Board of Pharmacy, the Board of DentalExaminers, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Department ofConsumer Affairs, and the State and Consumer Services Agencybecame sponsors of the Summit on Effective Pain Management.

Among the most tragicvictims are those whose lives are consumed by chronic,intractable pain. Although narcotics can frequently help, they are typicallyavoided or given at inadequate levels. A number of factors areinvolved, including the fear of patient addiction and the threatof disciplinary action f or overprescribing. In addition, pain isdifficult for the patient to describe and the physician toevaluate. Whatever the reason, the result is often unnecessarysuffering. Evidence is steadily accumulating that persons withintractable pain do not respond to narcotics in the same way asdo street addicts. Their motivations are different, and so aretheir psychological reactions and tolerances to the drugs. Thepain patient can be treated with narcotics with little risk ofdeveloping the self-destructive behavior characteristic ofaddiction--even though dosages may sometimes far exceed the"normal." The public needs to know that more can and should be done forthose people with chronic pain. THE PAINFUL DILEMMA Albert Schweitzer once said: "We must all die. But if I can save him from days oftorture, that is what I feel is my great and ever new privilege.Pain is a more terrible lord of mankind than even deathitself." Everybody has suffered from pain--especially the intense acutePain that flares up when a toe is stubbed or a finger burned.That pain soon goes away. But at least 20 million Americanssuffer from chronic pain that lasts for weeks or months--or maynever go away. Most of its victims are the middle-aged and theelderly. The most common form is low back pain, which arises fromosteoartharitis or other causes, and is estimated to afflict 15percent of the population. Cancer patients often suffer severepain as their condition worsens. Burn victims may haveexcruciating pain during recovery. Chronic pain includes tensionand migraine headaches. Individuals with arthritis often sufferfrom chronic pain. In fact, chronic pain is one of the nation's most costlyhealth problems. The price tag each year comes to nearly $50billion for medical costs, lost income, lost productivity,compensation payments and legal costs. To the individual, the impact can be devastating bothpersonally and professionally. Severe pain can impair sleep andappetite, and it can trigger anxiety, frustration and depression.Over time, pain can lower self-esteem and bring on significantpsychological problems. Pain can destroy the will to live. As common as it is, pain can be extremely elusive. The patientmay have difficulty describing it, and the physician often cannotsubstantiate it. An individual in acute pain may scream andwrithe in agony; but the person with chronic pain often appearsoutwardly normal, with few visible signs. Although much remains to be learned about the mechanism ofpain, we know individuals have different levels of tolerance topain. There are also differences in individual sensitivity todrugs, and in how drugs are metabolized. Studies indicate thatpain relief from opiates varies by age, race, culturaldifferences, type of pain and location of pain. Because the effectiveness of pain medication varies greatlyfrom person to person, a patient's need for a high dose is notnecessarily a sign of addiction. Treatment of pain A variety of methods are used to treat chronic pain. They mayinclude acupuncture, biofeedback and other relaxation techniques,physical therapy, psychotherapy, hypnosis, behavior modification,nerve block by injection and transcutaneous electrical nervestimulation (TENS). In addition, cancer patients who suffer painmay benefit from radiation therapy. Surgery can alter theperception of pain, modify conduction of pain along pathways ofthe central nervous system, or, as a last resort, block pain bycutting nerve bundles. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents,antidepressants and anticonvulsants are among the medicationsthat can be used. Despite the variety of treatments available, a substantialnumber of pain patients are not helped. Even some of those'successfully treated must learn to live with pain. Narcotics are extremely effective for pain relief, but theirlong term use has been avoided because of the potential foraddiction. Included are "opiates" like morphine andcodeine, which are derived from opium, and "opioids"like heroin and methadone, which are synthetic or semi-syntheticcompounds with similar properties. Opiate therapy is now generally used for burn victims andterminal cancer patients, and for shorter periods for hospitalpatients who have undergone surgery. The standard prescription isPRN (pro re nata, or "as needed"). In effect the ordermeans medication is to be given only after pain returns. However, by the time the pain is treated, it may be so severethat a larger dose, with greater side effects, is needed.Undertreatment can occur when surgery patients have a longercourse of recovery than normal, and for young patients. Regulatory efforts Narcotic analgesics are noted not only for their ability torelieve pain--but- also for their widespread abuse. Attempts to curtail drug abuse have led to a wide range of lawenforcement activities. One of the most visible in the medicalsetting is the system of triplicate prescriptions required for anumber of drugs. One copy of a prescription is retained by thephysician, a second sent to the pharmacist, and the third to theDrug Enforcement Agency. Triplicate prescriptions are frequentlyused to identify physicians who may be overprescribing. Overprescribing of narcotics, stimulants and other drugsaccounts for almost 20 percent of the disciplinary actions takenby the Medical Board of California (or MBC, formerly the Board ofMedical Quality Assurance). In 1982, the physician who was then the MBC's medicalconsultant declared in an interview sent out to all licensedphysicians in California: "We have two kinds of doctors who get into trouble (foroverprescribing narcotics)--'script doctors' and 'wellintentioned' doctors. The 'well-intentioned' doctor may appear asa 'nice guy, I but he is really naive or, in some cases, notkeeping up with present day prescribing standards. The 'scriptdoctor' is one who usually knows he is breaking the law andwrites prescriptions for controlled substances purely forprofit." He gave no indication that prescribing high amounts ofnarcotics over the long term might be acceptable. The traditional view The interview reflected the traditional view that long-termnarcotics use by anyone inevitably leads to addiction: the bodylearns to tolerate the drugs, and demands ever escalating doses;abuse begins as a search for euphoria, and eventually conditionedreflexes cause an irresistible craving for the narcotic. Thisescapist-conditioning explanation dominated medical thinking andpublic health policy for three decades and is still widely held. For example, a June, 1990, issue of the Mayo Clinic's MedicalEssay newsletter warns: "Opiates can cause drowsiness, nausea, constipation andmood changes. In addition ' extended use of opiates can lead totolerance--the body becomes accustomed to certain amounts of thedrug and no longer responds as well to it. Because of theinevitable addiction that accompanies chronic opiate use, theiruse in treating pain should be extremely limited." There are problems with that point of view. Some so-called"chippers" who abuse drugs occasionally do not. becomeaddicted. Many veterans of the Vietnam War used narcotics extensivelywhile overseas, but abruptly discontinued use after returninghome without subsequent readdiction. It was discovered that long-term addicts could be maintainedwith methadone at a high, though stable, dose. Individuals couldthen function with minimal side effects. Experience with cancer patients led to a major change inthinking. Except for an initial increase in dose, there waslittle evidence of growing tolerance to narcotics. "The cancer patient has thus served as a model todemonstrate that opioids can be used on a chronic basis inpatients with pain, and this insight has given a greater insightinto the clinical pharmacology effects of these drugs,"writes neurologist Kathleen Foley in a 1990 monograph on painmanagement. "For example, chronic use of opioids in thecancer patient has demonstrated that physical dependence occurs,but psychological dependence or 'addiction' is rare, if notnonexistent." Many addicts claim to have been hooked by medical care, andolder studies indicated perhaps 10 percent of addicts started offthat way. However, a major study in 1980 showed abuse developedin only 4 of 11,882 patients given opiates while hospitalized; inonly one instance was the abuse considered major. In recent years, self-infusion pumps have been introducedwhich allow patients after surgery to give themselves limiteddoses of narcotics to control pain. There were fears the processwould create a new population of drug addicts. Instead, theamount of narcotics used by patients has been the same or lessthan under the old PRN method. Emerging concepts It now seems clear there is a major difference between addictsseeking euphoria and individuals seeking relief from pain. Thetraditional perception is that the reactions of street addictsare simply a more extreme expression of what happens to chronicpain patients. However, drug addicts behave as if obtaining and using drugsare primary drives--akin to eating, sleeping or sex. They takedrugs to get high and are frequently lost to themselves, theirfamilies and society. In contrast, the person with chronic pain takes drugs toreturn to normal and to get on with life. Narcotics allowindividuals with pain to interact with their families and toreturn to work. Pain patients overcome most of the side effectsof the narcotics. The pain patient's entire behavior is aimed at getting relieffrom pain, just as the addict's efforts are aimed at obtainingdrugs. Unlike an addict, the typical pain patient experienceslittle or no euphoria from narcotics. Except for an initialincrease in dosage, there is little indication of increasingtolerance. Withdrawing from drugs is a major hurdle for addicts,but for the pain patient withdrawal is typically uncomplicated. Why the different reaction to opiates? chronic pain signalstravel to the brain by a different nerve pathway than do suddenor "Phasic" pain signals. One prominent researcherbelieves the chronic pathway develops relatively little toleranceto morphine, so does not demand constantly escalating doses. New definitions of abuse Along with recent medical developments have come redefinitionsof the key terms of drug abuse. All long-term users of narcoticsbecome physically dependent: if drugs are suddenly discontinued,their bodies react with sweating, aches, nausea or otherwithdrawal symptoms. That physical dependence was once virtuallysynonymous with addiction, but is no longer. The American Society of Addiction Medicine now definesaddiction as the abuse of any psychoactive substance withcompulsion and loss of control despite adverse consequences. Similarly, an American Medical Association Task Forcedescribes addiction as a chronic disorder characterized by"the compulsive use of a substance-resulting in physical,psychological or social harm to the user and continued usedespite the harm." "Psychological dependence,"which emphasizes the compulsive use of drugs, is now often usedinterchangeably with the term addiction. Under the older definition, anyone who became physicallydependent could be viewed as an "addict"--including thepain patient on narcotics. The newer definition distinguishesbetween the pain patient trying to put a life back together andthe self-destructive addict trying to achieve euphoria. Physicians and pain patients Despite the changing perceptions of pain and addiction,physicians are generally ambivalent about the use of narcotics.Most physicians were trained under older concepts of drugaddiction--as are many current medical students. Pain expertstoday still disagree about the proper use of narcotics. Even a supposedly safe practice--giving narcotics to terminalcancer patients--has its own quandaries. It is sometimescriticized for placing medical care nearer to euthanasia. In ahighly publicized case in early 1990, the morphine-related deathsof two terminally ill patients in the Minneapolis area were ruledby the coroner to be homicides. There is constant pressure for more discipline of physicians.A recent example is a draft report of the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services which says data strongly suggest"the universe of potentially actionable events far exceedsthe number of disciplinary actions actually imposed by the(state) boards." Physicians are also aware of the ongoing disciplinary actionsagainst doctors for overprescribing drugs, usually narcotics. As a consequence, many physicians simply limit the amount ofnarcotics they will prescribe f or any one pain patient. Somephysicians even shy away from using any triplicate forms. Theforms are a paperwork nuisance and a red flag of danger. Nothaving them is also a convenient excuse for not treating painpatients. Few doctors welcome patients who complain of chronic pain.Pain patients often appear normal, so the physician cannot besure of the extent or validity of the complaints. The patientsare often difficult, manipulative or depressed. High levels ofmedication to relieve pain invite disciplinary problems for thephysician. Most physicians prescribe narcotics only f or chronic painpatients they have treated for a number of years. Patientsreceiving such medication face a major problem if they move to anew area or their physician retires. New physicians will beextremely reluctant to treat them. Political developments The environment in which physicians and patients now findthemselves was captured by the theme of the October, 1989,meeting of the American Pain Society, "Relieving Pain in aRegulated Environment--a Medical Dilemma for the 90's. " Themeeting focused on the difficulties in treatment caused by theongoing war on drugs. The Texas Legislature confronted the problem in 1989 byenacting a law which defined "intractable pain," addedto state law language from federal law recognizing the legitimatemedical use of dangerous drugs, and restricted discipline ofphysicians for treating chronic intractable pain. The California Legislature acted in 1989 as well, passingsenator Leroy Greene's SB 711 to set down new requirements beforethe Board of Medical Quality Assurance (now known as the MedicalBoard of California or MBC) could discipline a physician foroverprescribing. The Board would have to consider the physicaland mental condition of the patient, whether the patient hadintractable pain, whether there was evidence of drug addiction orabuse, and whether the medication caused physical orpsychological harm to the patient. However, the bill was vetoed at the Medical Board's urging.The governor said he shared the board's concern the law wouldreduce its ability to discipline physicians: "By requiringthat the Board's investigations take into account certainspecific characteristics of the patient, particularly where thepatient may not be willing to cooperate for fear of losing asupply of drugs, the bill places a significant new burden ofproof on the Board in its efforts to discipline physicians whoare excessive providers." The Governor also pointed to the war on drugs: "I believeat a time when illicit access and use of drugs is a major problemfor our citizens, this bill's provisions are a step in the wrong.direction." In 1990, Senator Greene took a different, successful tack withSB 1802. The bill said physicians could not be disciplined forprescribing controlled substances to control "intractablepain." The Medical Board found the bill more acceptable thanthe previous measure, but still thought there was no problem andno need for legislation. SB 1802 defined "intractable pain" as "a painstate in which the cause of the pain cannot be removed orotherwise treated and which in the generally accepted course ofmedical practice no relief or cure of the cause of the pain ispossible or none has been found after reasonable effortsincluding, but not limited to, evaluation by one or morephysicians and surgeons specializing in the treatment of thearea, system, or organ of the body perceived as the source of thepain. The bill was signed into law by the Governor on September 30,1990. Looking ahead Hopefully, measures like the Greene bill will allow physiciansto better treat the patient disabled by chronic pain. one keyprovision of that law requires consultation with other experts. In addition, physicians should consider long-term narcoticsonly after other reasonable attempts at pain relief have failed.Patients should be seen and prescriptions given at regularintervals. Physicians must be wary of the patient with a historyof drug abuse, the patient who does not have some initial reliefwith relatively low doses of pain medication, or the patient whohoards drugs or shows uncontrolled escalation of drug use. Pain patients should be made aware of the risk of long-termnarcotic use. But those who need narcotics should understand thatphysical dependence does not inevitably lead to addiction. Theodds are decidedly against addiction in the self-destructivesense. The medical community, regulatory bodies and the public needto know that more can and should be done for treatment of chronicpain. The emerging evidence indicates we can safely offerpatients more for pain than to "learn to live with it." GLOSSARY acute pain. short-term pain.

Rose, MD In the fall of 1990, three events signaled a new era in theuse of opioids for the management of chronic pain -- particularlynon-malignant pain: (1) SEDMS published "The Painful Dilemma: The Use ofNarcotics for the Treatment of Chronic Pain;" (2) Governor Deukmejian signed into law Senator Leroy Greene'sSB 1802, the Intractable Pain Act, which protects physicians fromunwarranted intrusion by regulatory agencies in the treatment ofchronic pain with controlled substances. Under this law, aphysician cannot be disciplined by the Medical Board for suchtreatment as long as a consultation was obtained from anappropriate specialist and good records were maintained on thepatient; (3) The AMA published "Balancing the Response toPrescription Drug Abuse," after becoming aware of theproblem. As Dr. James Sammons stated, "The war on drugsshould not be a war on patients." But it has been a war onpatients and physicians alike. In November 1990, I gave testimony before the Medical Board ofCalifornia (MBQ and asked them to communicate to the physiciansof this state through their Action Report the significance of theyear's prior events. Finally, in June 1991, the Action Reportcarried an article on the use of controlled substances for themanagement of chronic pain. While the article did mention SenatorGreene's bill, no mention was made of "The PainfulDilemma." In October 1992, Senator Greene held hearings at the StateCapitol regarding the Intractable Pain Treatment Act because hewas receiving calls from doctors informing him that theregulatory climate had not improved at all. At the hearing,physicians and patients testified about the problems theyencountered with prescribing and obtaining controlled substancesfor chronic pain, but the Medical Board refused to admit therewas any problem. On October 27, The Sacramento Bee reported"Legal Fears have Doctors Under-prescribingPainkillers," and the following day Ken Wagstaff resigned asdirector of the MBC over an internal scandal. Governor Wilsonsubsequently appointed Dixon Arnett, a former Republicanassemblyman, to head the MBC. Senator Greene, who knew Arnettfrom their days in the legislature, met with him and expressedhis concerns. Arnett, through friends who had encountereddifficulty getting medication for the relief of chronic pain, wasaware of the problem and set up a task force to look into thesituation. In its November 4, 1993 report, the task forcerecognized that the undertreatment of chronic pain was a greaterproblem than so-called "excessive prescribing." Afterseveral hearings, the task force's statement on prescribingcontrolled substances for chronic pain was published in the July1994 Action Report (the guidelines are to be published in anupcoming action report). In reference to the report, Arnett wasquoted in The Bee (8/11/94), saying "Doctors won't have theMedical Board to blame anymore(for undertreatment of pain)."In addition, Arnett said in his letter to task force members thathe wanted physicians to achieve a certain level of comfort whenit comes to prescribing these drugs. In November, Proposition 161, "Physician AssistedSuicide," appeared on the state ballot. A coalition ofreligious groups strongly opposed to the initiative spent largesums of money to defeat it, which they did, 54:46 percent. Thesegroups came to realize that suicide was not the real issue atstake; rather, it was the pain. Cavalier and Associates, the samegroup that ran that campaign against Proposition 161 formed theCalifornia Pain Management Coalition. They worked withAssemblyman Richard Polanco, who introduced AB 2155 calling for apain management advisory committee within the attorney general'soffice to advise on pain matters. The wife of an administrativeassistant to Assemblyman Polanco had chronic pain and hadexperienced difficulty obtaining pain relief. Her doctors hadbeen afraid of her getting "addicted" to opioids, but Imaintain it was really the scarlet letter of "arrest"that kept her from getting what she needed to alleviate her pain. AB 2155 passed that state legislature but was vetoed byGovernor Wilson. In his veto message, however, the governorcalled for a pain summit to remove the impediments to adequateprescribing: "The proponents [of AB 21551 make a compellingargument that the medical community and the law enforcementcommunity need to work together in a cooperative fashion to makecertain patients are receiving medically necessary paintreatment. I am directing ... the various boards... to overcomeobstacles that contribute to inadequate pain management."10/8/93 In 1989, the American Pain Society (APS) formed a newcommittee on analgesic regulatory issues. Ronald Blum, MD, chiefof oncology at New York University, was the committee's firstchairman. In 1987, Dr. Blum had been arrested in his office bynarcotic agents for alleged overprescribing of Diluadid to hiscancer patients. They finally reduced the charges against him to notregistering his patients is "ilarcotic addicts" asrequired by New York law. The second chair of this committee wasAl Brady, MD, an oncologist from Portland, Oregon who had alsobeen arrested on charges similar to Dr. Blum's. As a member ofthis committee, I worked with C. Stratton Hill, MD, head ofoncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He was theauthor of The Intractable Pain Treatment Act, which had becomelaw in Texas in 1989. We adopted this law, made a few changes,and it became law in California the next year. William Marcus, deputy attorney general in the Los Angelesoffice, became a member of the APS' analgesic regulatorycommittee and gained awareness of how regulatory agencies hadcreated a climate that was not conducive to prescribing narcoticsfor chronic pain patients. The pain summit was held in Los Angeles in March 1994 withSenator Greene, as well as experts from all over the country inmedicine, nursing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and lawenforcement, in attendance. At about the same time, the Agencyfor Health Care Policy Research came out with cancer painguidelines, acknowledging that at least half of all cancerpatients are undertreated for pain. Certainly, addiction shouldnot be an issue in deciding how much pain relief cancer patientscan receive. The report on the pain summit, which was released inJuly 1994, stated that patients had a right to relief of theirpain and suffering. The following was the only underlinedstatement in the summit report: "We should create by statutea positive legal duty for physicians to relieve pain."Included in the summit report was a chronology of events that hadled up to the summit. The first event listed was Senator Greene'sIntractable Pain Treatment Act. In June 1994, the 6th District Court of Appeals published adecision in the Peopic vs. Schade case. Among other charges, Dr.Schade was accused of illegally prescribing controlled substancesto addicts (of course, these so-called addicts were actuallychronic pain patients). Dr. Otto Neubuerger and I testified onDr. Schade's behalf. One of the pivotal issues as seen by thecourt of appeals was the definition of addiction. In 1989, SB711, another bill by Senator Greene, included a definition ofaddiction. It was passed by the legislature but vetoedby.Governor Deukmejian. The appellate court felt that if the trial court could notprovide a definition of addiction, then how could it convict Dr.Schade for treating addicts? It overturned that part of Dr.Schade's conviction by 2:1. While the dissenting justice feltthat Dr. Schade still should have been found guilty, he caughtthe essence of tile problem in his opinion: "To be sure,there was abundant and divergent testimony during the course ofthis trial devoted to the meaning of addiction as that conceptrelates to pain management. It was apparent that the medicalcommunity is divided on the question of the appropriate use ofnarcotics for treatment of patients in chronic pain. One thingmade clear by the expert testimony is that there is no commonlyaccepted medical standard by which to measure how much is toomuch to prescribe for any given patient presenting with thecomplaint of chronic pain. As appellant testified, each case willdepend upon the doctor's assessment of the particular patient'slevel of comfort and ability of function." (Daily AppellateReport, 6/17/94:8291). Part of my own testimony, quoted in the appellate courtsdecision, reads as follows: "Dr. Rose testified that he hasprescribed narcotics to chronic pain patients with nonmalignantailments. According to Dr. Rose, the quality of life is thebottom line and the doctor should be able to prescribe narcotics.when necessary to restore function in the patients' lives."(DAR, 6/17/94:8275). With the virtually simultaneous release of the Medical Board'stask force statement and the governor's pain summit report thisyear, there is no turning back. Once the full implementation ofthese documents is realized, California will become the firstpolitical unit on the planet where the undertreatment of pain andsuffering will be considered illegal. All members of the healthcare team will have not only a professional obligation but astatutory positive legal duty to effectively relieve theirpatients' pain and suffering, and no longer will physicians haveto tell their patients in pain to "just learn to live withit."

Thispractice parameter has been approved as a working document by theFlorida Board of Medicine and the Florida Board of OsteopathicMedicine. This guideline is published for information,education and review by the medical community, otherprofessionals and the public. This practice guideline has beencreated in recognition that some dangerous drugs, includingcontrolled substances under schedules II-V as provided in FloridaStatutes s. 893.03, can be vital in the treatment of pain,including intractable pain. They are useful for relieving andcontrolling many other pain related symptoms. These drugs may be prescribed for the treatmentof pain and related symptoms as a result of a prudent medicaldiagnosis, in proper doses and for appropriate lengths of time,which in some cases, may be for as long as the pain or relatedsymptoms exist. Pain, and many of the symptoms associated withintractable pain, can result in subjective complaints and theappropriateness and the adequacy of drug and drug doses will varyfrom patient to patient. The physician is expected to exercisesound medical judgment in treating pain and its related symptomswith dangerous drugs and controlled substances. This generic guideline applies primarely (sic)to the treatment of chronic and intractable pain with the use ofdangerous drugs and controlled substances. At the end of thetext, there are additional Agency for Health Care Administrationendorsed guidelines that target pain management. These guidelinescontain information about the management of specific acute andchronic pain and injury conditions using prescription drugs,controlled substances and other modalities. The guidelines alsocontain the mandated scientific base for this generic painmanagement guideline. Guidelines are not intended to be used as fixedprotocols. They are parameters for patient management strategieswhich are not entirely inclusive or exclusive of all methods ofreasonable care that can achieve comparable results. They dopermit the consideration of the unique exigencies of eachindividual and available resources. Many patients will requiremore or less treatment to achieve relief from pain. Treatment must be based on patient need as wellas professional judgment. Therefore, these guidelines can betailored to fit distinctive patient needs that are affected bythe medical setting, the available resources and by otherfactors. Deviations can be justified by individual circumstances. While standards are intended to be rigid andmandatory, making exceptions rare and troublesome to justify,guidelines are more flexible, but it is advisable they befollowed as closely as is prudent. Guidelines are revisited everythree years or less and reviews are based on scientific updates. FLORIDA GENERIC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE MANAGEMENT OF PAIN USING DANGEROUS DRUGS ANDCONTROLLED SUBSTANCES PART I PREFACE The State of Florida recognizes that pain,including intractable pain, is often undertreated. Unrelievedpain can have harsh and sometimes disastrous influence on thequality of life for patients and their families. PAIN MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY INFLORIDA Principles of quality medical practice dictatethat citizens of Florida who suffer from pain should seekrelief-with treatment that is currently available. Theappropriate application of current knowledge and treatments cangreatly improve the quality of life for many Florida citizens andreduce the morbidity and costs associated with untreated pain. In addition to promoting competent patientcare, these guidelines are intended to help physicians avoidinvestigation if controlled substances are appropriatelyprescribed for short or long-term pain management. PRESCRIBING DANGEROUS DRUGS AND CONTROLLEDSUBSTANCES FOR PAIN The proper treatment for any patient's paindepends upon a careful diagnosis of the etiology of the pain,selection of appropriate and cost effective treatments and theongoing evaluations of the results of treatment. Patients withchronic pain may demand more time of the practitioner because ofthe complexity of their problem. Opioid analgesics and other dangerous andcontrolled substances are useful for pain treatment. They are thecornerstone of treatment for acute pain due to trauma or surgeryand of chronic pain due to progressive diseases, such as cancer.Other than that specified in the Physician's Desk Reference(PDR), large doses, if documented, may be necessary to controlsevere pain. Extended therapy may also be needed to alleviatechronic pain. Published formularies, relating to commercialfinancial incentives, should not be a deterrent to achievingoptimal pain relief. Opioid analgesics may also be useful intreating patients with intractable nonmalignant pain especiallywhen efforts to remove or treat the pain with other modalitieshave failed. Such intractable pain may have a number of differentetiologies and might require several treatment methods. Inaddition, the extent to which pain is associated with physicaland psychosocial impairment varies greatly. Therefore, whenpatients are selected for therapy trials using dangerous drugsand opioid therapy, care should be used to assess the pain aswell as the patient's disability. The duration of drug therapyshould depend on the physician's evaluation of the results oftreatment, including the degree of pain relief, the changes inphysical and psychological functioning and the appropriateutilization of health care resources. Addiction in relation to these substancesshould be placed in proper perspective. Physical dependence andtolerance are normal physiological consequences of extendedopioid therapy and are not the same as addiction. Addiction is abehavioral syndrome characterized by psychological dependence andaberrant, drug-related behaviors. Addicts use drugs in acompulsive manner and not for medical purposes. An addict mayalso be physically dependent or tolerant. Patients with chronicpain should not be considered addicts merely because they arebeing treated with opioids. Physicians need to be cognizant ofthe fact that patients with a history of drug abuse may beparticularly problematic to the management of pain. PAIN MANAGEMENT, CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND THELAW Federal government laws and regulations andthose of the State of Florida impose special requirements fordangerous drugs and controlled substances prescription. Theseregulations are aimed at preventing harm to the consurner fromdangerous prescription drugs which are diverted to nonmedicaluses. It is legitimate medical practice for physicians toprescribe controlled substances for the treatment of pain,including intractable pain. The Agency for Health Administrationsupports the examination of prescriptions for analgesics andopioids for the treatment of pain. This examination must be basedon the documented diagnosis and treatment rather than on the drugdosage or on the number of prescriptions written. Concerns about regulatory scrutiny should notcause physicians to be reluctant to prescribe or administerdangerous and controlled substances, including Schedules II-Vdrugs as provided for in Florida Statutes s. 893.03, for patientswith legitimate medical needs. Physicians need not fearadministrative action when prescribing dangerous drugs andcontrolled substances to patients in their care for a pathologyor condition when the prescription is issued after a good faithexamination and there is medical indication for the prescription. The regulatory boards may identify a pattern ofdangerous and controlled substance use which merits furtherexamination, but private, courteous and professional inquiry canusually determine whether the physician is appropriatelyprescribing for patients in good faith or whether aninvestigation is warranted. The Florida Board of Medicine and theFlorida Board of Osteopathic Medicine must judge the prescriptionvalidity relative to the physician's documented diagnosis andtreatment and if the prescribed drugs are appropriate for thepatient's condition. Predetermined limits should not be placed ondosages or length of drug therapy. It is the goal of the Agency for Health CareAdministration to change practitioner perception of regulatoryscrutiny and recognize the commitment of regulatory boards toimproving pain management in order to enhance the quality oflives of pain-affected patients in Florida. Federal and Statelaws and regulatory policies should not hamper the appropriateuse of dangerous drugs and controlled substances for the reliefof pain. PART II PRACTICE AND REGULATORY GUIDELINES The Florida Board of Medicine and the FloridaBoard of Osteopathic Medicine may use the following guidelines todetermine whether conduct violates the physician's respectivepractice act, including Florida Statutes s. 458.326--IntractablePain; Authorized Treatment--of the Florida Medical Practice Act,below, in regard to prescribing, administering, ordering or thedispensing of pain medications and other drugs and to addresstheir side effects. Excerpted from Florida Statutes Chapter 458,Medical Practice Florida Statutes s. 458.326 - Intractable pain;authorized treatment. (1) For the purposes of this section, the term"intractable pain" means pain for which, in thegenerally accepted course of medical practice, the cause cannotbe removed and otherwise treated. (2) Intractable pain must be diagnosed by aphysician licensed under this chapter and qualified by experienceto render such diagnosis. (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law,a physician may prescribe or administer any controlled substanceunder Schedules II-V, as provided for in (4) 893.03, to a person for the treatment ofintractable pain, provided the physician does so in accordancewith that level of care, skill, and treatment recognized by areasonably prudent physician under similar conditions andcircumstances. (5) Nothing in this section shall be construedto condone, authorize, or approve mercy killing or euthanasia,and no treatment authorized by this section may be used for suchpurpose. History.--s. 3, ch. 94-96. DEFINITIONS INTRACTABLE PAIN - A pain state in which thecause of the pain cannot be removed or otherwise treated andwhich, in the generally accepted course of medical practice, norelief or cure of the cause of the pain is possible or none hasbeen found after reasonable efforts. NONTHERAPEUTIC USE - A medical use or purposethat is not legitimate in nature or in manner. ABUSER OF NARCOTIC DRUGS, CONTROLLED SUBSTANCESAND DANGEROUS DRUGS - An individual who takes a drug or drugs forother than legitimate rnedical purposes. 1. The treatment of pain, including intractablepain, with dangerous drugs and controlled substances has alegitimate medical purpose when performed in the usual course ofmedical practice. 2. Physicians duly authorized to practice undertheir respective practice act and to prescribe controlledsubstances and dangerous drugs in Florida, shall not be subjectto disciplinary action by their respective licensure board forprescribing, ordering, administering or dispensing dangerousdrugs or controlled substances for the treatment and relief ofpain, including intractable pain, in the usual course ofprofessional practice for a legitimate medical purpose incompliance with applicable state and federal law. 3. The prescribing, ordering, administering ordispensing of dangerous drugs or controlled substances for painwill be considered to be for a legitimate medical purpose ifbased upon scientific knowledge of the treatment of pain,including intractable pain; and are not in contravention ofapplicable state and federal law, and if prescribed, ordered,administered or dispensed in compliance with the followingguidelines where asoronnate and as is necessary to meet theindividual needs of the patient. A physician will be considered in complianceif: a. The medication is prescribed after adocumented patient history and physical examination by thephysician prescribing or providing the medication, whichincludes: an assessment and consideration of the physical andpsychological impact of the pain, any patient history orpotential for substance abuse, for coexisting diseases andconditions and the prescience of a recognized medical indicationfor the use of a dangerous drug or controlled substance. b. If medications are prescribed pursuant to awritten treatment plan tailored for the individual needs of thepatient and if treatment progress and success can be evaluatedwith stated objectives such as pain relief and improved physicaland psychosocial function. Such a written treatment plan willconsider pertinent medical history and physical examination aswell as the need for further testing, consultations, referrals orthe use of other treatment modalities. c. The physician should discuss with thepatient, significant other(s) or legal guardian, if appropriate,the risks, i.e., narcotic bowel syndrome (inforrnation attached),addiction and other side effects in comparison to the benefitsfrom the use of dangerous and controlled substances. d. The patient will be subject to documentedperiodic review of the care by the physician at reasonableintervals and in view of the individual circumstances of thepatient in regard to progress toward reaching the statedobjectives. The review will take into consideration the course ofmedications prescribed, ordered, administered or dispensed, aswell as any new information about the etiology of the pain. e. Complete and accurate records of the careprovided are kept as set forth in a-d, above. When controlledsubstances are prescribed, records are made which include names,quantities prescribed, dosages and number of authorized refills.This record takes into account that pain-affected patients with ahistory of substance abuse, or patients who live in anenvironment that may pose a risk for medication misuse ordiversion, may require special consideration. Management of thesepatients may warrant closer monitoring by the physician managingthe pain and require consultation with appropriate health careprofessionals. 4. A physician's decision not to adherestrictly to the provisions of number 3, above, will not if"good faith or cause" is shown, constitute grounds forboard disciplinary action. Each case of prescribing for pain willbe evaluated on an individual basis. The physician's conduct willbe evaluated to a great extent by the treatment outcome, takinginto account: 1/ whether the drug used is medically orpharmacologically recognized to be appropriate for the diagnosis,2/ the patient's individual needs, including any improvement infunctioning, and 3/ recognizing that some types of pain cannot becompletely relieved. 5. If the provisions set out in numbers 1-4,above, are met, and if all drug treatment is properly documented,the board will consider such practices as prescribing in atherapeutic manner, and as prescribing and practicing in a mannerconsistent with public health and welfare. 6. Quantity of pharmaceutical and chronicity ofthe prescription will be evaluated on the basis of the documentedappropriate diagnosis and treatment of the recognized medicalindication. Documented persistence of the recognized medicalindication, and properly documented follow-up evaluations withappropriate continuing care as set out in these guidelines, willalso be evaluated. 7. A physician may use any number of treatmentmodalities for the treatment of pain, including intractable pain,which are consistent with legitimate medical purposes.

Advances in chronic pain managementsince gate control. [Review] AB - OBJECTIVE. Two pain treatment systems that developedsoon after the publication of the gate theory are probably adirect result of its publication: neuraxial opiate administrationand electrical stimulation of the spinal cord and peripheralnerves and receptors. Although the use of these modalities hasbecome widespread in managing chronic pain, there is disagreementabout their long-term efficacy. This presentation will attempt toreview the data regarding the mechanisms of action of thesemodalities and their efficacy in treating chronic pain ofmalignant and nonmalignant origin. DATA SOURCES. Data werederived almost entirely from original articles reportingexperimental data from both animal and human studies and fromseries of patients undergoing treatment with the modalitiesreviewed. STUDY SELECTION. Where possible, controlled studieswere selected. However, much of the available data regardingtreatment results are uncontrolled. DATA EXTRACTION ANDSYNTHESIS. Selected data from studies that were felt to bereasonably well conducted are presented or summarized. Because ofthe lack of control groups in many of the clinical trials,meta-analyses were not carried out. CONCLUSIONS. Long-term spinalopiate administration has been shown to be more effective thansystemic opiates in some patients with cancer pain, but oftenmust be combined with local anesthetics to provide satisfactorypain relief. Loss of effect over time is a significant problem.Since the identification of spinal opiate receptors and theintroduction of spinally administered narcotics, a number ofother receptors that are important in both sensitization andsuppression of pain projection systems have been characterized.Agonists and antagonists to many of these receptors are beingdeveloped, and a few are available for clinical trials. Long-termelectrical stimulation of the spinal cord produces substantialanalgesia below the stimulated spinal segments in some patientswith chronic pain. Although initial results are usuallyencouraging, long-term efficacy may be disappointing. It ispostulated that analgesia associated with spinal stimulation isassociated with both stimulation of large fiber ascending tractsand blockade of spinothalamic pathways. Transcutaneous electricalnerve stimulation (TENS) has come into widespread use in managingchronic pain and has had limited trials in cancer pain patients.It is well accepted by patients and physicians, but clinicalstudies of long-term efficacy have yielded variable results. Theanalgesic action is probably the result of both large afferentfiber activation and blockade of peripheral nociceptors.[References: 99] SO - Regional Anesthesia 1993;18:66-8 UI - 000146 AU - Bushnell TG AU - Justins DM TI - Choosing the right analgesic. A guide to selection.[Review] AB - Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience,unique to each individual patient. In the dynamic processes ofnociceptive stimulation, signal transmission, central decodingand interpretation there are many potential sites forpharmacological intervention, and there are many drugs which willproduce analgesia. An analgesic 'ladder' has been proposed forrational pain relief in cancer and a similar concept should beused in all forms of acute and chronic pain. Continuing researchand drug development undoubtedly extends our understanding, butconsistent improvement in our clinical ability to relieve paindepends more on our willingness to consider the need of eachpatient individually, to tailor the drug, route and mode ofadministration to that patient's requirements, and then tomonitor on the basis of the response of the patient to thetreatment. [References: 27] SO - Drugs 1993;46:394-40 TI - Decision-making in the opioid therapy of cancer pain:interim analysis of a prospective survey (Meeting abstract) AB - Sequential trials of opioid drugs or routes ofadministration are frequently required to optimize the balancebetween analgesia and adverse effects. Neither the clinicalfactors that determine the choice of drug or route nor thevariability in patient (pt) response have been studiedpreviously. To assess these phenomena, we are evaluating ptsreferred to the Pain Service using a new instrument completed bythe treating physician that records reason(s) for referral,pain-related data, and reason(s) for change(s) in analgesicregimen. To date, 25 consecutive pts with advanced cancer (11males and 14 females; median age 51 yr, range 31-82) have beenfollowed until discharge (n=23) or death (n=2). The reason(s) forreferral included uncontrolled pain despite analgesic therapy(68%), difficulties in pain assessment (33%), and analgesictoxicity with inadequate (33%) or adequate (11%) analgesia. Allpts had received previous opioid trials (median 3, range 1-6).Following referral, a total of 45 changes in either drug, route,or both were evaluable. Two pts died and 13 were dischargedduring the initial therapeutic trial. Ten required additionaltrials to achieve an acceptable balance between pain relief andadverse effects: 5 required 2 trials, 2 required 3 trials, and 3required 4 or more sequential trials. The major factors thatinfluenced opioid selection were previously well tolerated (48%),no known prior dose-limiting toxicity (51%), and easy to titrate(56%). Convenience of formulations (24%) was associated only withthe selection of morphine, whereas concerns regarding renalfunction (8%) and drug metabolites (14%) were associated with theselection of hydromorphone. The major reasons for the choice of aparenteral rather than oral route were the need for very rapidanalgesic effect (66%), inability to swallow (31%), impairedintestinal function (25%) and intolerance of po administereddrugs (18%). In the 2 cases in which spinal route was selected,dose- limiting toxicity with systemic administration was thecompelling consideration. In 6 cases, an initial parenteral routewas changed to the oral route prior to discharge; the need forrapid analgesic effect was a reason for the first selection, andresolution of that need and improved convenience were the reasonsfor the change. This interim analysis illustrates (1) the largevariability in response to different opioids and routes ofadministration; (2) the potential utility of sequentialtherapeutic trials; and (3) the likely existence of trends in therationale for the selection of opioid therapies, enhancedunderstanding of which may improve therapeutic decision making AD- Pain Service AD - Dept. of Neurology AD - MemorialSloan-Kettering Cancer Center AD - New York AD - NY 10021 UI -93695900 SO - Proc Annu Meet Am Soc Clin Oncol 1993;12:A1502-A150 UI - 000147 AU - Dixon BA TI - Institutional survey of nurse anesthesia practice inpatients receiving opioids via patient- controlled analgesia AB - This preliminary study determined certified registerednurse anesthetist (CRNA) practice experience and educationalneeds in the preoperative evaluation of patients usingpatient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for chronic and cancer painmanagement. A convenience sample (N = 29) of CRNAs practicing ina university teaching hospital completed the surveys developed bythe investigator. Survey items related to CRNA experience withmanagement of patients using PCA preoperatively, PCA modes ofopioid delivery, and use of adjuvant medication for chronic andcancer pain patients. Results of the study indicated that 79% ofCRNAs reported experience in administration of anesthesia to oneor more patients who used PCA preoperatively. However, only 32%of CRNAs surveyed reported knowledge of the modes of opioiddelivery available. Results also indicated that 48% of CRNAs werenot familiar with adjuvant medications (ie, tricyclicantidepressants, benzodiazepines, steroids, and anticonvulsants),which are often prescribed in combination with opioids in chronicpain management. The respondents reported use of a variety ofmethods in handling opioid and infusion devices for patientsusing PCA preoperatively. Fifty-two percent of CRNAs disconnectedthe infusion and discarded the opioid preoperatively. Fourteenpercent reported leaving the PCA device connected to the patientfor use perioperatively or for continued pain managementpostoperatively. Based upon the findings of this preliminarystudy, CRNA education in management techniques for the use of PCAinfusions in chronic and cancer pain is recommended SO - Nurse Anesthesia 1993;4:112-11 TI - Flupirtine. A review of its pharmacological properties,and therapeutic efficacy in pain states. [Review] AB - Flupirtine is a novel non-opiate centrally actinganalgesic agent with muscle relaxant properties, advocated foruse in a number of pain states. Preliminary evidence suggeststhat flupirtine 100 to 200mg orally or 150mg rectally 3 to 4times daily (maximum daily dose 600mg) is more effective thanplacebo in relieving moderate acute pain of various types. Forthe relief of pain due to surgery, traumatic injury, dentalprocedures, headache/migraine and abdominal spasms, flupirtinehas proved at least as effective as the opiate analgesicscodeine, dihydrocodeine and pentazocine, the nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory agents suprofen, diclofenac and ketoprofen, aswell as dipyrone and paracetamol (acetaminophen). Althoughevidence to support a role in the treatment of chronic pain islimited, flupirtine has been found as effective as pentazocine inshort term trials of patients with muscular or neuralgiform pain,dysmenorrhoea, soft tissue rheumatism or cancer pain. The safetyprofile of flupirtine has not yet been fully established,although initial evidence suggests that adverse reactions, whilefrequent, are usually minor in nature. The most common reactionsare drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth and various gastrointestinalcomplaints. In comparison with opiate drugs, flupirtine appearsto produce fewer central nervous system effects, no respiratoryor cardiovascular depression, and no overt tolerance or physicaldependence on prolonged administration. If these initiallyfavourable results are confirmed in larger long term trials, thenflupirtine would appear to represent an effective analgesic forthe relief of moderate pain, particularly that of musculoskeletalorigin.

Visualanalog and numerical verbal pain ratings, sedation scores, sleepquantity/quality scores, and sense of well-being scores wereassessed twice daily on each of the days succeeding AMT/placebouse. AMT was no different than placebo in altering the majorityof postoperative symptom variables studied in the sample studypopulation but caused no significant adverse effects.

Pharmacological studies have definedthree classes of opioid receptors, designated as delta, kappa,and mu. To investigate mechanisms by which agonists andantagonists interact with the delta opioid receptor, we havesubstituted aspartic acid 95 in the transmembrane segment 2 ofthe cloned mouse delta opioid receptor with an asparagine (D95N).The D95N mutant receptor had reduced affinity for deltareceptor-selective agonists such as enkephalin,[D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin and [D-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 suchthat it did not bind these peptides even at micromolarconcentrations. The binding of delta-selective non-peptideagonists was also reduced. In contrast, the deltareceptor-selective antagonists, such as naltrindole, thebenzofuran analog of naltrindole, and 7-benyllidenenaltrexone,bound equally well to the wild-type and mutant receptor.Similarly, non- selective opioid agonists such as bremazocine andbuprenorphine, which interact with delta, kappa, and mu opioid receptors, showed no difference in binding to thewild-type and mutant delta receptor. The D95N mutant remained coupled to G proteins, and the receptor wasfunctionally active since it mediated agonist inhibition of cAMP accumulation. These results indicate thatselective agonists and antagonists bind differently to the delta receptor and show that Asp-95contributes to high affinity delta-selective agonist binding. The identification of a key residue involved inselective agonist binding to the delta opioid receptor will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic reagentsthat can be used for the treatment of chronic pain and other conditions.

Patients with noncancer-related chronic pain, who have failed allconventional syndrome-specific therapies before neuroablative surgical procedures, including sequentialstrong opioid drug trials, who have intractable, unmanageable side effects, and who haveundergone successful spinal opioid efficacy trial are deemed candidates for implantable spinal infusionaltherapy. Patients with chronic noncancer- related pain and patient with cancer-related pain who havelife expectancies greater than 3 mo all have implanted programmable infusion pumps. Patients withcancer-related pain who have life expectancies less than 3 mo have implanted permanent epidural cathetersconnected to external pump systems.

DESIGN: Non-randomized consecutive sample with prospective,before-after treatment. SETTING: Pain- management, tertiary care center in a major U.S. city.PATIENTS: All adult patients (n = 50) who were treated in an inpatient multidisciplinary pain managementcenter were contrasted with those of a control group of 46 adult patients who were treated in an outpatientpain center. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain Locus of Control Scale, the Pain Beliefs and PerceptionsInventory, subjective pain intensity, and medication usage were measured before and after treatment. RESULTS:Statistically significant posttreatment changes were found for the treatment group, but not the controlgroup. Patients who completed the inpatient pain management program reported significant decreases insubjective pain intensity despite discontinuation of narcotic analgesics. Patients in the treatment group showedan increased sense of personal control over their pain and substantial decreases in attributions of paincontrol to powerful others and chance. Patients in the treatment group also showed a significant reduction in theirendorsement of the belief that their pain was a mysterious phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic non-terminal painpatients' beliefs about pain and attributions of pain control are amenable to change in ashort-term inpatient multidisciplinary pain management program. These results suggest that an intensivemultidisciplinary program involving psychotherapy might be more effective in treating chronicpain patients similar to those in this study than outpatient treatment without psychotherapy.

Reasons for this include excessive concern about opioid-induced respiratorydepression, tolerance, and addiction, as well as the impact of controlled substances regulations. The negativeimpact of controlled substances regulations on patient care is not well understood. This paper reviews thehistorical basis and current structure of the regulatory system. Four potential ways in which controlledsubstances regulations and policies can affect medical care are discussed: (1) by placing restrictions onphysician practice, (2) by affecting patient access to opioids, (3) by stigmatizing patients, and (4) indirectlythrough physicians' perceptions of regulations, resulting in modified medical practices. Physicians are urgedto work with state regulatory agencies to identify regulatory impediments to appropriate patient care.AD - Division of Cancer and Blood Diseases AD - Medical College of Wisconsin AD -Milwaukee UI - 93235094 SO - Semin Oncol 1993;20:53-5 UI - 000154 AU - Wilder-Smith CH TI - [Non-opioids in pain therapy: current perspectives].[German] AB - Increasing knowledge of the mechanisms underlyingnociceptive processing are making a more rationale approach to pain treatment possible.

Alpha 2-adrenergic agonists are being clinically tested and have shown considerable analgesicactivity in various pain states. Simultaneous treatment of pain with complementary analgesics, i.e."balanced analgesia", seems to be a logical approach in the light of the close interactions between the differentnociceptive pathways. The indications for the use of known analgesics in chronic pain therapy are insufficientlyresearched.

Comprehensive assessment provides the foundation foreffective pain management, and data that clarify the relationship between pain and other relevant factors alsofacilitate this process. The main objective of the study was to develop a clinical data base for advanced cancerpatients and to survey data to determine (1) pain severity at admission, (2) opioid use at admission, (3)change in opioid use during the hospital stay, and (4) survival in the hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Information was collected prospectively on 1,103 patients admitted and on 1,017 patients who died within6 months of the study's end. Demographic and clinical data were recorded 72 hours after admission andsoon after death or discharge. RESULTS: Seventy-three percent of patients had pain at admission.Cancer of the cervix was frequently (68%) associated with severe pain, as were prostate (52%) andrectal/sigmoid tumors (49%). Severe pain was more probable in those with bone metastasis, those admitted fromhome, and in those younger than 55 years of age. The majority (71.7%) of patients had a stable dosingpattern, and only 4.2% of the patients required dose increases of at least 10% per day. CONCLUSION: Thisstudy demonstrated the wide variability in opioid doses required. No reliable predictor of opioidrequirement was identified, and this lack of predictability of cancer pain severity underscores the needfor ongoing assessment.

Controversy exists about the opioidresponsiveness of this type of pain. Some clinicians have suggested that these pains may be inherentlyresistant to opioid analgesia; others have postulated that the neuropathic mechanism may relativelydiminish the analgesic response. To assess these hypotheses, we performed a combined analysis of the resultsfrom 4 controlled single-dose analgesic trials performed from 1978 to 1982, with morphine or heroin at highand low doses. Analgesic response was assessed serially over a 6-hr interval using a visual analogscale and was summarized as a total pain relief (TOTPAR) score. A total of 194 pts with chronic cancer painwere included; there were 482 administrations of study drug. Median age was 52 yr (20-79). Informationabout characteristics of pts' pain recorded at the time of study was reviewed independently by 2 experiencedpain clinicians who grouped each case according to inferred pain mechanism (neuropathic, nociceptive ormixed) and the degree of confidence in the inferred mechanism (definite vs probable/possible). When initialgroupings differed, they were rereviewed with a third investigator and disagreement was resolved byconsensus. Cases were grouped as follows: nociceptive pain only (n=210), neuropathic pain only (n=51) and mixed(n=221). Analgesic responsiveness was evaluated comparing TOTPAR scores using the Student's t-test.TOTPAR for the entire group was not predicted by the specific drug (morphine vs heroin), but thedose (high vs low) was a significant predictor of TOTPAR. Placebo TOTPAR response was estimated at 5.1,significantly less than the mean observed with any group. The primary analysis for the study comparedanalgesic response of pts having any neuropathic component with those with only nociceptive pain. Results arepresented in a table. In a covariate analysis that adjusted for prior opioid exposure and other prognosticfactors, the opioid responsiveness of neuropathic pain was significant and was less than that ofpurely nociceptive pain. These data support the postulate that opioid responsiveness is a continuum and thatit is diminished by the neuropathic mechanism AD - Pain Service AD - Dept. of Neurology AD - MemorialSloan-Kettering Cancer Center AD - New York AD - NY 10021 UI - 92682059 SO - Proc Annu Meet Am Soc Clin Oncol 1992;11:A1330-A133 UI - 000188 AU - Culpepper-Morgan JA AU - Inturrisi CE AU - Portenoy RK AU - Foley K AU - Houde RW AU - Marsh F AU - Kreek MJ TI - Treatment of opioid-induced constipation with oralnaloxone: a pilot study AB - Opioids cause constipation by binding to specific opioidreceptors in the enteric and central nervous systems. First-pass glucuronidation limits systemicbioavailability of oral naloxone. This study was designed to determine if oral naloxone could reverse opioid-inducedconstipation without precipitating abstinence or recrudescence of pain in opioid-dependent individuals.Concentrations of unmetabolized and total naloxone, including naloxone glucuronide, were measured byradioimmunoassay. A dose-related increase in symptoms of laxation resulted in all three opioid-dependent patientsstudied that paralleled the increase in active and total naloxone plasma levels. Withdrawal symptoms occurredwith plasma naloxone area under the plasma concentration-time curves above 550 ng.min/ml and with dosingintervals less than 3 hours. Peak plasma levels did not predict withdrawal. Oral naloxone amelioratesopioid-induced constipation in opioid- dependent persons. Titration of dose to a maximum of 12 mg atleast 6 hours apart may be needed to avoid adverse reactions.

However, we report two patients thought to have this syndrome in whomrenal autotransplantation did not result in long- term control of pain. In case 1, autotransplantation resultedin immediate cessation of pain; however, the flank pain recurred 7 1/2 months later. The recurrent painwas also severe and debilitating, requiring narcotic medications for control. In case 2, autotransplantation ofthe left kidney resulted in chronic pain in the left pelvic area, the site of the autotransplanted kidney. Inaddition, the patient continued to experience chronic discomfort in the left flank and along the flank incision.One year after autotransplantation, the patient still requires multiple daily doses of narcotic medications forpain control. Our two patients represent the 13th and 14th reported patients subjected to renalautotransplantation for management of LPHS. They represent only the third and fourth reported patients with recurrenceof pain after renal autotransplantation. Because studies with negative results are less likely to be reportedin the literature than studies with positive results, it is possible that the literature overestimates theeffectiveness of renal autotransplantation in the LPHS. To assess the true effectiveness of renal autotransplantation inLPHS, a survey of patients with LPHS who have undergone renal autotransplantation needs to be performed.

To illustrate this variability, we present 5 patients, 4 with cancer pain and 1with non- malignant pain, who underwent dose titration with more than 1 opioid and developed markedlydifferent responses to each. In every case, dose escalation led to successful treatment with 1 opioid and tointolerable side effects without adequate relief with others. The existence of this individual variability inthe response to different opioids has important implications for both clinical practice and currentunderstanding of opioid pharmacology in man. It contradicts the view that any opioid is inherently moreefficacious than any other, suggests that patients who fail to obtain adequate pain relief at maximally tolerateddoses of 1 opioid may benefit from an alternative drug, and underscores the potential importance of geneticfactors as a determinant of opioid response.

These developmental issues must be consideredwhen planning treatment for adolescents with acute or chronic pain. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) isa method of administering opioids that reinforces patient autonomy. Traditionally, opioids given byPCA are administered via the intravenous or subcutaneous route. Issues of autonomy and control, however,are no less important for patients receiving oral opioids. To augment patient autonomy, we have providedoral medication kept at the bedside (oral bedside PCA) for adolescents with diverse pain problems. Wedescribe our selection criteria and methods for using oral bedside PCA with adolescents and present 4patients who used this method.

A prestudy judgmentwas made from the characteristics of the pain as to whether it was nociceptive or neuropathic. Analgesicefficacy was assessed by a nurse-observer; adverse events were noted and plasma morphine and metabolitieconcentrations measured. Three categories of opioid response were distinguished. Good respondersobtained > 70 mm relief on the visual analogue scale, with minimal or manageable adverse events. Moderateresponders obtained < 70 but > 30 mm relief with more problematic adverse events, and poor responders had< 30 mm relief with troublesome adverse events. This method for the study of opioid sensitivityallowed a wide dosage range to be studied. The simultaneous analgesic and adverse event measurements showedthat the spectrum of observed response was wide, and response category could be judged for the majorityby 4 h. In those with poor or moderate response, adverse event severity limited further doseincrement. The relationship between pain characteristics and response showed that some pains judged tobe neuropathic had a good response to opioid (5/13), and some pains judged to be nociceptive did not(5/14). The study suggests that the pattern of response is not as black and white as the prediction of goodresponse from nociceptive pain and poor from neuropathic pain would suggest, although nociceptive pain wasmore likely than neuropathic pain to show a good response. For the moderate responders opioid titrationmay, in the absence of other effective treatments, be useful, but the analgesic endpoint may not betotally satisfactory. The method provides an operational definition of opioid sensitivity.

DESIGN: Retrospectivestudy. SETTING: Tertiary care facilities and patients' homes. PATIENTS: Of 481 patients seen inconsultation for cancer pain between July 1987 and April 1990, 60 (12%) met the eligibility criteria (i.e.,standard medical management had failed, and they had adequate supervision at home). INTERVENTION: Continuoussubcutaneous infusion with hydromorphone hydrochloride or morphine started on aninpatient basis and continued at home whenever possible. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient selectivity, narcoticdosing requirements, discharge rate, patient preference for analgesic regimen, side effects, complicationsand cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The mean initial maintenance infusion dose after dose titration wasalmost three times higher than the dose required before infusion (hydromorphone or equivalent 6.2 v. 2.1mg/h). Eighteen patients died, and the remaining 42 were discharged home for a mean of 94.4 (standard deviation128.3) days (extremes 12 and 741 days). The mean maximum infusion rate was 24.1 mg/h (extremes 0.5 and180 mg/h). All but one of the patients preferred the infusion system to their previous oralanalgesic regimen. Despite major dose escalations nausea and vomiting were well controlled in all cases. Twelvepatients (20%) experienced serious systemic toxic effects or complications; six became encephalopathic, whichnecessitated dose reduction, five had a subcutaneous infection necessitating antibiotic treatment,and one had respiratory depression. The programmable computerized infusion pump was found to be morecost-effective than the disposable infusion device after a break-even point of 8 months. CONCLUSIONS: Continuoussubcutaneous infusion of opioid drugs with the use of a portable programmable pump is safe and effective inselected patients who have failed to respond to standard medical treatment of their cancer pain. Dosetitration may require rapid dose escalation, but this is usually well tolerated. For most communities embarking onsuch a program a programmable infusion system will be more cost-effective than a disposable system SO - Canadian Medical Association Journal 1992;146:891-89 UI - 000015 AU - Ollat H TI - Traitement pharmacologique de la douleur neuropathique./ Pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain AB - IN: Association pour la Neuro-Psycho-Pharmacologie,Paris, France LA: French AB: Reviews the recent literature on pharmacological treatment of neuropathicpain (i.e., chronic pain resulting from injury to the peripheral nervous system and induced by functionalchanges in peripheral and central pathways).

[Russian] AB - A synthetic opiate agonist-antagonist norphin(buprenorphin) has been studied in 297 cancer patients as an analgetic component of general anesthesia, inpostoperative analgesia and in the treatment of chronic pain syndrome. In modified neuroleptanalgesia based onnorphin, diazepam, droperidol and N2O the patient is more adequately prevented from surgical trauma than inconventional neuroleptanalgesia based on fentanyl. This is confirmed by greater stability incirculation, metabolism and stress hormone parameters, however this anesthesia technique is lessmanageable and may be accompanied by prolonged postanesthesia depression of the central nervoussystem. Good results have been obtained when norphin pills were used sublingually for the treatment oflong-lasting intensive chronic pain syndrome in incurable cancer patients. Norphin is no less effective thanmorphin, however, unlike morphin, it causes no severe adverse reactions.

The type and severity of pain children with cancer experiencevaries from acute, short-term, procedure- related pain to the progressive chronic pain associated withterminal illness.

[Review] AB - Studies on the mechanisms of tolerance and dependencehave mostly focused on changes at the receptor level. These experiments, conducted with modelsystems ranging from clonal cell lines to whole animals, have identified a number of important adaptive mechanisms which occur at the receptor level. However, noneof these adaptive mechanisms can completely account for the phenomena which serve to define the state ofmorphine tolerance and dependence, especially the observation that as an animal becomes more tolerant tomorphine, less naloxone is required to trigger withdrawal. The data reviewed in this paper provide strongsupport for the hypothesis that the brain synthesizes and secretes neuropeptides which act as part of ahomeostatic system to attenuate the effects of morphine and endogenous opioid peptides. According to thismodel, administration of morphine releases anti-opioid peptides (AOP), which then attenuate the effectsof morphine. As more morphine is given, more AOP are released, thereby producing tolerance to the effectsof morphine. Cessation of morphine administration, or administration of naloxone, produces arelative excess of anti-opioid, which is in part responsible for the withdrawal syndrome. Since endogenous andexogenous antagonists might together produce synergistic effects, less naloxone might be requiredto trigger withdrawal in the presence of higher levels of AOPs. Although the study of AOP is in its infancy,a deeper understanding of the central nervous system (CNS) anti-opioid systems may lead to new treatmentsfor chronic pain, substance abuse, and psychiatric disorders.

Other disadvantages include the potential infectionswith implantable pumps and the inconvenience of repeated narcotic administration. During the past severalyears, studies at the author's laboratory indicated that transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue or isolatedchromaffin cells into the spinal subarachnoid space can significantly reduce pain in several rodent modelswithout resulting in development of tolerance. Adrenal medullary chromaffin cells were selected because theyproduce high levels of both opioid peptides and catecholamines, agents that independently, and possiblysynergistically, reduce pain when injected locally into the spinal subarachnoid space. The adrenal medullarytransplants survive for prolonged periods, and continue to produce high levels of both catecholamines andmet-enkephalin. These transplants reduce pain in two rodent chronic pain models, an arthritis model and aperipheral neuropathy model, both of which closely resemble human chronic pain syndromes. The success of theanimal studies has led to initiation of human clinical trials in patients with chronic cancer pain; resultsare promising.

Early trials, although uncontrolled, supported the safety and efficacy of patient-controlledanalgesia (PCA) in several kinds of pain, such as that relating to surgery, cancer, trauma, and obstetricprocedures. In the past decade, prospective, randomized trials have reported several advantages of PCA overconventional analgesia in the early postoperative period. Although not supported by all controlled trials, they includeimproved pain relief, less sedation, lower level of narcotic consumption, fewer postoperative complications,greater patient satisfaction, and improved pulmonary function. Preliminary results in the management ofchronic pain indicate that PCA can lead to significant lifestyle improvements in ambulatory patientswith cancer. The most significant, although infrequent, adverse effect is respiratory depression, themajority of cases occurring in patients predisposed secondary to concomitant illness or as a result of humanerror. The clinical use of PCA will likely see a significant increase among persons with cancer, and anincrease in epidural administration. The cost benefit of PCA has yet to be assessed in inpatient and outpatientsettings.

CONCLUSIONS: This case reportillustrates some of the hazards of opioid therapy in the management of patients with chronic pain. Ourpatient's opiate therapy was expensive, gave her undesirable side effects, and did not reduce her paincomplaints or improve her function.

In an effort to decrease the manpower requirements, some hospitals allow thenursing staff to administer epidural narcotics to adult patients. In children, however, this practice hasbeen limited. We retrospectively reviewed our experience over 12 months with this procedure. Epiduralcatheters (caudal, lumbar, or thoracic) were placed in 43 pediatric patients for acute and chronic painmanagement. All patients received a continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine hydrochloride with fentanyl citrate.Eleven (26%) of the 43 patients required supplemental analgesia and were given 45 doses of epiduralfentanyl. Adequate analgesia was achieved in all patients. No intravascular or intrathecal injections werenoted, nor did any inadvertent epidural injections of medications occur. No patient had respiratory depression(respiratory rate less than 10% for age). We believe epidural administration of fentanyl by a carefullyeducated nursing staff is safe and effective in children.

The 6-h course combined written materials conveying facts aboutbehavioral, social and biological aspects of pain with clinical observations of an acute and a chronic paintreatment team. Examination of responses to a questionnaire assessing attitudes toward pain patientsrevealed that medical students have limited personal experience with pain and medications for pain, and limitedknowledge about pain. Pre-course attitudes toward pain patients were dominated by perceived negativecharacteristics of pain patients and the belief that working with such patients is difficult. Attitudes measured 5months after the course reflected increased complexity, greater emphasis that pain is real and notimaginary, and stronger belief that working with pain patients is rewarding. Five months after the seminar,students reported more accurate estimates of the frequency of problems with addiction stemming from acute paintreatment and exaggerated the prevalence of pain problems in the society. The importance of integratingclinical and basic science experiences in order to influence long-term clinical attitudes and produce lastingchanges in clinically relevant knowledge is discussed.

We describe 100 patients who were chronically given opioids for treatment ofnonmalignant pain. Most patients experienced neuropathic pain or back pain. We used sustained-releasedihydrocodeine, buprenorphine, and sustained- release morphine.

Both NTI and 5'-NTII suppressed the development ofopiate tolerance and dependence in acute and chronic models. The antagonists had no influence on theactivity of the mu opioid receptor agonist DAMGO.

[Review] [French] AB - Experimental studies have shown that opioids couldproduce two types of effect on neuronal excitability. The first one, aspecific, is a local anestheticaction on the nerve fiber with a diminution of sodium and potassium conductance. The second is specific: thesodium conductance lowering is due to a linkage of the opioid with a receptor on the internal face ofthe membrane. Opioids could also migrate to the posterior horn of the spinal cord after linkage with axonalreceptors. Clinical studies have proved that opioid injection in peripheral nervous trunks and speciallyin the brachial plexus produce a prolonged analgesia status in the post operative period butalso and mostly in the chronic pain. The more liposoluble opioids like fentanyl and buprenorphine arethe more effective.

[Review] [French] AB - The aim of the regional administration of opioids is toprovide an efficient and prolonged analgesia. Then, opiates can be useful for postoperative analgesia andfor the treatment of chronic pain of malignant origin. Analgesia is correlated with several adverse effectsof which the most frequent are nausea and itching and the most severe is respiratory depression. Beside theadverse effects, other properties of opiates could be responsible of favourable effects which can be taken inadvantage in specific indications. In the postoperative period, epidurally administered opioid canattenuate the neuroendocrine and metabolic responses to surgery and pain. This effect is responsible ofa reduction of the resistance to insulin and of a better nutritional balance, especially after major abdominalsurgical procedures. Opioids also act by a reduction of the motor functions of the bowel, which perhapscould reduce the incidence of anastomotic breakdowns. Finally, other effects have been reported, asanecdotes, such as the treatment of spasm after bilateral replantation of the ureters, neurologic bladderdysfunctions and enuresis. Spinal administration of opioids has also been used as a treatment of prematureejaculation.

Pain is a common problem that has tremendous potential to influence thephysical function and quality of life of elderly people during their remaining years. The experience of pain and itsmanagement at home are not analogous to institutional settings. Family and caregivers have importantinfluences on pain management and may require education and support for the long-term management of chronicpain patients. Existing pain management strategies should be tailored to meet the special needs ofgeriatric patients and be sensitive to caregiver concerns. Implications, indications, and applications forhigh-tech pain management strategies need to be clarified for the management of older people at home.[References: 27] SO - Clinics in Geriatric Medicine 1991;7:765-77 UI - 000122 AU - Fogel BS AU - Fretwell MD TI - Common mental health problems in geriatric practice.Part II: Insomnia, chronic pain, troubled families, and other dilemmas SO - Rhode Island Medical Journal 1991;74:68-7 UI - 000112 AU - Foldes FF TI - Pain control with intrathecally and peridurallyadministered opioids and other drugs. [Review] AB - Sharp pain is conducted rapidly by myelinated delta Afibers and diffused pain slowly by nonmyelinated C fibers to pseudobipolar neurons in theposterior ganglion and from there to neurons located in the posterolateral horn ofthe spinal cord. From here on nociferous impulses are transmitted by excitatory peptides (e.g. substance P) oramino acids (e.g. glutamate, aspartate) through interconnecting neurons of the pain pathways, primarily onthe contralateral side, to the brain stem and from there to the sensory cortex, where they are appreciated andacted upon. There are specific inhibitory receptors located on axon terminals, near to the releasesites of the excitatory amino acids and peptides. Stimulation of these receptors by their appropriate ligandssuch as endogenous (e.g. enkephalis, endorphins) or exogenous opioids, clonidine, serotonin, somatostatininhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and relieves pain. There are at least 3 different opioidreceptors, called mu-, kappa- and delta-receptors in the spinal cord. These can be differentiated from one anotherby their specific affinity toward different endogenous or exogenous opioids and the pure narcoticantagonist, naloxone. It appears that the nociferous impulses transmitted by parallel pathways equipped withdifferent inhibitory receptors have to be integrated to produce pain sensation and partial inhibition oftransmission in different pathways or complete inhibition in one of the pathways may relieve pain. In recent years theconcept of "selective spinal analgesia" has been applied clinically for the relief of postoperative,obstetrical and chronic pain. At first it was expected that the intrathecal or peridural administration of morphine willproduce analgesia without the side effects of systemically administered morphine. It soon became evident,however, that intrathecally and peridurally administered morphine after several hours of delay reachesthe fourth ventricle and by stimulating mu- receptors may cause respiratory depression and otherundesired effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting, pruritus). Several different approaches are being investigated for theproduction of selective spinal analgesia without side effects. They include: a. the use of more lipophilic,long-lasting opioids (e.g. lofentanil) which would be almost completely absorbed by the spinal cord and thereforewould not reach the medullary centers; b. the development of opioids with specific affinity to kappa- andfor delta- and little or no affinity to mu- receptors, primarily responsible for side effects; and c.combining lower doses of opioid agonists with alpha 2-adrenergic agonists (e.g. clonidine) or with somatostatin.It is conceivable that in the not-too-distant future, it will be possible to achieve through thesemeasures, selective spinal analgesia without side effects.

In some patients, pain control is difficult with infusions of morphine. Seven patients with diagnoses ofarachnoiditis, epidural scarring, and/or vertebral body compression fracture were treated withalternative solutions in an epidural route. For maximal flexibility, Medtronic implanted programmableinfusion pumps with catheters to T6-T10 were used, and pain was monitored by verbal pain scales. In threepatients, epidural infusions of morphine in 0.5% bupivacaine (MS-MARC) resulted in little or no pain reliefwithout significant side effects (e.g., headache, nausea, or vomiting). In these same patients, epiduralinfusions of sufentanil citrate resulted in pain scale reductions of 92%, 82%, and 40%, respectively, with no sideeffects. Four other patients found more effective pain relief when switched from initial sufentanilcitrate infusions to MS-MARC. Pain scale reductions (with no side effects) were 92%, 76%, 59%, and 47%in these patients. Pain relief and minimal side effects with sufentanil citrate is theorized to resultfrom its higher lipophilicity promoting local transdural diffusion to spinal cord and limiting upwarddiffusion to the brain stem. Sufentanil citrate is also advantageous for programmable pumps because it is 100 timesmore potent than morphine and therefore allows longer pump refill times and higher infusion doses.Although this study was done on a limited number of patients, sufentanil citrate and MS-MARC in epiduralinfusions using programmable infusion pumps for non-cancer patients provide significant alternative drugcombinations and routes.

The mean pre- epidural equianalgesic dose of im morphine was 300 mg/day.Temporary catheters were used to assess response to epidural morphine; if no response bupivacaine wasadded; if no response the catheter was removed; if analgesia was obtained the temporary catheter wasreplaced by a tunneled catheter for long-term use. Analgesia was successfully obtained in 12/16 epiduralattempts; 6 with morphine alone, 6 with morphine plus bupivacaine. 4/16 attempts were discontinued due tounacceptable toxicity or technical problems. Tunneled catheters were used for a mean of 83 days (range6-965 days). Catheter problems included malfunction (7), infection (4), injection pain (4), epiduralhematoma (1), hyperesthesia (1).

[Review] AB - The agonist-antagonist opioid analgesics are aheterogeneous group of drugs with moderate to strong analgesic activity comparable to that of the pure agonistopioids such as codeine and morphine but with a limited effective dose range. The group includes drugs whichact as an agonist or partial agonist at one receptor and an antagonist at another (pentazocine,butorphanol, nalbuphine, dezocine) and drugs acting as a partial agonist at a single receptor (buprenorphine). Thesedrugs can be classified as nalorphine-like or morphine-like. Meptazinol does not fit into eitherclassification and occupies a separate category. Pentazocine, butorphanol and nalbuphine are weakmu-antagonists and kappa-partial-agonists. All three drugs are strong analgesics when given by injection:pentazocine is one-sixth to one-third as potent as morphine, nalbuphine is slightly less potent than morphine,and butorphanol is 3.5 to 7 times as potent. The duration of analgesia is similar to that of morphine (3 to 4hours). Oral pentazocine is closer in analgesic efficacy to aspirin and paracetamol (acetaminophen) than theweak opioid analgesics such as codeine. Neither nalbuphine nor butorphanol is available as an oral formulation. At usual therapeutic doses nalbuphine andbutorphanol have respiratory depressant effects equivalent to that of morphine (though the duration of sucheffects with butorphanol may be longer). Unlike morphine there appears to be a ceiling to both therespiratory depression and the analgesic action. All of these 3 drugs have a lower abuse potential than the pureagonist opioid analgesics such as morphine. However, all have been subject to abuse and misuse, andpentazocine (but not the others) is subject to Controlled Drug restrictions. Buprenorphine is a potentpartial agonist at the mu-receptor, and by intramuscular injection is 30 times as potent as morphine. Aceiling to the analgesic effect of buprenorphine has been demonstrated in animals and it is also claimed inhumans. However, there are no reliable data available to define the maximal dose of buprenorphine inhumans. A practical ceiling exists for sublingual use in that the only available formulation is a 2 microgramstablet and few patients will accept more than 3 or 4 of these in a single dose. The duration of analgesia islonger than that of morphine, at 6 to 9 hours. There have been suggestions that buprenorphine causes lessrespiratory depression than morphine, but viewed overall it appears that in equianalgesic doses the 2 drugshave similar respiratory depressant effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 118] SO - Drugs 1991;41:326-34 UI - 000113 AU - Mendelson G AU - Mendelson D TI - Legal aspects of the management of chronic pain[published erratum appears in Med J Aust 1991 Dec 2-16;155(11-12):856] AB - OBJECTIVE: To review the legal provisions which controlthe prescription of opioid analgesics in Australia, and to summarise the areas in which practitionerswho treat patients with chronic pain may expect to become involved with the legal system. DATA SOURCES: Therelevant legislation was reviewed, and a selective review was undertaken of literature dealing withthe legal aspects of pain and suffering which may form a basis for personal injury claims. Case law which dealswith issues of consent to treatment was also examined. DATA SYNTHESIS: Statutory requirements whichcontrol the prescription of opioids were summarised. Leading cases on patient consent were discussedto clarify for the practitioner the principles which the Courts use in the assessment of the validity of theconsent given by patients for treatment. The assessment of the pain patient involved in litigation wasbriefly discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The prescription and administration of opioid analgesics must bein accordance with the legislative provisions. Treatment options must be discussed and explained to patientsso that valid consent can be obtained.

It has been in use since the early 1900s, but the technique usinglocal application of opiate analgesics has only been in use since the late 1970s (Moulin & Coyle, 1986).Today, many patients receive epidural analgesia for postoperative pain control, and its use for acute or chronicpain management in a hospital, pain clinic, or home setting also continues to increase. Epidural analgesiais also being utilized to manage acute pain in the pediatric client. Epidural analgesia requires meticuloustechniques, beginning with placement of the epidural catheter and continuing with administration of medicationsand nursing management of the catheter. Nursing assessment and development of protocols along withpreoperative and postoperative patient and family teaching are vital components of the total plan of care. Thenurse practitioner (NP) or other health care provider must be cognizant of safety considerations, whetherin the hospital environment, pain clinic, or home setting.

It is estimated thatpain is a major symptom in 70% of cancer patients. Continuous subcutaneous infusion of opioids hasproved to be an efficacious and safe method to control the chronic pain of the home-bound and hospitalizedpatient. A wide variety of opioids can be used, including morphine, hydromorphone, and methadone. Thesubcutaneous route offers economic as well as physiologic advantages. The primary disadvantage to thesystem is volume limitations. Competent nursing management of the subcutaneous infusion helps to maximize theeffectiveness of the opioid, thereby improving the patient's quality of life SO - Journal of Intravenous Nursing 1991;14:30-3 UI - 000115 AU - Richlin DM TI - Nonnarcotic analgesics and tricyclic antidepressants forthe treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain AB - Chronic nonmalignant pain is often characterized bymultiple treatment failures, a pattern of maladaptive behavior, and depression. Often there is ahistory of inappropriate and excessive use of medications for pain. Prior and ongoing use of narcotics andsedatives acts to compound and aggravate the chronic pain syndrome. A first step in treatment iscontrolled withdrawal of these agents. Nonnarcotic analgesics, NSAIDs, and tricyclic antidepressants arecommonly employed in patients with chronic pain. Effective use of these agents requires understanding of theirpharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Use of a fixed-time schedule is necessary toachieve an effective, sustained therapeutic response. Careful patient education and monitoring for side effects andtoxicity are necessary, particularly in the elderly and patients with coexisting medical disorders.Incidence of side effects and toxicity may be reduced by choice of drug and modification of dosing regimen.Nonnarcotic analgesics, TCAs, and NSAIDs are seldom effective by themselves in resolving the pain anddistress of patients with chronic nonmalignant pain. This is particularly true when maladaptive behavior coexists.A comprehensive multimodal pain management program encompassing additional pain-relieving strategies andbehavior-modifying techniques should be considered and utilized in conjunction with medication.

[Review] AB - Inadequately treated acute and chronic pain remains amajor cause of suffering, in spite of enormous advances in pharmacology and technology. Opioids provide apowerful, versatile, widely available means of managing this pain, but their use is too often restrained byignorance and mistaken fears of addiction. The management of postoperative pain (perhaps the most commonform of acute pain) is traditionally attempted with fixed dosages of analgesics by relatively unpredictableroutes (e.g. oral, rectal and intramuscular). Intravenous opioid infusions (an improvement) riskrespiratory depression and require close monitoring and titration. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), by contrast,permits the most efficacious medication (pure opioid agonist) by the optimal route (intravenous) underdirect control of the patient, and provides high levels of satisfaction and safety. Ideally, any opioid useshould be integrated with a wide spectrum of other analgesic modalities in an anaesthesiology-based 'acute painservice'. The use of opioids for chronic pain of nonmalignant origin remains controversial. There is aperceived conflict between patients' interests and those of society. However, problems (such as tolerance, physicaldependence, addiction and chronic toxicity), anticipated from experience with animal experiments andpain-free abusers, seldom cause difficulties when opioids are used appropriately to treat pain (so-called 'dualpharmacology'). With sensible guidelines, and in the context of a multidisciplinary pain clinic, opioids mayprovide the only hope of relief to many sufferers of chronic pain.

Central action on opioid receptors of the substantia gelatinosa allows opioids to beadministered spinally for pain originating anywhere inferior to the cranial nerves. Spinal opioids aremost commonly administered for intractable midline sacral and perineal pain. The best candidates forspinal opioids are patients in whom appropriate "conventional" therapy no longer provides adequaterelief, patients who experience severe adverse effects from conventional therapy, and patients for whom alternativeanesthetic procedures are inappropriate or have failed. A reasonably safe initial dose is morphinesulfate 1 mg intrathecally. The availability of preservative-free, concentrated morphine sulfate enableslarger doses to be safely and comfortably administered. Increased dosage requirements may result fromtolerance, progression of disease, increased systemic absorption, or slippage of the catheter tip. As withsystemically administered opioids, care must be exercised when discontinuing spinal opioid therapy. Adjuvantdrugs used with spinal opioids include systemically administered analgesics, antidepressants,corticosteroids, and spinal local anesthetics. The administration of spinal opioids with systemic opioids orother CNS depressants may result in excessive sedation, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting,constipation, pruritus, and other adverse effects. Spinally administered opioids can be used to manage severe chronicpain effectively, safely, and comfortably.

Thisreport presents one of the first large series of terminally ill cancer patients with intractable pain treatedwith continuous epidural morphine infusions by means of implanted pumps and epidural spinal catheters. Thepurpose of the study was to demonstrate that the epidural route is effective with minimal complications,and that screening with temporary epidural catheter infusions results in a high rate of subsequent painrelief. A multidisciplinary team (neurosurgeon, anesthesiologists, psychiatrists, oncologists, and nurseclinicians) evaluated and treated all of the patients studied. Percutaneous placement of temporary epiduralcatheters for a trial assessment was performed by the anesthesiologists. Pain evaluations were conductedindependently by psychiatrists using both verbal and visual analog scales. From 1982 to 1988, 41 (59.4%) of 69patients evaluated for eligibility experienced good pain control during trial assessment and weresubsequently implanted with Infusaid infusion pumps. Preinfusion pain analog values were 8.6 +/- 0.3 andpostimplantation values at 1 month were 3.8 +/- 0.4 (p less than 0.001). Over this same 1-month period. requirementsof systemic morphine equivalents decreased by 79.3% with epidural infusions as compared to preinfusionrequirements (p less than 0.001). There were no instances of epidural scarring, respiratory depression,epidural infections, meningitis, or catheter blockage. One patient developed apparent drug tolerance andthree patients required further catheter manipulations.

[Review] AB - The pathogenesis of cancer pain, the incidence of painassociated with specific types of malignant tumors, and the nature of acute and chronic pain arediscussed, and alternative delivery systems for pain management are described. More than 80% of cancer patientswith advanced metastatic disease suffer moderate to severe pain. Most cancer pain is caused by directtumor infiltration; approximately 20% of cancer pain may be attributed to the effects of surgery,radio-therapy, or chemotherapy. The incidence of cancer pain is related to tumor type; 70% or more of patientswith tumors of the bone, cervix, and ovaries suffer cancer-related pain, while only 5% of patients withleukemia have pain. Pain is defined by the organs involved. Somatic pain is usually dull and well localized;visceral pain is generalized and difficult to describe. Other types of pain, including deafferentation pain andreferred pain, are particularly difficult to manage. Cancer pain may be acute or chronic. The latter may causepsychological reactions that make effective treatment more challenging. Opiate analgesic agents,administered by the epidural or intrathecal routes, block pain more selectively and produce fewer adversereactions than systemic analgesic agents. The duration and onset of analgesia depend on the lipophilicityof the agent used. Because pain is the most common complaint of the patient with cancer, cliniciansshould be aware of the range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic analgesic modalities available to them.Familiarity with newer modalities and delivery routes, such as spinal administration of opiate analgesics,is recommended.

A previously treated patient with surgery and radiotherapy for carcinomaof the palate developed severe intractable pain despite high dose oral morphine therapy. Investigationsrevealed that neoplasm had reoccurred with extensive infiltration. Intraventricular morphine therapy wasdiscussed and accepted by the patient and family. A ventricular shunt with an Ommaya reservoir wasinserted under local anaesthesia. Preservative-free morphine sulphate in increasing doses of 0.25 to 1 mg wasadministered, once daily, which kept the patient in a pain-free state. The treatment was initiated in thehospital and continued at home till the demise of the patient on the 9th week.

[Review] AB - The mechanism of action of opioids and clinicallyrelevant differences among the opioid analgesics are described. Both endorphins (endogenous morphine-likesubstances) and exogenous opioids (opium alkaloids and their derivatives) bind to opioid receptors in the humancentral nervous system to provide analgesia and other effects. Some drugs, such as morphine, are trueagonists, i.e., they bind to and activate receptors. Some are partial agonists, binding to part of the receptorand causing effects that are similar to, but perhaps less pronounced than, the effects produced by agonists.Others are antagonist, i.e., they bind to the receptor but do not cause the associated effects. Some drugs, termedagonist-antagonist opioids, act as antagonists at one type of receptor and agonists at another type ofreceptor. True agonists tend to have relatively straight- line dose-response curves; in other words, their effectincreases with increasing doses over a broad dosage range. Partial agonists and agonist-antagonists tend to haveceiling effects; that is, they do not have the broad dosage range of drugs such as morphine, methadone,hydromorphone, and other "strong" opioids. This fact mediates against the use of partial agonists andagonist-antagonists in cancer patients who have chronic pain that may increase as the disease progresses.Three major factors that should be considered when a drug is selected for clinical use are (1) relativeaffinities for the different opioid receptor types, (2) pharmacokinetic characteristics that influence onset andduration of action, and (3) whether the opioids are strong or weak. For treatment of cancer pain, drugs with longdurations of action are preferable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [References: 11] SO - American Journal of Hospital Pharmacy 1990;47:S7-1 UI - 000128 AU - McKinney MW AU - Londeen TF AU - Turner SP AU - Levitt SR TI - Chronic TM disorder and non-TM disorder pain: acomparison of behavioral and psychological characteristics AB - The purpose of this paper is to determine whetherpatients with chronic temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain manifest behavioral, experimental, andpsychological characteristics similar to patients with other chronic pain illnesses. The Chronic Pain Battery (CPB),a multidimensional assessment tool for chronic pain patients, was used to compare several importantvariables between 78 TM disorder (TMD) patients and 98 non-TMD chronic pain patients. The study found thatchronic TMD patients had lower "usual" pain intensity and suffering levels, fewer vegetative symptomsassociated with depression, higher pain tolerance, less impairment of activity, more hope about treatmentoutcome, lower health care system utilization, but higher reported stress levels than non-TMD chronic painpatients. The two groups manifested no significant differences in use of narcotics, sedatives, and sleepingpills; levels of depression, anxiety, somatization, hostility, or psychoticism; illness behavior reinforcement intheir social surroundings; or ratings of problems with work, family, self-esteem, or suicidal impulses. Thesefindings suggest that chronic TMD pain patients (with a symptom duration of over six months) are behaviorallyand psychologically similar to non-TMD chronic pain patients, but that they differ in theirperceptions of their disorder, rendering them less handicapped by their problems.

An important task for the anesthesiologist]. [Review] [German] AB - Anesthesiologists have always played a leading role inresearch into pain and its treatment. Their efforts, however, have been focused on acute or postoperativepain problems. It was the American anesthesiologist John J. Bonica who fought for an increasedinterest in chronic pain. The establishment of the first Multidisciplinary Pain Center at the University ofWashington in Seattle, the foundation of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) andMelzack and Wall's now 25 year old gate control theory were the driving forces behind rapid developments inresearch and treatment in the area of chronic pain. The realization that chronic pain was the most frequentcause of disability in the United States also gave an impetus for new efforts in treatment. The classicanesthesiological topics, such as operative anesthesia emergency medicine and intensive care, have beenextended to include acute pain services and chronic pain treatment facilities. This reflects theunderstanding that anesthesiological knowledge and techniques can be valuable to patients in severe acute painand those in lingering long-term chronic pain phases. Anesthesiologists are skilled in the use of opioidnarcotics and in the administration of strong analgesics. Many severe pain problems can be solved bycorrect use of the analgesic regimen. Special ways of administering narcotic analgesics, such as epiduralinfusion or patient-controlled analgesia, have already alleviated the pain problems of many patients.Anesthesiological techniques are also crucial in diagnosis. Sequential differential blockade and simple nerve blocks canbe helpful in the diagnosis and classification of the pain problems. Anesthesiological contributions to achronic pain service are not restricted to medical interventions. Organizational skills are also needed forefficient running of multidisciplinary pain treatment facilities. Clinical practice in surgical anesthesia meansthat anesthesiologists are experienced in interdisciplinary work and familiar with the advantages anddangers of team work. Despite international acceptance of the multidisciplinary approach to chronic pain,there is still a lack of appropriate facilities in the German-speaking countries, and we consider it importantthat anesthesiologists commit themselves to increasing general awareness of what is needed.

Theprevalence and characteristics of this phenomenon have not been defined, and its impact on patient care isunknown. We developed operational definitions for breakthrough pain and its major characteristics, and appliedthese in a prospective survey of patients with cancer pain. Data were collected during a 3 month period fromconsecutive patients who reported moderate pain or less for more than 12 h daily and stable opioiddosing for a minimum of 2 consecutive days. Of 63 patients surveyed, 41 (64%) reported breakthrough pain,transient flares of severe or excruciating pain. Fifty-one different pains were described (median 4 pains/day;range 1-3600). Pain characteristics were extremely varied. Twenty-two (43%) pains were paroxysmal inonset; the remainder were more gradual. The duration varied from seconds to hours (median/range: 30min/1-240 min), and 21 (41%) were both paroxysmal and brief (lancinating pain). Fifteen (29%) of thepains were related to the fixed opioid dose, occurring solely at the end of the dosing interval.Twenty-eight (55%) of the pains were precipitated; of these, 22 were caused by an action of the patient (incidentpain), and 6 were associated with a non-volitional precipitant, such as flatulence. The pathophysiology of thepain was believed to be somatic in 17 (33%), visceral in 10 (20%), neuropathic in 14 (27%), and mixed in10 (20%).

This most likely resultsfrom the stimulated release of opioid peptides and catecholamines from the transplanted chromaffin cells.However, chronic pain models may more closely resemble human clinical pain, and the arthritic rat model hasbeen used for screening potential therapeutic strategies. The purpose of the present study was to assessthe potential for adrenal medullary tissue implanted into the spinal subarachnoid space to alleviatechronic pain. Adrenal medullary tissue was implanted into adjuvant-induced arthritic rats, and changesin body weight and vocalization responses were monitored over the 10 week course of the disease. Resultsindicate that the severe weight reduction normally associated with this inflammatory arthritis wasattenuated by adrenal medullary, but not control, implants. In addition, vocalizations were reduced in animalsimplanted with adrenal medullary, but not control tissue following nicotine stimulation. This reductionwas blocked by the opiate antagonist, naloxone, and partially attenuated by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist,phentolamine. Together, these results suggest that the transplantation of adrenal medullary tissue into thesubarachnoid space of the spinal cord may provide a local source of opioid peptides and catecholaminesfor the reduction of chronic pain SO - Pain 1990;42:69-7 UI - 000126 AU - Tom CM AU - Arias LM AU - Barolat G TI - Spinal opiate administration: a case of cathetermisplacement AB - Continuous spinal opiate administration via permanentlyimplantable drug delivery devices has been proven to provide profound analgesia for chronic painconditions.

This was verified by x-ray dyestudies. It is postulated that this misplacement of the catheter likely occurred as a result of recent lumbarpunctures the patient had undergone.

The present study was aimed at studying the role played by noradrenergic andopioidergic influences on the antinociceptive activity of subchronically administered clomipramine in the formalintest (a tonic pain model) in rats. Clomipramine produced antinociception after 7 days, administration (2.5mg/kg/day), an effect equivalent to that obtained by acute morphine (5 mg/kg). The antinociceptive effect ofclomipramine was inhibited by the following: nonspecific blocking of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors byphentolamine, specific blocking of alpha 1- adrenoceptors by prazosin; stimulation of alpha 2 receptorsby clonidine; and blocking of the opioid receptors by naloxone. Blocking the alpha 2-receptors withyohimbine did not antagonize the effect of clomipramine. These results suggest that clomipramineproduces antinociception in this test, partly via the participation of the endogenous opioid system and partly byfurther activating or potentiating previously activated noradrenergic pathways which are involved in thecontrol of pain information SO - Psychopharmacology 1989;98:93-9 UI - 000069 AU - Arnold C TI - Intraspinal analgesia: a new route for an old drug AB - Chronic pain control is a pressing world health problem.Despite the magnitude of this health issue, health care professionals receive little formal training inpain management, hence attempts to deal with chronically suffering patients may be futile.

[Review] AB - A broad spectrum of painful conditions presents to themodern emergency center (EC). The three most common categories are acute, self-limited disorders;chronic medical or surgical syndromes with acute exacerbation; and psychic pain syndromes in which theetiology cannot be easily ascertained. Many factors may differentiate pain from suffering, and physicians shouldeducate patients not only about the nature of their condition and its prognosis, but also about anticipateddiscomfort. Clinical concerns in the EC include physicians' tendency to undertreat or even ignore pain, theneed for appropriate but flexible dosage schedules, and physicians' concern about masking importantsigns and symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are currently the safest and mosteffective group of oral analgesics. Important factors for drug selection include efficacy, dosage, lack ofside effects, and cost. Two special groups of patients, those with psychic pain syndromes and those withdrug-seeking behavior, can create problems for the physician. Patients with chronic pain syndromes needspecial follow-up but do not benefit from additional analgesic drug therapy. Patients who seek andabuse drugs can be difficult to identify, may have true underlying medical pathology, and should not be givennarcotic prescriptions.

Enkephalinase was labeled by a specific tritiated inhibitor,[3H]N-[(2RS)-3-hydroxyaminocarbonyl-2-benzyl-1- oxopropyl]glycine ([3H]HACBO-Gly), while mu and delta opioidbinding sites were selectively labelled with [3H]Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-(Me)Phe-Gly-ol ([3H]DAGO) and[3H]Tyr-D-Thr-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr ([3H]DTLFT), respectively. As compared to controls, no significantmodifications were found in NEP, mu or delta binding sites at both supraspinal and spinal levels of arthriticrats.

The patients were dividedinto one of four groups based on their response to the epidural solutions: placebo response group--painrelief with placebo solutions; fentanyl response group--pain relief with epidural fentanyl; lidocaine responsegroup (LRG)--pain relief with lidocaine but not fentanyl; and no response group--no pain relief with any ofthe solutions used. The four groups were compared on the basis of age, sex, site of pain, duration ofpain, narcotic use, pain assessment index, and workmen's compensation claims. The comparisons resulted inthe conclusion that LRG patients had a much longer average duration of pain than the other groups. On thebasis of the information gathered, it was theorized that, despite their response to epidural lidocaine,LRG patients may actually be a group of operant pain patients.

Patients notundergoing opiate withdrawal evinced increased baseline pain tolerance latencies prior to drug administrationcompared with normal volunteers. Two patients undergoing the opiate withdrawal syndrome at the time of testexperienced reduced pain tolerance latencies compared with normal volunteers, most probably correspondingto the hyperesthesia symptom of the syndrome. Intravenous morphine infusion (30 mg) induced atime-dependent increase in cutaneous pain tolerance with peak effect occurring 1-2 h afteradministration. This persisted for up to 4 h and thereafter declined. The time course of subjective pain self-report byvisual pain analog scale (VPAS) measurements corresponded to the time course of increasing cutaneous paintolerance latency assessed by dolorimetry. Pain self-reports following intrathecal morphine infusion(2.25 or 1 mg) followed a similar though slower onset to that reported by patients receiving intravenousmorphine and was of lesser degree. In contrast, heat beam dolorimetric evidence of increased cutaneous paintolerance (which was of lesser degree than following i.v. morphine) did not reach its maximum during the4 h measuring period. A dissociation was noted therefore between the self-reported relief ofendogenous pain and dolorimetrically measured cutaneous analgesia following intrathecal morphineadministration. Linear regression correlation analysis characterized this phenomenon as a positive correlationbetween cutaneous pain tolerance and pain relief self-report following intravenous morphine infusion and anegative correlation following intrathecal administration. We propose that the phenomenon may be due tointrathecal morphine acting via two separate compartments: one spinal and onesupraspinal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) SO - Pain 1989;39:249-25 UI - 000082 AU - Lombard MC AU - Besson JM TI - Electrophysiological evidence for a tonic activity ofthe spinal cord intrinsic opioid systems in a chronic pain model AB - The aim of this electrophysiological investigation wasto evaluate the activity of the spinal endogenous opioid systems in a chronic pain model, the arthritic rat.The activity of nociceptive non-specific dorsal horn neurons (n = 23) were recorded in 23 spinal unanesthetizeddecerebrated rats.

Progressive pain due to eitheradvancing disease or development of drug tolerance could be controlled by increasing opiate infusionrates. We conclude that (1) continuous infusion opiate with PCA bolus capability can be initiated andadministered safely in the home setting; (2) patients with pain related to malignancy can be managed well with thissystem; and (3) pain control programs can be designed, implemented, and evaluated in the private practicesetting SO - Journal of Clinical Oncology 1989;7:1903-1908 UI - 000217 AU - Vaccarino AL AU - Tasker RA AU - Melzack R TI - Analgesia produced by normal doses of opioid antagonistsalone and in combination with morphine AB - AB - In a recent study [30] it was reported thatnaloxone, at doses normally employed for opioid antagonism, produced a dose-dependent analgesia in BALB/cmice in the formalin test. We report here that another opioid antagonists, naltrexone, also producesanalgesia under these conditions. Female BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with naltrexone (0.01-1.0mg/kg) or saline alone and tested for analgesia using the formalin test. Naltrexone produced a statisticallysignificant dose-dependent analgesia, with an ED50 of 0.05 mg/kg and almost total analgesia at doses of 0.1mg/kg or greater. To determine the relationship between naloxone analgesia and better documentedforms of opioid analgesia, BALB/c mice were injected with naloxone or saline following theadministration of a pre-determined ED50 for morphine and tested for analgesia using the tail-flick and formalintests. Naloxone antagonized morphine analgesia in the tail-flick test at both doses used (0.3 and 10 mg/kg). Inthe formalin test, however, naloxone attenuated morphine analgesia at the lower doses (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) andpotentiated morphine analgesia at the highest dose (10 mg/kg).

[Review] AB - Of the four categories of oral analgesics, three havebeen available since the 19th century. Although adequate doses of the more potent oral opioids such asmorphine and methadone are effective even in severe pain, the commonly used "weak" narcotics such ascodeine and propoxyphene are no more effective than usual doses of aspirin or acetaminophen. Furthermore, theopioids produce gastrointestinal and central nervous system adverse effects, and, during long-termadministration, tolerance may develop and there is a risk of drug dependence. Aspirin and acetaminophen are thetraditional agents of choice for oral analgesic therapy; until 10 years ago, there were no single-entity,oral analgesics--with the exception of large doses of oral narcotics--that were more effective than usual doses ofaspirin or acetaminophen. However, there is a ceiling on the analgesic effect attainable with safe doses ofthese drugs, which may in part be overcome through the use of the third category of oral analgesics,combinations of aspirin or acetaminophen with oral opioids. The fourth category of oral analgesics constitutesthe most important recent development in pain management with analgesic drugs: the newer peripherallyacting, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics, some of which are clearly more efficacious than aspirin oracetaminophen and compare favorably not only with full doses of narcotic combination products but even, insome cases, with strong injectable opioids. On repeated dosing, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsare better tolerated than aspirin and some have a much longer duration of analgesic effect than aspirin oracetaminophen. Further study is needed to compare nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs among themselvesand to determine their value in chronic pain and in combination therapy.

Follow-up data(with attrition controlled) at six months and 12 months postdischarge do not provide any evidence fordeterioration (ie, return to pretreatment levels of drug dependence).

Sensory levels of analgesia (topinprick) and pain (on a five-point scale) were assessed hourly for 16 hours during continuous epiduralinfusion of 0.5% plain bupivacaine (8 ml/hr) in 12 patients with chronic nonsurgical pain and in 30 patientsafter major abdominal surgery performed under combined bupivacaine and halothane--N2O general anesthesia.No opiates were given. If sensory analgesia decreased more than five segments from the initial level orif the pain score reached 2 (moderate pain), the patient was removed from the study. Initial levels of sensoryanalgesia after loading doses of 21.8 +/- 0.5 and 19.3 +/- 0.8 ml bupivacaine 0.5% were similar (T3.8 +/-0.3 and T3.8 +/- 0.5) in the surgical and chronic pain patients, respectively (mean +/- SEM). Of thesurgical patients, only 4 of the 30 (13%) maintained the initial level of sensory analgesia, and a painscore below 2 throughout the study compared with 7 of the 12 patients with chronic pain (58%) (P lessthan 0.01).

At the time of blood sampling, pain intensity, mood, and cognitiveperformance were assessed. There was large individual variation in the dose-drug level relationship. Seven patientswith bone or soft tissue pain and drug levels of greater than or equal to 4 ng/ml had good pain control,whereas 10 did not. None of 15 patients with levels less than 4 ng/ml had pain control, despite drug dosessimilar to those given patients with higher levels. Thus 60% of the patients without control of their pain hadhydromorphone levels below the lowest level that produced pain control. No patient with pain from nerveinfiltration or compression had good pain control, irrespective of the drug level or dose. Poor mood correlatedwith high pain intensity and low drug level.

[Review] AB - Although the scientific study of pain in the modernsense was initiated 150 years ago, and a number of theories were subsequently proposed, until two decades agopain research remained conceptually stagnant and the meager amount done was not commensurate with themagnitude and clinical importance of pain. Consequently, pain treatment remained somewhat empirical andineffective. Moreover, the knowledge and effective therapeutic modalities that were available were notproperly applied, primarily because medical students and physicians were not taught the basic principlesof pain management. Fortunately, during the past 20 years significant advances have been made in ourknowledge of basic mechanisms of acute pain and about some chronic pain syndromes, and a variety of newtherapeutic modalities have been introduced and old ones have been refined. Among the most important advancesof the past decade have been the discovery of opiate receptors, the extensive pharmacokinetic andpharmacodynamic studies of narcotics, the development of very sensitive analytic techniques andmathematic knowledge and many other advances which have prompted the development of new drugs, novel drugpreparations and novel methods of administration, of which intraspinal narcotic therapy is themost important and widely used. [References: 123] SO - Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica, Supplement1987;85:1-16 UI - 000099 AU - Bovill JG TI - Which potent opioid? Important criteria for selection AB - Opioids remain the drugs of choice for the treatment ofsevere pain. In recent years several new potent opioids have become available for clinical use. These newerdrugs are generally safer than the older morphine-like compounds and their differing pharmacologicaland pharmacokinetic properties allow the physician to choose an appropriate drug according to theclinical situation and need of an individual patient. These drugs are classified according to their activity at theopioid receptors. The opioid agonists produce their pharmacological effect by an almost exclusive action atmu-receptors. The agonist-antagonist group are kappa-receptor agonists and either competitive antagonists atthe mu-receptor or weak mu-agonists. The use of the potent opioid agonists, because of their potential forcausing respiratory depression, is restricted to hospitals. Fentanyl, the oldest drug of this class, isextensively used as a supplement to general anaesthesia, or in high doses as a 'complete' anaesthetic for patientsundergoing cardiac surgery. Alfentanil and sufentanil are newer fentanyl derivatives. Alfentanil is unique inhaving a very short elimination half-life. This is a particular advantage during short operations and for day-casesurgery. For longer operations alfentanil can be given as a continuous infusion to supplement nitrous oxideanaesthesia. Sufentanil is about 10 times more potent than fentanyl and is more rapidly eliminated. Initialreports suggest that it may be more effective than fentanyl as an anaesthetic supplement and that recovery maybe more rapid. Both sufentanil and alfentanil are also used in cardiac anaesthesia. The neweragonist-antagonist opioids, butorphanol, nalbuphine and buprenorphine, have largely replaced pentazocine in clinicalpractice. Unlike pentazocine, they cause a low incidence of dysphoric side effects. Like the pure agonists,they cause respiratory depression; however, in contrast to the pure agonists this is not dose related,reaching a 'ceiling' as dose increases. The risk of dependence is also less, so that these drugs are safer forthe treatment of chronic pain. Additionally, it is particularly worth noting that buprenorphine and nalbuphinecause minimal cardiovascular changes, and are safe and effective drugs for treatment of pain associatedwith myocardial infarction. Buprenorphine, which is effective parenterally, orally and sublingually, has aprolonged duration of action (up to 12 hours after a single dose) SO - Drugs 1987;33:520-530 UI - 000037 AU - Bruera E AU - Brenneis C AU - Michaud M AU - Chadwick S AU - MacDonald RN TI - Continuous sc infusion of narcotics using a portabledisposable device in patients with advanced cancer AB - Fifty-six patients with chronic pain due to advancedcancer were treated with an sc infusion of morphone (34 patients) or hydromorphone (22 patients) using aportable disposable infusor.

A combination of an in itself ineffective dose of R 62 818 with an ineffective dose of suprofen didattenuate arthritic hyperventilation, and the combination constituted the only pharmacological treatmentthat did so in the absence of anti-inflammatory, toxic or intrinsic respiratory effects. The data areconsistent with the hypothesis that pain rather than acidosis mediates arthritic hyperventilation. They also suggest thatcombinations of an opiate with an NSAID may perhaps be effective in alleviating this pain SO - Pain 1987;30:243-258 UI - 000108 AU - Dickenson AH AU - Sullivan AF TI - Subcutaneous formalin-induced activity of dorsal hornneurones in the rat: differential response to an intrathecal opiate administered pre or post formalin AB - Many studies of pain and nociception use short-lastingacute stimuli which may have limited relevance to prolonged or chronic pain states. Using extracellularsingle-unit recording in the dorsal horn of the rat lumbar spinal cord the present study examines the response ofneurones to a long-lasting nociceptive stimulus, i.e., 50 microliter 5% formalin injected into thecorresponding receptive field in the ipsilateral hind paw, and modulation of this response by an opioid. Formalinproduced a distinct biphasic excitatory response in all convergent neurones tested; an immediateacute or phasic peak of neuronal firing (mean maximum 22 spikes/sec) 0-10 min post injection, and a secondmore prolonged tonic excitatory response (mean maximum 12 spikes/sec) over a period 20-65 min afterformalin. Cells only activated by innocuous stimuli were not excited by formalin indicating theinvolvement of C fibre afferents in the excitatory response of convergent neurones to formalin. Both the biphasic natureand the time course of the neuronal response are similar to those observed in behavioural studies.Intrathecal DAGO (Tyr-D-AlaGlyMePheGly-ol), a potent and selective mu opioid receptor agonist, applied 20min prior to formalin completely inhibited both peaks of excitation. Co-administration of intrathecalnaloxone with the agonist restored the biphasic response. By contrast, when the administration of naloxonewas delayed to 2 min post formalin so that inhibition of the first peak by DAGO pretreatment occurred,there was no subsequent second peak of activity although antagonism of the opioid would haveoccurred. When DAGO was applied 2 min post formalin so the initial acute response occurred, theinhibitory effect of the agonist on the second peak was far less. Thus the relative ability of DAGO to modulate thebiphasic excitatory response of cells to formalin depends on whether the agonist is administered prior to orafter the formalin and the appearance of the second peak may depend on the presence of the first. Theseresults are discussed in light of the role of these neurones in nociception, opioid effects and changes in neuralsystems following peripheral stimuli SO - Pain 1987;30:349-360 UI - 000102 AU - Hanks GW TI - The clinical usefulness of agonist-antagonistic opioidanalgesics in chronic pain.

Pentazocine, the first and most widely used of this group ofdrugs has two major limitations: by mouth it is not a strong analgesic, but is closer in efficacy to theperipherally acting drugs aspirin and paracetamol than the weak opioids; and its use is associated withpsychotomimetic side effects in 10-20 percent of patients. The weak opioid analgesics codeine and dextropropoxyphene aremore effective and better tolerated than pentazocine. Buprenorphine is the most useful of theagonist-antagonists in chronic pain patients. It is potent, long-acting (6-9 h) and effective when givensublingually. However, it has a limited effective dose range and produces the same side effects as morphine-likedrugs, possibly more frequently at equianalgesic doses. It may be used in the treatment of cancer pain, or inpatients with chronic arthritides or other forms of chronic non-cancer pain who require a potent conventionalanalgesic, as an alternative to the weak opioids or to morphine in low doses.

The present paper is a preliminary report of this ongoing study. The report deals with 104 patients: 55of whom completed the 12-month treatment period and a 2-week follow-up phase, during which flupirtinewas replaced by placebo in order to be able to detect drug-withdrawal effects. Forty nine patients withdrewfrom the study. Most of the patients were suffering from degenerative rheumatic arthrosis orinflammatory rheumatic arthritis. The average daily dosage was 300 mg. The incidence of drop-outs was highest inthe first months with hardly any patients withdrawing in the last six months. Fifteen patients droppedout because of side effects (dizziness, nausea, sleep disturbances, and headache). Ten patients dropped outbecause of ineffectiveness, seven because of side effects plus ineffectiveness, and three because of sideeffects and other reasons. The remaining 14 patients dropped out because of other or non-medical reasons.For the 55 patients who completed the study, the analgesic took effect within 45 minutes to 2 hours, theduration of effect was 4-6 hours. Three-quarters of the patients responded to the drug, one-quarter did not.The analgesic effect remained constant during the 12-month treatment, as did the average number of capsulestaken per month. There was no evidence that tolerance developed. The most frequent side effects weredrowsiness (9% of patients), dizziness (11%), dry mouth (5%) and pruritis (9%). The withdrawal symptom scalecompleted every month during treatment (to determine baseline values) and every day throughout the2-week placebo post-treatment phase showed no changes in the median. The mean value increased during thewithdrawal phase, however, indicating that the symptomatology was more pronounced in some subjects. Afterwithdrawal, the non-specific symptoms increased to a greater extent than symptoms from the opiatescale. The symptoms were present throughout the withdrawal phase. If the withdrawal phenomena hadcorresponded to the flupirtine's terminal half-life, then the symptoms ought to have been present mainly in thefirst few days. There was a slight trend for lowering systolic blood pressure but no changes in diastolicblood pressure or heart rate, nor changes in the ECG or laboratory analysis that could be related toflupirtine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) SO - Postgraduate Medical Journal 1987;63 Suppl 3:87-103 UI - 000034 AU - Isakova ME AU - Larionova VB AU - Sidorkin VA AU - Tsirikhov SM TI - Treatment of the pain syndrome in cancer patients byperidural administration of low doses of opiates.

[Review] AB - The treatment approach presented in this article is anobvious departure from ways physicians are typically trained to handle patients' pain complaints.Traditional medical training focuses primarily on the management of acute pain. Unfortunately, the treatmentmodalities appropriate for acute pain are not applicable to most chronic pain disorders. Since physicians'practices contain many chronic pain patients, it is important for them to develop a more comprehensive andeffective approach to the management of CLBP. Through the use of case vignettes, this article has attemptedto elucidate some common problems experienced by patients with CLBP. It is a complex disorderthat requires that the physicians be sensitive to the biologic, psychologic, and social aspects of the illness.Simply handing a patient with CLBP a set of back exercises or prescriptions for narcotics and sedatives willnot be beneficial. Rather, the patient must be educated about the pain and taught to take an active role inhis own treatment. By working with patients and their families, physicians can teach patients with CLBP theself-management skills essential for the resumption of a normal, productive life.

In vitro autoradiography of coronalsections of rat brain was used for a parallel determination of binding to mu-, delta- and kappa-opioidbinding sites. In only two regions, the dorsomedial and dorsolateral parts of the periaqueductal grey (PAG), wasa significant change seen: this comprised an increase in binding to kappa-sites, whereas mu- anddelta-sites therein were unaffected. This region was analysed for opioid peptides derived from each of the threeopioid peptide families known. While no change was seen in levels of immunoreactive (ir)-dynorphin1-17 A(DYN) and ir-Met-enkephalin, a decrease was detected in those of ir-beta-endorphin (beta-EP): this changewas restricted to the PAG. These data demonstrate a highly localized and selective influence ofchronic arthritic pain upon multiple opioid systems in the PAG of the rat, a structure playing a key role in thecontrol of pain and in the expression of the antinociceptive actions of opioids. The data suggest apossible significance of PAG pools of beta-EP and kappa-receptors in the response to and modulation of chronicpain SO - Brain Research 1987;416:349-353 UI - 000097 AU - Millan MJ AU - Czlonkowski A AU - Pilcher CW AU - Almeida OF AU - Millan MH AU - Colpaert FC AU - Herz A TI - A model of chronic pain in the rat: functionalcorrelates of alterations in the activity of opioid systems AB - Intradermal inoculation of rats at the tail base withMycobacterium butyricum led to the gradual development of an arthritic swelling of the limbs whichpeaked at 3 weeks and subsided thereafter. Arthritic rats displayed a loss of body weight, hypophagia, andhypodipsia in addition to a disruption of the diurnal rhythms of ingestive behavior and of core temperature. Theactivity of adenohypophyseal beta-endorphin- (beta-EP) secreting corticotrophs, in contrast toprolactin-(PRL) secreting lactotrophs, was increased in arthritic rats. Indeed, hypertrophy of the adrenal glands wasseen. Arthritic rats also showed an elevation in spinal cord levels of immunoreactive dynorphin (DYN), anendogenous ligand of the kappa-opioid receptor. The paws and tail of arthritic rats showed lower thresholdsin response to noxious pressure (hyperalgesia), higher thresholds in response to noxious heat (hypoalgesia),and no change in their response to noxious electrical stimulation. Neither naloxone nor ICI-154, 129 (apreferential delta-receptor antagonist) modified the responses of the paw or tail to pressure. However, MR2266 (an antagonist with higher activity at kappa-receptors) decreased thresholds to pressure inarthritic, but not control, rats; that is, it potentiated the hyperalgesia. This action was stereospecific. None of theantagonists modified the response to heat. MR 2266 did not affect the response to pressure in rats withacute inflammation produced by yeast. Thus, the potentiation of pressure hyperalgesia by MR 2266 in chronicarthritic rats is highly selective. Arthritic rats showed a reduced response to the analgesic effect of akappa-agonist (U-50, 488H), whereas the response to a mu-agonist (morphine) was enhanced. These effects werespecific to nociception in that their influence upon endocrine secretion (PRL and beta-EP) was otherwisechanged. The secretion of beta-EP and PRL was stimulated by both morphine and U-50,488H, and theinfluence of U-50,488H upon the release of beta- EP (from the adenohypophysis) was enhanced in arthritic rats.It is suggested that polyarthritis is a complex condition entailing many changes, both behavioral andendocrinological. Further, arthritic rats cannot simply be described as "hyperalgesic": of criticalimportance is the nature of the nociceptive stimulus applied. The parallel alterations in spinal cord pools of DYN andkappa-receptors (see also Millan et al., 1986) and the changes in the influence on nociception of kappa-agonists andkappa-antagonists suggest an increased activity of spinal DYN. Thus, spinal kappa-receptors may playa role in the modulation of nociception under chronic pain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) SO - Journal of Neuroscience 1987;7:77-87 UI - 000107 AU - Miller BE AU - Lipman JJ AU - Byrne WL TI - Partial characterization of a novel endogenous opioid inhuman cerebrospinal fluid AB - Human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains manyuncharacterized endogenous opioids, in addition to the known enkephalins, endorphins, and dynorphins.

Approximately 50% of the patients assessed in the hospitaland 25% of the patients assessed in the out- patient clinic were found to be experiencing some degree ofpain at the time of assessment. Therapy-related pain predominated in both in-patients and out-patients; onlyone-third of the pain experienced by in-patients and less than 20% of the pain experienced by out-patients wasdue to tumor. Tumor pain was due primarily to bony invasion. In order to control pain in thoseindividuals experiencing pain, narcotic analgesics were being used by one-half of the in-patients and one-third ofthe out-patients.

In 2 patients, the effects of themorphine sulfate on their unilateral pelvic pain wore off after 4 and 6 months because of tumor progression. Atthat time, they underwent chordotomy procedures elsewhere. The treatment was discontinued in 4patients for reasons other than inadequate pain relief, such as medical complications or resolution of pain.In 3 patients, the procedure was abandoned when emotional and psychological factors interfered with paincontrol. Dose requirements of intraventricular morphine sulfate varied greatly, depending on the total dailydose of systemic narcotic intake at the onset of the study.

The routes of administration covered are oral, buccal,sublingual, rectal, parenteral (continuous iv administration, continuous sc administration, and patient-controlledanalgesia), spinal (epidural and intrathecal), and intraventricular. These routes of administration offer to theclinician many options in the pursuit of a safe, affordable, and effective method of opioid analgesia for thepatient with chronic cancer pain. Regular dosing with oral medication offers the simplest, most reliable, andleast expensive method of pain control; it remains the preferred approach. There should be a specific indicationfor the use of any particular route of administration. Appropriate use of these administrationroutes depends on careful assessment of the patient and detailed knowledge of both the literature and theclinical utility relevant to each.

Evidence for a non-opioid mechanism AB - Pain relief following stimulation of the periaqueductalgray matter (PAG) or periventricular gray matter (PVG) in man has been ascribed to stimulation-inducedrelease of endogenous opioid substances. Forty-five patients were studied and followed for at least 1year after placement of chronic stimulating electrodes in the PAG or PVG to determine if pain relief dueto stimulation could be ascribed to an endogenous opioid mechanism. Three criteria were assessed:the development of tolerance to stimulation; the possibility of cross-tolerance to morphine; andreversibility of stimulation-induced pain relief by the opiate antagonist naloxone. Sixteen patients (35.6%)developed tolerance to stimulation, that is, they obtained progressively less effective pain relief. Twelve(44.4%) of 27 patients undergoing stimulation of the thalamic sensory relay nuclei for treatment of chronic pain(a presumably non-opioid mechanism) also developed tolerance. Morphine sulfate was administered in ablind, placebo-controlled protocol to 10 patients who had become tolerant to PAG-PVG stimulation andnone showed evidence of cross-tolerance. Fifteen of 19 patients, already tolerant to morphine at thetime of PAG-PVG electrode implantation, experienced excellent pain relief by stimulation, alsoindicating a lack of cross-tolerance. Twenty-two patients who experienced excellent pain relief from chronicPAG-PVG stimulation received intravenous naloxone in a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. Painintensity as assessed by the visual analog scale was increased to the same degree by both placebo andnaloxone. Eight patients showed no increase in pain intensity with either placebo or naloxone. Although toleranceto PAG-PVG stimulation developed in these patients, the frequency of tolerance was similar to that seenin patients undergoing thalamic sensory nuclear stimulation. Since the latter technique presumably relievespain by a non-opioid mechanism, the development of tolerance to PAG-PVG stimulation does not, in itself,confirm an opioid mechanism. Cross-tolerance between PAG-PVG stimulation and morphine was not seen andcross-tolerance to PAG-PVG stimulation in patients already tolerant to morphine was rare. Thepain-relieving effect of PAG-PVG stimulation was reversed to an approximately equal degree by naloxone andplacebo. The authors do not believe that, in most patients, pain relief elicited by PAG-PVG stimulationdepends on an endogenous opioid mechanism. It appears that other, non-opioid mechanisms are primarilyresponsible for such pain relief SO - Journal of Neurosurgery 1987;66:364-371 UI - 000176 AU - Zenz M TI - Therapy of pain caused by gastrointestinal tumors.[German] AB - Therapy of pain induced by malignant diseases is animportant task for any physician. A proper diagnosis is necessary for an adequate treatment. Pain in thebones can be treated successfully with peripherally acting analgesics such as acetylsalicylic acid,paracetamol or metamizole. On the other hand, certain tumors require local blockade as in cases withpancreatic or perianal tumors. If such a therapeutic approach is not possible or if pain is felt all over the bodythen centrally acting analgesics such as opiates are necessary. Opiates should be administered according to atight schedule and not on demand. Combinations of certain analgesic drugs are often quite useful.

Twenty-threepatients (19%) showed evidence of tolerance and were given droperidol 1.25-5.0 mg epidurally. In 20patients in this study, there was a significant reduction in the number of epidural opioid injections. Sixpatients complained of excessive sedation, which disappeared when the dose of droperidol was reduced, althoughthis did not affect the analgesia.

This prospective study correlates the clinicalresults of chronic stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and periventricular gray (PVG) matter in humanswith the anatomic site of electrode placement as determined at autopsy, and documents the histologicreactions to electrode implantation and electrical stimulation of the area. Seven patients underwent electrodeimplantation to control their chronic pain; two had electrodes implanted bilaterally. All patients obtainedcomplete analgesia with stimulation, although 3 subsequently found the stimulation to have diminishedefficacy. The opiate antagonist naloxone reversed the analgesia in the 4 patients so tested. All 7 patients laterdied of causes unrelated to electrode implantation or stimulation. Postmortem analysis showed that, for 6 of the 9electrodes implanted, the electrode tip was located in the ventrolateral PAG at the level of theposterior commissure; the other 3 electrodes were found in the white matter adjacent to the PAG. No evidence ofgliosis or parenchymal reaction was observed along the tracts and tips of the electrodes.

Three patients wereswitched to oral regimens using PCA dosing as a guide. Pain and sedation rankings were similar to thoseregistered while exclusively on PCA.

D-Phenylalanine (500 mg/kg p.o.) produced a small increase inaversive threshold which was not statistically significant and not naloxone reversible. Acetylsalicylic acid(200 mg/kg p.o.) but not zomepirac sodium (200 mg/kg p.o.) in combination with D-phenylalanine (500 mg/kg)produced a small statistically significant increase in aversive threshold. Our results argue against thehypothesis that D-phenylalanine is responsible for increasing aversive thresholds via opiate receptormechanisms involving increased activity of enkephalins at synaptic loci. Previous studies by others in rats and miceshowed that D-phenylalanine and acetylsalicylic acid produced increases in nociceptive thresholds which werenaloxone reversible. Our failure to find opiate receptor mediated analgesia in a primate model withdemonstrated opiate receptor selectivity and sensitivity is discussed in terms of previous basic and clinical researchindicating an analgesic role for D-phenylalanine.

These symptoms peak at 3 weeks after inoculation and disappear by10 weeks. The following changes were seen at 3 weeks. Immunoreactive dynorphin (ir-Dyn) andir-alpha-neo-endorphin (alpha-NE) manifested comparable patterns of change. Their levels were increased in theanterior, but not neurointermediate, pituitary. The thalamus showed a rise in ir-Dyn and ir-alpha-NE, but noalterations were seen in other brain regions. In each case, cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral sections ofthe spinal cord showed a rise in ir-Dyn and ir- alpha-NE: This was most pronounced in the lumbosacral region,where the magnitude of these shifts correlated with the intensity of arthritic symptoms. Inaddition, a moderate elevation in ir-methionine- enkephalin (ME) was seen in lumbosacral spinal cord. Inbrain, ir was not changed. The level of ir-beta- endorphin (beta-EP) was elevated both in the plasma and theanterior, but not the neurointermediate, pituitary. In addition, the content of messenger RNA encodingthe beta-EP precursor, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), was enhanced in the anterior lobe. Thus, there was aselective activation of synthesis of beta-EP in, and its secretion from, the anterior lobe. In no braintissue did levels of ir-beta-EP change. At 10 weeks postinoculation, the above changes were no longer apparent,indicating their reversibility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) SO - Journal of Neuroscience 1986;6:899-906 UI - 000198 AU - Portenoy RK AU - Moulin DE AU - Rogers A AU - Inturrisi CE AU - Foley KM TI - I.v. infusion of opioids for cancer pain: clinicalreview and guidelines for use AB - AB - To assess the safety, efficacy, and use ofcontinuous iv infusion (CI) of opioids for cancer pain, we reviewed the clinical experience of 36 patients whoreceived 46 CIs. CI was always preceded by a period of repetitive dosing of opioids. Morphine was used in 36 CIs,methadone in four, hydromorphone in four, oxymorphone in one, and levorphanol in one. Mean doses duringCI were the morphine equivalent of 17 mg/hour (range, 0.7-100) at the start, 69 mg/hour (range, 4-480) at the maximum, and 52 mg/hour (range, 1-480) at termination. Pain relief was acceptable during 28CIs, unacceptable during 17, and unknown during one. There were few toxic effects other than sedation.Twenty-five patients died, 12 resumed im or oral opioids, six continued CI with a different opioid(yielding analgesia in two), and outcome was undetermined in three.

Despite the popularity of CI, little documentation exists for its safety and efficacy.In order to assess these concerns, clinical characteristics of 46 infusions in 36 patients withcancer-related pain were reviewed retrospectively. Hospital charts were analyzed for patient characteristics, prioropioid exposure, rationale for iv administration of drug and for CI, course of infusion, and outcome. Details of thecharacteristics of the study population are presented in a table. All patients had cancer and all but onehad active disease. Thirty-two patients had pain due to tumor invasion, whereas three had pain caused bycancer therapy and one had pain unrelated to the diagnosis of cancer. All patients had been exposed to opioidmedications before the CI was begun. Thirty-six infusions were begun with morphine sulfate, while methadonewas used in four infusions, hydromorphone in four, oxymorphone in one, and levorphanol in one. Additionalmedications, including the opioid analgesics, were often given during the CI; their nature and frequency ofuse are tabulated. During 42 infusions, the max infusion rate was greater than that at the start; during 17infusions, the rate at CI termination was lower than the max rate. Three patterns of dosing during CI wereobserved and are displayed graphically. The duration of CI ranged from 1 to 45 days. Five patients were treatedfor less than 3 days, 13 for 4-6 days, 13 for 7- 13 days, 7 for 14-21 days, 3 for 22-29 days, 2 for 30-37 days,and 3 for 38-45 days. For 25 patients, the CI was maintained until the patients died. Side effects due to theCI were difficult to determine precisely, since 34/46 patients were receiving repetitive iv bolus injectionsof opioids prior to CI, and the medical conditions of the patients were often deteriorating during the infusion.Progressive sedation was by far the most common side effect during CI. Respiratory depression, easilyreversed with iv naloxone, occurred in a single patient who received intrathecal morphine during CI. Safetyand efficacy of CI are discussed. Guidelines in the management of CI are listed in a table.

Oxycodone was used by 12 patients, methadone by 7, and levorphanol by5; others were treated with propoxyphene, meperidine, codeine, pentazocine, or some combination ofthese drugs. Nineteen patients were treated for four or more years at the time of evaluation, while 6 weremaintained for more than 7 years. Two-thirds required less than 20 morphine equivalent mg/day and only 4took more than 40 mg/day. Patients occasionally required escalation of dose and/orhospitalization for exacerbation of pain; doses usually returned to a stable baseline afterward. Twenty-four patientsdescribed partial but acceptable or fully adequate relief of pain, while 14 reported inadequate relief.No patient underwent a surgical procedure for pain management while receiving therapy. Few substantialgains in employment or social function could be attributed to the institution of opioid therapy. No toxicitywas reported and management became a problem in only 2 patients, both with a history of prior drug abuse.A critical review of patient characteristics, including data from the 16 Personality Factor Questionnairein 24 patients, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory in 23, and detailed psychiatricevaluation in 6, failed to disclose psychological or social variables capable of explaining the success of long-termmanagement. We conclude that opioid maintenance therapy can be a safe, salutary and more humane alternativeto the options of surgery or no treatment in those patients with intractable non-malignant pain and nohistory of drug abuse UI - 86258701 SO - Pain 1986;25:171-186 UI - 000186 AU - Portenoy RK TI - Continuous infusion of opioids AB - [No Abstract Available] SO - Am J Nurs 1986;86:318, 322-318, 322 UI - 000047 AU - Przewlocki R AU - Lason W AU - Silberring J AU - Herz A AU - Przewlocka B TI - Release of opioid peptides from the spinal cord of ratssubjected to chronic pain AB - Chronic localized pain increased the level of the opioidpeptides, dynorphin (DYN), alpha- neoendorphin (ANEO), Met-enkephalin (MET) andMets-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 (MEAGL), in the lumbar enlargement of the rat spinal cord.

Responses of males and females were very similar for the heroin rush, rankingpleasure, relaxation, satisfaction, warmth, and thirst highest among 20 feelings surveyed and ranking feelings likesexual orgasm low, only fifteenth out of 20. Responses of males and females for the cocaine rush weresimilar in that both ranked excitement, pleasure, thirst, strength, and anxiety very high, in the top sixresponses, and both rated feelings like sexual orgasm relatively low, rank 9 for males and 15 for females. However,male and female responses for cocaine differed in that males ranked power very high, rank 2; and femalesranked power relatively low, rank 10; but ranked satisfaction, rank 5; warmth, rank 5; and relaxation, rank12; much higher than males who ranked them 15, 16, and 17, respectively.

[Review] AB - Since its introduction to North America in 1942, the useof epidural catheter analgesia has increased dramatically. Improved equipment, methods and medicationshave broadened its application to include among others, surgical anesthesia, chronic pain relief andthe management of postoperative pain. Numerous techniques for epidural puncture and insertion of thecatheter have been described. Although complications have been associated with placement of an epidural catheter,these are rare when performed by an experienced anesthesiologist. Epidural analgesia was firstaccomplished by blockade with local anesthetics. Bupivacaine has been called the local anesthetic of choicefor epidural infusion. Bolus administration of epidural local anesthetics gives effective analgesia;however, its use is limited by brief duration and occasionally severe hypotension. Epidural local anestheticshave been administered by continuous infusion in an attempt to minimize side effects. Nevertheless,hypotension, as well as motor block, numbness, nausea and urinary retention have occurred. Epidural analgesia withlocal anesthetics is effective in relieving postoperative pain, but its safety and feasibility have beenquestioned because of the frequent, potentially serious side effects. These problems led to trials ofepidural narcotics for postoperative pain management. The exact site of action of epidural narcotic analgesics isdebatable; however, the bulk of evidence supports a direct spinal action. Epidural narcotics appear tospecifically inhibit nociceptive stimuli. The prolonged and profound analgesia that occurs with epidural narcoticsrelative to parenteral administration is due to a higher concentration of drug reaching the CSF through the epiduralroute. Since nervous transmission is not completely blocked this technique cannot provide anesthesiaduring operation. Morphine has been the most frequently used narcotic for epidural analgesia. Results ofseveral recent, randomized double-blind studies have shown that epidural narcotics give adequate analgesiacomparable with that observed with epidural bupivacaine. Epidural morphine provides a greater duration ofanalgesia and may cause fewer side effects. Improved analgesia has been reported when epidural narcoticsare used in combination with local anesthetics. Continuous administration of low dosage epiduralnarcotics has been shown to have less frequent side effects than bolus administration.Nevertheless, pruritus, urinary retention, hypotension and severe respiratory depression have been reported with bothmethods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 133] SO - Surgery, Gynecology & Obstetrics 1986;162:389-404 UI - 000229 AU - Tennant FS Jr. AU - Rawson RA AU - Pumphrey E AU - Seecof R TI - Clinical experiences with 959 opioid-dependent patientstreated with levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) AB - AB - Levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) is an orphan drugthat will soon be generally available to treatment facilities. We have recently treated 959 opioidaddicts with LAAM for periods up to 36 consecutive months. Three times per week dosing of LAAMproved to be a safe and effective treatment agent for the majority of subjects. During LAAM inductionthere is a delay in opioid activity as LAAM forms its long-acting metabolites, therefore, symptomaticwithdrawal medication must usually be administered during the first 96 hours of treatment toadequately suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms and prevent self- administration of drugs by the patient. Nolong-term hepatic toxicity or tumor formation could be demonstrated by liver function studies and liver-spleenimaging in a subgroup of patients. Some opioid addicts report that they prefer LAAM over methadone, but thereverse was reported by about 40% of our patients which suggests that both drugs are needed foradequate maintenance treatment of the opioid- addicted population AD - UCLA School of Public Health AD -UCLA Center for Health Sciences 90024 UI - 87112832 SO - J Subst Abuse Treat 1986;3:195-202 UI - 000053 AU - Todd B TI - Narcotic analgesics for chronic pain.

Intramuscular buprenorphine was compared with intramuscular morphine in a series ofsequentially related, twin crossover assays and was found to be about 25 times as potent as morphine. Sideeffects were essentially morphine-like. In a second assay, the acceptability and analgesic activity of sublingualbuprenorphine was studied in a 6-dose, balanced, incomplete block assay, a modification of the twin crossoverdesign employed in the all-intramuscular trial. Sublingual buprenorphine was found to be about 15 times aspotent as intramuscular morphine and was well accepted by our patients. The 4-dose twin crossover trial inwhich doses are adjusted sequentially is more flexible in that a wide range of doses may be studied, but itlacks the ability of the 6-dose design to provide estimates of the curvature of the dose-response slopes of thestudy drugs. When first-dose-only data were analyzed as parallel group assays, the main difference inresults compared with the crossover studies was a decrease in efficiency and sensitivity SO - Pharmacotherapy 1986;6:228-235 UI - 000062 AU - Auld AW AU - Maki-Jokela A AU - Murdoch DM TI - Intraspinal narcotic analgesia in the treatment ofchronic pain AB - The results of intraspinal narcotic analgesia (INA) in43 patients with chronic nonmalignant pain syndromes are reviewed.

This is based upon thepatients' subjective response to the epidural administration of fentanyl and placebo agents. Patientsinitially had both physical and psychological assessment in a multidisciplinary pain management unit andbecause of doubt of the underlying diagnosis, were subjected to this procedure. Eight patients aredescribed in whom the following solutions were administered at 20 min intervals: 2 aliquots of normal saline(5 ml) via an epidural catheter; 1 microgram/kg fentanyl via the epidural catheter; intravenous naloxone 0.4mg, then, depending upon results obtained, 15- 20 ml 2% plain lignocaine via the epidural catheter. If apatient's visual analogue score decreased following epidural fentanyl and subsequently increased followingnaloxone, then a predominantly physical basis for the pain was likely. In contrast, little change in visualanalogue score following fentanyl and naloxone suggested a diagnosis of a predominantly emotional basis for the pain.The diagnoses were substantiated by subsequent follow-up and treatment. It is suggested that this test hasboth prognostic and diagnostic value when used in the context of thorough physical and psychologic assessmentof a patient with chronic pain SO - Pain 1985;21:143-152 UI - 000215 AU - Cohen SR AU - Melzack R TI - Morphine injected into the habenula and dorsalposteromedial thalamus produces analgesia in the formalin test AB - AB - Microinjection of morphine into the area of thehabenula and dorsal posteromedial thalamus (H- PMT) produces analgesia for tonic pain as measured by theformalin test in the rat. Control injections of morphine into sites near the H-PMT result in less or noreduction in pain, indicating that the analgesia observed is probably due to a site of action within the H-PMTrather than at surrounding neural structures. The analgesia is fully developed by the first time oftesting, 10-16 min following the microinjection, and is completely reversible by naloxone, an opiate antagonist.

A rapid narcoticdetoxification procedure using auricular electroacupuncture was applied to Ss, who were to be withdrawn from their opiatemedications. All Ss were first switched to oral methadone. They were then given bilateral electricalstimulation to needles inserted in the "lung" and "shen men" acupuncture points on the ear, followedby periodic intravenous injections of low doses of naloxone (0.8-40 mg/day). 12 Ss were completely withdrawnfrom narcotic medications within 2-7 days, and they experienced no to minimal side effects. These resultsare explained by the relationship of electroacupuncture to the release of endorphins.

We compared the analgesic andside effects of intrathecal (i.t.) DADL and i.t. morphine sulfate (MS) in 10 tolerant cancer patients withchronic pain at or below the T12 level who were receiving inadequate relief or unacceptable side effects fromsystemic opiates. These patients were given i.t. DADL and i.t. MS in a randomized, double-blind, cross-overstudy on separate days at least 1 day apart. I.t. DADL produced analgesia in all patients tested. Total painrelief was greater with DADL than MS in 6 patients, equal in 1 patient and less with DADL in 3. Sideeffects, most commonly drowsiness, were similar with both MS and DADL and suggest supraspinal effects by bothdrugs. At the doses given i.t. DADL produced effective pain relief in patients tolerant tosystemic opiates although no significant difference in analgesic efficacy between MS and DADL was observed.

[Review] AB - Nalbuphine is a potent analgesic with a low side effectand dependence profile in animals and man. Nalbuphine is distinguished from other agonist/antagonistanalgesics in having greater antagonist activity and fewer behavioral effects at analgesic doses than pentazocine,butorphanol or buprenorphine. At equi- analgesic doses, nalbuphine is quantitatively similar tonalorphine in regard to its large ratio of antagonist to analgetic activity. Clinical studies have confirmed thisbalance of strong antagonist to analgesic activity. Nalbuphine has been shown to effectively antagonize therespiratory depressant activity of narcotic analgesics while concomitantly adding to their analgeticresponses. Unlike nalorphine or pentazocine, nalbuphine produces few overt behavioral or autonomic effectsin animals at doses over 300 times its analgesic range. These findings are confirmed by clinicalresults which show that nalbuphine produces few psychotomimetic effects, even at elevated dose levels, incontrast to nalorphine or pentazocine. Nalbuphine produces limited respiratory depression in animals and inman. Significant cardiovascular effects have not been found. Nalbuphine was found to produce significantlyless inhibition of gastrointestinal activity than any of the clinically useful narcotic or agonist/antagonistanalgesics tested in animals. Nalbuphine's analgetic effects are reversed by naloxone doses similar to those whichreverse nalorphine's agonist effects. Results in this and other tests suggest that nalbuphine is primarily akappa-agonist/mu-antagonist analgesic. Unlike pentazocine or buprenorphine, nalbuphine does not suppressthe narcotic abstinence syndrome in partly- withdrawn morphine-dependent animals or man. Rather, due tonalbuphine's strong antagonist activity, analgesic-range doses of nalbuphine severely exacerbate thewithdrawal syndrome in partly-withdrawn mice, monkeys and humans. Nalbuphine also precipitates a strongabstinence response in non-withdrawn morphine-dependent animals and man. In post-addict humans,analgesic-range doses of nalbuphine are perceived as minimally morphine-like, but higher doses arejudged to be progressively more nalorphine-like (i.e. dysphoric), which further limits nalbuphine's abusepotential in drug-seeking individuals. Primary dependence studies have demonstrated that physical dependenceis possible at high dose levels that produce marked side effects. Other studies show that dependence isunlikely to be of significance within nalbuphine's usual analgesic range. Six-month studies in patients withchronic pain have confirmed that analgesic tolerance or physical dependence is uncommon.(ABSTRACTTRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 47] SO - Drug & Alcohol Dependence 1985;14:339-362 UI - 000059 AU - Slattery PJ AU - Boas RA TI - Newer methods of delivery of opiates for relief of pain.[Review] AB - Successful pain management using opiates requires bothan analgesic with sufficient intrinsic activity and an effective administration system. Most instances ofunsatisfactory pain control, however, are due to failure to achieve and maintain adequate blood concentrationsof the chosen drug. Newer techniques of administration aim to overcome this problem. Oral opiatetherapy with conventional or sustained-release formulations of morphine provide good control of terminalcancer pain provided that a regular dosing pattern is established and reviewed according to thepatient's needs. This represents a significant departure from the traditional 'as required' prescription of this typeof drug. In the management of acute severe pain, sublingual and intravenous opiates--self-administered asneeded, or given by mandatory dosing schedules-- have also been shown to overcome the limitations ofintermittent intramuscular injections. A further novel development, stemming from basic neuroscience research, isthe selective application of opiates to the spinal cord via the epidural or intrathecal route. Thiscontroversial technique has led to major improvements in treatment of some types of acute and chronic pain.[References: 61] SO - Drugs 1985;30:539-551 UI - 000061 AU - Young RF AU - Kroening R AU - Fulton W AU - Feldman RA AU - Chambi I TI - Electrical stimulation of the brain in treatment ofchronic pain. Experience over 5 years AB - Forty-eight patients underwent electrical stimulation ofthe brain for treatment of chronic pain between 1978 and 1983. Average pain duration prior totreatment was 4.5 years. Before selection for this procedure patients underwent pain treatment in amultidisciplinary pain center, intensive psychological and psychiatric evaluation, and assessment of pain responsivenessto intravenous administration of placebo, morphine, and naloxone. A total of 71 electrodes were placedin the 48 patients at a variety of stimulating targets, including the periaqueductal gray matter,periventricular gray matter, thalamus, and internal capsule. Seventy-two percent of patients experienced complete orpartial pain relief. In addition, 59% of patients were able to discontinue narcotic usage. Twenty-five percentof patients returned to normal physical activities and another 33% showed marked improvement infunctional capacity. Follow-up periods ranged from 2 to 60 months; with a mean follow-up period of 20months. A variety of relatively minor complications occurred, but no mortality or permanentsequelae were experienced. No patient's pain was made worse as a result of electrical stimulation. Electricalstimulation of the brain offers a safe and relatively effective method for the treatment of chronic pain inappropriately selected patients, who are unresponsive to other forms of therapy SO - Journal of Neurosurgery 1985;62:389-396 UI - 000177 AU - Zenz M AU - Piepenbrock S AU - Tryba M TI - Epidural opiates: long-term experiences in cancer pain AB - Epidural opiates were administered to 139 patients withpain due to malignant diseases via a chronic indwelling catheter inserted percutaneously. So far, 9,716days of treatment can be evaluated. In 87% of the patients whose pain previously could not be controlled withconventional analgesic approaches, epidural opiates resulted in remarkable pain relief. With a mean dailydose of 15.6 mg morphine (range 2-290 mg) or 0.86 mg buprenorphine (range 0.15-7.2 mg) half of thepatients could be treated as outpatients. The mean duration of therapy was 72 days (range 1-700 days), 26catheters being in place for more than 100 days and one catheter being in place for 510 days. Two severeside-effects (meningitis) were observed, both patients being free of symptoms after catheter removal and antibiotictherapy.

Threeprincipal research strategies have been used: (1) measurement of endorphin levels in body fluids (CSF andplasma) in relationship to the stress response and the evaluation of effects on the stress response, (2)enhancement of the functioning of the EOS by administering an opioid agonist, and (3) suppression of thefunctioning of the EOS by the administration of an opioid antagonist (principally naloxone). Clinical studieswith humans have demonstrated some stress- induced analgesia, increased plasma levels of beta-endorphinafter demanding physical exercise and in later stages of labor, and decreases in lumbar CSF opioid levels inSs suffering from chronic pain. In surgical studies, evidence was found that elevated plasmabeta-endorphin levels may be considered a biologic marker of the human stress response. In addition, alterations in thephysiological response to surgical stress followed administration of opiates, suggesting the potential of theEOS to modify stress responses.

These tests--tail-flick,hot-plate, and Formalin--allow comparison of the effects of different noxious stimuli and different motorresponses. Each pain test yielded a unique constellation of cholinergic and dopaminergic influences,suggesting that variation of stimulus and response parameters can change the functional expression ofcholinergic and dopaminergic systems related to pain processing. Significant analgesia was observed in theFormalin test, compared with the saline control, after administration of choline (30 or 60 mg/kg), atropine (2mg/kg), mecamylamine (2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg), or apomorphine (0.3 or 8 mg/kg). No analgesic effects in thistest were observed after atropine (10 mg/kg) or pimozide (0.125 or 0.5 mg/kg). In contrast, there was noevidence of analgesia produced by any of these drugs, in the doses given, in the hot-plate test, and onlyapomorphine (8 mg/kg) produced analgesia in the tail-flick test. When these cholinergic and dopaminergicagents were administered to rats after an injection of 2.5 mg/kg morphine, which by itself has been shown not toproduce analgesia in any of the tests, a general pattern of facilitation was observed in the Formalin test butnot in the tail- flick or hot-plate tests. Facilitation was produced by choline, atropine, mecamylamine, apomorphine,and pimozide (at 0.5 mg/kg but not 0.125 mg/kg).

[German] AB - A randomized double-blind study was done to test the twoopiates buprenorphine (0.3 mg i.v.) and pentazocine (30 mg i.v.) with regard to their applicabilityfor the postoperative phase. These substances were chosen because they are not subject to drug prescriptionregulations. 60 patients who had undergone epigastric and hypogastric interventions underthiopental-sodium-induced halothane anesthesia received i.v. injections of one of the two analgetics as soon as theyrequested a pain-killer postoperatively. The subjective pain intensity registered by means of a visual analogue scaleshows a gradual decrease after buprenorphine with maximal effects 1-3 h post injectionem (7.3 leads to1.5). The duration of action is 8.2 +/- 0.7 h on the average (median 8 h; range 4-22 h). The maximal analgeticeffect of pentazocine is already attained after 10 min (6.3 leads to 3.2). Thereafter the pain-intensity curverises again. Pentazocine has a mean duration of action of 2.35 +/- 0.24 h (median 2 h; range 0.5-5 h). Theinadequate analgetic effect of pentazocine manifests itself in an only slight initial reduction of therespiratory rate (19.5 leads to 17.5 min-1), which, on the other hand, decreases significantly and continuouslyunder buprenorphine (20.8 leads to 13.5 min-1).

Clinical results of a 2-yearstudy. [German] AB - Postoperative pain relief, consumption of analgesics andthe incidence of postoperative complications were investigated in a retrospective cohort-study on 470patients following abdominal surgery. 221 of these patients received epidural morphine or buprenorphine forpostoperative pain relief (Group I). Another group of 249 patients received conventional opiate analgesicsintravenously or intramuscularly (Group II). On average the analgesia lasted 14 h after epidural morphine and11 h after epidural buprenorphine. The overall amount of morphine in the postoperative period was 13.3 +/-14.9 mg and 0.89 +/- 0.55 mg buprenorphine respectively. 5 cases of pneumonia (2.3%) were seen in theepidural group (Group I). 22 pneumonia cases (8.8%) were registered in the group with conventionalanalgesics (Group II). Besides the advantage of stronger and longer duration, small dosage and minor centraldepressive side effects, epidural opiate analgesia has proven to result in positive clinicalconsequences.

Within the context of a "therapeuticcommunity" oriented pain unit, we attack this major public health problem differently. The use of non-narcoticanalgesics, mood altering medications, various forms of psychotherapy (individual, group, family, gestalt,psychomotor) and peer pressure when used in conjunction with various physical modalities of treatment(including biofeedback, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, physical therapy, whirlpool, massage, ice,heat, etc.) appear most efficacious.

The endogenous opiates--the enkephalinsand endorphins--are richly presented in brain structures involved in pain perception and emotionalbehavior. The physiological part played by these opiates seems to be pain relief in situations of fear andanxiety. Disturbances in the endogenous level of endorphins and enkephalins may result in chronic pain andpsychiatric disorders. Acupuncture analgesia is produced by a rise in the brain level of opiates, most likelythe endorphins, further activating the descending midline serotonin system from the raphe nuclei known to exertinhibitory effects on spinal pain transmission.

Samplesof lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained from the Ss and analyzed for the presence of opiatereceptor-active material, here called endorphins. Ss classified as having mainly organic painsyndromes were found to have significantly lower endorphin levels than Ss with predominantly psychogenic painsyndromes. In the total group of Ss as well as in the 2 subgroups, there was a significant correlationbetween CSF endorphin levels and the depth of depressive symptomatology as reported by the patients. On theother hand, there was no correlation between CSF endorphin levels and extent of anxiety or motorretardation. It is concluded that CSF endorphins reflect central processes involved in chronic pain syndromes.

A narrow approach to acupuncture researchlimits itself to study of the nervous system, although there are equally important effects in thecirculatory and endocrine systems. Previous research by the author has shown that acupuncture effects on themicrocirculatory system can normally be classified into 3 consecutively changing phases: vasoconstriction,quasi-control, and vasodilation of capillaries and arterioles. Vasodilation effects are often accompanied bysignificant blood chemistry and complete blood count changes, most of which resemble ACTH effects. Changessuch as generalized vasodilation effects can give various degrees of improvement in insomnia,irritability, impaired learning, memory, and brain circulation. Pain threshold to electrical stimulation isoften enhanced by acupuncture in the acupunctured area, without respiratory depressant effect characteristicsof opiates. The author proposes a concept of "coded stored memory molecules" for chronic painand phantom sensation, using examples of phantom pain, phantom itch, and phantom coldness. The interrelationship ofthe effects of morphine derivaties and their analogs and antagonists and acupuncture is discussed.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In clinical practice, patients with chronic painfrequently report problems with memory functioning. This issue,however, has received little attention in the scientificliterature. The present study was designed to investigate thiscommon problem and to stimulate research interest in thisneglected and important area. DESIGN: Self-reported memory problems were investigated in twogroups of chronic pain patients--patients with pain fromacceleration-deceleration automobile accidents (n = 56) andpatients with pain from various work accidents (n = 27)--and twocontrol groups involving medical/dental (n = 24) andpsychotherapy patients (n = 20). SETTING: Private practice,chronic pain, rehabilitation psychology services. RESULTS: Ourfindings suggest that memory complaints are higher in patientswith chronic pain than in medical/dental or psychotherapypatients. No differences were found between chronic pain groups.On more general measures of memory complaint, differences betweenpain patients and controls were attributed to the severity ofpatients' depression. On a questionnaire designed to be morespecific to memory complaint in chronic pain patients,differences in memory complaint between pain patients andcontrols were found, even after the effects due to depressionwere statistically removed. Although pain patients oftenattribute their memory problems to codeine use and/orpsychoactive medications, there was no support for this in thepresent study. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, thesefindings suggest that memory complaints may be related not onlyto depression but also to the presence of chronic pain. Furtherresearch in this area is needed. Author: Enck-R-E. Title: Pain management and parenteral opioids: an update. Source: Am-J-Hosp-Palliat-Care. 1995 Sep-Oct. 12(5). P 8,9-13.

Journal Title: ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS. Abstract: Hypersensitivity to pain is a common component offunctional bowel disorders. Hyperalgesia may be induced byvarious stimuli which produce a cocktail of inflammatorymediators that decrease the pain threshold. Drugs able to blockthese peripheral events within the gut may offer a newpharmacological approach for treating functional bowel disorders.Kappa opioids have been shown to inhibit somatic pain through aperipheral mechanism of action, acting directly on receptorslocated on peripheral sensory endings. They can block both thenociceptive messages as well as the release of sensory peptides.This paper reviews the effects of opioid agonists on gut visceralpain and motility anomalies induced by visceral pain. Kappaopioids have strong effects on all models tested, with aperipheral mechanism of action allowing the design of drugsacting only in the periphery and having no central nervous systemside- effects. This contrasts with mu agonists which arecentrally active on pain and worsen the subsequent transit andmotility anomalies. Author: Golinski-M-A. Fill-D-M. Title: Preemptive analgesia. Source: CRNA. 1995 Feb. 6(1). P 16-20. Journal Title: CRNA. Abstract: Preemptive analgesia describes a situation where theadministration of a pharmacological agent administered before theonset of a painful stimulus causes a decrease in the intensity ofpain felt, and subsequently there is a decrease in the totalamount of analgesic required compared with the administration ofan agent after a painful stimulus. It is best understood if it isthought of as a block to afferent impulses that are trying toreach the central nervous system before a tissue injury.Preemptive analgesia, administered in the form of narcotics,nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, or local anesthetics, isthought to alter peripheral and central sensitization tonociceptive impulses.

Source: J-Neurosci. 1995 Jan. 15(1 Pt 1). P 165-72. Journal Title: JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE. Abstract: Opioid receptors have been demonstrated on sensorynerves in both inflamed and normal subcutaneous tissue butlocally applied opioid agonists produce analgesia in inflamedtissue only. Inflammation confers a disruption of the perineurialbarrier that can also be induced deliberately by hyperosmolarsolutions. The present study examines at which stage of Freund'sadjuvant-induced inflammation peripheral opioid analgesic effectsbecome manifest and whether a perineurial defect contributes tothe appearance of such effects. To this end we have monitored thetemporal evolution of inflammatory signs (swelling, temperature,hyperalgesia) and of peripheral antinociceptive effects (by thepaw pressure test) of mu-, delta-, and kappa-selective opioids.Using horseradish peroxidase histochemistry, the perineurialbarrier was assessed in normal and inflamed tissue and followingits artificial disruption by hyperosmolar saline and mannitol invivo. Finally, we sought to elicit analgesia in normal tissue bythe concomitant application of mannitol and receptor-selectiveopioids or by an extremely lipophilic opioid agonist (fentanyl).We found that peripheral opioid antinociception and perineurialleakage occur simultaneously at a very early stage (within 12 hr)of the inflammatory reaction and that both can be mimicked by theadministration of hyperosmolar solutions in normal tissue.Fentanyl produced peripheral antinociception in noninflamedtissue that was potentiated by mannitol or inflammation. Ourfindings demonstrate that the perineurium is a crucialdeterminant for peripheral opioid analgesia and that the efficacyof locally applied hydrophilic or lipophilic neuromodulatorycompounds can be improved dramatically by the concomitantmodulation of perineurial permeability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250WORDS) Author: Fowler-C-J.

The first casedescribes a young female who developed hyperalgesia and myoclonusduring intravenous morphine infusion. The hyperalgesia andmyoclonus disappeared when the morphine administration wasdiscontinued and she felt comfortable on small and sporadic oraldoses of methadone. The second case describes hyperalgesiaoccurring after a small dose of sustained-release morphine whichdisappeared after alternative use of oral ketobemidone. The thirdcase describes hyperalgesia following high doses of intramuscularmorphine which disappeared after alternative use of continuoussubcutaneous infusion of sufentanil. The fourth case describes aboy developing hyperalgesia after high doses of oral andintramuscular morphine. The hyperalgesia disappeared afterdiscontinuing morphine administration but withdrawal symptomsdeveloped due to too small doses of methadone. Possiblemechanisms of morphine-induced hyperalgesia are discussed. Author: Turk-D-C. Brody-M-C. Okifuji-E-A. Title: Physicians' attitudes and practices regarding thelong-term prescribing of opioids for non-cancer pain. Source: Pain. 1994 Nov. 59(2). P 201-8. Journal Title: PAIN. Abstract: Prescribing long-term opioids for patients withchronic pain is controversial. The primary purpose of this studywas to examine physicians' beliefs about and prescribing of thelong-term use of opioids in the treatment of chronic painpatients. Concerns about regulatory pressure and appropriatenessof education regarding opioids were also examined. The design wasa stratified random sample. In the United States, 6962 physicianswere randomly selected from two states in each of five regions ofthe country (Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, andPacific). Physicians from seven medical specialties (FamilyPractice, Internal Medicine, Physical Medicine andRehabilitation, Rheumatology, Orthopedic Surgery, Neurosurgery,and Neurology) were surveyed and 1912 (27.46%) responded. Asurvey consisting of questions regarding years of practice,number of chronic pain patients treated, frequency of prescribinglong-term opioids, concerns about opioids, goals of treatment,beliefs about education regarding opioids, and concerns aboutregulatory pressures was used. Based on the physicians whoresponded, it appears that prescription of long-term opioids isrelatively wide-spread. Differences were noted by region,specialty, and the requirement for the use of multipleprescriptions for schedule II drugs. Physicians in the MidwesternUnited States were the least likely to prescribe the long-termuse of opioids. Rheumatologists and general practitioners weresignificantly more likely to prescribe long-term opioids thanwere surgeons, neurologists, or physiatrists and were more likelyto emphasize the importance of symptom improvement as anappropriate goal even in the absence of functionalimprovements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Author: Cherry-D-A.

Abstract: Of the currently available mu agonist drugs, thefollowing are relatively contraindicated: 1.Methadone--unpredictable duration of action [5]. 2.Pethidine--unwanted central effects, metabolised to an activemetabolite and too short acting. 3. Codeine--too weak and withconstipating side-effects. 4. Fentanyl--too short acting. 5.Oxycodone--too short acting although suppositories may overcomesome theoretical disadvantages. 6. Dextropropoxyphene--weakagonist which is possibly metabolised to a cardiotoxic metabolite[6]. Morphine remains the drug of choice for chronic pain whenadministered in a sustained release preparation. MS Contin, aslow release oral formulation of morphine, is available and has apredictable duration of action lasting from 8-12 h, whileimproved formulations are about to be released in the near futurein some countries. Prescribers need to take into account therelatively poor oral bioavailability of morphine when calculatingthe daily morphine dose. Author: Pribilla-O. Title: Medical legal and ethical questions in palliativemedicine and euthanasia. Source: Forensic-Sci-Int. 1994 Dec 16. 69(3). P 299-306. Journal Title: FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL. Abstract: The increasing importance of legal and ethicalquestions in palliative medicine and euthanasia due to theincreased technical possibilities for extending life will beconsidered. In palliative medicine, the choice of the besttherapy will be discussed, especially in the case of oncologicaldiseases. Here, consideration of the prospects of success, forexample, in chemotherapy, is faced with partly seriousside-effects. The requirements of palliative medicine that thepatient has to be fully informed of the fatal prognosis of hisdisease is equally debated as the optimum pain therapy. In thisrespect, the modification of the Narcotics Act of 1 February 1993is also under discussion. In the field of euthanasia, thetechnical development of life extension versus dying has raisedconsiderable legal and ethical problems regarding termination oftherapy. Additionally, fiscal considerations are of increasingrelevance. The common development of the legal and ethicaldiscussion, for example, with regard to the publicity of the workof the so-called 'Gesellschaft fur humanes Sterben', the publicdiscussion leading up to a hearing of the 'Bundestag' regardingactive euthanasia leads to a realization of the subject. Theproposals for an active termination of life by discontinuingtherapy for adults and also for malformed newborns are discussed.A dispute concerning the new legal regulation of activeeuthanasia in the Netherlands of February 1993 is also discussed.There, around 2% of all deaths per year result from activetermination of life and also cases where persons are not able toconsent. This also has enormous consequences for the position ofthe physician.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Author: Platt-D. Title: Important principles of effective pain management.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, numerous trials haveassessed the safety and efficacy of patient-controlled analgesia(PCA). Advantages over conventional parenteral narcotics reportedfrom these trials include equivalent to superior pain relief,superior patient satisfaction, decreased sedation and anxiety,faster return to normal functional status, and reduction innursing time and hospitalization. The majority of these trialshave been conducted in the postoperative patient population. Inthe mid to late 1980s, interest arose in applying PCA technologyto the management of cancer pain. Factors that served as animpetus for the use of PCA in cancer pain included favorablereports from the postoperative setting and the often-citedstatistics regarding the magnitude of the cancer pain problem.Advances in PCA technology coupled with advances in vascularaccess technology that allow the placement of long-term ports andcatheters to facilitate intravenous, epidural, or intrathecaladministration of opioid analgesics have made the applicabilityof PCA in ambulatory cancer patients an attractive option. Thegreatest breakthrough in PCA technology came with theintroduction of devices making it possible to choose betweenintermittent (demand bolus) and continuous administration(continuous infusion) or both intermittent and continuous modes.A comparison of these types of PCA devices is described. Thelimitations of the literature involving PCA therapy in cancerpatients make it difficult to identify optimal patient selectioncriteria, PCA administration schedules, drug selection anddosing, and optimal route of administration. The current statusand pertinent issues related to these topics are addressed. Author: McCaffery-M. Ferrell-B-R. Title: Nurses' assessment of pain intensity and choice ofanalgesic dose.

Source: Anesthesiology. 1994 Dec. 81(6). P 1429-35. Journal Title: ANESTHESIOLOGY. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)receptor- mediated mechanisms may contribute to reduced opioidsensitivity in conditions of pain. The effectiveness of spinalopioids in inhibiting NMDA-mediated nociceptive events wasassessed with two models. In addition, opioid dose-responsecurves with preemptive administration were compared with earlyand late postadministrations. METHODS: Dorsal horn nociceptiveneuronal responses were recorded in the intact halothaneanesthetized rat to acute repetitive C-fiber electricalstimulation (0.1 and 0.5 Hz) and to the peripheral injection of5% formalin. At 0.5 Hz but not at 0.1 Hz, there was an enhancedC-fiber evoked response of dorsal horn neurons elicited byrepetitive C-fiber stimulation (wind-up), which is mediated bythe NMDA receptor. Formalin produced a biphasic response; thelate protracted inflammatory phase was NMDA receptor-mediated.RESULTS: With 0.5-Hz stimulation a large degree of wind-up waselicited; it was less sensitive to 5 micrograms morphine comparedwith the effect of the same dose on the residual wind- upelicited at 0.1 Hz. Preadministration and earlypostadministration of morphine were equieffective at inhibitingthe second-phase formalin response. In contrast, administrationof the fast-acting mu opioid, D-Ala-Gly-MePHe-Gly-ol, given latepostadministration (during the second phase) was less effectivethan preadministration. Increasing the dose of D-Ala-Gly-MePHe-Gly-ol produced complete inhibitions. CONCLUSIONS: NMDA receptor-mediated neuronal responses, suchas wind-up and the established second phase of the formalinresponse, are poorly responsive to opioids. Dose increases andpreemptive opioids effectively inhibit these NMDAreceptor-mediated events. Author: Santill'an-R. Maestre-J-M. Hurl'e-M-A. Fl'orez-J. Title: Enhancement of opiate analgesia by nimodipine in cancerpatients chronically treated with morphine: a preliminary report. Source: Pain. 1994 Jul. 58(1). P 129-32. Journal Title: PAIN. Abstract: The ability of nimodipine, a calcium-channelblocker, to enhance morphine analgesia and/or modify thedevelopment of tolerance was studied in patients with cancer painwho had needed successive increments of morphine for periodsranging from 21 to 780 days. Assessment of daily morphineconsumption was the primary effect parameter. Nimodipinesucceeded in reducing the daily dose of morphine in 16 of 23patients (oral, n = 13; intrathecal, n = 3), and failed to modifyit in 2 patients. Total oral daily dose was reduced by nimodipine(120 mg/day) from 282.6 +/- 47.7 mg to 158.7 +/- 26.2 mg (n = 15,P < 0.001). Intrathecal morphine was also reduced by 1-5mg/day. Nimodipine was withdrawn in 5 patients during the firstweek of treatment due to intolerance (n = 3) or aggravation ofthe disease (n = 2). These preliminary results supportexperimental findings showing that pharmacological interferencewith Ca(2+)-related events may modify chronic opioid effects,including the expression of tolerance.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to assess theeffectiveness of a previously described technique of regionalanalgesia (continuous infusion of local anesthetic through acatheter placed at the time of amputation within the exposedsciatic or posterior tibial nerve) on relieving the postoperativepain in a heterogeneous group of patients who underwent lowerextremity amputations. A second objective was to determine theeffect of such treatment on the incidence and characteristics ofphantom limb pain 6 months or more after surgery in the samepatients. The study design was retrospective, unblinded,controlled (postoperative pain), and unblinded questionnaire andinterview (phantom pain) were utilized. Subjects were inpatientsat Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington, Seattle,WA. Nineteen bupivacaine-treated and 40 nonbupivacaine-treatedpatients who underwent lower extremity amputation subsequent totrauma, infection, long-standing injury (poor or no function),congenital deformity, or burns were evaluated in thepostoperative pain management assessment. Nine treated and 12untreated patients were interviewed in the phantom painassessment. Bupivacaine 0.5% 2-6 ml/h was infused through apolyamide 20-gauge catheter inserted into the sciatic orposterior tibial nerve sheath under direct vision at the time ofsurgery. All patients, treated and control, received opioidanalgesics systemically during the 72-hour period of study. Thepostoperative opioid analgesic requirement of treated patientswas compared with that of control patients who received opioidanalgesics alone. A questionnaire was administered to assesspresence, severity, and character of phantom pain.(ABSTRACTTRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Author: Bilfinger-T-V. Kushnerik-V.

Journal Title: ANNALS OF PHARMACOTHERAPY. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess pharmacists' knowledge,attitudes, and beliefs regarding the use of narcotics in cancerpain management, identify pharmacist counseling activities forcancer pain patients, assess pharmacy- related barriers to cancerpain management, and evaluate the availability of narcoticanalgesics. METHODS: Mailing of a six-page survey. SETTING: Fivehundred randomly selected pharmacists registered in NorthCarolina. PARTICIPANTS: Of 500 pharmacists surveyed, 141 surveyswere completed and returned for a response rate of 28.2 percent.RESULTS: Pharmacists surveyed were knowledgeable regarding theproblem of undertreatment of cancer pain. More than 80 percent ofrespondents replied that most cancer patients experience pain atsome time during their illness. Eighty-five percent ofrespondents agreed that the nurse must believe the patient'sreport of pain and that the patient is the best judge of theintensity of the pain. Conservative physician prescribingpatterns and conservative administration patterns of nurses wereidentified as perceived barriers to adequate pain management by51 and 44 percent of respondents, respectively. Less than 30percent of respondents frequently counseled cancer pain patientsand were unable to identify patients who have cancer pain as amajor medical illness. Hospital pharmacists recommendedadjunctive therapy more often than did community pharmacists (p =0.013). Interventions in pain management regimens were more oftenconducted by hospital pharmacists than by community pharmacists(p = 0.049). Differences in availability of narcotics was notedamong practice sites for some more potent narcotics. Of thepharmacists surveyed, only 43 percent had attended a continuingeducation program on cancer pain management. Ninety-six percentof respondents were interested in attending a continuingeducation program in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists in North Carolina are aware that theundertreatment of cancer pain is a serious medical problem.Unfortunately, pharmacists appear to be unable to identifypatients with cancer pain as a major medical problem; therefore,counseling activity is limited. Addiction is still perceived as abarrier by some pharmacists. Through organizations such as theNorth Carolina Pain Initiative, these problems can be addressed. Author: Jamison-R-N. Anderson-K-O.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES. Opioids have beenaccepted as appropriate treatment for acute and cancer pain, butremain controversial for use with chronic nonmalignant pain.Clinicians are concerned about efficacy, tolerance, addiction,and unwanted side effects. METHODS. The aim of this study was tosurvey chronic pain patients who were taking opioids for theirpain, to determine the incidence of these adverse conditions. Twohundred seventeen patients who were being treated for their painat two different pain centers completed a medicationquestionnaire. The most common diagnosis was low back pain. Onehundred twelve patients reported taking oral opioids for theirpain. RESULTS. Of the patients who reported taking opioids fortheir chronic pain, 83% felt that the opioids were moderatelybeneficial in relieving their pain; 25% felt that the opioid hadnot lost its ability to relieve the pain over time; 35% reportedthat they did not need to increase their medication; 36%expressed no fear of addiction or dependence; and 56% reportedhaving no unwanted side effects. CONCLUSIONS. The results suggest that chronic nonmalignantpain patients taking opioids for their pain reported sometolerance, fear of addiction, and side effects when takingopioids. However, despite these concerns, some of these patientsfelt that opioid therapy was very beneficial. Furtherinvestigations are needed to determine which patientcharacteristics predict benefit from opioid therapy fornonmalignant pain. Author: King-J-C. Kelleher-W-J. Stedwill-J-E. Talcott-G.

Abstract: A high performance, active duty fitness requirementgroup rehabilitated equally to a low performance needs civiliangroup, both suffering from disabling chronic pain. The purpose ofthis prospective study was to determine whether higher physicalperformance requirements adversely affected outcome in a chronicpain rehabilitation program. Twenty-three active duty, chronicpain patients were treated along with 22 civilian chronic painsufferers in a behavior modification, including positive, verbalreinforcement for performance, stress management and familycounseling, physical reconditioning, including stretching,strengthening and aerobic conditioning in a slowly progressivefashion to required needs, and narcotic and muscle relaxantdetoxification program at a major military medical center.Eighteen patients in each group, representing, respectively, 78and 82% of the military and civilian participants, successfullycompleted the inpatient program. Success was defined by (1)elimination of all narcotics and minor tranquilizers, (2)elimination of all physical restrictions that precluded anydesired work or play, which required much higher levels for theactive duty patients that included: (3) elimination of allphysical profile restrictions and (4) objectively passing annualaerobics field test requirements before the program's end. Reviewof military disability separation records, averaging 24 moposttreatment, showed that no formerly successful active dutypatients had later been discharged because of physicalimpairments. Of individuals responding to mail questionnaires atan average of 19 mo postprogram, 12 of 14 (86%) initiallysuccessful military patients reported continued unrestrictedmaintenance of physical abilities, whereas 10 of 14 (71%) of theinitially successful civilians reported no restrictions indesired activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Author: Meert-T-F.

Journal Title: ANESTHESIOLOGY. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Data on the analgesic properties ofalpha 2 agonists and their interactions with opioids areconflicting. Experiments were conducted in rats to evaluatewhether various available alpha 2 agonists can potentiate theanalgesic properties of opioids and to determine the route ofadministration needed for optimal interaction. METHODS: Thetail-withdrawal reaction test was used as an analgesia assay. Inseparate experiments, the interactions between systemic(subcutaneous, intravenous, and intraperitoneal) and spinally(epidural and intrathecal) administered alpha 2 agonists andopioids were evaluated. The antagonism of medetomidine plusfentanyl with naloxone and/or idazoxan also was studied. RESULTS:All alpha 2 agonists tested, when injected subcutaneously withfentanyl, potentiated the opioid-induced analgesia. In terms of areduction of the amount of fentanyl needed to produce a deepsurgical analgesia (tail-withdrawal reaction latency > or = 10s) over more than 2 h, the relative order of potency of the alpha2 agonists tested was: medetomidine > dexmedetomidine >xylazine > clonidine > detomidine. For some of these alpha2 agonists there was a biphasic effect: at the larger dosestested, a reduction in the fentanyl potentiation was present. Thepotentiation of the opioid activity with alpha 2 agonists wasalso demonstrated in terms of a longer duration of analgesiaafter combined treatment with fixed doses of opioids. Theinteraction between the alpha 2 agonists and the opioids remainedpresent when a more profound criterion of analgesia(tail-withdrawal reaction latency > or = 30 s) was used.Furthermore, the interactions between the alpha 2 agonists testedand fentanyl or sufentanil appeared to be independent of theroute of administration. Potentiations were observed aftersimultaneous subcutaneous injections of both groups of compounds,after the combination of intraperitoneal (alpha 2 agonist) plussubcutaneous (opioid), intravenous (alpha 2 agonist) plusepidural (opioid) and simultaneous epidural or intrathecaladministrations. With regard to antagonism of the analgesicactivity of combined treatment with alpha 2 agonists plusopioids, naloxone provided total antagonism, whereas the alpha 2antagonist idazoxan overcame only the alpha 2 agonist-inducedpotentiation of fentanyl. CONCLUSIONS: The tested alpha 2 agonists can potentiate theanalgesic properties of opioids, but they have no intrinsicantinociceptive effects on spinal reflexes on their own. Thepotentiating activities of the alpha 2 agonists could be measuredboth in terms of a reduction of the amount of opioid needed toreach a particular level of analgesia and in terms of a longerduration of analgesia with a fixed dose of the opioid. Thepotentiations were observed with various alpha 2 agonists andopioids and appeared independent of the routes of administration. Author: Poyhia-R.

Abstract: A questionnaire was sent to the pharmacies of 88Finish hospitals with surgical departments to inquire about theconsumption of opioids during 1990. Another questionnaire wassent to 480 members of the Finnish Society of Anaesthesiologiststo ask how they administer opioids to adult patients. Answerswere received from 95% of hospitals and 67% of anaesthetists.Dextropropoxyphene was the most common oral opioid and oxycodonewas the most common parenteral opioid used in Finland. Parenteralopioids were consumed almost totally in the hospitals. Theanaesthetists reported oxycodone to be the opioid of choice forpremedication, postoperative pain and sedation of critically illpatients. Fentanyl was the opioid most commonly usedintravenously during balanced anaesthesia and in epiduraladministration. Epidural opioids were administered by 77% ofanaesthetists and patient- controlled analgesia (PCA) techniquemostly for intravenous administration by 19%. Only 10% of Finnishanaesthetists were actively involved in the management of chronicpain; the methods they use are discussed. The majority ofanaesthetists were satisfied with the currently availableopioids. Author: Richardson-M. Title: Conquering cancer pain.

Abstract: Opioid sensitivity, residual pain, development oftolerance, physical and psychological dependence are describedand discussed in relation to long-term opioid therapy. Based onthis, guidelines for long-term opioid administration areestablished for chronic pain conditions of non-cancer origin. Theindication must be well-considered--a life-long treatment may beinstituted. Prior to final initiation of the treatment, a testingof the selected drug and method of administration should beperformed. Due to the compliance- reasons, only long actingopioids should be used (controlled release morphine preparations,methadone, buprenorphine) and the route of administration shouldalways be oral. The treatment must be individualised, covering 24hours a day. The single dosages should be identical andadministered with identical time intervals, which are determinedby the duration of action of the drug in use.P.r.n.-administration should not be allowed. Only one physicianshould be responsible for the treatment and for the prescriptionof the opioid analgesic drugs. Author: Lewis-K-S. Whipple-J-K. Michael-K-A. Quebbeman-E-J. Title: Effect of analgesic treatment on the physiologicalconsequences of acute pain. Source: Am-J-Hosp-Pharm. 1994 Jun 15. 51(12). P 1539-54. Journal Title: AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL PHARMACY. Abstract: Physiological responses to acute pain are described,and the effects of different analgesic techniques on theseresponses are discussed. The body's response to acute pain cancause adverse physiological effects. Pain can impede the returnof normal pulmonary function, modify certain aspects of thestress response to injury, and alter hemodynamic values andcardiovascular function. It can produce immobility and contributeto thromboembolic complications. In addition, pain can slow apatient's recovery from surgery and contribute to increasedmorbidity. Fewer pulmonary complications occur when adequateanalgesia is provided through the use of epidural narcotics andlocal anesthetics, particularly if the injury or surgery involvesthe lower part of the body. Continuous morphine infusions,intercostal nerve blocks, and transcutaneous electricalstimulation do not alter the frequency of pulmonarycomplications. The effectiveness of patient-controlled analgesiain reducing postoperative pulmonary complications is still notknown. Epidural local anesthetic therapy inhibits the stressresponse, particularly in operations involving the lower abdomenor extremities; this technique is less effective during majorabdominal procedures. Suppression of endocrine-metabolic changesfollowing lower abdominal surgery requires neural block to thefourth thoracic segment. Epidural narcotics partially inhibit thestress response after lower abdominal or extremity surgery butnot after upper abdominal or thoracic surgery. Local anestheticsapplied to the surgical site, intercostal nerve blocks, andintrapleural and intraperitoneal administration also do notmodify the stress response. Adequate analgesia through the use oflocal anesthetics and narcotics postoperatively generally resultsin improved cardiovascular function, decreased pulmonarymorbidity and mortality, earlier ambulation, and decreasedlikelihood of deep vein thrombosis. Some data suggest thatimproved patient outcome occurs with adequate analgesia. Block ofafferent and efferent neural pathways by local anesthetics seemsto be the most effective analgesic modality in lessening thephysiologic response to pain and injury. Author: Li-Q-S. Cao-S-H.

Journal Title: CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL. Abstract: In the evaluation of Chinese herbs (A),ear-acupuncture (B) and epidural morphine (C) to relievepostoperative pain and abdominal distension, sixteen malepatients with primary liver cancer were observed. This study wasconducted by means of orthogonal experiment and double blind,randomized design. The patients received various treatmentsaccording to the display of the orthogonal table L16(2)15 whichcorresponds to 2(3) factorial experiment design. C+ (morphine 2mg) was given before the peritoneum was sutured. A+ (orallyadministered) and B+ were given 24 hours after operation. 50-100mg of pethidine was given when the pain intensity VAS (0-100)exceeded 50-70. The observation parameters included plasmaleucine enkephalin (LEK), postoperative total dosage of narcoticsadministered for 5 days, VAS for pain and pain reliever,abdominal distension, urinary retention, constipation, etc. Theresults were as follows: a. Patients who had received A (A+B+C+,A+B+C-, A+B-C-, A+B-C+); C (C+A+B+, C+A+B-, C+A-B+, C+A-B-), or B(B+A+C+, B+A+C-, B+A-C+, B+A-C-) produced better analgesiceffects than those who had received placebo. The A, B, and Creduced narcotics 650, 450 and 550 mg respectively when comparedwith placebo. The effects of A and C were of statisticalsignificance (P < 0.05), while AB, BC, and AC interactionswere not found; b.

Journal Title: ANNALS OF THE ACADEMY OF MEDICINE, SINGAPORE. Abstract: For most patients with cancer pain, the primary goalof opioid pharmacotherapy is a satisfactory balance betweenanalgesia and side effects. Consequently, the assessment andtreatment of opioid side effects is a fundamental aspect oftherapy, which may increase the likelihood of a favourabletreatment outcome, potentially allow higher and more efficaciousopioid doses, and improve quality of life by reducing otheruncomfortable symptoms. This review describes the presentation,assessment and management of adverse neuropsychological andgastrointestinal effects due to opioid drugs. These common sideeffects pose the major challenge for the clinician who undertakesthe long-term opioid therapy of patients with cancer pain. Author: Hecker-R-B.

Journal Title: CLINICAL JOURNAL OF PAIN. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The provision of acute pain managementfor the chronic pain patient can pose a challenge. We sought tocharacterize management issues. SUBJECTS/SETTING: An anonymoussurvey was distributed to 270 physicians and 212 nurses atUniversity of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) in an attempt tocharacterize management issues. DESIGN: Caregivers were queriedregarding treatment modalities, efficacy of anxiolysis, patientattributes, concern of the quantity of medication, criteria forpatient evaluation, and other management issues. RESULTS: Of therespondents, 61.8% were physicians, and 38.2% were nurses. Themean duration in practice was 7.7 years. The responses from thetwo groups were similar. Seventy-five percent reported usingdifferent pain-evaluation techniques for chronic pain patientsthan those utilized for the "average" patient. Painscores were used frequently in the average patient, whereasability to perform activities was used more commonly in thechronic pain patient (p < 0.0001). Half of the respondentsexpressed concern regarding the amount of medication used andlevel of sedation. The same proportion found anxiolysis to be ahelpful adjunct. The use of a time- contingent "paincocktail" as an oral medication was a useful strategy for88% of respondents. The least labor- intensive modality reportedwas patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for 84.5% of respondents;intravenous opiate fusion, 5.3%; and epidural analgesia, 11.2%. CONCLUSIONS: The survey describes caregiver concerns regardingthis patient population, including medication use, sedation,length of hospital stay, and evaluation techniques. Author: Kenner-D-J. Title: Pain forum. Part 2. Neuropathic pain. Source: Aust-Fam-Physician. 1994 Jul. 23(7). P 1279-83. Journal Title: AUSTRALIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN. Abstract: Neuropathic pain is often a reason for anunfavourable response to morphine or other opioids in treatingcancer pain. This type of pain is difficult to manage and mayco-exist with nociceptive cancer pain. There is still a potentialfor opioid responsiveness, although the doses needed will behigher, and adjuvant drug therapies are best employedconcurrently with opioid drugs. Adjuvant drugs used are theantidepressants, anticonvulsants, including benzodiazepines,corticosteroids and neurolepts. Less commonly, agents such asbaclofen and clonidine, and sympatholytic drugs such as prazosincan be employed for sympathetically maintained neuropathic pain(discussed in Part 3). The type of agent selected will depend onthe natural history of the disease process, as well as adescription of the pain-- the lancinating pains tending torespond better to anticonvulsants. Non invasive neurostimulatoryapproaches such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(TENS) may be useful in management, and a few patients mayrequire an invasive procedure such as dorsal column stimulation.

Abstract: A prospective, open-label study of the effectivenessof transnasal butorphanol in the treatment of pain resulting frommusculoskeletal injuries. Twenty-eight patients with strains (n =20), fractures (n = 6), contusions (n = 1), and stab wounds (n =1) were included. All patients were examined by an attendinglevel emergency medicine physician and deemed to have pain severeenough to warrant parenteral narcotic analgesia. All patientsreceived an initial 1-mg dose of transnasal butorphanol.Subsequent dosing was flexible depending on response to theinitial dose. All patients received pain relief from transnasalbutorphanol, and only one requested alternative analgesicmedication. Fifty- seven percent (n = 16) of patients noticed atleast a little relief of pain within 5 minutes of administrationand 93% (n = 26) received at least a little relief within 15minutes. Seventy-one percent of the patients received a 50%reduction of pain within 60 minutes. No serious side effects werenoted, but drowsiness occurred in 82% (n = 23) and dizziness in54% (n = 15) of the patients. One patient discontinuedparticipation in the study because of nausea. In this limitedtrial transnasal butorphanol proved to be a rapidly effectiveopioid analgesic. Further controlled studies comparing transnasalbutorphanol with standard parenteral narcotics are needed.

Title: Opiate reduction in chronic pain patients: a comparisonof patient-controlled reduction and staff controlled cocktailmethods. Source: Pain. 1994 Mar. 56(3). P 279-88. Journal Title: PAIN. Abstract: This study compares the effectiveness of two methodsof opiate reduction in 108 chronic pain patients during a 4 weekinpatient pain management programme, and at 1-month and 6-monthfollow-up. Patients chose either the patient-controlled reduction(PCR) or cocktail reduction method, aiming to complete withdrawalby discharge. Use of opiates and other drugs was recorded, andpsychological measures taken, at admission, at discharge, and atfollow-ups. Patients who opted for the cocktail reduction methodstarted at higher morphine equivalents (P < 0.001), were lessconfident in their ability to cope without medication (P <0.05), and rated their everyday activities a more disrupted bypain (P < 0.05). At discharge, 89% of the cocktail group wereabstinent from opiates compared with 68% of the PCR group (P <0.05). By 1- month follow-up, the advantage of the cocktailmethod had disappeared, with no significant differences betweenthe two groups in mean opiate dose, nor in the proportion ofabstinent patients. This was the result of a greater return toopiate use in the cocktail group, with abstinence rates remainingunchanged in the PCR group. By 6-month follow-up, abstinencerates for the groups were equivalent, with 55% of patientsremaining off opiates. By this stage, however, non-abstinentcocktail group patients were taking significantly larger doses ofopiates than PCR patients (P < 0.05), although in both groups,the dose was well below admission level. Admission opiate doselevel was the best predictor both of abstinence at discharge andof subsequent opiate dose level in non-abstinent patients. Thisstudy demonstrates that both reduction methods can producesubstantial reduction in opiate use by severely impaired chronicpain patients with long medication histories. Author: Markley-H-G. Title: Chronic headache: appropriate use of opiate analgesics. Source: Neurology. 1994 May. 44(5 Suppl 3). P S18-24. Journal Title: NEUROLOGY. Abstract: The question of the appropriate use of opiateanalgesics in the management of chronic headache pain is underdebate. Often, the management of headache pain is complicated bythe overuse of dependency-promoting analgesics. Because ofconfusion about the use of analgesics in pain management, somepatients are denied access to necessary opioid analgesia, whereasothers receive large quantities of combination analgesics. Theproper use of opiate analgesics is presented here, including areview of the pharmacology of these agents. Signs of analgesicdependence, analgesic rebound headache, and methods of withdrawalare also presented. The potential use of such new treatmentmodalities as butorphanol nasal spray is discussed.

P 793-8. Journal Title: NEUROSCIENCE. Abstract: Changes in chemical sensitivity of peripheralnociceptors following injury or inflammation have been studied inin vitro preparation of the saphenous nerve-hind paw skin fromadult rats. Heat hyperalgesia in the hind paw was induced by aprior ultraviolet irradiation and the skin from these animals wasinvestigated five days later. Polymodal nociceptors werequiescent in normal skin but were spontaneously active in themajority of fibres after ultraviolet exposure. Capsaicin- inducedactivation of fine fibres was enhanced after ultravioletpretreatment. Direct administration of morphine, DAGOL(mu-receptor agonist) and U-69593 (kappa-receptor agonist), butnot DPDPE (delta-receptor agonist) to the receptive fieldproduced a concentration-related and naloxone- reversiblesuppression of spontaneous firing in polymodal nociceptors ofultraviolet-treated skin. Morphine did not reduce the activity offibres in normal skin when these were driven by KCldepolarization. These data show that polymodal nociceptors changetheir activity and sensitivity to exogenous chemicals followingthe induction of peripheral hyperalgesia by ultravioletirradiation. Specifically, evidence is provided for theexpression of opioid sensitivity and inhibition of polymodalnociceptor activity through mu- and kappa-opioid receptors. Theseobservations may account for peripheral antinociceptive actionsof opioids during specific states of peripheral hyperalgesia. Author: Tyre-T-E. Walworth-D-E. Tyre-E-M.

Abstract: Thirty-three patients previously treated for avariety of chronic pain syndromes (largely non-surgical backproblems) were selected for study on the basis of 2 years orgreater post-discharge status. A patient profile was developedrevealing an 86% successful return-to-work rate and minimal useof narcotics 4 years after discharge. In addition, there wasrelatively low use of either inpatient or outpatient medicalservices after treatment. These patient behaviors were specificgoals of the pain management program in which these patients hadparticipated. Interesting data were also collected on medicationuse after treatment and methods of pain control used mostsuccessfully. Selected outcome variables were also studied acrossspecific diagnostic categories (surgical v non-surgical backproblems, amputee pain, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and others)for this group. In general, rather compelling positive outcomesare shown for the long-term effects of multi-disciplinary painmanagement. Author: Kehlet-H.

Abstract: Our laboratory and others have previously reportedthat the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptorantagonist, MK-801, interferes with the development of toleranceto the analgesic effects of morphine. The present studies wereperformed in order to further characterize the role of NMDAreceptors in opiate tolerance. The results demonstrate thatopiate tolerance is inhibited rapidly, and at low doses, by fourdifferent non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists (MK-801,ketamine, dextrorphan and phencyclidine), suggesting that thisinhibition results from blockade of NMDA receptors rather thanfrom the 'side-effect' of a particular drug. The NMDA antagonistswere found to inhibit the development but not the expression ofopiate tolerance; i.e. they were able to prevent but not reversetolerance. Finally, the results suggest that NMDA receptorantagonists do not interfere with associative tolerance; insteadit appears that these drugs may specifically inhibitnon-associative tolerance. It thus appears that NMDA receptorsmay have a fundamental role in the development of opiatetolerance, and that non- competitive NMDA receptor antagonistsmay be effective adjuncts to opiates in the treatment of chronicpain.

Abstract: In summary, RSD is pain of neuropathic origin. Thediagnosis is often obscure and requires a complete history,physical, and psychological evaluations. The diagnosis depends onsymptoms (burning pain, allodynia and hyperpathia); signs (edema,sudomotor changes, temperature changes); and objectivemeasurements, such as skin temperature, QSART, radiographs, andtriple-phase bone scans; as well as the clinical response to asympathetic block. Management of RSD should be designed topromote restoration of function utilizing physical therapy madepossible by sympathetic, central, or peripheral nerve blockade.Medications may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,tricyclic antidepressants, and vasoactive drugs. Psychologicsupport is an important part of the patient's rehabilitation.Dorsal column or peripheral nerve stimulators, sympathectomies,and narcotics should be considered only when other moreconservative measures have failed.

A review of psychomotor andcognitive test methods is given, including their application inpatients on long-term opioid treatment. The findings of the mostvalid studies on cancer patients in long-term treatment withopioids are an increase in continuous reaction time andsubjective sedation score regardless of the routes ofadministration. Studies of drug addicts in long-term treatmentwith opioids seem to reflect a lowering of the general level ofactivity. According to recent studies, patients with chronic non-malignant pain conditions are responsible for the major part ofthe total opioid consumption. So far, no studies of cerebraldysfunction have been performed on this group of patients.Further research should concentrate on the use of few validpsychomotor and cognitive tests and should include patients withchronic non-malignant pain conditions.

Abstract: Addiction medicine specialists, besieged with theadverse consequences of opioids, not unreasonably developreservations about their use. Opioid prohibition may beappropriate when working with addicts, but drug abstinence is notalways the most appropriate nor optimal treatment of painpatients. Consultation concerning the management of chronic painpatients may require an attitude adjustment of challengingproportions for the addiction medicine specialist; it is a rolesubstantially different from that usually assumed in treatingalcohol- and drug-dependent patients. Rather than relentlesslypursuing psychotropic drug abstinence as the treatment goal,restoration of function should be the primary treatment goal forthe chronic pain patient. Unlike the chemically dependent patientwhose level of function is impaired by substance use, the chronicpain patient's level of function may improve with adequate,judicious use of medications, which may include opioids.Evaluating for addiction in a patient who is prescribed long-termopioids for pain control is often problematic. While the conceptof addiction may include the symptoms of physical dependence andtolerance, physical dependence and/or tolerance alone does notequate with addiction. In the chronic pain patient takinglong-term opioids, physical dependence and tolerance should beexpected, but the maladaptive behavior changes associated withaddiction are not expected. Thus, it is the presence of thesebehaviors in the chronic pain patient that is far more importantin diagnosing addiction. Author: Krames-E-S. Lanning-R-M.

Journal Title: JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT. Abstract: We report on the analgesic efficacy of intrathecalinfusions of opioids alone or in combination with bupivacaine in16 nonmalignant pain patients with implanted pumps. Threepatients had nociceptive pain, five had neuropathic pain, and 8had mixed pain syndromes. Infusional therapy was delivered over acombined monthly total of 445 mo of therapy (mean, 27.8 mo). Doserequirements appeared to be stable with a mean dose increase of0.26 mg/mo. Bupivacaine was added to the opioid to enhance paincontrol in 13 patients who received combination therapy for anaverage of 11.7 mo/patient. Thirteen patients (81%) reported goodto excellent results with opioid alone or opioid combined withbupivacaine. The addition of bupivacaine improved analgesia intwo of three patients with nociceptive pain (66.7%), compared toeight of ten patients with a pure or mixed neuropathic componentto their pain (80%). We conclude that intrathecal opioids aloneor in combination with bupivacaine are efficacious for thetreatment of nonmalignant pain states and are relatively free ofsignificant side effects or tolerance.

Abstract: As the United States continues its "War onDrugs," physicians who prescribe opioids for the purpose ofpain control must recognize that legal issues are an importantpart of the prescription process. Physicians who do not correctlyprescribe opioids may mark their patients as drug abusers andthemselves as misprescribers. Efforts are under way tocharacterize appropriately the conditions under which opioidsshould be prescribed for the management of pain. California andTexas have passed intractable pain laws, which permit theprescribing of opioid medication for chronic pain patients. Theselaws were necessary because claims were made against prescriberswho legitimately administered opioids to chronic pain patients.Physicians must be aware that once a patient has been diagnosedan addict, it is not legal to prescribe opioids for the purposeof maintaining or detoxifying that patient; treatment of pain isstill permissible, however. It is clear that new standards ofcare must be developed to reduce the liability of legitimateprescribers from sanctions in either criminal or civil settings.With new standards of care, prescriptions for opioids written ingood faith for the treatment of pain should survive legalscrutiny.

Journal Title: JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT. Abstract: The use of long-term opioids (LTOs) to treat chronicpain of nonmalignant origin (CNMP) is controversial. Mostphysicians had felt there was essentially no role for LTOs inCNMP, but successful treatment outcomes have recently beenreported. Tolerance, organ toxicity, or fear of addiction are notreasons to limit LTOs. The significant question is efficacy. DoesLTO therapy improve pain and increase function with minimal sideeffects or risk? It is useful to divide chronic pain patientsinto three types. Type 1 patients are "typical" chronicpain patients with pain and disability far out of proportion tothe peripheral stimulus. Psychological factors are significant.In this type of patient, opioids appear to do more harm thangood. Type 2 patients have ongoing nociception and moderaterefractory pain. Type 3 patients have refractory severenociception or neuropathic pain. The latter types might beconsidered for LTOs. LTO use is appropriate for a very small,carefully selected group of patients.

This presentation will attempt toreview the data regarding the mechanisms of action of thesemodalities and their efficacy in treating chronic pain ofmalignant and nonmalignant origin. DATA SOURCES. Data werederived almost entirely from original articles reportingexperimental data from both animal and human studies and fromseries of patients undergoing treatment with the modalitiesreviewed. STUDY SELECTION. Where possible, controlled studieswere selected. However, much of the available data regardingtreatment results are uncontrolled. DATA EXTRACTION ANDSYNTHESIS. Selected data from studies that were felt to bereasonably well conducted are presented or summarized. Because ofthe lack of control groups in many of the clinical trials,meta-analyses were not carried out. CONCLUSIONS. Long-term spinal opiate administration has beenshown to be more effective than systemic opiates in some patientswith cancer pain, but often must be combined with localanesthetics to provide satisfactory pain relief. Loss of effectover time is a significant problem. Since the identification ofspinal opiate receptors and the introduction of spinallyadministered narcotics, a number of other receptors that areimportant in both sensitization and suppression of painprojection systems have been characterized. Agonists andantagonists to many of these receptors are being developed, and afew are available for clinical trials. Long-term electricalstimulation of the spinal cord produces substantial analgesiabelow the stimulated spinal segments in some patients withchronic pain. Although initial results are usually encouraging,long-term efficacy may be disappointing. It is postulated thatanalgesia associated with spinal stimulation is associated withboth stimulation of large fiber ascending tracts and blockade ofspinothalamic pathways. Transcutaneous electrical nervestimulation (TENS) has come into widespread use in managingchronic pain and has had limited trials in cancer pain patients.It is well accepted by patients and physicians, but clinicalstudies of long-term efficacy have yielded variable results. Theanalgesic action is probably the result of both large afferentfiber activation and blockade of peripheral nociceptors. Author: Bowsher-D. Title: Pain syndromes and their treatment.

Abstract: Neurogenic pain (encompassing all types ofneuropathic and central pain) is discussed. Experimental work ispresented in a model in which the rat sciatic nerve is looselyligatured. In painful human neuropathies, tricyclicantidepressants have been found to be effective in proportion tothe degree they facilitate monoaminergic activity. Several papersalso stress the importance of early treatment with amitriptylineor desipramine, and the ineffectiveness of analgesics, includingnarcotics. In nociceptive pain, recent findings in humansemphasize the importance of both the retroinsular (SII) and theanterior cingulate cortices in the conscious appreciation ofpain. Opioid studies have revealed individual differences in themetabolism of morphine to its 3- and 6-glucuronosides; patientswith nociceptive pain who respond poorly to morphine ordiamorphine probably have a high 3:6 ratio. It has been pointedout that methadone may be useful in such cases, as it is notbroken down to glucuronosides. Author: Zenz-M. Willweber-Strumpf-A.

P 186-200. Journal Title: BRAIN RESEARCH. Abstract: Intravenous (i.v.) administration of morphineproduces a dose- dependent inhibition of the tail-flick (TF)reflex, depressor response, and bradycardia in the rat. Some ofthese effects depend on interactions of i.v. morphine withperipheral opioid receptors and the integrity of cervical vagalafferents. The present studies used the relatively specific mu,delta, and kappa opioid receptor agonists (DAGO, DPDPE orU-50,488H) and the relatively specific mu, delta, and kappaopioid receptor antagonists (beta-FNA, naloxonazine, naltrindoleor nor-BNI) in either intact rats or rats with bilateral cervicalvagotomy (CVAG) to delineate the vagal afferent/opioid-mediatedcomponents of these effects. I.v. administration of DAGO inintact rats produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the TFreflex, depressor response, and bradycardia virtually identicalto those produced by i.v. morphine. All of these effects ofeither i.v. DAGO or i.v. morphine were significantly attenuatedby either bilateral CVAG or pre-treatment with the mu 2 opioidreceptor antagonist beta-FNA. Pre-treatment with the mu 1 opioidreceptor antagonist naloxonazine affected i.v. DAGO- inducedinhibition of the TF reflex and bradycardia, but had nosignificant effects on i.v. morphine-produced responses. I.v.administration of DPDPE produced a dose-dependent pressorresponse, but had no marked effects on the either the TF reflexor heart rate (HR). The pressor response was unaffected by eitherbilateral CVAG or pre-treatment with naltrindole, naloxone,hexamethonium, or bertylium. i.v. administration of U-50,488Hproduced a depressor response and bradycardia, but had nosignificant effect on the TF reflex. The depressor response andbradycardia produced by i.v. U-50,488H were unaffected bybilateral CVAG, but could be antagonized by pre- treatment witheither nor-BNI or naloxone. These studies suggest that the vagalafferent-mediated antinociceptive and cardiovascular effects ofi.v. morphine are primarily mediated by interactions with lowaffinity mu 2 opioid receptors.

Abstract: In this article, first, the different stages ofacquisition and processing of nociceptive information fromperipheral receptor to brain are reviewed and the plastic changesthat accompany tissue injury are underlined. For instance, thesubclassification of peripheral receptors in nociceptors andnon-nociceptors (e.g., mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors) must beunderstood in the light of peripheral sensitization. Thisphenomenon is the probable explanation for primary hyperalgesia,the decrease in pain threshold at the site of injury. Theobservation that substance P enhances N-methyl- D-aspartate(NMDA)-elicited responses suggests that these two receptors mayoperate in concert to prolong and amplify the afferent inputgenerated by peripheral tissue injury. Such afferent barrageinduces a state of central sensitization. Second, the majorproblems in the management of cancer pain, i.e. the developmentof tolerance to opioids and opioid-insensitive pain, arediscussed. The loss of drug effect observed after chronicexposure of the opioid receptor (tolerance) may be theconsequence of the down-regulation or desensitization phenomenon(where the total number of receptors coupled to the secondmessenger is reduced). The agonist dose- response begins to shiftto the right. The dramatic analgesic improvement obtained withsubanaesthetic doses of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, inthose of our cancer patients who have become resistant tomorphine is intriguing. As shown for tolerance, insensitivity toopioids may represent a rightward shift in the opioiddose-response curve and the analgesic effect of ketamine thereversal of that shift. Author: Grossman-S-A.

Abstract: Over 70% of patients with cancer have moderate tosevere pain during their illness and many fear pain more thandeath itself. There is consensus among experts that most patientscan be well-palliated using knowledge, medications, andtechniques that are readily accessible. Despite this, only asmall proportion of patients with cancer pain receive adequateanalgesia. Some of the barriers that interfere with the deliveryof appropriate analgesia are patient-related, while othersinvolve health-care providers. Patients frequently do notcommunicate the intensity of their pain to care- givers and areoften hesitant to take opiates. Health-care providers receivescant teaching on cancer pain, have little awareness of painintensity in their patients, and may be overly concerned aboutopiate toxicities. They lack appropriate role models in academicinstitutions and may be concerned about the potential forinvestigation by law-enforcement agencies. These obstacles can belargely overcome by (a) emphasizing the importance of paincontrol in cancer patients, (b) considering the etiology of painin each patient, (c) weighing the full range of availabletherapeutic options, (d) ensuring that "user-friendly"opiate- equivalence information is available, (e) using painassessment tools routinely and recording pain intensity scores inthe medical record, and by (f) not being easily dissuaded fromproviding adequate doses of opiates for pain relief. Therationale for and current efforts in each of these areas arediscussed in this review. Author: Oliver-M. Stenn-P-G. Title: Is there a risk for dependency with therapeutic dosesof dimenhydrinate?

Available procedures are: 1) Nerverepair, neurolysis and nerve relocation; 2) Interventions on thesympathetic nervous system; 3) Neurostimulation; 4) Intraspinalmorphine; 5) Ablative lesions. Neurosurgeons have, or shouldhave, the necessary neuroscience background and microsurgicalskills to be important partners of the team caring for patientswith peripheral neuropathic pain.

P605-20. Journal Title: VETERINARY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA. EQUINEPRACTICE. Abstract: The recognition and alleviation of animal pain is agrowing veterinary and public concern. Pain can be of an acute orchronic nature with different behavioral manifestations.Physiologically, pain is a dynamic and complex phenomenon thatproduces changes in the central and autonomic nervous systems aswell as in the endocrine system. Horses and other animals appearto possess an endogenous pain-suppressing system involving thebrainstem and spinal cord. This system can modulate painperception and the responses to it. The recently discoveredendogenous opioid peptides (endorphins and enkephalins) appear toplay a role in this system, which is activated by stress. Opioids(narcotic analgesics) act to selectively depress pain- sensitivecells. Opioid analgesics may act via multiple opioid receptors.Each subclass of opioid receptor has a different pharmacologicprofile. Classical opioids that act at mu (morphine) receptorstypically produce analgesia, increased locomotor activity,cardiorespiratory stimulation, and a decrease in intestinalperistalsis in the horse. Opioids that act at kappa receptorsproduce analgesia, sedation, ataxia, and minimal autonomiceffects in the horse. Owing to their lack of excitatory actions,the kappa opioids represent a potentially useful class ofanalgesics for use in equine species. Local anesthetics depressall excitable cells and can diminish sensory, motor, and muscularfunction. They do not act selectively on pain fibers, althoughpain is among the first sensations lost following a nerve block.Local anesthetic activity is enhanced by increased extraneuronalpH, nerve cooling, increased nervous activity, coadministrationof a vasoconstrictor or hyaluronidase, delayed systemicabsorption, prolonged drug metabolism, and by using agents withhigh lipid solubility. Procaine, lidocaine, and mepivacaine areamong the most widely used and studied agents in horses. Theseagents and/or their metabolites can be readily detected in urine;in some cases, for prolonged periods. Author: Krames-E-S.

Source: Jpn-J-Pharmacol. 1993 Sep. 63(1). P 59-64. Journal Title: JAPANESE JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY. Abstract: We have examined whether or not the presence of paincan block the development of tolerance to morphineantinociception in mice. A single injection of formalin or Freundcomplete adjuvant into the dorsal part of one side of the hindpaw resulted in a significant swelling of the treated paw whichlasted more than 5 days. In formalin-treated animals thatreceived the initial morphine 2 hr after the stimulant, thedevelopment of tolerance to morphine was delayed withoutaffecting morphine antinociception when the effect was measureddaily by the tail-pinch (TP) method but not by the tail-flick(TF) method. However, the stimulant suppressed tolerancedevelopment even in the TF method unless the daily measurementwas undertaken. When morphine injection was started from 5 daysafter the formalin injection, tolerance developed in a patternsimilar to that in the control animals. On the other hand,treatment with Freund adjuvant did not affect the development oftolerance measured by both the TP and TF methods, with or withoutdaily measurement of antinociception. When acetic acid was usedas a stimulant, daily morphine was administered before or afterthe acetic acid injection, in the presence or absence of pain,tolerance developed to the same extent as in the control group,regardless of the time of morphine injection. Thus, our resultssuggest that the development of tolerance to narcotics may bemodified by various factors, such as the type and intensity ofnociception; and they also suggest that different results may beproduced depending on the test method.

Journal Title: CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY AND PHARMACOLOGY. Abstract: Pain arising from cancer tends to be chronic andchemotherapy of cancer pain usually requires narcotics. Mostinjectable narcotics, however, have short half-lives (T1/2) andrequire either continuous infusion or repeated frequentinjections which are both inconvenient and uncomfortable. Anextended-release formulation of morphine sulfate (Depo/Morphine)in a lipid-based drug- delivery system was characterized andtested in an animal model. The encapsulation efficiency was 53%+/- 4%, and the in vitro release T1/2 in human plasma at 37degrees C was 12.1 +/- 1.1 days. Following s.c. administration ofDepo/Morphine, the total amount of morphine remaining at the s.c.injection site decreased monoexponentially with a T1/2 value of2.59 +/- 0.16 days as compared with 0.46 +/- 0.04 h following theinjection of unencapsulated morphine. The morphine concentrationin plasma also decreased monoexponentially with a T1/2 value of8.33 +/- 2.13 days as compared with 0.45 +/- 0.21 h forunencapsulated morphine. Cataleptic behavior was observed in miceinjected with unencapsulated morphine but not in those given anidentical dose of morphine in the form of Depo/Morphine. Inconclusion, Depo/Morphine has potential as an extended-releaseformulation of morphine and may be useful in chemotherapy ofcancer pain as well as in maintenance therapy of narcoticaddicts.

Journal Title: JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTALTHERAPEUTICS. Abstract: The potassium channel openers could share a commonmechanism of action with the opiates in the production ofantinociception because both classes of drugs have been shown toenhance potassium efflux. The i.t. administration of thepotassium channel openers diazoxide, minoxidil, and lemakalim(BRL38227) produced antinociception as measured in the tail-flicktest. The ED50's were 122, 184 and 35 micrograms/mouse,respectively. Minoxidil and lemakalim (BRL 38227) were fullagonists, whereas diazoxide was a partial agonist.Diazoxide-induced antinociception was blocked by the potassiumchannel blockers glyburide, apamin and charybdotoxin. Minoxidil-and lemakalim (i.t.)-induced antinociception was blocked totallyby only glyburide. The antinociception produced by the potassiumchannel openers (i.t.) was blocked differentially by opiateantagonists (i.t.). The antinociceptive effects of diazoxide wereblocked by nor binaltorphimine, ICI 174,864 and naloxone.Minoxidil- and lemakalim-induced antinociception was blocked bynaloxone and ICI 174,864, but not by nor-binaltorphimine.Naloxone (s.c.) shifted the dose-effect curve for minoxidil tothe right in a parallel manner. Morphine-induced antinociceptionwas partially blocked by glyburide and apamin, whereas thatproduced by DPDPE was blocked totally by apamin. U50,488H-induced antinociception was blocked partially by apamin. Thepotassium channel openers (i.t.) were not cross tolerant tomorphine when measured in the tail-flick test. Apamin andglyburide precipitated "withdrawal-like" symptoms inmorphine-tolerant mice. The interaction of potassium channelopeners and opioids probably does not represent a directinteraction of these two classes of drugs at a similar receptor,but rather may occur via an interaction with a common secondmessenger system such as calcium.

Abstract: Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotionalexperience, unique to each individual patient. In the dynamicprocesses of nociceptive stimulation, signal transmission,central decoding and interpretation there are many potentialsites for pharmacological intervention, and there are many drugswhich will produce analgesia. An analgesic 'ladder' has beenproposed for rational pain relief in cancer and a similar conceptshould be used in all forms of acute and chronic pain. Continuingresearch and drug development undoubtedly extends ourunderstanding, but consistent improvement in our clinical abilityto relieve pain depends more on our willingness to consider theneed of each patient individually, to tailor the drug, route andmode of administration to that patient's requirements, and thento monitor on the basis of the response of the patient to thetreatment.

Abstract: Pain is the most common symptom experienced inpatients with advanced cancer. This pain may be acute, chronic,or intermittent, and often has a definable origin, usuallyrelated to tumor recurrence and treatment. The goal of therapy isto provide patients with enough pain relief to enable them totolerate diagnostic and therapeutic manipulations and allow themfreedom of movement and choice, while limiting medication-inducedadverse effects. Morphine is the medication of choice, and isavailable in a sustained-release oral formulation with convenientaround-the-clock administration every 8 to 12 hours. Morphine canalso be administered subcutaneously, intravenously, and rectally,which provides enhanced flexibility for dosing patients unable totake oral medications. The transdermal fentanyl patch may providea convenient dosage-form alternative if oral morphinepreparations are not tolerated. Some patients with advancedcancer may require other adjunctive medications such asnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, tricyclic antidepressants,steroids, or benzodiazepines, as well as psychologic techniques,to assist in pain management.

L-Arginine pretreated i.t. did notpotentiate i.c.v. administered beta-endorphin-induced inhibitionof the tail-flick response, indicating that the potentiatingeffect of L-arginine on beta-endorphin-induced antinociception islocated at the supraspinal sites but not at the spinal sites.

Abstract: The putative antinociceptive action of guanethidineand calcitonin systemically injected has been compared in 2 ratmodels of persistent experimental pain: Freund's adjuvant-inducedarthritis (n = 29) and mononeuropathy induced by 4 looseligatures around the sciatic nerve (n = 24). Guanethidine (30mg/kg, i.v.) and calcitonin (0.125 mg, s.c.) were injected once aday over 1 week, when hyperalgesia was fully developed. Theantinociceptive action was gauged using nociceptive tests basedon mechanical or cold stimuli (vocalization threshold to pawpressure and struggle latency to 10 degrees C, respectively), andthe score of spontaneous pain-related behavior was measured onthe basis of the abnormal hind paw position. No antinociceptiveaction was observed in calcitonin-compared to saline-injectedrats, either in arthritic or neuropathic animals. Guanethidinetreatment was ineffective on hyperalgesia exhibited in arthriticrats but was able to reduce reliably and even suppress theabnormal reactions to cold stimulus in neuropathic animals. Thelack of hypoalgesic action of calcitonin versus its beneficialaction in bone repair, as well as the possible role(s) of thesympathetic system in neuropathic versus arthritic pain and inhyperalgesia versus physical signs of inflammation, arediscussed.

Abstract: Three novel benzomorphans,(+)-N-benzylnormetazocine, (-)- deoxy-N-benzylnormetazocine, and(-)-deoxypentazocine were tested for their ability to producecircling behavior in rats following intranigral microinjections.Dose studies revealed the following rank order of potency:(-)-deoxypentazocine > (- )-deoxy-N-benzylnormetazocine >(+)-N-benzylnormetazocine. This rank order approximates that foraffinities for sigma 2 receptors but not sigma 1 receptors. It isvery unlikely that the effects of the (-)-deoxybenzomorphans weremediated by opiate receptors for the following reasons: (1)consistent with the known requirement for the phenolic hydroxylgroup for opiate activity, both (-)-deoxy compounds showed verylow affinity for opiate receptors; (2) naloxone (4 micrograms)co- administered with (-)-deoxy-N-benzylnormetazocine failed toreduce its efficacy; (3) both (-)-deoxy compounds failed toproduce marked analgesic effects in the tail flick test followingsystemic injections of 20 mg/kg s.c. These finding suggest thatsigma 2 receptors mediate the motor effects of sigma ligands inrats. Author: Stein-C. Title: Peripheral mechanisms of opioid analgesia.

Abstract: STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of high-doseIV narcotics in patients requiring analgesia for painfulemergency department procedures. DESIGN: Prospective multicenterclinical trial. SETTING: Five adult urban EDs. METHODS ANDMEASUREMENTS: All patients received IV meperidine (1.5 to 3.0mg/kg) titrated to analgesia followed by a painful procedure.Vital signs and alertness scale were recorded at regularintervals, and patients were observed for four hours. Adverseevents were monitored and documented. Comparisons betweenbaseline and postanalgesia intervals were made with a repeatedmeasures ANOVA (Dunnett's test). RESULTS: Although statisticallysignificant changes in vital signs and alertness scale occurred,they were not clinically significant. Opiate reversal withnaloxone was not needed in any patient, and no significantrespiratory or circulatory compromise occurred. CONCLUSION: Thisstudy of 72 patients demonstrates that high- dose narcoticanalgesia is appropriate, well tolerated, and safe when used inselected patients before painful procedures in the ED. Narcoticantagonists and resuscitation equipment nonetheless should beavailable to maximize safety. Author: Longstreth-G-F. Wolde-Tsadik-G.

Abstract: A study of irritable bowel-type symptoms in 1264health examinees using a self-administered questionnaire andpsychological tests revealed they are common throughoutadulthood. Of affected subjects 68% were female, and those withthe more severe type (> or = 3 Manning criteria) werepredominantly female (80%). Fewer Asians than other racial/ethnicgroups had these symptoms. Nongastrointestinal symptoms,physician visits, incontinence, laxative use, a stress effect onbowel pattern and abdominal pain, abdominal surgery,hysterectomy, childhood abuse, use of mind- altering drugs,depression, and anxiety were correlated with irritable bowel-typesymptoms. Regression analysis found some of the clinicalcorrelates were independent markers for irritable bowel-typesymptoms and that sexual abuse was related to nongastrointestinalsymptoms and abdominal surgery independent of irritablebowel-type symptoms. More severe irritable bowel-type symptomswere especially associated with nongastrointestinal symptoms,stress effects, sexual abuse, use of sedatives and oralnarcotics, and a past alcohol problem. There are importantdemographic and clinical correlates with irritable bowel-typesymptoms. Author: MacDonald-N. Der-L. Allan-S. Champion-P.

Abstract: We report a case of the eosinophilia myalgiasyndrome (EMS) with incapacitating myalgias, weakness secondaryto a severe polyneuropathy, and contractures in all fourextremities requiring aggressive rehabilitation treatment. A55-year-old woman was admitted to a rehabilitation hospital 11months after the onset of EMS. At that time, she had severeweakness secondary to peripheral neuropathy and painfulcontractures in all extremities and required high doses ofnarcotics for pain control. A continuous passive range of motionmachine was used in order to maintain range of motion obtainedduring active exercise therapy. The patient showed functionalimprovement in basic mobility and ADL skills. She was withdrawnfrom narcotics and successfully learned pain managementtechniques. An aggressive rehabilitation approach in thetreatment of EMS associated with peripheral neuropathy mayimprove functional outcome even when instituted late in theclinical course. Author: Tobias-J-D.

Abstract: Continuous passive motion (CPM) may have potentialapplication as a physical modality in decreasing acute pain. Thepurpose of this study was to examine the effects of CPMimmediately following an arthroscopically-assisted anteriorcruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction utilizing bone-patella-bone autograft on acute pain during the inflammatory phase ofsoft tissue healing. Acute pain was measured by assessing theamount of pain medication (amount of narcotic delivered from thepatient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump during the firstpostoperative 24 hours and the total intake of oral medicationduring the second and third postoperative days), the need forpain medication (number of times the patient pushed the PCAbutton during the first postoperative 24 hours), and perceivedpain (graphic pain scale measuring antalgic sensation). Thirtypatients (15-45 years old) participated in this study. Thepatients were prospectively randomized into two groups, CPM andnon-CPM. Both groups followed an identical postoperativerehabilitation program except for the CPM groups using a CPMdevice. The design of this study included the collection of dataduring the inflammatory phase of soft tissue healing. The resultsindicated that the initiation of CPM immediately following an ACLreconstruction had a significant (p < .05) effect ondecreasing the amount of medication consumed by the patient and asignificant (p < .05) decrease in the patient's need formedication during the inflammatory phase. There was nostatistical significance in the level of perceived pain betweenthe groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) CliffSchaffer's Home Page WT01-B34-52IA087-000628-B030-163http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/lsd/munn.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122062737 text/html 93604HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 06:27:16 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wednesday, 01-Jan-97 22:38:21 GMTContent-length: 93385 The Mushrooms of Language Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | The Psychedelic Library The Mushrooms of Language by Henry Munn (1) The Mazatec Indians, who have a long tradition of using the mushrooms,inhabit a range of mountains called the Sierra Mazateca in thenortheastern corner of the Mexican state of Oaxaca.

Harner.© 1973 by Oxford University Press. The Mazatec Indians eat the mushrooms only at night in absolutedarkness. It is their belief that if you eat them in the daylightyou will go mad. The depths of the night are recognized as thetime most conducive to visionary insights into the obscurities,the mysteries, the perplexities of existence. Usually severalmembers of a family eat the mushrooms together: it is not uncommonfor a father, mother, children, uncles, and aunts to all participatein these transformations of the mind that elevate consciousnessonto a higher plan. The kinship relation is thus the basis ofthe transcendental subjectivity that Husserl said is intersubjectivity.The mushrooms themselves are eaten in pairs, a couple representingman and woman that symbolizes the dual principle of procreationand creation. Then they sit together in their inner light, dreamand realize and converse with each other, presences seated theretogether, their bodies immaterialized by the blackness, voicesfrom without their communality. In a general sense, for everyone present the purpose of the sessionis a therapeutic catharsis. The chemicals of transformation ofrevelation that open the circuits of light, vision, and communication,called by us mind-manifesting, were known to the American Indiansas medicines: the means given to men to know and to heal, to seeand to say the truth. Among the Mazatecs, many, one time or anotherduring their lives, have eaten the mushrooms, whether to curethemselves of an ailment or to resolve a problem; but it is noteveryone who has a predilection for such extreme and arduous experiencesof the creative imagination or who would want to repeat such journeysinto the strange, unknown depths of the brain very frequently:those who do are the shamans, the masters, whose vocation it isto eat the mushrooms because they are the men of the spirit, themen of language, the men of wisdom. They are individuals recognizedby their people to be expert in such psychological adventures,and when the others eat the mushrooms they always call to be withthem, as a guide, one of those who is considered to be particularlyacquainted with these modalities of the spirit. The medicine manpresides over the session, for just as the Mazatec family is paternaland authoritarian, the liberating experience unfolds in the authoritariancontext of a situation in which, rather than being allowed tospeak or encouraged to express themselves, everyone is enjoinedto keep silent and listen while the shaman speaks for each ofthose who are present. As one of the early Spanish chroniclersof the New World said: "They pay a sorcerer who eats them[the mushrooms] and tells them what they have taught him. He doesso by means of a rhythmic chant in full voice." The Mazatecs say that the mushrooms speak. If you ask a shamanwhere his imagery comes from, he is likely to reply: I didn'tsay it, the mushrooms did. No mushroom speaks, that is a primitiveanthropomorphization of the natural, only man speaks, but he whoeats these mushrooms, if he is a man of language, becomes endowedwith an inspired capacity to speak. The shamans who eat them,their function is to speak, they are the speakers who chant andsing the truth, they are the oral poets of their people, the doctorsof the word, they who tell what is wrong and how to remedy it,the seers and oracles, the ones possessed by the voice. "Itis not I who speak," said Heraclitus, "it is the logos."Language is an ecstatic activity of signification. Intoxicatedby the mushrooms, the fluency, the ease, the aptness of expressionone becomes capable of are such that one is astounded by the wordsthat issue forth from the contact of the intention of articulationwith the matter of experience. At times it is as if one were beingtold what to say, for the words leap to mind, one after another,of themselves without having to be searched for: a phenomenonsimilar to the automatic dictation of the surrealists except thathere the flow of consciousness, rather than being disconnected,tends to be coherent: a rational enunciation of meanings. Messagefields of communication with the world, others, and one's selfare disclosed by the mush rooms The spontaneity they liberateis not only perceptual, but linguistic, the spontaneity of speech,of fervent, lucid discourse, of the logos in activity. For theshaman, it is as if existence were uttering itself through him.From the beginning, once what they have eaten has modified theirconsciousness, they begin to speak and at the end of each phrasethey say tzo-"says" in their language-like arhythmic punctuation of the said. Says, says, says. It is said.I say. Who says? We say, man says, language says, being and existencesay. (2) Cross-legged on the floor in the darkness of huts, close to thefire, breathing the incense of copal, the shaman sits with thefurrowed brow and the marked mouth of speech. Chanting his words,clapping his hands, rocking to and fro, he speaks in the nightof chirping crickets. What is said is more concrete than ephemeralphantasmagoric lights: words are materializations of consciousness;language is a privileged vehicle of our relation to reality. Letus go looking for the tracks of the spirit, the shamans say. Letus go to the cornfield looking for the tracks of the spirits'feet in the warm ground. So then let us go walking ourselves alongthe path in search of significance, following the words of twodiscourses enregistered like tracks on magnetic tapes, then translatedfrom the native tonal language, to discover and explicitate whatis said by an Indian medicine man and medicine woman during suchecstatic experiences of the human voice speaking with rhythmicforce the realities of life and society. The short, stout, elderly woman with her laughing moon face, dressedin a huipil, the long dress, embroidered with flowers andbirds, of the Mazatec women, a dark shawl wrapped around her shoulders,her gray hair parted down the middle and drawn into two pigtails,golden crescents hanging from her ears, bent forward from whereshe knelt on the earthen floor of the hut and held a handful ofmushrooms in the fragrant, purifying smoke of copal rising fromthe glowing coals of the fire, to bless them: known to the ancientMeso-Americans as the Flesh of God, called by her people the Bloodof Christ. Through their miraculous mountains of light and rain,the Indians say that Christ once walked-it is a transformationof the legend of Quetzalcoatl-and from where dropped his blood,the essence of his life, from there the holy mushrooms grew, theawakeners of the spirit, the food of the luminous one. Flesh ofthe world. Flesh of language. In the beginning was the word andthe word became flesh. In the beginning there was flesh and theflesh became linguistic. Food of intuition. Food of wisdom. Sheate them, munched them up, swallowed them and burped; rubbed ground-uptobacco along her wrists and forearms as a tonic for the body;extinguished the candle; and sat waiting in the darkness wherethe incense rose from the embers like glowing white mist. Thenafter a while came the enlightenment and the enlivenment and allat once, out of the silence, the woman began to speak, to chant,to pray, to sing, to utter her existence: (3) My God, you who are the master of the whole world, what we wantis to search for and encounter from where comes sickness, fromwhere comes pain and affliction. We are the ones who speak andcure and use medicine. So without mishap, without difficulty,lift us into the heights and exalt us. From the beginning, the problem is to discover what the sicknessis the sick one is suffering from and prognosticate the remedy.Medicine woman, she eats the mushrooms to see into the spiritof the sick, to disclose the hidden, to intuit how to resolvethe unsolved: for an experience of revelations. The transformationof her everyday self is transcendental and gives her the powerto move in the two relevant spheres of transcendence in orderto achieve understanding: that of the other consciousness wherethe symptoms of illness can be discerned; and that of the divine,the source of the events in the world. Together with visionaryempathy, her principal means of realization is articulation, discourse,as if by saying she will say the answer and announce the truth. It is necessary to look and think in her spirit where it hurts.I must think and search in your presence where your glory is,My Father, who art the Master of the World. Where does this sicknesscome from? Was it a whirlwind or bad air that fell in the dooror in the doorway? So are we going to search and to ask, fromthe head to the feet, what the matter is. Let's go searching forthe tracks of her feet to encounter the sickness that she is sufferingfrom. Animals in her heart? Let's go searching for the tracksof her feet, the tracks of her nails. That it be alleviated andhealed where it hurts. What are we going to do to get rid of thissickness? For the Mazatecs, the psychedelic experience produced by the mushroomsis inseparably associated with the cure of illness. The idea ofmalady should be understood to mean not only physical illness,but mental troubles and ethical problems. It is when somethingis wrong that the mushrooms are eaten. If there is nothing thematter with you there is no reason to eat them. Until recent times,the mushrooms were the only medicine the Indians had recourseto in times of sickness. 'I heir medicinal value is by no meansmerely magical, but chemical. According to the Indians, syphilis,cancer, and epilepsy have been alleviated by their use; tumorscured. They have empirically been found by the Indians to be particularlyeffective for the treatment of stomach disorders and irritationsof the skin. The woman whose words we are listening to, like many,discovered her shamanistic vocation when she was cured by themushrooms of an illness: after the death of her husband she brokeout all over with pimples; she was given the mushrooms to seewhether they would "help" her and the malady disappeared.Since then she has eaten them on her own and given them to others. If someone is sick, the medicine man is called. The treatmenthe employs is chemical and spiritual. Unlike most shamanisticmethods, the Mazatec shaman actually gives medicine to his patients:by means of the mushrooms he administers to them physiologically,at the same time as he alters their consciousness. It is probablyfor psychosomatic complaints and psychological troubles that theliberation of spontaneous activity provoked by the mushrooms ismost remedial: given to the depressed, they awaken a catharsisof the spirit; to those with problems, a vision of their existentialway. If he hasn't come to the conclusion that the illness is incurable,the medicine man repeats the therapeutic sessions three timesat intervals. He also works over the sick, for his intoxicatedcondition of intense, vibrant energy gives him a strength to healthat he exercises by massage and suction. His most important function, however, is to speak for the sickone. The Mazatec shamans eat the mushrooms that liberate the fountainsof language to be able to speak beautifully and with eloquenceso that their words, spoken for the sick one and those present,will arrive and be heard in the spirit world from which comesbenediction or grief. The function of the speaker, nevertheless,is much more than simply to implore. The shaman has a conceptionof poesis (4) in its originalsense as an action: words themselves are medicine. To enunciateand give meaning to the events and situations of existence islife giving in itself. "The psychoanalyst listens, whereas the shaman speaks,"points out Levi-Strauss: When a transference is established, the patient puts words intothe mouth of the psychoanalyst by attributing to him alleged feelingsand intentions; in the incantation, on the contrary, the shamanspeaks for his patient. He questions her and puts into her mouthanswers that correspond to the interpretation of her condition.A pre-requisite role-that of listener for the psychoanalyst andof orator for the shaman-establishes a direct relationship withthe patient's conscious and an indirect relationship with hisunconscious. This is the function of the incantation proper. Theshaman provides the sick woman with a language by meansof which unexpressed and otherwise inexpressible psychic statescan be immediately expressed. And it is the transition to thisverbal expression-at the same time making it possible to undergoin an ordered and intelligible form a real experience that wouldotherwise be chaotic and inexpressible- which induces the releaseof the physiological process, that is, the reorganization, ina favorable direction, of the process to which the sick womanis subjected. (5) These remarks of the French anthropologist become particularlyrelevant to Mazatec shamanistic practice when one considers thatthe effect of the mushrooms, used to make one capable of curing,is to inspire the shaman with language and transform him intoan oracle. "That come all the saints, that come all the virgins,"chants the medicine woman in her sing-song voice, invoking thebeneficent forces of the universe, calling to her the goddessesof fertility, the virgins: fertile ones because they have notbeen sowed and are fresh for the seed of men to beget childrenin their wombs. The Virgin of Conception and the Virgin of the Nativity. ThatChrist come and the Holy Spirit. Fifty-three Saints. Fifty-threeSaintesses. That they sit down at her side, on her mat, on herbed, to free her from sickness. The wife of the man in whose house she was speaking was pregnantand throughout the session of creation, from the midst of genesis,her language as spontaneous as her being that has begun to vibrate,she concerns herself with the emergence of life, with the birthof an existence into that everyday social world that. her developingdiscourse expresses: With the baby that is going to come there is no suffering, says.It's a matter of a moment, there isn't going to be any suffering,says. From one moment to another it will fall into the world,says. From one moment to another, we are going to save her fromher woe, says. That her innocent creature come without mishap,says. Her elf. That is what it is called when it is still in thewomb of its mother. From one moment to another, that her innocentcreature, her elf come, says. "We are going to search and question," she says, "untieand disentangle." She is on a journey, for there is distanciationand going there, somewhere, without her even moving from the spotwhere she sits and speaks. Her consciousness is roaming throughoutexistential space. Sibyl, seer, and oracle, she is on the trackof significance and the pulsation of her being is like the rhythmof walking. "Let us go searching for the path, the tracks of her feet,the tracks of her nails. From the right side to the left side,let us look." To arrive at the truth, to solve problems andto act with wisdom, it is necessary to find the way in which togo. Meaning is intentional. Possibilities are paths to be chosenbetween. For the Indian woman, footprints are images of meaning,traces of a going to and from, sedimented clues of significanceto be looked for from one side to the other and followed to wherethey lead: indicators of directionality; signs of existence. Thehunt for meaning is a temporal one, carried into the past andprojected into the future; what happened? she inquires, what willhappen? leaving behind for what is ahead go the footprints betweendeparture and arrival: manifestations of human, existential ecstasis.And the method of looking, from the right side to the left side,is the articulation of now this intuition, fact, feeling or wish,now that, the intention of speaking bringing to light meaningswhose associations and further elucidations are like the discoveryof a path where the contents to be uttered are tracks to be followedinto the unexplored, the unknown and unsaid into which she adventuresby language, the seeker of significance, the questioner of significance,the articulator of significance: the significance of existencethat signifies with signs by the action of speaking the experienceof existence. "Woman of medicines and curer, who walks with her appearanceand her soul," sings the woman, bending down to the groundand straightening up, rocking back and forth as she chants, dividingthe truth in time to her words: emitter of signs. "She isthe woman of the remedy and the medicine. She is the woman whospeaks. The woman who puts everything together. Doctor woman.Woman of words. Wise woman of problems." She is not speaking, most of the time, for any particular person,but for everyone: all who are afflicted, troubled, unhappy, puzzledby the predicaments of their condition. Now, in the course ofher discourse, uttering realities, not hallucinations, talkingof existence in a communal world where the we is more frequentthan the I, she comes to a more general sickness and aggravationthan physical illness: the economic condition of poverty in whichher people live. "Let us go to the cornfield searching for the tracks of thefeet, for her poorness and humility. That gold and silver come,"she prays. "Why are we poor? Why are we humble in this townof Huautla?" That is the paradox: why in the midst of suchgreat natural wealth as their fertile, plentiful mountains wherewaterfalls cascade through the green foliage of leaves and ferns,should they be miserable from poverty, she wants to know. Thedaily diet of the Indians consists of black beans and tortillascovered with red chili sauce; only infrequently, at festivals,do they eat meat. White spots caused by malnutrition splotch theirred faces. Babies are often sick. It is wealth she pleads forto solve the problem of want. The mushrooms, which grow only during the season of torrentialrains, awaken the forces of creation and produce an experienceof spiritual abundance, of an astonishing, inexhaustible constitutionof forms that identifies them with fertility and makes them amediation, a means of communion, of communication between manand the natural world of which they are the metaphysical flesh.The theme of the shamaness, mother and grandmother, woman of fertility,bending over as she chants and gathering the earth to her as ifshe were collecting with her hands the harvest of her experience,is that of giving birth, is that of growth. Agriculturalists,they are people of close family interrelationships and many children:the clusters of neolithic thatch-roofed houses on the mountainpeaks are of extended family groups. The woman's world is thatof the household, her concern is for her children and all thechildren of her people. "All the family, the babies and the children, that happinesscome to them, that they grow and mature without anything befallingthem. Free them from all classes of sickness that there are herein the earth. Without complaint and with good will," shesays, "so will come well-being, will come gold. Then we willhave food. Our beans, our gourds, our coffee, that is what wewant. That come a good harvest. That come richness, that comewell-being for all of our children. All my shoots, my children,my seeds," she sings. But the world of her children is not to be her world, nor thatof their grandfathers. Their indigenous society is being transformedby the forces of history. Until only recently, isolated from themodern world, the Indians lived in their mountains as people livedin the neolithic. There were only paths and they walked everywherethey went. Trains of burros carried out the principal crop-coffee-tothe markets in the plain. Now roads have been built, blasted outof rock and constructed along the edges of the mountains overprecipices! to connect the community with the society beyond.The children are people of opposites: just as they speak two languages,Mazatec and Spanish, they live between two times: the timeless,cyclical time of recurrence of the People of the Deer and thetime of progress, change and development of modern Mexico. Inher discourse, no stereotyped rite or traditional ceremony withprescribed words and actions, speaking of everything, of the ancientand the modern, of what is happening to her people, the womanof problems, peering into the future, recognizes the inevitableprocess of transition, of disintegration and integration, thatconfronts her children: the younger generation destined to livethe crisis and make the leap from the past into the future. Forthem it is necessary to learn to read and to write and to speakthe language of this new world and in order to advance themselves,to be educated and gain knowledge, contained in books, radicallydifferent from the traditions of their own society whose languageis oral and unwritten, whose implements are the hoe, the axe,and the machete. Also a book is needed, says. Good book. Book of good reading inSpanish, says. In Spanish. All your children, your creatures,that their thought and their custom change, says. For me thereis no time. Without difficulty, let us go, says. With tenderness.With freshness. With sweetness. With good will. "Don't leave us in darkness or blind us," she begs theorigins of light, for in these supernatural modalities of consciousnessthere are dangers on every hand of aberration and disturbance."Let us go along the good path. The path of the veins ofour blood. The path of the Master of the World. Let us go in apath of happiness." The existential way, the conduct of one'slife, is an idea to which she returns again and again. The pathsshe mentions are the moral, physical, mental, emotional qualitiestypical of the experience of animated conscious activity fromthe midst of which spring her words: goodness, vitality, reason,transcendence, and joy. Seated on the ground in the darkness,seeing with her eyes closed, her thought travels within alongthe branching arteries of the bloodstream and without across thefields of existence. There is a very definite physiological qualityabout the mushroom experience which leads the Indians to say thatby a kind of visceral introspection they teach one the workingsof the organism: it is as if the system were projected beforeone into a vision of the heart, the liver, lungs, genitals, andstomach. In the course of the medicine woman's discourse, it is understandablethat she should, from astonishment, from gratitude, from the knowledgeof experience, say something about the mushrooms that have provokedher condition of inspiration. In a sense, to speak of "themushroom experience" is a reification as absurd as the anthropomorphizationof the mushrooms when it is said that they talk: the mushroomsare merely the means, in interaction with the organism, the nervoussystem, and the brain, of producing an experience grounded inthe ontological-existential possibilities of the human, irreducibleto the properties of a mushroom. The experience is psychologicaland social. What is spoken of by the shamaness is her communalworld; even the visions of her imagination must have their originin the context of her existence and the myths of her culture.The subject of another society will have other visions and expressa different content in his discourse. It would seem probable,however, that apart from emotional similarities, colored illuminations,and the purely abstract patterns of a universal conscious activity,between the experiences of individuals with differing social inherences,the common characteristic would be discourse, for judging by theireffect the chemical constituents of the mushrooms have some connectionwith the linguistic centers of the brain. "So says the teacherof words," says the woman, "so says the teacher of matters."It is paradoxical that the rediscovery of such chemicals shouldhave related their effects to madness and pejoratively calledthem drugs, when the shamans who used them spoke of them as medicinesand said from their experience that the metamorphosis they producedput one into communication with the spirit. It is precisely thevalue of studying the use in so-called primitive societies ofsuch chemicals that the way be found beyond the superficial toa more essential understanding of phenomena which we, with ourlimited conception of the rational, have too quickly, perhapsmistakenly, termed irrational, instead of comprehending that suchexperiences are revelations of a primordial existential activity,of "a power of signification, a birth of sense or a savagesense." (6) What are we confrontedwith by the shamanistic discourse of the mushroom eaters? A modalityof reason in which the logos of existence enunciates itself, orby the delirium and incoherence of derangement? "They are doing nothing but talk," says the medicinewoman, "those who say that these matters are matters of thepast. They are doing nothing but talk, the people who call themcrazy mushrooms." They claim to have knowledge of what theydo not have any experience of; consequently their contentionsare nonsense: nothing but expressions of the conventionality themushrooms explode by their disclosure of the extraordinary; merechatter if it weren't for the fact that the omnipotent They formsthe force of repression which, by legislation and the implementationof authority, has come to denominate infractions of the law andthe code of health, the means of liberation that once were calledmedicines. In a time of pills and shots, of scientific medicine,the wise woman is saying, the use of the mushrooms is not an anachronisticand obsolete vestige of magical practices: their power to awakenconsciousness and cure existential ills is not any the less relevantnow than it was in the past. She insists that it is ignoranceof our dimension of mystery, of the wellsprings of meaning, tothink that their effect is insanity. "Good and happiness," she says, naming the emotionsof her activized, perceptualized being. "They are not crazymushrooms. They are a remedy, says. A remedy for decent people.For the foreigners," she says, speaking of us, wayfarersfrom advanced industrial society, who had begun to arrive in thehigh plazas of her people to experiment with the psychedelic mushroomsthat grew in the mountains of the Mazatecs. She has an inklingof the truth, that what we look for is a cure of our alienations,to be put back in touch, by violent means if necessary, with thatoriginal, creative self that has been alienated from us by ourmiddle-class families, education, and corporate world of employment. "There in their land, it is taken account of, that thereis something in these mushrooms, that they are good, of use,"she says. "The doctor that is here in our earth. The plantthat grows in this place. With this we are going to put together,we are going to alleviate ourselves. It is our remedy. He thatsuffers from pain and illness, with this it is possible to alleviatehim. They aren't called mushrooms. They are called prayer. Theyare called well-being. They are called wisdom. They are therewith the Virgin, Our Mother, the Nativity." The Indians donot call the mushrooms of light mushrooms, they call them theholy ones. For the shamaness, the experience they produce is synonymouswith language, with communication, on behalf of her people, withthe supernatural forces of the universe; with plenitude and joyfulness;with perception, insight, and knowledge. It is as if one wereborn again; therefore their patroness is the Goddess of Birth,the Goddess of Creation. With prayers we will get rid of it all. With the prayers of theancients. We will clean ourselves, we will purify ourselves withclear water, we will wash our intestines where they are infected.That sicknesses of the body be gotten rid of. Sicknesses of theatmosphere. Bad air. That they be gotten rid of, that they beremoved. That the wind carry them away. For this is the doctor.For this is the plant. For this is the sorcerer of the light ofday. For this is the remedy. For this is the medicine woman, thewoman doctor who resolves all classes of problems in order torid us of them with her prayers. We are going with well-being,without difficulty, to implore, to beg, to supplicate. Well beingfor all the babies and the creatures. We are going to beg, toimplore for them, to beseech for their well-being and their studies,that they live, that they grow, that they sprout. That freshnesscome, tenderness, shoots, joy. That we be blessed, all of us. She goes on talking and talking, non-stop; there are lulls whenher voice slows down, fades out almost to a whisper; then comerushes of inspiration, moments of intense speech; she yawns greatyawns, laughs with jubilation, claps her hands in time to herinterminable singsong; but after the setting out, the heightsof ecstasy are reached, the intoxication begins to ebb away, andshe sounds the theme of going back to normal, everyday consciousexistence again after this excursion into the beyond, of rejoiningthe ego she has transcended: We are going to return without mishap, along a fresh path, a goodpath, a path of good air; in a path through the cornfield, ina path through the stubble, without complaint or any difficulty,we return without mishap. Already the cock has begun to crow.Rich cock that reminds us that we live in this life. The day that dawns is that of a new world in which there is nolonger any need to walk to where you go. "With tendernessand freshness, let us go in a plane, in a machine, in a car. Letus go from one side to another, searching for the tracks of thefists, the tracks of the feet, the tracks of the nails." It seemed that she had been speaking for eight hours. The secondsof time were expanded, not from boredom, but from the intensityof the lived experience. In terms of the temporality of clocks,she had only been speaking for four hours when she concluded witha vision of the transcendence that had become immanent and hadnow withdrawn from her. "There is the flesh of God. Thereis the flesh of Jesus Christ. There with the Virgin." Themost frequently repeated words of the woman are freshness andtenderness; those of the shaman, whose discourse we will now consider,are fear and terror: what one might call the emotional poles ofthese experiences. There is an illness that the Mazatecs speakof that they name fright. We say traumatism. They walk throughtheir mountains along their arduous paths on the different levelsof being, climbing and descending, in the sunlight and throughthe clouds; all around there are grottos and abysses, mysteriousgroves, places where live the laa, the little people, mischievousdwarfs and gnomes. Rivers and wells are inhabited by spirits withpowers of enchantment. At night in these altitudes, winds whirlup from the depths, rush out of the distance like monsters, andpass, tearing everything in their path with their fierce claws.Phantoms appear in the mists. There are persons with the evileye. Existence in the world and with others is treacherous, perilous:unexpectedly something may happen to you and that event, unlessit is exorcised, can mark you for life. The Indians say following the beliefs of their ancestors, theSiberians, that the soul is sometimes frightened from one, thespirit goes, you are alienated from yourself or possessed by another:you lose yourself. It is for this neurosis that the shamans, thequestioners of enigmas, are the great doctors and the mushroomsthe medicine. It is the task of the Mazatec shaman to look forthe extravagated spirit, find it, bring it back, and reintegratethe personality of the sick one. If necessary, he pays the powersthat have appropriated the spirit by burying cacao, beans of exchange,wrapped in the bark cloth of offerings, at the place of frightwhich he has divined by vision. The mushrooms, the shamans say,show: you see, in the sense that you realize, it is disclosedto you. "Bring her spirit, her soul," implores the medicinewoman to whom we have just been listening. "Let her spiritcome back from where it got lost, from where it stayed, from whereit was left behind, from wherever it is that her spirit is wanderinglost." With just such a traumatic experience, began the shamanistic vocationof the man we will now study. In his late fifties, he has beeneating the mushrooms for nine years. Why did he begin? "Ibegan to eat them because I was sick," he said when asked.(7) No matter how much the doctors treated me, I didn't get well.I went to the Latin American Hospital. I went to Cordoba as well.I went to Mexico. I went to Tehuacan and wasn't alleviated. Onlywith the mushrooms was I cured. I had to eat the mushrooms threetimes and the man from San Lucas, who gave them to me, proposedhis work as a medicine man to me, telling me: now you are goingto receive my study. I asked him why he thought I was going toreceive it when I didn't want to learn anything about his wisdom,I only wanted to get better and be cured of my illness. Then heanswered me: now it is no longer you who command. It is alreadythe middle of the night. I am going to leave you a table withground tobacco on it and a cross underneath it so that you learnthis work. Tell me which of these things you choose and like thebest of all, he said, when everything was ready. Which of theseworks do you want? I answered that I didn't want what he offeredme. Here you don't give the orders, he replied; I am he who isgoing to say whether you receive this work or not because I amhe who is going to give you your diploma in the presence of God.Then I heard the voice of my father. He had been dead for forty-threeyears when he spoke to me the first time that I ate the mushrooms:This work that is being given to you, he said, I am he who tellsyou to accept it. Whether you can see me or not, I don't know.I couldn't imagine from where this voice came that was speakingto me. Then it was that the shaman of San Lucas told me that thevoice I was hearing was that of my father. The sickness from whichI was suffering was alleviated by eating the mushrooms. So I toldthe old man, I am disposed to receive what it is that you offerme, but I want to learn everything. Then it was that he taughtme how to suck through space with a hollow tube of cane. To suckthrough space means that you who are seated there, I can drawthe sickness out of you by suction from a distance. What had begun as a physical illness, appendicitis, became a traumaticneurosis. The doctors wheeled him into an operating room-he whohad never been in a hospital in his life-and suffocated him withan ether mask. And he gave up the ghost while they cut the appendixout of him. When he came to, he lay frightened and depressed,without any will to live, he'd had enough. Instead of recuperating,he lay like a dead man with his eyes wide open, not saying anythingto anyone, what was the use, his life had been a failure, he hadnever become the important man he had aspired all his life tobe, now it was too late; his life was over and he had done nothingthat his children might remember with respect and awe. The doctorscouldn't help him because there was nothing wrong with him physically;contrary to what he believed, he had survived the operation; theslash into his stomach had been sewn up and had healed; nevertheless,he remained apathetic and unresponsive, for he had been terrifiedby death and his spirit had flown away like a bird or a fleet-footeddeer. He needed someone to go out and hunt it for him, to bringback his spirit and resuscitate him. The medicine man, from the nearby village of San Lucas, whom hecalled to him when the modern doctors failed to cure him of thestrange malady he suffered from, was renowned throughout the mountainsas a great shaman, a diviner of destiny. The short, slight, wizenedold man was 105 years old. He gave to his patient, who was sufferingfrom depression, the mushrooms of vitality, and the therapy worked.He vividly relived the operation in his imagination. Accordingto him, the mushrooms cut him open, arranged his insides, andsewed him up again. One of the reasons he hadn't recovered washis conviction that materialistic medicine was incapable of reallycuring since it was divorced from all cooperation with the spiritsand dependence upon the supernatural. In his imagination, the mushrooms performed another surgical interventionand corrected the mistakes of the profane doctor which he consideredresponsible for his lingering lethargy. He went through the wholeprocess in his mind. It was as if he were operating upon himself,undoing what had been done to him, and doing it over again himself.The trauma was exorcised. By intensely envisioning with a heightened,expanded consciousness what had happened to him under anesthesia,he assumed at last the frightening event he had previously beenunable to integrate into his experience. His physiological curewas completed psychologically; he was finally healed by virtueof the assimilative, creative powers of the imagination. The deadman came back to life, he wanted to live because he felt onceagain that he was alive and had the force to go on living: onceexhausted and despondent, he was now invigorated and rejuvenated. The cure is successful because not only is his spirit awakened,but he is offered another future: a new profession that is a compensationfor his humble one as a storekeeper. The ancient wise man, onthe brink of death, wants to transmit to the man in his prime,his knowledge. What he encounters is resistance. The other doesn'twant to assume the vocation of shaman, he only wants to be cured,without realizing that the cure is inseparable from the acceptanceof the vocation which will release him from the repression ofhis creative forces that has caused the neurosis with which heis afflicted. It is no longer you who command, he is told, forhis impulse to die is stronger than his desire to live; thereforethe counterforce, if it is to be effective, cannot be his: itmust be the will of the other transferred to him. You are toofar gone to have any say in the matter, the medicine man tellshim, it is already the middle of the night. By negating the willof his patient, he arouses it and prepares him to accept whatis being suggested to him. He shows him the table, the tobacco, the cross: signs of the shaman'swork. The table is an altar at which to officiate.. When the Mazatecseat the mushrooms they speak of the sessions as masses. The shaman,even though a secular figure unordained by the Church, assumesa sacerdotal role as the leader of these ceremonies. In a similarway, for the Indians each father of a family is the religiouspriest of his household. The tobacco, San Pedro, is believed tohave powerful magical and remedial values. The cross indicatesa crossing of the ways, an intersection of existential paths,a change, as well as being the religious symbol of crucifixionand resurrection. The shaman tells him to choose. Still the manrefuses. You don't give the orders, says the medicine man intentupon evoking the patient's other self in order to bring him backto life, the I who is another. Whether you want to or not, youare going to receive your diploma, he says, to incite him withthe prospect of award and reputation. Living in an oral culturewithout writing, where the acquisition of skills is traditional,handed down from father to son, mother to daughters rather thancontained in books, for the Mazatecs wisdom is gained during theexperiences produced by the mushrooms: they are experiences ofvision and communication that impart knowledge. Now he is spoken to. The inner voice is suddenly audible. He hearsthe call. He is told to accept the vocation of medicine man thathe has hitherto adamantly. refused. He cannot recognize this voiceas his own, it must be another's; and the shaman, intent upongiving him a new destiny, sure of the talent he has divined, interpretsfor him from what region of himself springs the command he hasheard. It is your father who is telling you to accept this work.A characteristic of such transcendental experiences is that familyrelationships, in the nexus of which personality is formed, becomepresent to one with intense vividness. His superego, in conjunctionwith the liberation of his vitality, has spoken to him and hisresistance is liquidated; he decides to live and accepts the newvocation around which his personality is reintegrated: he becomesan adept of the dimensions of consciousness where live the spirits;a speaker of mighty words. In his house, we entered a room with bare concrete walls and ahigh roof of corrugated iron. His wife, wrapped in shawls, wassitting on a mat. His children were there; his family had assembledto eat the mushrooms with their father; one or two were givento the children of ten and twelve. The window was closed and withthe door shut, the room was sealed off from the outside world;nobody would be permitted to leave until the effect of what theyhad eaten had passed away as a precaution against the peril ofderangement. He was a short, burly man, dressed in a reefer jacketover a tee shirt, old brown bell-bottomed pants down to his shortfeet, an empty cartridge belt around his waist. In daily life,he is the owner of a little store stocked meagerly with cannedgoods, boxes of crackers, beer, soda, candy, bread, and soap.He sits behind the counter throughout the day looking out uponthe muddy street of the town where dogs prowl in the garbage betweenthe legs of the passers-by. From time to time he pours out a shotglass of cane liquor for a customer. He himself neither smokesnor drinks. He is a hunter in whom the instincts of his peoplesurvive from the time when they were chasers of game as well asagriculturalists: inhabitants of the Land of the Deer. Now it is night-time and he prepares to exercise his shamanisticfunction. His great- grandfather was one of the counselors ofthe town and a medicine man. With the advent of modern medicineand the invasion of the foreigners in search of mushrooms, theshamanistic customs of the Mazatecs have almost completely vanished.He himself no longer believes many of the beliefs of his ancestors,but as one of the last oral poets of his people, he consciouslykeeps alive their traditions. "How good it is," he says,"to talk as the ancients did." He hardly speaks Spanishand is fluent only in his native language. Spreading out the mushroomsin front of him, he selected and handed a bunch of them to eachof those present after blessing them in the smoke of the copal.Once they had been eaten, the lights were extinguished and everyonesat in silence. Then he began to speak, seated in a chair fromwhich he got up to dance about, whirling and scuffling as he spokein the darkness. It was pouring, the rain thundering on the roofof corrugated iron. There were claps of thunder. Flashes of lightningat the window. Christ, Our Lord, illuminate me with the light of day, illuminatemy mind. Christ, Our Lord, don't leave me in darkness or blindme, you who know how to give the light of day, you who illuminatethe night and give the light. So did the Holy Trinity that madeand put together the world of Christ, Our Lord, illuminated theMoon, says; illuminated the Big Star, says; illuminated the CrossStar, says; illuminated the Hook Star, says; illuminated the Sandal,says; illuminated the Horse, says. One who eats the mushroom sinks into somnolence during the transitionfrom one modality of consciousness to another, into a deep absorption,a reverie. Gradually colors begin to well up behind closed eyes.Consciousness becomes consciousness of irradiations and effulgences,of a flux of light patterns forming and unforming, of electriccurrents beaming forth from within the brain. At this initialmoment of awakenment, experiencing the dawn of light in the midstof the night, the shaman evokes the illumination of the constellationsat the genesis of the world. Mythopoetical descriptions of thecreation of the world are constant themes of these creative experiences.From the beginning, the vision his words create is cosmological.Subjective phenomena are given correlates in the elemental, naturalworld. One is not inside, but outside. "This old hawk. This white hawk that Saint John the Evangelistholds. That whistles in the dawn. Whistles in the light of day.Whistles over the water." Wings spread wide, the annunciatorybird, image of ascent, circles in the sky of the morning, driftingon the wind of the spirit above the primordial terrain the speakerhas begun to explore and delineate, his breathing, his inhalationsand exhalations, as amplified as his expanded being: an explanationfor the sudden expulsion of air, the whooshes and high-pitched,eerie whistles of the shamans on their transcendental flightsinto the beyond. "Straight path, says. Path of the dawn, says. Path of thelight of day, says." Through the fields of being there aremany directions in which to go, existences are different waysto live life. The idea of paths, that appears so frequently inthe shamanistic discourses of the Mazatecs comes from the factthat these originary experiences are creative of intentions. Tobe in movement, going along a path, is an expressive vision ofthe ecstatic condition. The path the speaker is following is thatwhich leads directly to his destination, to the accomplishmentof his purpose; the path of the beginning disclosed by the risingsun at the time of setting out; the path of truth, of clarity,of that revealed in its being there by the light of day. "Where the tenderness of San Francisco Huehuetlan is, says.Where the Holy Virgin of San Lucas is, says. Where San FranciscoTecoatl is, says. San Geronimo Tecoatl, says." He beginsto name the towns of his mountainous environment, to call thelandscape into being by language and transform the real into signs.It is no imaginary world of fantasy he is creating, as those onehas become accustomed to hearing of from the accounts of dreamersunder the effects of such psychoactive chemicals, fabled landsof nostalgia, palaces, and jeweled perspectives, but the realworld in which he lives and works transfigured by his visionaryjourney and its linguistic expression into a surreal realm wherethe physical and the mental fuse to produce the glow of an enigmaticsignificance. "I am he who speaks with the father mountain. I am he whospeaks with danger, I am going to sweep in the mountains of fear,in the mountains of nerves." The other I announces itself,the transcendental ego, the I of the voice, the I of force incommunication with force. His existence intensified, he positshimself by his assertions: I am he who. The simultaneous referenceto himself in the first and third person as subject and objectindicates the impersonal personality of his utterances, utteredby him and by the phenomena themselves that express themselvesthrough him. Arrogantly he affirms his shamanistic function asthe mediator between man and the powers that determine his fate;he is the one who converses with all connoted by father: power,authority, and origin. He is the one who is on familiar termswith the sources of fright. The conception of existence manifestedby his words is one of peril, anxiety, and terror: experiencesof which he has become knowledgeable by virtue of his own traumas,his life as a hunter, and his adventures into the weird, secretregions of the psyche. Where there is foreboding and trembling,the medicine man tranquilizes by exorcising the causes of disturbance.His work lies among the nerves, not in the underworld, but onthe heights, places of as much anguish as the depths, where theelation of elevation is accompanied by the fear of falling intothe void of chasms. This is perhaps why, throughout Central andSouth America, the conception of illness in the jungle areas isthe paranoic one of witchcraft, whereas in the mountainous areasis prevalent the vertiginous idea of fright and loss of self.(8) "There in Bell Mountain, says. There is the dirty fright.There is the garbage, says. There is the claw, says. There isthe terror, says. Where the day is, says. Where the clown is,says. The Lord Clown, says." In vision he sees, throughouthis being he senses a repulsive place of filth and contamination,a stinking site of pustulence, of rottenness and nausea, wherelies a claw that might have dealt with cruel viciousness an infectedwound. His words, emanating evil, seem to insinuate some horribledeed that left an aftermath of guilt. The sinister hovers in theair. Where? Where the clown is, he says. Concern and carefreenessare linked together, dread and laughter, from which we catch aninsight into the meaning of the matter: during such experiencesof liberation, there are likely to be encountered disturbancesof consciousness by conscience, when reflection comes into conflictwith spontaneity, guilt with innocence. It is as if the self drewback in fright from its ebullience, from its forgetfulness, unableto endure its carefreeness for long without anxiety. But the exuberantwelling up of forms is ceaseless, in this flux, this fountain,this energetic springing forth of life, the past is left behindfor the future, all is renewed. Beyond good and evil is the playfulnessof the creative spirit incarnated by the clown, character of fortuity,the laughing one with his gay science. Thirteen superior whirlwinds. Thirteen whirlwinds of the atmosphere.Thirteen clowns, says. Thirteen personalities, says. Thirteenwhite lights, says. Thirteen mountains of points, says. Thirteenold hawks, says. Thirteen white hawks, says. Thirteen personalities,says. Thirteen mountains, says. Thirteen clowns, says. Thirteenpeaks, says. Thirteen stars of the morning. The enumeration, by what seems to be a process of free association,of whirlwinds, clowns, personalities, lights, mountains, birds,and stars, is an expression of his ecstatic inventiveness. Whetherhe says what he sees or sees what he says, his activized consciousnessis a whirlwind of imaginings and colored lights. Why always thirteen?Because twelve is many, but an even number, whereas thirteen istoo many, an exaggeration, and signifies a multitude. What's more,he probably likes the sound of the word thirteen. The mushroom session of language creates language, creates thewords for phenomena without name. The white lights that sometimesappear in the sky at night, nobody knows what to call them. Themind activated by the mushrooms, from out of the center of themystery, from the profoundest semantic sources of the human, inventsa word to designate them by. The ancient wise men, to describethe kaleidoscopic illuminations of their shamanistic nights, drewan analogy between the inside and the outside and formed a wordthat related the spectrum colors created by the sunshine in thespray of waterfalls and the mists of the morning to their consciousexperiences of ecstatic enlightenment: these are the whirlwindshe speaks of, gyrating configurations of iridescent lights thatappear to him as he speaks, turned round and round and round himselfby the turbulent winds of the spirit. Clowns are frequent personaeof his discourse, the impish mushrooms come to life, embodimentsof merriment, tumbling figments of the spontaneous performingincredible acrobatic feats, funny imaginations of joyfulness.Personalities are more serious. Others. Society. The faces ofthe people he knows appear to him, then disappear to be succeededby the apparition of more people. The plurality of incarnatedconsciousnesses becomes present to him. Multitude. His is an elementalworld where cruel, predatory birds wheel in the sky; where thestar of the morning shines in the firmament. Outside the darkroom where he is speaking, the mountains stand all around in thenight. I am he who speaks with the dangerous mountain, says. I am hewho speaks with the Mountain of Ridges, says. I am he who speakswith the Father, says. I am he who speaks with the Mother, says.Where plays the spirit of the day, says. Cold Water Mountain,says. Big River Mountain, says. Mountain of Harvest and Richness,says. Where the terror of the day is, says. Where is the way ofthe dawn, the way of the day, says. It is significant that though the psychedelic experience producedby the mushrooms is of heightened perceptivity, the I say is ofprivileged importance to the I see. The utter darkness of theroom, sealed off from the outside, makes any direct perceptionof the world impossible: the condition of interiorization forits visionary rebirth in images. In such darkness, to open theeyes is the same as leaving them closed. The blackness is alivewith impalpable designs in the miraculous air. Even the appearancesof the other presences, out of modesty, are protected by the obscurityfrom the too penetrating, revealing gaze of transcendental perception.Freed from the factuality of the given, the constitutive activityof consciousness produces visions. It is this aspect of such experiences,to the exclusion of all others, that has led them to be calledhallucinogenic, without any attempt having been made to distinguishfantasy from intuition. The Mazatec shaman, however, instead ofkeeping silent and dreaming, as one would expect him to do ifthe experience were merely imaginative, talks. There are timeswhen in the midst of his ecstasy, whistling and whirling about,he exclaims: "Look at how beautiful we're seeing!"-astonishedby the illuminations and patterns he is perceiving-"Lookat how beautiful we're seeing. Look at how many good things ofGod there are. What beautiful colors I see." Nevertheless,the I am the one who speaks enunciates an action and afunction, weighted with an importance and efficacity which Iam the one who sees, hardly more than an interjection of amazement,totally lacks. "I am he who speaks. I am he who speaks. I am he who speakswith the mountains, with the largest mountains. Speaks with themountains, says. Speaks with the stones, says. Speaks with theatmosphere, says. Speaks with the spirit of the day." Forthe Mazatecs, the mountains are where the powers are, their summits,their ranges, radiating with electricity in the night, their peaksand their edges oscillating on the horizons of lightning. To speakwith is to be in contact with, in communication with, in conversationwith the animate spirit of the inanimate, with the material andthe immaterial. To speak with is to be spoken to. By a conversionof his being, the shaman has become a transmitter and receiverof messages. "I am the dry lightning, says. I am the lightning of thecomet, says. I am the dangerous lightning, says. I am the biglightning, says. I am the lightning of rocky places, says. I amthe light of the dawn, the light of day, says." He identifieshimself with the elements, with the crackle of electricity; superhumanand elemental himself, his words flash from him like lightning.Sparks fly between the synaptic connections of the nerves. Heis illuminated with light. He is luminous. He is force, light,and rhythmic, dynamic speech. The world created by the woman's words, articulating her experience,was a feminine, maternal, domestic one; the masculine discourseof the shaman evokes the natural, ontological world. "Sheis beseeching for you, this poor and humble woman," saidthe to the exclusion of all others, that has led them to be calledhallucinogenic, without any attempt having been made to distinguishfantasy from intuition. The Mazatec shaman, however, instead ofkeeping silent and dreaming, as one would expect him to do ifthe experience were merely imaginative, talks. There are timeswhen in the midst of his ecstasy, whistling and whirling about,he exclaims: "Look at how beautiful we're seeing!"-astonishedby the illuminations and patterns he is perceiving-"Lookat how beautiful we're seeing.

The world created by the woman's words, articulating her experience,was a feminine, maternal, domestic one; the masculine discourseof the shaman evokes the natural, ontological world. "Sheis beseeching for you, this poor and humble woman," saidthe shamaness. "Woman of huipile, says. Simple woman, says.Woman who doesn't have anything, says." The man, consciousof his virility, announces: "I am he who lightnings forth." "Where the dirty gulch is, says. Where the dangerous gulchis, says. Where the big gulch is, says. Where the fear and theterror are, says. Where runs the muddy water, says. Where runsthe cold water, says." It is a landscape of ravines, mountains,and streams, he charts with his words, of physical qualities withemotional values: a terrain of being in its variations. He evokesthe creation, the genesis of all things out of the times of mist;he praises, marvels, wonders at the world. "God the HolySpirit, as he made and put together the world. Made great lakes.Made mountains. Look at the light of day. Look at how many animals.Look at the dawn. Look at space. Great earths. Earth of God theHoly Spirit." He whistles. The soul was originally conceivedof as breath. The wind, he says, is passing through the treesof the forest. His spirit goes flying from place to place throughoutthe territory of his existence, situating the various locationsof the world by naming them, calling them into being by visitingthem with his words: where is, he says, where is, to create thegeography of his reality. I am, where is. He unfolds the extensionsof space around himself, points out and makes present as if hewere there himself. "Where the blood of Christ is, says.Where the blood of the diviner is, says. Where the terror andthe fright of day are, says. Where the superior lake is, says.Where the big lake is, says. There where large birds fly, says.Where fly dangerous birds." The world is not only paradisiacalin its being there, but frightening, with perils lurking everywhere."Mountains of great whirlwinds. Where is the fountain ofterror. Where is the fountain of fright." And the differentplaces are inhabited by presences, by indwelling spirits, thegnomes, the little people. "Gnome of Cold Water, says. Gnomeof Clear Water, says. Gnome of Big River, says. Big Gnome. Gnomeof Burned Mountain. Gnome of the spirit of the day. Gnome of TlocalcoMountain. Gnome of the Marking Post. White Gnome. Delicate Gnome." The shaman, says Alfred Metraux, is "an individual who, inthe interest of the community, sustains by profession an intermittentcommerce with the spirits or is possessed by them." (9)According to the classical conception, derived from the ecstaticvisionaries of Siberia, the shaman is a person who, by a changeof his everyday consciousness, enters the metaphysical realmsof the transcendental in order to parley with the supernaturalpowers and gain an understanding of the hidden reasons of events,of sickness and all manner of difficulty. The Mazatec medicinemen are therefore shamans in every sense of the word: their meansof inspiration, of opening the circuits of communication betweenthemselves, others, the world, and the spirits, are the mushroomsthat disclose, by their psychoactive power, another modality ofconscious activity than the ordinary one. The mere eating of themushrooms, however, does not make a shaman. The Indians recognizethat it is not to everyone that they speak; instead there aresome who have a longing for awakenment, a disposition for exploringthe surrealistic dimensions of existence, a poet's need to expressthemselves in a higher language than the average language of everydaylife: for them in a very particular sense the mushrooms are themedicine of their genius. Nonetheless, there is a very definiteidea among the Mazatecs of what the medicine man does, and sincethe mushrooms are his means of converting himself into the shamanisticcondition, the essential characteristics of this particular varietyof psychedelic experience must be manifested by his activities. "I am he who puts together," says the medicine man todefine his shamanistic function: he who speaks, he who searches, says. I am he who looks for thespirit of the day, says. I search where there is fright and terror.I am he who fixes, he who cures the person that is sick. Herbalmedicine. Remedy of the spirit. Remedy of the atmosphere of theday, says. I am he who resolves all, says. Truly you are man enoughto resolve the truth. You are he who puts together and resolves.You are he who puts together the personality. You are he who speakswith the light of day. You are he who speaks with terror. It is immediately obvious that a discrepancy exists between theIndian conception of the mushrooms' effect and the ideas of modernpsychology: whereas in experimental research reports they aresaid to produce depersonalization, schizophrenia, and derangement,the Mazatec shaman, inspired by them, considers himself endowedwith the power of bringing together what is separated: he canheal the divided personality by releasing the springs of existencefrom repression to reveal the ecstatic life of the integral self;and from disparate clues, by the sudden synthesis of intuition,realize the solution to problems. The words with which he stateswhat his work is indicate a creative activity neither outsideof the realm of reason or out of contact with reality. The centerof convergent message fields, sensitive to the meaning of allaround him, he expresses and communicates, in direct contact withothers through speech, an articulator of the unsaid who liberatesby language and makes understood. His intuitions penetrate appearancesto the essence of matters. Reality reveals itself through himin words as if it had found a voice to utter itself. The shamanis a signifier in pursuit of significance, intent upon bringingforth the hidden, the obscure into the light of day, the lucidone, intrepid enough to realize that the greatest secrets liein regions of danger. He is the doctor, not only of the body,but of the self, the one who inquires into the origins of trauma,the interrogator of the familiar and mysterious. It is indeedas if that which he has eaten, by virtue of the possibilitiesit discovers to him, were of the spirit, for perception becomesmore acute, speech more fluent, and the consciousness of significanceis quickened. The mushrooms are a remedy to which one has recoursein order to resolve perplexities because the experience is creativeof intentions. The way forth from the problematic is conceivedof, the meaning of resolved. The shaman, he is the one in communicationwith the light and with the darkness, who knows of anxiety andhow to dispel it: the man of truth, psychologist of the troubledsoul. Where is the fear, says. Where is the terror, says. Where stayedthe spirit of this child, says. I have to search for it, says.I have to locate it, says. I have to detain it, says. I have tograb it, says. I have to call it, says. I have to whistle forit in the midst of terror, says. I have to whistle for it throughthe cumulus clouds. I have to whistle for it with the spirit ofthe day. Once more there appears the notion of alienation, the malady offright, the loss of the self. The task of the shaman, hunter ofextravagated spirits, is to reassociate the disassociated. Heexplains his method himself in these words: Under the effect of the mushrooms, the lost spirit is whistledfor through space for the spirit is alienated, but by means ofthe mushrooms one can call for it with a whistle. If the personis frightened, the mushrooms know where his spirit is. They arethe ones who indicate and teach where the spirit is. Thereby onecan speak to it. The sick person then sees the place where hisspirit stayed. He feels as if he were tied in that place. Thespirit is like a trapped butterfly. When it is whistled for itarrives where one is calling it. When the spirit arrives in theperson, the sick one sighs and afterwards is cleaned. It becomes evident from the words used to describe the conditionof fright-the spirit is said to have been left behind, to havestayed somewhere, to be tied up, and as we will see later, tobe imprisoned-that just as in the etiology of the neuroses, thesickness is a fixation upon a traumatic past event which the individualis incapable of transcending and from which he must be liberatedto be cured. It is not by chance that the mushrooms, which causea flight of the spirit, should be considered the means of chasingwhat has flown away. The shaman goes in search; by empathic imagination,sometimes even by dialogue with the disturbed one, he gains aninsight into the reasons for the state of shock, which allowshim to make his invocations relevant to the individual case. Thepatient, by the mnemonic power of the mushrooms, freed from inhibitionsand repressions, recalls the traumatic event, surmounts the repetitionsyndrome that perpetuates it by virtue of the ecstatic spontaneitythat has been released from him, suffers a catharsis, and is broughtback to life, integrated again. Another method of regaining the lost spirit, used as well as invocation,is to barter for it. Merchants, the Mazatecs conceive of all transactionsin terms of commerce, of trading one value for another. Throughouthis discourse, the shamans a storekeeper in daily life, dreamsof money, of richness, of freedom from poverty. "Father Bank.Big Bank. Where the light of day is. Cordoba. Orizaba." Henames the cities where the merchants of Huautla sell their principalcommercial crop-coffee-in the market. "Where the SuperiorBank is, says. Where the Big Bank is, says. Where the Good Bankis, says. Where there is money of gold, says. Where there is moneyof silver, says. Where there are big notes, says. Where the bankof gold is, says. Where the bank of well-being is, says."It is not surprising that among such mercantile people it shouldbe considered possible to buy back the lost spirit, to retrieveit in exchange for another value. "Where the fright of the spirit is. Going to pay for it tothe spirit. Going to pay the day. Going to pay the mountains.Going to pay the corners." The shaman becomes a transcendentalbargainer. He is told by the supernatural powers how much theydemand as a ransom for the spirit they have expropriated, thenhe undertakes to transact the deal. He explains it himself inthis way: Cacao is used to pay the mountain and to pay for the life of thesick one. The Lord of the Mountain asks for a chicken. This isan important matter because it is the Masters of the Mountainswho speak. That is the belief of the ancients. The chicken isthe one who has to carry the cacao. Loaded with cacao it has togo and leave the offering in the mountain. Once it is on the mountain,seeing it loaded no one bothers to catch it because already itbelongs to the Masters of the Mountain where it is lost forever.The cacao that it carries is money for the Master of the Mountain.The bark paper is used to wrap the bundle and the parrot featherthat goes with it. The signification of the parrot feather isthat it is as if the parrot himself arrived on the mountain. Itis he who arrives announcing with his songs the arrival of thechicken loaded with cacao, the arrival of the money to pay whatwas asked for, as if the liberty of a prisoner were being paidfor. It is as if an authority said to you, "This prisonerwill be set free for a fine of one hundred pesos and if it isn'tpaid, he won't go free." The transaction probably has thepsychological effect of assuaging anxiety with the assurance thatthe powers angered by a transgression have been appeased. As we have seen, though these shamanistic chants are creationsof language created by the individual creativity of the speakers,the structure of the discourses, short phrases articulated insuccession terminated by the punctuation of the word says, tendto be similar from person to person, determined to a large extentby culture and tradition as is much of what is said. An instanceis the invocatory reiteration of names, a characteristic commonto all the Mazatec shamanistic sessions of speech. The names repeatedby the Indian medicine men, devout Catholics, are those of theVirgin and the saints. In ancient times, other divinities musthave been named, but without any doubt, to name and make presenthas always played a role in such chants. "Holy Virgin ofthe Sanctuary. Holy Virgin. Saint Bartholomew. Saint Christopher.Saint Manuel. Holy Father. Saint Vincent. Saint Mark. Saint Manuel.Virgin Guadalupe, Queen of Mexico." To sing out the holynames serves the function for the oral poet, like the stereotypedphrases of Homeric song, of keeping the chant going during theinterludes of inspiration; at the same time, the rhythmic enunciationis a telling over of identities, an expression of the interpersonalityof consciousness. To recall again the affirmation of Husserl:Transcendental subjectivity is intersubjectivity. The name isthe word for the person. In the mind of the speaker one identityafter another becomes present, names call up people, the visionof people calls up names. Instead of naming his own acquaintances,which might occur in a desacralized discourse, the shaman invokesthe holy ones. The sacred nomenclature is a sublimation of thenomenclature of family and social relationships. It is now his everyday self, his wife and his family whom he speaksabout. "Our children are going to grow up and live. I see.I see my wife, my little working woman. I love her. I speak toher through space. I speak to her through the cumulus clouds.I call to her spirit. Nothing will befall us." Man and woman,the couple and their children, that is his theme now that lovefor his family wells up in his heart. Nothing can happen to us. We will go on living. We will go onliving in the company of my wife, of my people. We should notmake our wife irritable. We went to receive her before God, inthe sight of God, in the Sacred Sacrament, in sight of the altar.There was a great mass, there was a mass of union. We were ableto respect each other forty-three days and therefore God disposedthat our children should be born and live. Because of that ourseeds bore fruit, our offspring grew, offspring and seed thatGod Our Lord gave us. He who speaks and says, perhaps it is rumored that the work heis doing, this person, is great, that his ranch is large. He isnot presumptuous. He is a humble person. He is a laborious person.He is a person of problems. He is a person who has al ready loanedhis service as an authority. He has realized himself, his giftsare inherited, he is of important people: Justo Pastor, Juan Nazareno.He is of a great root, an important root. Large trees, old trees.All our children will live, says. Will have a good harvest. Willrear their animals. Well-being and pleasure in their sugar cane,in their coffee groves. I will live much time yet. I will becomean old man with gray hair, I will continue living with my offspringand with my people. My children will have education and well-being.Education must be given to my sons. He says the changes through which he passes, the transformationsand permutations of his ecstatic consciousness in the course ofits temporalization-the sense of gamble, the risks, the momentsof fright, the presence of light and vigor. "It turns intoa game of chance, says. It turns into terror, says. It turns intospirit, says." He whistles and sings and dances about. "That which soundsis a harp in the presence of God and the Angel of the Guard. Playsspace, plays the rocks, plays the mountains, plays the corners,plays fear, plays terror, plays the day." He plays the facetsof the world as if they were musical instruments. Things and emotions,at the contact of his singing and touch are magically resolvedinto ringing vibrating tonalities, into music-music of mountainsand rocks, of space and fear. "Where sound the trees, says.Where sound the rocks, says. Where sound baskets. Where soundsthe spirit of the day." He is hearing the ringing and thebuzzing and the humming of his effervescent consciousness andfinding analogies for the sounds he hears in the echo chambersof his eardrums: the soughing of the wind through the trees, theclinking of stones, the creaking of baskets. He whistles and sings.His words issue forth from the melodic articulation of inarticulatesounds, from the physical movement of his rhythmic whirling aboutand scuffling in the darkness. "How beautiful I sing,"he exclaims. "How beautiful I sing. How many good pleasuresconcedes to us the Lord of the World." He dances about workinghimself up to a further pitch of exaltation. "How beautifulI dance. How beautiful I dance." Repetition is one of theaspects of the discourse as it is of the pulsation of energy waves. "This person is valiant," he says of himself. "Heis of the people of Huautla, he is a Huautecan. With great speedhe calls and whistles for the spirits among the mountains; whistlesthe fright of the spirit." Then he flips out. He throws himselfinto the shamanistic fit, his voice changes, becomes that of another,rougher, more guttural, and beginning to speak in the speech ofSan Lucas from where came his old master, a town in the midstof the corn on a high windswept peak, he recalls his spiritualancestor, the ancient wise man who taught him the use of the gnomicmushrooms. "He is a person of jars. He is of San Lucas. Aperson of plates. He is a person of jars and bowls. He is an oldone." San Lucas is the place where all the black, unadorned,neolithic pottery used throughout the region is made. Men go fromtown to town carrying the jars, padded with ferns, on their backsto sell them in the marketplaces of the mountain villages. "Oldman of pots, dishes, bowls. These are the people of the center.They speak with the mountains arrogantly. He is from San Lucas.He speaks with the whirlwind, with the whirlwind of the interior." From what he himself tells of this old shaman, appear vestigesof the days when the shaman of the People of the Deer, intermediarybetween man, nature, and the divine was a thaumaturge who presidedover fertility and the hunt. "I had to visit the same medicineman," he recounts, "when we went to the hunt. I hadto prepare for him an egg, an egg to be offered to the mountain.It all depends on the value of the animal that one wants. It isas if you were going to buy an animal," he said. He is the one who says what one is to pay. He goes to leave theegg. Afterwards the dogs go into the woods and begin to work.It is necessary to rub tobacco on the crown of the dogs' heads.But with the egg and twenty-five beans of cacao, the master issure that the deer is already bought. I have paid for the game,says the true shaman. And every time we went to hunt, we weretherefore sure to encounter deer because a good shaman from SanLucas can transform a tree or a stone into a deer once he hasexchanged its value for it with the Lord of the Mountain. We weresure to come upon deer because they had been paid for. "Here come the Huautecans. Here come the Huautecans."Dancing about in the darkness, flapping his coat against his sidesto imitate the bounding of a startled deer through the underbrush,he, the hunter of spirits and of game, barking like the dogs closingin around the cornered animal, tells a hunting story, talkingrapidly with intense excitement in the gruff voice of one fromSan Lucas who sees from his vantage point the hunters of Huautlain the distance: Listen to how their dogs bark. It's an old dog. Here they comeby way of the Sad Mountain. They are bringing their kill. Thereis barking in the mountain. Here they come. Listen to how theirarms sound. Already they have shot a colored deer. They pay themountains. They pay the corners. The deer was killed because theHuautecans pay the price. They paid the spirit. Paid the BaldMountain. Paid the Hollow Mountain. Paid the Mountain of the Spiritof the Day. Paid fifty pesos. You can't do just as you like. Itis necessary to pay the White Gnome. The Huautecans are like clowns.They are carrying the deer off along the path. The rifles of theHuautecans are very fine. These people are important people. Theyknow what they are doing. They know how to call the spirit. TheHuautecans call their dogs by blowing a horn. Already the dogsare coming close. The story comes almost at the conclusion of his discourse. Theeffect of the mushrooms lasts approximately six hours; usuallyit is impossible to sleep until dawn. In all such adventures,at the end, comes the idea of a return from where it is one hasgone, the return to everyday consciousness. "I return tocollect these holy children that served as a remedy," theshaman says, calling back his spirits from their flight into thebeyond in order to become his ordinary self again. "Agedclowns. White clowns." The mushrooms he calls sainted childrenand clowns, relating them by his personifications to beings whoare young and joyful, playful, creative, and wise. "The aurora of the dawn is coming and the light of day. Inthe name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, by the signof the Holy Cross, free us Our Lord from our enemies and all evil.Amen." What began in the depths of the night with the illumination ofinterior constellations in the spaces of consciousness ends withthe arrival of the daylight after a night of continuous, animatedspeech. "I am he who speaks," says the Mazatec shaman. I am he who speaks. I am he who speaks with the mountains. I amhe who speaks with the corners. I am the doctor. I am the manof medicines. I am. I am he who cures. I am he who speaks withthe Lord of the World. I am happy. I speak with the mountains.I am he who speaks with the mountains of peaks. I am he who speakswith the Bald Mountain. I am the remedy and the medicine man.I am the mushroom. I am the fresh mushroom. I am the large mushroom.I am the fragrant mushroom. I am the mushroom of the spirit. The Mazatecs say that the mushrooms speak. Now the investigators(10) from without should have listenedbetter to the Indian wise men who had experience of what they,white ones of reason, had not. If the mushrooms are hallucinogenic,why do the Indians associate them with communication, with truthand the enunciation of meaning? An hallucination is a false perception,either visual or audible, that does not have any relation at allto reality, a fantastical illusion or delusion: what appears,but has no existence except in the mind. The vivid dreams of thepsychedelic experience suggested hallucinations: such imaginationsdo occur in these visionary conditions, but they are marginal,not essential phenomena of a general liberation of the spontaneous,ecstatic, creative activity of conscious existence. Hallucinationspredominated in the experiences of the investigators because theywere passive experimenters of the transformative effect of themushrooms. The Indian shamans are not contemplative, they areworkers who actively express themselves by speaking, creatorsengaged in an endeavor of ontological, existential disclosure.For them, the shamanistic condition provoked by the mushroomsis intuitionary, not hallucinatory. What one envisions has anethical relation to reality, is indeed often the path to be followed.To see is to realize, to understand. But even more important thanvisions for the Mazatec shaman are words as real as the realitiesof the real they utter. It is as if the mushrooms revealed a primordialactivity of signification, for once the shaman has eaten them,he begins to speak and continues to speak throughout the shamanisticsession of ecstatic language. The phenomenon most distinctiveof the mushrooms' effect is the inspired capacity to speak. Thosewho eat them are men of language, illuminated with the spirit,who call themselves the ones who speak, those who say. The shaman,chanting in a melodic singsong, saying says at the end of eachphrase of saying, is in communication with the origins of creation,the sources of the voice, and the fountains of the word, relatedto reality from the heart of his existential ecstasy by the activemediation of language: the articulation of meaning and experience.To call such transcendental experiences of light, vision, andspeech hallucinatory is to deny that they are revelatory of reality.In the ancient codices, the colored books, the figures sit, hieroglyphsof words, holding the mushrooms of language in pairs in theirhands: signs of signification. (2). The inspiration produced by the mushroomsis very much like that described by Nietzsche in Ecce Homo.Since the statement of Rimbaud, "I is another," spontaneouslanguage, speaking or writing as if from dictation (to use thecommon expression for an activity very difficult to describe inits truth) has been of paramount interest to philosophers andpoets. Sap the Mexican, Octavio Paz, in an essay on Breton, "Theinspired one, the man who in truth speaks, does not say anythingthat is his: from his mouth speaks language." Octavio Paz,"Andre Breton o La Busqueda del Comienzo," CorrienteAlterna (Mexico: Siglo Veintiuno, 1967), p. 53. (Back) (3). The shamanistic discourses studied in this essay, were tape-recorded.I am indebted for the translations to a bilingual woman of Huautla,Mrs. Eloina Estrada de Gonzalez, who listened to the recordingsand told me, phrase by phrase, in Spanish, what the shaman andshamaness were saying in their native language. As far as I know,the words of neither of these oral poets have hitherto been published.They are Mrs. Irene Pineda de Figueroa and Mr. Roman Estrada.The complete text of each discourse takes up ninety-two pages.For the purposes of this essay, I have merely selected the mostrepresentative passages. (Back) (4). ". . . the Greek word which signifies poetry was employedby the writer of an alchemical papyrus to designate the operationof 'transmutation' itself. What a ray of light! One knows thatthe word 'poetry' comes from the Greek verb which signifies 'make.'But that does not designate an ordinary fabrication except forthose who reduce it to verbal nonsense. For those who have conservedthe sense of the poetic mystery, poetry is a sacred action. Thatis to say, one which exceeds the ordinary level of human action.Like alchemy, its intention is to associate itself with the mysteryof the 'primordial creation' . . ."

The story of how he began his shamanistic career, togetherwith the information to follow about fright, payments to the mountains,and practices in relation to the hunt, are quotations from aninterview with Mr. Roman Estrada whom I questioned through aninterpreter: the conversation was tape-recorded and then translatedfrom the native language by Mrs. Eloina Estrada de Gonzalez, theniece of the shaman, who served as questioner in the interviewitself.

It is necessary to express one's debt to R. Gordon Wasson,whose writings, the most authoritative work on the mushrooms,informed me of their existence and told me much about them. "Wesuspect," he wrote, "that, in its integral sense, thecreative power, the most serious quality distinctive of man andone of the clearest participations in the Divine . . . is in somesort connected with an area of the spirit that the mushrooms arecapable of opening." R. Gordon Wasson and Roger Heim, LesChampignons halhlcinogenes du Mexique (Paris: Museum Nationald'Histoire Naturelle, 1958). From my own experience, I have foundthat contention to be particularly true.

Acad. Sci., March 14, 1957. Our interest [in psychotomimetic drugs], so far, has been psychiatric and pathological, withonly a hint that any other viewpoint is possible; yet our predecessorswere interested in these things from quite different points ofview. In the perspective of history, our psychiatric and pathologicalbias is the unusual one. By means of a variety of techniques,from dervish dancing to prayerful contemplation, from solitaryconfinement in darkness to sniffing the carbonated air at theDelphic oracle, from chewing peyote to prolonged starvation, menhave pursued, down the centuries, certain experiences that theyconsidered valuable above all others. The great William James endured much uncalled-for criticism forsuggesting that in some people inhalations of nitrous oxide alloweda psychic disposition that is always potentially present to manifestitself briefly. Has our comparative neglect of these experiences,recognized by James and Bergson as being of great value, renderedpsychology stale and savorless? Our preoccupation with behavior,because it is measurable, has led us to assume that what can bemeasured must be valuable and vice versa. During the twentiethcentury we have seen, except for a few notables such as Carl Jung,an abandoning of the psyche by psychologists and psychiatrists.Recently they have been joined by certain philosophers. Pavlov,Binet, Freud, and a host of distinguished followers legitimatelylimited the field to fit their requirements, but later expandedtheir formulations from a limited inquiry to embrace the wholeof existence. An emphasis on the measurable and the reductivehas resulted in the limitation of interest by psychiatrists andpsychologists to aspects of experience that fit in with this concept. There was and is another stream of psychological thought in Europeand in the United States that is more suitable for the work thatI shall discuss next. James, in the United States, Sedgwick, Myers,and Gurney in Britain, and Carl Jung in Switzerland are amongits great figures. Bergson is its philosopher and Harrison itsprophet. These and many others have said that in this work, asin any other, science is applicable if one defines it in Dingle'sterm, "the rational ordering of the facts of experience."We must not fall into the pitfall of supposing that any explanation,however, ingenious, can be a substitute for observation and experiment.The experience must be there before the rational ordering. Work on the potentialities of mescaline and the rest of theseagents fell on the stony ground of behaviorism and doctrinairepsychoanalysis. Over the years we have been deluged with explanations,while observation has become less sharp. This will doubtless continueto be the case as long as the observer and the observed do notrealize that splendor, terror, wonder, and beauty, far from beingthe epiphenomena of "objective" happenings, may be ofcentral importance. Accounts of the effect of these agents, ranging in time from thatof Havelock Ellis in 1897 to the more recent reports of AldousHuxley are many, and they emphasize the unique quality of theexperience. One or more sensory modalities combined with mood,thinking and, often to a marked degree, empathy, usually change.Most subjects find the experience valuable, some find it frightening,and many say that it is uniquely lovely. All, from Slotkin's unsophisticatedIndians to men of great learning, agree that much of it is beyondverbal description. Our subjects, who include many who have drunkdeep of life, including authors, artists, a junior cabinet minister,scientists, a hero, philosophers, and businessmen, are nearlyall in agreement in this respect. For myself, my experiences withthese substances have been the most strange, most awesome, andamong the most beautiful things in a varied and fortunate life.These are not escapes from but enlargements, burgeonings of reality.Insofar as I can judge they occur in violation of Hughlings Jackson'sprinciple, because the brain, although its functioning is impaired,acts more subtly and complexly than when it is normal. Yet surely,when poisoned, the brain's actions should be less complex, ratherthan more so! I cannot argue about this because one must undergothe experience himself. Those who have had these experiences know,and those who have not had them cannot know and, what is more,the latter are in no position to offer a useful explanation. Is this phenomenon of chemically induced mental aberration somethingwholly new? It is not, as I have suggested earlier. It has beensought and studied since the earliest times and has played a notablepart in the development of religion, art, philosophy, and evenscience. Systems such as yoga have sprung from it. Enormous efforthas been expended to induce these states easily so as to put themto use. Although occasionally trivial and sometimes frightening,their like seems to have been at least part of the experienceof visionaries and mystics the world over. These states deservethought and pondering because until we understand them no accountof the mind can be accurate. It is foolish to expect a singleexploration to bring back as much information as twenty of them.It is equally foolish to expect an untrained, inept, or sick personto play the combined part of observer, experienced and recorderas well as a trained and skilled individual. Those who have notaste for this work can help by freely admitting their shortcomingsrather than disguising them by some imposing ascription. This may seem mere nonsense but, before closing his mind, thereader should reflect that something unusual ought to seem irrationalbecause it transcends those fashionable ruts of thinking thatwe dignify by calling them logic and reason. We prefer such rationalizedexplanations because they provide an illusory sense of predictability.Little harm is done so long as we do not let our sybaritism blindus to the primacy of experience. especially in psychology. Psychoanalysts claim that their ideas cannot be fully understoodwithout a personal analysis. Not everyone accepts this claim,but can one ever understand something one has never done? A eunuchcould write an authoritative book on sexual behavior, but a bookon sexual experience by the same author would inspire less confidence.Working with these substances, as in psychoanalysis, we must oftenbe our own instruments. Psychoanalysis resembles Galileo's telescope, which lets one seea somewhat magnified image of an object the wrong way round andupside down. The telescope changed our whole idea of the solarsystem and revolutionized navigation. Psychotomimetic agents,whose collective name is still undecided, are more like the radartelescopes now being built to scan the deeps of outer, invisiblespace. They are not convenient. One cannot go bird watching withthem. They explore a tiny portion of an enormous void. They raisemore questions than answers, and to understand those answers wemust invent new languages. What we learn is not reassuring oreven always comprehensible. Like astronomers, however, we mustchange our thinking to use the potentialities of our new instruments. Freud has told us much about many important matters. However,I believe that he and his pupils tried illegitimately to extrapolatefrom his data far beyond their proper limits in an attempt toaccount for the whole of human endeavor and, beyond this, intothe nature of man and God. This was magnificent bravado. It isnot science, for it is as vain to use Freud's system for thesegreatest questions as it is to search for the galaxies with Galileo'shand telescope. Jung, using what I consider the very inadequatetools of dream and myth, has shown such skill and dexterity thathe has penetrated as deep into these mysteries as his equipmentallows. Our newer instruments, employed with skill and reverence,allow us to explore a greater range of experience more intensively. There have always been risks in discovery. Splendid rashness suchas John Hunter's should be avoided, yet we must be prepared forcalculated risks such as those that Walter Reed and his colleaguestook in their conquest of yellow fever. The mind cannot be exploredby proxy. To deepen our understanding, not simply to great madnessesbut of the nature of mind itself, we must use our instrumentsas coolly and boldly as those who force their aircraft throughother invisible barriers. Disaster may overtake the most skilled.Today and in the past, for much lesser prizes, men have takenmuch greater risks. How Should We Name Them? If mimicking mental illness were the main characteristic of theseagents, "psychotomimetics" would indeed be a suitablegeneric term. It is true that they do so, but they do much more.Why are we always preoccupied with the pathological, the negative?Is health only the lack of sickness? Is good merely the absenceof evil? Is pathology the only yardstick? Must we ape Freud'sgloomier moods that persuaded him that a happy man is a self-deceiverevading the heartache for which there is no anodyne? Is not achild infinitely potential rather than polymorphously perverse? I have tried to find an appropriate name for the agents underdiscussion: a name that will include the concepts of enrichingthe mind and enlarging the vision. Some possibilities are: psychephoric,mind moving; psychehormic, mind rousing; and psycheplastic, mindmolding. Psychezynic, mind fermenting, is indeed appropriate.Psycherhexic, mind bursting forth, though difficult, is memorable.Psychelytic, mind releasing, is satisfactory. My choice, becauseit is clear, euphonious, and uncontaminated by other associations,is psychedelic, mind manifesting. One of these terms should serve. Epilogue This, then is how one clinician sees these psychedelics. I believethat these agents have a part to play in our survival as a species,for that survival depends as much on our opinion of our fellowsand ourselves as on any other single thing. The psychedelics helpus to explore and fathom our own nature. We can perceive ourselves as the stampings of an automatic socioeconomicprocess, as highly plastic and conditionable animals, as congeriesof instinctive strivings ending in loss of sexual drive and death,as cybernetic gadgets, or even as semantic conundrums. All ofthese concepts have their supporters and they all have some degreeof truth in them. We may also be something more, "a partof the main," a striving sliver of a creative process, amanifestation of Brahma in Atman, an aspect t of an infinite Godimminent and transcendent within and with; out us. These verydifferent valuings of the self and of other people's selves haveall been held sincerely by men and women. I expect that even whatseem the most extreme notions are held by some contributors tothese pages. Can one doubt that the views of the world derivedfrom such differing concepts are likely to differ greatly, andthat the courses of action determined by those views will differ? Our briefs, what we assume, as the Ames demonstrations in perception*show, greatly influence the world in which we live. That worldis in part, at least, what we make of it. Once our mold for worldmaking is formed it most strongly resists change. The psychedelicsallow us, for a little while, to divest ourselves of these acquiredassumptions and to see the universe again with an innocent eye.In T. H. Huxley's words, we may, if we wish, "sit downin front of the facts like a child" or as Thomas Traherne,a seventeenth-century English mystic, puts it, "to unlearnthe dirty devices of the world and become as it were a littlechild again."**Mystic and scientist have the same recipe for those who seek truth.Perhaps, if we can do this, we shall learn how to rebuild ourworld in another and better image, for the breakneck advance ofscience is forcing change on us whether we like it or not. Ourold faults, however, persisting in our new edifice, are far moredangerous to us than they were in the old structure. The old worldperishes and, unless we are to perish in its ruins, we must leaveour old assumptions to die with it. "Let the dead bury theirdead" tells us what we must do. While we are learning, we may hope that dogmatic religion andauthoritarian science will keep away from each other's throats.We need not put out the visionary's eyes because we do not sharehis vision. We need not shout down the voice of the mystic becausewe cannot hear it, or force our rationalizations on him for ourown reassurance. Few of us can accept or understand the mind thatemerges from these studies. Kant once said of Swedenborg, "Philosophyis often much embarrassed when she encounters certain facts shedare not doubt yet will not believe for fear of ridicule."Sixty years ago orthodox physicists knew that the atom was incompressibleand indivisible. Only a few cranks doubted this. Yet who believesin the billiard-ball atom now? In a few years, I expect, the psychedelics that I have mentionedwill seem as crude as our ways of using them. Yet even thoughmany of them are gleanings from Stone Age peoples they can enlargeour experience greatly. Whether we employ these substances forgood or ill, whether we use them with skill and deftness or withblundering ineptitude depends not a little on the courage, intelligence,and humanity of many of us who are working in the field today. Recently I was asked by a senior colleague if this area of investigationlies within the scope of science and, if it does not, should notreligion, philosophy, or politics take the responsibility forit? But politics, philosophy, religion, and even art are dancingmore and more to the tune of science, and, as scientists, it isour responsibility to see that our tune does not become a deathmarch, either physical or spiritual. We cannot evade our responsibilities. So far as I can judge, spontaneous experience of the kind we arediscussing has always been infrequent, and the techniques fordeveloping it are often faulty, uncertain, clumsy, objectionable,and even dangerous. Our increasingly excellent physical health,with the steady elimination of both acute and chronic infections,the tranquilizers that enable us to neutralize unusual chemoelectricalbrain activity, our diet, rich in protein and, especially, B-complexvitamins whose antagonism to LSD I have already discussed-allof these, combined with a society whose whole emphasis is on materialpossession in a brightly lit and brilliantly colored syntheticworld, will make spontaneous experiences of the sort I have mentionedever fewer. As we grow healthier and healthier, every millimeterthat we budge from an allotted norm will be checked. I believe that the psychedelics provide a chance, perhaps onlya slender one, for homo faber, the cunning, ruthless, foolhardy,pleasure-greedy toolmaker to merge into that other creature whosepresence we have so rashly presumed, homo sapiens, the wise, theunderstanding, the compassionate, in whose fourfold vision art,politics science, and religion are one. Surely we must seize thatchance. *". . . the principle that what weare aware of is not determined entirely by the nature of whatis out there or by our sensory processes, but that the assumptionswe bring from past experience, because they have generally provedreliable, are involved in every perception we have."

AARONSON AND HUMPHRY OSMOND The Introduction to PSYCHEDELICS, The Uses and Implications ofHallucinogenic Drugs, edited by Bernard Aaronson and HumphryOsmond, Doubleday & Company 1970. Copyright Aaronson andOsmond. Any culture may be regarded as a ramification of a particulartechnology applied to the particular set of local conditionswithin which that culture is situated. The term"technology," as used here, refers to the entire set ofdevices, whether mechanical, chemical, or linguistic, by whichadaptations of individuals to their environments are enhanced.Plows, clubs, radios, airplanes, fertilizers, drugs, breakfastcereals, grammars, and concepts are each implements and instancesof technology, which influence and are influenced by one another.Some implements operate by directly altering the environment inresponse to the demands of the individual, as when we turn on anair conditioner on a hot day. Others operate by altering theindividual to meet the demands of the environment, as when we"make the last one for the road coffee." Still othersmay attempt to integrate the two, as when we read a book to gainknowledge that will help us in particular situations. All systems of technology have certain common characteristicsin terms of how they affect those who use them. They set up waysof looking at the world in terms of which new experiences can beencoded. One of the best illustrations of this is given in an oldJewish folk song in which the singing of a new cantor on theSabbath is heard by a tailor in terms of how one sews a suit ofclothes, by a cobbler in terms of making shoes, and by acarpenter in terms of cutting wood. Systems of technology focusattention on certain kinds of relationships and particular waysof conceptualizing those relationships. It is probably noaccident that the great Chinese book on time, the I Ching,with its emphasis on seasons and changes and on ways of adaptingto these and on the right time for initiating and carryingthrough action should have arisen as a vegetable oracle, theproduct of a farming people. Conceptualizations, once arrived at, interact to produce newconceptualizations, new technology, from which, once more, newconcepts and new needs may emerge. Television, for instance,derives as a concept from motion pictures and radio and, eventhough it was introduced only a comparatively short time ago, hasrapidly become a central part of homes at all levels of societyin our culture. Watching television has tended to produce a moreuniform culture through greater exposure to common stimuli, hasreduced the amount of time available for free interaction bymembers of any particular household, and has resulted in thecreation of such implements as "TV trays" and "TVdinners" to accommodate the need for more time around thetelevision set. Automobiles have made possible the movement tothe suburbs, the virtual end of public transportation in manyparts of our country, and a resultant increased dependency onprivate means of transportation. In its turn, this has produced amore mobile population, a proliferation of roads, a tendency tothink of distance in terms of units of time, the destruction ofthe countryside, and an increased need to deal with airpollution. Any technological innovation in any area expands to fill allthe analogous gaps to which it can be applied. The technology ofclubs developed into the technology of axes and hoes, and, inmodern America, into the technology of baseball. Anytechnological system has a degree of play that makes possible thedevelopment of new technologies, which may not be immediatelyuseful, but can become functional or can be combined to befunctional when the need arises. The technique for producinglight shows has long been available but remained essentiallyunused until the advent of psychedelic drugs produced its impacton a generation accustomed to TV diffraction patterns. The technology of drugs is one of the oldest technologies andprobably began when our ancestors browsed their way through theforests and found that, among the foods they sampled, someproduced interesting changes in how they felt, how theyperceived, and how they could accommodate themselves to theworld. Substances that alter consciousness are found in use amongprobably all the peoples of the world (Taylor, 1963). Inparticular, substances containing alcohol and caffeine seem to beused nearly everywhere, and hemp and its derivatives also seemwidely used. Substances whose main effect is to stop hunger are classed asfoods. Even though it is now customary to present an analysis ofthe chemical composition of many of the foods we eat on the sidesof the containers in which they are packaged, their action tendsto be studied in laboratories of nutrition rather than in thoseof pharmacology. The kinds of detailed study of effects onparticular structures and organ systems that have historicallycharacterized pharmacological study are rarely undertaken withfoods. Substances that increase conviviality or stimulate theindividual are often treated as foods if they can be eaten, or asmore like drugs (without usually naming them such) if they mustbe smoked. Alcohol, coffee, tea, and chocolate represent theedible class of these substances, as does cannabis and itsderivatives in many Moslem and Eastern countries. Cannabis andtobacco probably represent the principal common substancessmoked. The continuing agitation against the use of alcohol andcannabis by various groups in our culture suggests the anomalousposition of these kinds of substances on the food-drug continuum.The fear and anxiety over the moral and physical degradation thatmight result from enslavement to coffee, tea, and chocolate whenthese were introduced into Europe are another case in point. Itshould also be noted that many tobacco smokers often have troubleconceptualizing tobacco as a drug, for the term "drug"has developed very specialized meanings. Among the foods sampled by our ancestors, some sustained life,others destroyed it. Still others seemed to remove illness.Sometimes those foods that destroyed life could also sustain itand remove illness if administered in proper ways and in properamounts. It is hard to say when the division of edibles intofoods and poisons and into foods and drugs arose, for thedivisions already existed at the beginning of recorded history.Legends of the witch woman and the wizard and their herbs, or ofthe apple whose scent drives away disease are very old. Atechnology of drug use is found in all cultures along with atechnology of poisons, and the control of that technology isvested in individuals with priestly or semi-priestly functions,or in others with claims to special relationships with thesupernatural. As the amount of knowledge around the use of thehealing arts grew, the priesthood, which dealt in healing,gradually gave way to a more secularized group, with specializedtraining, called physicians. Another group claimed jurisdictionover the preparation of these substances and were calledapothecaries or, more recently, pharmacists. These experts knewwhich drugs to prescribe and when. It was also apparent thatthese substances could sometimes be dangerous when improperlycompounded or improperly used, so it was important to listen whenthey told you how to use the possibly dangerous substances inwhich they dealt. In addition, since they dealt in alleviatingsuffering, a "good guy" image was easy to come by. As aresult, a drug in this context became something that was used onthe advice of a physician, and that it was foolhardy to useotherwise. While a tradition of using minor remedies for things likecolds or warts existed, reasonable people left the control ofdrugs in the hands of the experts. Even patent medicines derivedtheir fundamental cultural status from the implied approval ofthese groups, or had to go back to their precursors, the medicinemen and shamans of primitive days. To this day, televisionadvertisements for patent medicines that will cure headaches,sinus congestion, or "tired blood" are delivered byfriendly, fatherly looking men in white coats. On the other hand,the development of modem research technology made possible anexpansion of the number of substances recognized as specificsagainst particular ailments and increased the range of illnessesand conditions for which drugs could be used. In particular, therealization that food-deficiency diseases exist, and thedevelopment of vitamin pills to be used as a food supplement,created a dynamic tension between the restricted use of drugs andthe use of pills as food. Subsequently, the modern development ofmood-changing drugs such as tranquilizers, and their promiscuousprescription by physicians to such a point that some minortranquilizers can now be purchased without a prescription,completed the breach. We became a pill-using culture, althoughthe earlier caution about the use of drugs remained as a naggingsense of guilt. Alongside the medically controlled and related concept ofdrugs, a second conception exists of drugs as substances thatproduce depressing but exotic sleep states to which the userbecomes easily addicted, to the exclusion of the claims andpleasures of ordinary life. In Homer's Odyssey, Ulyssesand his crew visit the Land of the Lotus Eaters, whoseinhabitants are addicted to a fruit that, when tasted, puts theuser into a sleep in whose dreams all thoughts of home andcountry are forgotten. In our country, in our time, when somebodysays he feels "drugged," he is generally referring to astate of depressed apathy. In contrast to this, we may oftenrefer to a situation in which we have been gratified as one inwhich we have been "fed." A product that does not sellis referred to in business as "a drug on the market,"but a new concept or a new perception may be "food forthought." It is a commonplace to hear how opium, theprototype for this conception, destroyed the initiative andcapacity for constructive activity of the people in many Easterncountries and kept them from the progress and well-being of theProtestant ethic. It is a fact, moreover, that China did fight alosing war to keep British enterprise from bringing in opium,because the rulers of China felt that the effects of opiumaddiction would enervate their population. For us, drugs are often seen as substances used in strange andalien cultures whose customs are the material from whichtravelogues are made and to which the intrepid traveler mayventure only at the risk of being debauched. The early writingson opium by Thomas De Quincy, and the accounts of hashishexperiences by Theophile Gautier and Fitzhugh Ludlow stress theexotic nature of the experience. Even Coleridge's famous poem KublaKhan, written from an opium dream, in which the legendaryruler builds a pleasure dome in Xanadu over a hidden sacred riverwhere women mourn for demon lovers and Abyssinian maids playdulcimers, bears out this aura of the strange. Drugs aresubstances that not only render us unable or unwilling tofunction in ordinary life, but make available exotic andforbidden landscapes. In these landscapes, the images ofnightmare from which we have fled since childhood, move and takeshape. This view of the dangerous nature of drugs is furtherbuttressed by the modern concept of "the drugaddict"---an individual so enslaved by his need to escape"reality," a euphemism for the disappointmentsattendant on the need to survive, that he seeks these dangeroussubstances to the exclusion of the more conventional activitiesthat keep society functioning. This immediately arouses the fearthat if one person finds "illegitimate" states soattractive, others will follow because of their inherent superiorpleasure-giving quality. The strictures by Louria (1966) on thehedonism of drug use emphasize this fear. Similar attitudes areexpressed in the fear and condemnation of homosexuals by manyperfectly adequate and well-adjusted heterosexuals, and in thehorror felt by some parents when they find their childrenmasturbating. The drug addict is seen as becoming less controlled and moreapt to express impulses that our society frowns upon, as his druguse continues. He is finally so taken over by his need, and sodebauched, and so unable to make his own way, that he is forcedto turn to crime to prolong a life that is now a threat to thesurvival of others. These negative images play an important rolewith respect to any substance labeled "drug" and notmedically prescribed or available in a pharmacy. It isinteresting to note that cough medicines containing codeine, anaddicting drug, are available without prescription in many of ourstates, and that, at least until recently, paregoric, whichcontains a small quantity of opium, was freely available withoutprescription for use with infants. That these concepts representan important aspect of the affective reaction to drug use isshown by the fact that campaigns against drug abuse in general,and the use of psychedelics in particular, have centered aroundappeals to these images. Psychedelics are the newest addition to drug technology in ourculture. While the use of many of these substances in their plantform is very old, their use in our culture is very recent, apartfrom minor experimentation by early scientists concerned withconsciousness, such as William James, Weir Mitchell, and HavelockEllis (DeRopp, 1957). Written descriptions of the use of hempdate from about 1250 B.C. Datura preparations are used in magicand witchcraft in many areas of the world. Amanita muscaria,the fly agaric mushroom, was not only probably used by theancient Vikings when they went into battle, but, according torecent evidence, may have been the legendary soma of the foundersof Hinduism (Schultes, 1969; Wasson, 1969). It is not possible tosay how far back the use of peyote, ololiuqui, or of Psilocybemexicana goes, for the records were destroyed by the RomanCatholic missionaries to the conquered people of Mexico in theirzeal for the welfare of the souls of their charges. The central property of any of the substances labeledpsychedelic is the enhancement of experience. In the anti-drugwritings in the popular and semi-popular press, psychedelics haveeven been condemned as offering "instant experience."They seem to step up the capacity of the organism to respond tofine gradations of stimulus input, to enhance response tostimulation at the upper and lower levels of perceptualresponding, and to break down the barriers imposed by thedifferent sensory avenues through which stimulation is received,in order to produce new perceptions, a greater frequency ofillusions, and, more rarely, hallucinations. Before Osmond(1957b) coined the word "psychedelic," they were morecommonly referred to as psychotomimetics or hallucinogens tostress their capacity to mimic psychoses or inducehallucinations. In contrast, depressants, such as alcohol and thebarbiturates, and narcotics, such as opium and morphine, reduceattention to stimulus input, although hypnagogic and dreamlikestates are possible with all of these. Stimulants, such as theamphetamines and caffeine, may enhance endurance, improve mood,and increase alertness and work capacity, but they do not promoteattention to the fine nuances of sensory experience as do thepsychedelics. The ability of the psychedelics to produce enhanced capacityfor experiencing, and for interrelating the data of experience,is central in understanding both their significance and theirpopularity. Very few books that deal with psychedelics fail toinclude individual protocols of such experiences. Metzner (1968),Ebin (1961), and Watts (1962) have published entire bookscontaining nothing but protocols of psychedelic experience.Huxley's great book The Doors of Perception (1954), whichprobably marks the beginning of the modern psychedelic movement,is also such a protocol from his famous initial encounter withthe Belle of Portugal rose to his final return to "thatreassuring but profoundly unsatisfactory state known as 'being inone's right mind.'" Timothy Leary's recent autobiographicalaccount of psychedelia, High Priest (1968a), is alsopresented in terms of psychedelic "trips." Indiscussing the use of psychedelics in therapy for variousemotional disorders, Hoffer and Osmond (1967) stress that LSD,psilocybin, and mescaline may all be equally effective. "Itis the experience, not the compound which induces it, which isresponsible." The stress on enhanced experiencing as the fundamentalcharacteristic of these substances leads, in the literature, to astress on the importance of the setting in which the drug istaken. In order for the enhanced capacity for experience createdby these substances to show itself, an adequate range of stimulimust first be available to be experienced. Administration ofpsychedelics under conditions of sensory deprivation seems toabolish most of the usual effects attributed to them (Pollard,Uhr, and Stern, 1965). Hoffer and Osmond (1967) stress theimportance of providing adequate environmental support to producethe kinds of experience required to produce change inpersonality. Alpert and Cohen (l966) also stress the need foradequate settings to provide psychedelic experiences. On the other hand, as the stimulus situations presented to thedrug taker increase in complexity, the variability of possibleresponses to those stimuli increases, especially when there isperceptual heightening. For this reason, along with the emphasison setting, a companion emphasis on set---the attitudes,motivations, preconceptions, and intentions that individualsbring to their experiences---has arisen. Mogar (1965a, 1965c) hassuggested that contradictory results in different experiments onthe effects of psychedelics on different functions can beaccounted for by considering the differences in set and setting.Leary, Litwin, and Metzner (1963) have suggested that the totaleffect of an exposure to psilocybin could be accounted forentirely in terms of set and setting. Krippner (1965) has pointedout that the psychotomimetic reactions of the early studies withLSD occurred within the context of a laboratory in which theindividual taking the drug was surrounded by white-coatedphysicians who were looking for evidence that an analogoussituation to schizophrenia was being produced. Hyde (1960) showedthat when psychedelics were administered to a variety of normalsubject groups under conditions in which they were confrontedwith impersonal, hostile, and investigative attitudes on the partof others, the subjects responded with devaluative distortionsand hostility. Flexibility, familiarity, and the presence ofothers with a common culture ameliorated the psychotomimeticaspects of the reaction, while rigidity, unfamiliarity,non-acceptance, and absence of others with a common cultureexacerbated them. While few would seek enhanced experience if that experiencewere negative, the ability to enhance the capacity for experienceis an important reason for the increased popularity ofpsychedelics. People tend to do what they are good at.Well-co-ordinated, well-muscled individuals are apt to beinvolved in athletics; those with good number ability are apt toenjoy working with numbers. One of the best predictive devicesfor vocational success is the Strong Vocational InterestInventory, which provides scores based on the similarity of anindividual's interest patterns to those of individuals who aresuccessful in their chosen fields. Virtually everyone has thecapacity to react, judge, and seek out experience. People willoften go on long and arduous journeys just to see things, or willbuy recording equipment, radios, or television just to providethemselves with stimulation. They will register for difficultcourses of instruction with no demonstrable practicalconsequences for themselves, in order to enhance theirexperience. This is not unique to man, for animals show a similarpattern of experience seeking (Welker, 1961). In human societies,the theater, the church, sports spectaculars, the pomp andceremony of parades, the rides, color, and glitter of carnivals,all are institutions created to meet the need for enhancedexperience. We are built to process stimuli, and an importantpart of living is seeking out stimuli to be processed. Thepopularity of psychedelics is not only a function of this generalcharacteristic of stimulus seeking, but it also suggests therelative infrequency of bad experiences resulting from their use,unless we wish to posit masochism as an equally fundamentalcharacteristic of biological adjustment. Because psychedelics focus attention on individual experience,some important social consequences arise from their use.Individual experience is on the one hand unique to theexperienced and on the other characterized by great transpersonalcommonality as one goes deeper into the self (Aaronson, 1968d).In spite of the scientific validity of the behaviorist critiquethat private experience is not available for scientificobservation, for each of us, as individuals, our own experienceshave a veridicality shared by few other things in this world. Wenot only seek experience, we respond in terms of our experiences,and accord a special hearing to those who can "speak fromexperience." Immediate experience is of greater consequenceto the individual experiencing it than any promise of future goodor ill made by a personal or impersonal authority figure. Anyparent who has had to take a child to face a shot administered tohim by his kindly pediatrician can testify to this. Any smokerwho lights up contentedly as he reads the warning on hiscigarette pack also shows its validity. When individual experience is emphasized, the generalizedverbal formulas for societal control based on hoary andlong-unquestioned precepts become open to question as they arefiltered through the individual consciousness. Variousinstitutions maintain their authority by means of symbols andconcepts that evoke traditional emotional reactions, and themore-rational verbal responses function as unconsciousrationalizations of these reactions. That is, many logicalarguments turn out to be simply elaborations of illogicalemotional biases. These traditional emotional biases areinculcated from the earliest age at home, in the schools, and inthe propaganda organizations for children, such as the BoyScouts, the Girl Scouts, the YMCA, and other groups. Similarinstitutions exist in Communist and Fascist societies, exceptthat there the conditioning tends to be more frenetic andcompulsive than in our own. The attention to the ways in whichthese symbols can affect us makes plain the inherent illogic ofconventional wisdom. Once the question of "Why, indeed,should I respond in this way?" has been posed, many of thestructures of society will tumble if answers cannot be foundrooted in the existential being of the questioner. Many of the consequences of this kind of questioning can beseen not only among the hippies and in Leary's concept of societyas a collection of television stage props (1968b), but in thekinds of questions posed by those of our young people who havenot obviously taken on the extreme styles of life representedeither by the hippies or by Leary. The use of marijuana issufficiently widespread among our young adult groups thatattitudes developing from attention to one's own consciousnesshave pervaded their style of approach to the world. Before thequestion of "What career shall I choose?" can beanswered, the question of "Why should I choose acareer?" must be settled. Before one can agree to fight forflag and country, the existential meaning of flag, country,death, killing, freedom, and a host of other concepts must beconsidered. The source of power is not seen as being conferredfrom on high, but as arising from the behavior toward the powerwielder of those over whom power is exercised. This attitude hastremendous implications with regard to the kinds of behavior thatwill be displayed toward the traditional holders of power and thetraditional methods of displaying power. The development of similar emphases on personal revelation andpersonal consciousness at various points in the history ofChristendom led to the formation of many of our existingProtestant denominations and the replacement of the old Catholicconcept of an ordained priesthood with a new concept of thepriesthood of all believers. The so-called "generationgap" is a mirage that results not from the traditional needof the young to make their way in a world of already establishedpeople nor from any traditional traits of impatience or idealism,although all these may be factors, but from differing amounts ofattention to the importance of individual experience. Because ofthe greater willingness of young people to try new things, theconsciousness-changing chemicals had their greatest effect alongpeer-group lines. Because of the fact that each individual consciousness islocated in a body, increased awareness of the body and of ourfunctions as biological organisms seems to occur in thepsychedelic-user population. This is not the kind of stress onthe body traditionally associated with weight lifting or theoverdevelopment of body parts that give a good male or femaleimage, but desire for a well-functioning body that is pleasant toexperience. This has led to an interest in hatha yoga and in taichi, the Indian and Chinese systems of exercise whose aim is notmuscular development, but peace, coordination, and good bodilyfunctioning. All bodily functions and bodily needs are more aptto be accepted and, even more important, respected. The ancientverbal taboos limiting sexual behavior have been weakened by thenon-verbal nature of psychedelic experience. Excretory functionsare accepted without embarrassment. Preferences develop forsimple foods with more concern about how these may affect thebody, although there is some tendency for this concern to turn tocultishness. Clothes are no longer used to hide the body, but toemphasize the body as the source of experience. The greateropenness with regard to the physical self has been accompanied byrelaxation of the taboo against touching other people and beingtouched by them, an event of overriding social consequence inchanging the character, intensity, scope, and availablepossibilities in any interpersonal relationship. Beyond the perception of the body itself, the enhanced sensoryexperience has called attention to the pleasures and insightsthat can be obtained directly from sensory experience. Lightshows and modern rock music reflect some of the visual andauditory experiences produced by psychedelics. Aldous Huxley(1956) has pointed out the luminous intensity of colors found in"the antipodes of the mind," and this is mimicked byDay-Glo paints and the eerie glow of colors under black light.The greater sensitivity to color reflections, color shadows, andafterimages, especially as they appear reflected on glossysurfaces like skin, has led to the modern fashion of bodypainting. Along with the perception of oneself as a biologicalorganism, with its consequent emphasis on the simple and natural,there has been an increased awareness of the complexity andbeauty of natural phenomena. This has been further elaborated bythe fact that, with many of the psychedelics, the retinalstructure of the eye itself enters into the perception, as Kluver(1966) has pointed out. This has complicated the drive forsimplicity with a preference for the baroque. The resultingdynamic tension appears in all forms of psychedelic decoration,music, literature, and art. Masters and Houston (1968) have shownthis well in their recently published book on psychedelic art,which runs the gamut from simple meditative expressions towelters of clashing stimulation designed to make the viewer leavehis senses through overstimulation of his senses. Going deeply into one's own experience leads to insightsbeyond those experienced when the focus of attention is on whatis experienced rather than the mode of experience itself. Theappearance of reality is no longer taken at face value, but isseen as an interaction with the perceptual apparatus of theperceiver. This means that the usual existential primacy giventhe world around us, probably because we are built to processinformation coming to us from the outside, gives way to anequality of perceives and perceived, so that the perceptionitself becomes the primary datum in a conscious sense, as it hasalways been without our realization. This is, indeed, one of thegoals of many meditative systems, and meditation as such hasbecome a popular activity among the psychedelic subgroup andthose influenced by them. Indeed, movement within the self awayfrom its more-surface manifestations inevitably invokes religiousimagery (Masters and Houston, 1966; Aaronson, 1968a), althoughimages invoking religious feelings may be possible at all levelsof consciousness. The sense that depth is expanded, common inpsychedelic experiences, is like the environmental conditionsmost commonly associated with mystical experience, and mysticalexperiences can be produced by experimentally providingexperiences of enhanced depth (Aaronson, 1967d). Movement within reaches the level of archetype and myth andmay transcend these to a point of ultimate mystical union. Thearchetypes may be an elaboration of current material featured inthe concerns of the popular press, as Barron (1967) has pointedout. They may derive from early impressions and concerns fed byother technologies in our culture. Tom Wolfe (1968), forinstance, has pointed out the prevalence of imagery from thecomic books dear to children in the late thirties and earlyforties in the group centering around Ken Kesey. They may derivefrom fundamental perceptions of our own structures and modes offunctioning. Barron (1967) has noted, "an experience ofChrist, i.e. of Christ free from the institutional embodimentknown as Christianity, is common to many psychedelic"trips." Christ on the cross may then be understoodsimply as "consciousness impaled on the human form, mindhung to die on body to expiate our voluntary participation in theworld's heavy materialism." This manner of thinking andperceiving, the concentration on archetype, the sense of anindwelling, immanent God, and the interest in meditation havecorrespondingly created an interest in those forms of religionthat stress these notions: Hinduism, and Tibetan and ZenBuddhism. Psychedelic experience is fundamentally religious, asany experience of life taken as an experience of life must be.Braden (1967) has pointed out that the fundamental thrust ofpsychedelic experience is religious and its fundamental challengeis to the forms of organized religion. It is one of the forcescontributing to the ferment in contemporary Christianity that ispresently leading one of the oldest and most tradition-bound ofChristian churches to reevaluate its forms, its structure, andmany of the engrafted beliefs of its development. The development of any new major innovation in technologyaffects profoundly the life and structure of the society in whichit occurs. The development of psychedelics is such a majorinnovation, which promises revolutionary changes and is, in fact,already producing them. Psychedelics may have a potential impacton society equivalent to that of the machine, which in settingoff the Industrial Revolution, created much of what we nowconsider our "natural" and "traditional"styles of life and forms of organizing society. At the time ofthe beginning of the Industrial Revolution, those dispossessed bythe new forms blamed the machines and tried to wreck them in theLuddite rebellion. Our modern Luddites are not the dispossessed,but those who exist at the very center of the power structure.The alteration of values, the questioning of rules by those whohave had psychedelic experiences, create much consternation,often by their very own children, among individuals who have madetheir way by those rules and under the value system of theexisting society. In addition, the negative implications of theconcept "drug," noted earlier in this discussion, arenot without their effects. Confronted by danger, each carries out his social function.The mass media simultaneously point at the wonders of psychedelicexperience and view them with alarm. Psychologists,psychiatrists, and sociologists, whose business it is to findabnormality in deviance, find abnormality in deviance. Governmentagencies introduce regulations, lawmakers make laws, andpolicemen police. The upshot of all this activity is that it isnow almost impossible to carry out legitimate research withpsychedelics. A large user population has developed that usesbootleg drugs, sometimes containing dangerous impurities, andalmost certainly producing revenue for organized crime. Drugs arenow used by individuals who, under a system of controlled accessto them, would probably not have been exposed to them and run therisk of injuring themselves. It is difficult to set up safeguardsfor the proper use of the major psychedelics when this use isillegal. One segment of our population exists under conditionsreminiscent of prohibition, while the other looks on with alarm.A crisis in confidence has been created that cuts acrossgenerational lines. A great many people who normally would belaw- abiding are placed in the position of outlaws, with markedimplications for their further relationships to society and itsinstitutions. It is beyond the scope of this paper to do any more thanoutline briefly some of the implications of psychedelictechnology and some of its associated problems. The rest of thisbook is devoted to filling in the picture in more detail. At thepresent time, the repressive attitudes toward this new technologyare so strong that its effects can only show themselves instrange and aborted forms. Perhaps the situation will be eased topermit more-open and controlled development of what is nowclandestine and uncontrolled. Hopefully.

Towardthis end I submitted to the Government this spring a request fora PUBLIC hearing. The text of this request follows: HEARING CLERK DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION AND WELFARE ROOM 5440 330 INDEPENDENCE AVENUE S.W. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20201 LSD and the other psychedelic (mind-manifesting) chemicalsrepresent a new fact for our society. These chemicals, the mostpowerful mind-altering substances known to man, are presentlybeing researched for their therapeutic potential with alcoholics,drug addicts, autistic children, psychoneurotics, and prisoners,as well as for their potential to increase man's creativity inproblem-solving and their value to the military. Significantresearch has also demonstrated that these chemicals are capableof altering the perception of terminal cancer patients in such away as to alleviate their fear of dying. The Native AmericanChurch continues to use peyote as a medicine in its religiousceremonies. In addition to these "authorized" uses ofpsychedelic chemicals, there is, as a result of increasedrestriction on who is considered a "qualifiedresearcher" with psychedelics, a significant increase in"private research," i.e., research not authorized bythe U.S. Government. The data from a variety of public andprivate sources indicate that this extralegal activity is notlimited to any specific segment of society. Among these privateexplorers are numbered religious leaders of all faiths,scientists in both the natural and social sciences, medical menspecializing in general practice as well as psychiatry; writers,artists, performers, musicians, educators, students, journalists,psychic researchers, businessmen, housewives, mystics,philosophers, lawyers, socialites, engineers, and"beatniks." When these chemicals have been ingested with suitablepreparation and in a supportive setting, by far the majority ofthese psychedelic researchers have reported that theirexperiences with the chemicals have enriched their lifeexperience, helped them to feel a greater sense of satisfaction.For some of these people the experience has provided thisincreased satisfaction spiritually, for others through helpingtheir marriages to achieve new depth and meaning, for others intheir professions, and for the majority through their ability toexperience each day more fully with a sense of increasedawareness. There is at the present time no statistical evidence thatpsychedelic chemicals are either dangerous or physicallyaddictive. In terms of suicides and psychosis, psychedelics usedin currently recommended dosages are considerably safer than, forexample, a four-year liberal arts education As far aspsychological risk (post-experience depressions, etc.) isconcerned, most of this can be prevented by education andpreparation of the researcher as well as design of the setting. At present in our society there is no existing socialinstitution which provides a citizen with the opportunity toutilize psychedelic chemicals to explore his own brain orconsciousness in order to increase his awareness should he sodesire, be it for spiritual, educational, therapeutic, oresthetic reasons. The potential for mankind in these chemicalscannot be realized under existing governmental policies. Thus thepresence of the psychedelic chemicals as well as the growingpublic interest in serious exploration with them poses a realneed for CREATIVE LEGISLATION. It is to be hoped that our visionand our commitment to growth of the individual and the societywill prevent us from legislating out of existence one of man'sgreatest chances to expand the boundaries of his mind, hisindividuality, and his culture. Lyndon Johnson speaks of "The Great Society." It isinteresting to speculate whether such a society as he envisionshas a place for a genuinely new institution which couldsignificantly alter the institutions of the society itself. Since 1963 many of us who are deeply concerned about thewelfare of mankind have attempted to interest the Government in agenuinely open-minded search for a constructive program regardingwho should use and who should control psychedelics. We havesuggested that Government-controlled privately supported centersbe created under limited licensing (a policy presently used withradioisotopes) which would provide a suitable setting andassistance for any responsible member of our society to carry onexplorations of his own consciousness with psychedelics forwhatever purpose he chose. Not only has the Government failed toseriously consider this proposal, but every indication is thatthe restrictions are mounting, and the Government is attemptingto ignore the uniqueness of the situation by treating psychedelicchemicals as similar to other drugs. It will become increasingly difficult with the implementationof new and more stringent restrictions for free and open researchto proceed with these chemicals in the United States. Accordingto the new Drug Abuse Control Amendment, an individual canpossess psychedelics for the use of himself or a member of hishousehold but cannot legally purchase or receive the chemical.The results of such control without simultaneously makingprovisions for the opportunity for responsible citizens toresearch their own consciousness legally will be predominantlyunfortunate, leading to, for example: (1) an increase in themanufacture of homemade psychedelic chemicals having little or noquality control; (2) an increase in the paranoia connected withpsychedelic chemical usage which in turn will increase the dangerof negative psychological reactions to the experience; (3) anincrease in the number of responsible and useful citizens who,because of their deep conviction about the value of psychedelicresearch, will continue such research and thus become criminalsin the eyes of law; (4) an attempt by the Government to enforcean obviously unenforceable law because of the numbers of citizensinvolved, thus re-creating the effects of prohibition, duringwhich time the Government enforcement agencies lost respect inthe eyes of the populace; and (5) a possibility of losing whatmight be a key for man to free himself of the limitation of hisown present vision which has caught him so deeply in alienationand paranoia, be it at the personal or national level. It is in view of the situation as outlined above that wehereby request that the Commissioner of the Food and DrugAdministration hold public hearings concerning the inclusion ofpsychedelic chemicals as listed in the Federal Register, January18, 1966, under the Drug Abuse Control Amendment. We furtherrequest that these hearings be addressed to the followingquestions: 1. Does the inclusion of psychedelic chemicals under the DrugAbuse Control Amendment unnecessarily curtail an individual'srights provided by the First Amendment of the Constitution?Specifically we wish to explore the implications of this Act forreligious freedom. 2. Is there indeed sufficient evidence to warrant Governmentcontrol of psychedelics on the basis of real danger to the publicsafety? 3. What is a "qualified research investigator" inthe field of psychedelic chemicals? 4. Are medical practitioners, in view of the nature of theirtraining, suitable supervisors for the administration ofpsychedelic chemicals? 5. Were the Commissioner to bring a chemical under thecontrol of his department based on a categorization of thechemical as producing "ecstasy" or "impairment ofacquired social and cultural customs," (Federal Register,December 18, 1965), would he not be setting a dangerous precedentconcerning ideas and experiences which could significantlycontribute to the growth of the society? 6. Has the Commissioner heard sufficient testimony concerningthe sociological, psychological, educational, philosophical, andspiritual implications of controlling psychedelics to determinehis decision to include these chemicals within the Act, on asufficiently broad cultural basis? 7. Does one have the right to decide for himself whether hewants to explore his own consciousness or change the nature ofhis own consciousness? 8. If, with the knowledge that the ingestion of psychedelicchemicals by some people leads to negative reactions, anindividual chooses to ingest a psychedelic agent in order toexplore his own consciousness, does the Federal Government havethe right to interfere with such a person who is willing toassume the risk? Is the Government by so doing assuming the rightto protect an individual from himself? 9. Does the Food and Drug Administration have the right toinitiate punitive action in connection with psychedelic chemicalswhere the individual has not harmed himself or society? Does theFood and Drug Administration have the right to impose punishmentfor effects of altered consciousness, or is the criminal law andpunishment only reserved for actual wrongdoing and harm tosociety? 10. Does the end justify the means? Can enforcement of theFood and Drug Administration law under consideration occurwithout gross invasion of the right of privacy? How will aviolation come to the attention of the Food and DrugAdministration? Will the willing possessor of psychedelicchemicals report a violation of this law? 11. Is it desirable for a law to be enacted that creates anestimated 100,000 to one million criminals? 12. Will the Food and Drug Administration be brought to thesame level of respect as the Prohibition Unit of the FederalGovernment during the Prohibition era? Will the promises offeredby the Prohibition Unit that "if we can have stifferpenalties and more Prohibition Agents, alcohol will be stampedout" be offered by the Food and Drug Administration when itfinds itself unable to "stamp out" the prohibitedsubstance? If the Prohibition Unit failed in enforcement of theVolstead Act and the Eighteenth Amendment despite every effort,will not this similarly unenforceable and corruption-breedingFood and Drug Administration law meet with a similar fate? 13. Finally, we request that the hearing be addressed to thematter of inclusion of another "drug" as fulfilling thecriteria for inclusion as "hallucinogen" (FederalRegister, December 18, 1965) under the Drug Abuse ControlAmendment. This drug is commonly referred to as"alcohol." We wish the Food and Drug Administration tojustify how it can impose controls upon psychedelic chemicalsbecause of "dangers" and "abuse" in view ofthe comparative statistics concerning the "dangers" and"abuse" attendant to the use of alcohol.

AARONSON The Concluding Chapter of PSYCHEDELICS edited by Bernard Aaronsonand Humphry Osmond, Doubleday & Company 1970. © Aaronsonand Osmond. Those older men and women exercising structural and moral authority(Paterson, 1966), often called collectively the Establishment,have been alarmed by psychedelics for rather less than five years.Their attitude might be described in the terms Aneurin Bevan usedfor an old man approaching a young bride: ". . . fascinated,sluggish, and apprehensive." The impetuous young, however,always at the heart of any anti-establishment movement, rush inwith all the rash ardor of Romeo and Juliet. Medical men, thoughless worried about morals or legality, are properly concernedwith the health of the young lovers, and have been debating, notwithout acrimony, whether the entrancing psychedelic bride isa delicious and sexy houri or a poxy doxy. This fascination of older folk with psychedelics and the climateattached to them becomes evident in the propaganda devoted tothem by many government agencies, professional associations, andother interested people. While this has been aimed ostensiblyat discouraging the young from taking or continuing to take thesesubstances, the means employed seem unlikely to achieve such anend. The cause of pornography has frequently been well servedby those whose strident warnings abjured others from seeking what,until then, they had hardly noticed. Public men have, quite unwittingly,by their ignorance, evasion, and downright lies, egged on theirchildren and grandchildren to explore these experiences. It appearssometimes as if they were trying to discredit themselves in theeyes of the young. It may not be their intention, but it seemsto be their achievement. Our connection with this intergenerational controversy began aboutsixteen years ago, when one of us, after a troubled night, wasstanding at a table stirring a glass of water in which silverywhite crystals were dissolving with an oily slick. Would it beenough or too much? He was uneasy: he would be disappointed ifnothing happened, but what if the mescaline worked too well? Supposehe poured half of the full glass into an adjacent flower vase?He did not relish the possibility, however remote, of findinga small, but discreditable niche in literary history as the manwho drove Aldous Huxley mad. His fears proved groundless. Althoughthe bitter chemical did not work as quickly as he had expected,in due course it etched away the patina of conceptual thinking. Much has happened since that smogless May morning in Hollywood.Neither Aldous Huxley nor he would have predicted that TheDoors of Perception (1954) was going to have such an immenseimpact on an ever-increasing number of people. Those substances,then known as hallucinogens or psychotomimetics, and which helater called psychedelics (Osmond, 1957b), have, for good or evil,become far more widely known and no longer the concern merelyof the specialist and scholar. They are part of our vocabulary,a source of both vexation and inspiration. Less than ten years after the senior author's spring visit toHollywood, Pandora's box was unexpectedly opened. Since then,members of the Establishment have been sitting on the lid of theempty box, unaware that this posture is both undignified and futile.It is the fate of establishments to be taken by surprise in spiteof ample and repeated warnings. Once they have become aware thatsomething is amiss, they often act precipitately, with littleforethought or caution, and transform a minor inconvenience oreven possible benefits into catastrophe. There was plenty of warningthat psychedelics were apt to be of interest to people and alsoto become more available so that this long-standing human tastecould be indulged more easily. It required no gift of prophecyto recognize this, for history shows that man has been an inveterateexperimenter with chemicals, usually derived from plants, thatmake him happier or livelier, or alter his perceptions and awareness.In his sumptuous and magnificent book Soma: Divine Mushroomof Immortality (1969), for example, R. Gordon Wasson, themycologist-scholar, has shown convincingly that the Rig Veda,one of the oldest and greatest of man's religious works, devotedabout one tenth of its collection of over one thousand psalmsto celebrating the plant god Soma. Wasson, with wonderful persistence,caution, and intuition, makes a good case for soma being the mushroomAmanita muscaria, or fly agaric, the classic toadstoolof the birch forests of the world. Psychedelics are a very ancientand influential human interest. What has the Establishment been doing about them? If one had listenedonly to its members from a recent president on down, one mighthave been convinced that psychedelics had no future at all becauseof the development of ever-growing and increasingly specializedlaw- enforcement agencies to remove the nuisance permanently.In the past year or two, the tone has changed somewhat, alongwith other overoptimistic estimates. On the other hand, if onelistened only to supporters of the psychedelic movement, one mightbe led to suppose that an age was borning in which from earliestchildhood, and possibly the prenatal state, we would all be exposedto the delights and virtues of wholly beneficial substances. Thefacts do not support either of these extreme positions, but extremepositions rarely depend on facts. Long before the official Establishmenthad asked itself what sort of problem it might be facing, legislationwas being prepared, bills hurriedly passed, statements of an alarmingkind made, and vigorous legal and police action taken. This wasnot admirable, but it was no more admirable of the psychedelicmovement to imply that there were scarcely any dangers attendanton these remarkable substances and that we should all hasten alongthe road to the "joyous cosmology," taking anythinganyone offered, and trusting it would be enough, and not too much. The Establishment's posture is not difficult to understand, forit is that of all establishments everywhere when faced with innovation.It consists in saying, "No, you don't. Father (or Grandfather)knows best. Be good and do as you are told, for if you don't,it will be the worse for you." Before planning and passinglegislation or developing new policing procedures, it might seemprudent to assess the effectiveness of such actions, and considerwhether police activities might not have unintended consequencesas bad as or worse than the evils to be remedied. This is especiallytrue in the United States, where prohibition, with all its admirableintentions, merely provided a golden opportunity for gangstersto become multimillionaires and spread the habit the legislationwas intended to curb. The most likely outcome of prohibition inthe early twenties was that, since many people did not feel thatdrinking alcohol was immoral, even though it might have becomeillegal, the law would be widely subverted. Criminals would thenhave an opportunity to provide these disaffected citizens withtheir needs. The police would be liable to be corrupted, the lawitself brought into disrepute, and because most people would cometo feel that prohibition itself is a farce, they would tend toconsider that the law is a racket, too. This is a high price topay for an unattainable social benefit. Other legislation aimed at preventing people from taking substances,such as psychedelics, that they want to take should surely beexamined in this context. As we have noted, this is an interestthat men have pursued for millennia with great persistence andin a variety of ways, ranging from self-inflicted tortures andausterities to taking dangerous substances. Drugs are only oneof many possible ways of achieving these experiences, and areby no means the most objectionable from a medical viewpoint. Fromearliest times, psychedelics have been regarded as strange andsacred and have been part of many great religious ceremonies.They are certainly as enduring and interesting for mankind asalcohol, although, since the rise of modern agriculture, alcoholhas been probably easier to obtain. On the other hand, cannabishas been used for many centuries. It may not be a simple matterto head off people's interest in psychedelics; it has not beeneasy to head off interest in alcohol. Had it been possible toprevent people from making alcoholic drinks, prohibition wouldhave been feasible. As it was, everyone could make his own fermenteddrink in the bathtub, and before long, the well-meant laws tocurb drinking had become meaningless and socially harmful. In 1966, the government did not seem to have considered theseearly experiences much, and appeared to believe that by preventingSandoz from manufacturing and distributing LSD to research workers,the problem would soon be resolved. Indeed, one of us was toldby an aide of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy that the ex-AttorneyGeneral of the United States was surprised to learn "thatpreventing Sandoz from selling LSD (which, of course, they werenot doing, but giving it away only to accredited researchers)would not resolve the problem. "Even though Senator Kennedywas a young, active, and unusually well-informed man, he was ignorantof this, although he quickly acquired the necessary information.The elderly men who govern most countries apparently failed toask or have impressed upon them the questions facing those whowish to control the use of psychedelics. During World War II, British and American intelligence servicesbriefed their generals by first giving an opinion as to what wasmost likely to happen, followed by a statement of what they consideredthe best possible outcome in the circumstances, and finally, theworst possible construction. The general officer, knowing theconclusion of his intelligence service, could then make his owndecision, basing it on optimism, pessimism, or a middle way, ashe saw fit. Suppose it had been our task to advise statesmen onthe future of psychedelic substances, what would we have toldthem, assuming that we knew that they were already more or lesslimited to a policy of control? From this point of view, the bestpossible thing that could happen would be for people to lose interestin psychedelics once and for all, and for the sources of supplyto dry up forever. The worst that could happen for the Establishmentwould be for supplies of psychedelics to become greater and easierto make in a climate of sustained or increasing interest, thusproducing a situation resembling prohibition at its worst. How would these two extreme estimates relate to the most likelyoutcomes It would be surprising if an interest so long sustainedever disappears completely. Indeed, our age is one in which interestin these matters seems more likely to increase. Today, at leastin North America and Europe, there are larger numbers of highlymobile young people, many of them fairly well-to-do, than everbefore in history. Most have been reared with less severity thanprevious generations and have largely escaped the terrible blowsthat death, illness, starvation, and poverty frequently inflicton the young. They are sufficiently uncowed by the world to behighly critical of how it is run, and have the energy, time, andopportunity to express dissatisfaction and explore new ways ofimproving matters. Their education has taught them how to uselibraries and other modern information-retrieval systems. Manyof them became interested in psychedelics in the early sixties,and while this preoccupation may fluctuate, it seems unlikelythat it will disappear completely. The interest of the Indiansin drugs survived the full force of the Spanish Inquisition, andit is unlikely that even the severest legislators intend to emulatethat mighty institution in policing their children and grandchildren. In addition, with regard to the control of the substances themselves,more have been discovered and rediscovered during the past decadeand a half than in any similar period in history. It seems likelythat more will be found during the next ten years. Some of thesewill be discovered in plants and others synthesized. Every discoverymakes it easier to suggest not only new places in which to lookfor active substances, but also new ways of making them. We predictthat within the next twenty-five years, and perhaps sooner, simpleprocesses will be discovered by which reasonably safe psychedelicscan be made in any kitchen or basement with materials availablein stores, pharmacies, and fields or gardens. Some believe thebest way to avoid these dangers would be to stop all researchon psychedelics. In our opinion, this would be objectionable,since these substances have great interest for psychology andpsychiatry and since there is, as we have shown here, growingevidence of their therapeutic usefulness. It would also not succeedin stopping the clandestine experiments in the synthesis or useof these substances, for forbidden fruits not only taste sweeter,but develop an esoteric interest. Presumably this "occult"science, because it would be "illegal," would not bepublished in official scientific journals. A sort of undergroundscience would develop, which at least would be deplorable, andmight be very dangerous. In our imaginary briefings, the statesmen would be told that themost likely outcome during the next decade would be that the interestin these substances would be maintained, though it is likely tofluctuate from year to year. Although a number of new psychedelicswill be discovered, there is no convincing evidence that the eraof "bathtub" psychedelics has yet arrived, allowingthem to be made in ease and safety at home. Should this occur,the resulting situation will resemble that of prohibition. Statesmen must surely ask themselves whether it is wise to inventnew crimes or inflate misdemeanors into matters of great importance.The roster of criminal law is large; by adding new laws that aredifficult to enforce, respect for the law may be decreased. Certainkinds of new laws may be expensive luxuries that societies inthe course of change simply cannot afford. We believe that theinterest in psychedelics will be maintained in the foreseeablefuture. If police and similar agencies devote much of their energyto controlling the substances, the overt interest may become lessconspicuous. Prosecuting people does not necessarily change theiropinions, but may invest forbidden activity with glamour and makethose undertaking it discreet. It is said that crime has beenincreasing greatly in recent years, and one wonders whether thisis a propitious time to add a whole new series of crimes to theburden of an already overladen police and magistracy. Already there are laws of such severity on the statute books thatjudges, juries, and police often shy away from using them, although,from time to time, unlucky people receive very harsh punishment,which seems unfair both to them and to their contemporaries. Itseems unlikely that occasional severities will do much to changethe general picture. However, in politics as elsewhere, men haverarely shown a sense of history or adequate foresight, and thesame legislators who promise a tough line against psychedelicstalk blithely about reducing the voting age to eighteen. If thesestatements are sincere, and they plan to continue their oppositionto psychedelics when they have reduced the voting age, one wonderswhether we are not becoming tired of politics. In our opinion, the Establishment has behaved as establishmentsusually do, bolstered with the authority they possess by virtueof their social and political position. They have not been anyless admirable than members of the psychedelic movement who claimthat as a result of their experiences they have a deeper knowledgeof the human heart and a greater understanding of the meaningof things. By their claims, their actions must be judged by ahigher standard than the actions of the Establishment, which doesnot make such claims. If one asks whether mind-expanding experienceshave increased the ability of members of the psychedelic movementto understand the views and fears of their elders more compassionatelythan they feel they themselves have been judged, we believe theverdict must be "not proven." Aldous Huxley once urgeda leading figure in the psychedelic movement to remember thatit is "important to do good stealthily." His excellentadvice has not always been heeded. If indeed insights have beenacquired as a result of psychedelic experience, they should beused for the general good rather than for personal ends. In this controversy, medical men have tended to be ranged on theside of the Establishment. This is understandable enough, forthey are frequently closely associated with it, and often amongits members. Unfortunately, they sometimes use their enormousmedical authority to justify prejudices deriving not from medicalknowledge, but from the social and moral climate in which theyhappen to live. This has occurred repeatedly throughout history,and the same error has been made by some of the most distinguishedmedical men. An excellent example of this is provided by the case of HenryMaudsley, one of the most enlightened psychiatrists of his day,and for whom a leading mental hospital in London is presentlynamed. In his fine paper "Masturbational Insanity,"E. H. Hare (1962) notes that Maudsley wrote, "In the lifeof the chronic masturbator, nothing could be so reasonably desiredas the end of it, and the sooner he sinks to his degraded restthe better for himself, and the better for the world, which iswell rid of him." Hare comments on this, ". . . thebesetting sin of the psychiatrist [is] a tendency to confuse therules of mental health with morality." Maudsley's views werepart of the conventional wisdom of his age. Even as late as 1892,the Dictionary of Psychological Medicine described the effectsof masturbation as "moral and mental shipwreck, the wholenature is deteriorated.... mental faculties become blunted....The miserable wretch would commit suicide if he dared, but rarelyhas the courage . . . and sinks into melancholic dementia."Writing in 1911 on the treatment and prevention of this grievouscondition, Ivan Bloch stated, "In the treatment of masturbation,the methods of the older physicians who appeared before the childarmed with great knives and scissors and threatened a painfuloperation or even to cut off the genital organs may often be usedand often effect a radical cure." Psychoanalysts, too, wereinvolved in this nonsense. Ernest Jones, the biographer of Freud,for instance, wrote in 1918 that neurasthenia derived from excessiveonanism and seminal emission (Comfort, 1967). Masturbation was of no interest to medicine until about 1720,following the publication in 1710 of a book called Onania,or the Heinous Sin of Self-Abuse, to tout a patent medicine.Indeed, in 1644, masturbation was recommended as a remedy against"the dangerous allurements of women." After the publicationof Onania, the negative view taken up by medical men and educatorsbecame the source of some of the most harmful iatrogenic miseries,exceeded only by the great nineteenth-century pandemic of bleeding.Right up to the 1930S, in both England and the United States,extraordinary garments, a combination of straitjacket and chastitybelt, were sold by makers of surgical and medical instrumentsto curb "the deadly vice of onanism." What relevance has this to psychedelics? Medicine, in its views,is in tune with the morality of the age in which it is practiced,and indeed, has been more or less identified with morality formillennia. Medical men have to choose a middle course to avoidoveridentifcation with the establishments of their day. Medicalmen who went along with the Nazi race theories are one dismalexample of how current social values can destroy medical ethics.In the case of masturbation, physical and psychological injurywas inflicted on at least six generations of children and adults.Panic and terror spread among parents who were urged to be everalert to spot young masturbators. Children became morbidly preoccupiedwith this attractive but deadly vice which excited the grownupsto such frenzy. Perhaps we are about to indulge in yet another of these medicomoralautos-da-fé. The sequence of events is easy to spot. First,a few medical men associate themselves with a particular moralviewpoint that they consider has some medical importance. Theysoon find evidence, sometimes dubious, to confirm their convictions.Using this evidence, they begin to suggest solving the moral problemby medical means. In the psychedelic context, users have beeninfringing on the contention of the medical establishment thatany pharmacological substances used on human beings lie withinits bailiwick. The psychological changes resulting from drug useare those older folk frown upon and sometimes find repugnant andfrightening, in contrast with such acceptable social tranquilizersas alcohol or barbiturates. There is also the possibility thatthose who use psychedelics might be injuring themselves or theiroffspring. The recent impassioned discussions of the possibleeffects of LSD on chromosomes is paralleled by similar discussionsover masturbation. It was stated with the utmost confidence thatnot only would the secret vice result in the collapse and insanityof those who practiced it, but should they be unfortunate enoughto survive to adulthood, their children would suffer for theirsins. There was no evidence for this, but it did not prevent menof the highest integrity from stating that it was undoubtedlyso. There are real dangers associated with the psychedelic substancesknown today. These dangers are of many kinds and call for concernfrom medicine and its allied sciences. However, before discussingthese dangers and how they might be alleviated, it may be wellto remind those who urge medical men to make public pronouncementsto frighten and dismay the young that, given the morality of medicine,its place in society, and the age of the experienced medical man,the doctor is rarely the best person for the task. He is liableto exaggerate such dangers as exist and is apt to aid and abetextreme measures, in keeping with the morality of the day, thatmay not alleviate the sufferings of the victims of the immoralcondition and may even make it worse. Psychedelics are liable to arouse moral indignation, because emotionsare always likely to be deeply stimulated when someone else isindulging in new pleasures that may alter social values, especiallywhen the users are young and rash and often brash as well. Medicinehas a duty not to make this confusion and uncertainty any worse.Physicians are not police. Their duty is to inform the publicas truthfully as they can, without excessive bias, resoundingmoral statements, or validation of punitive actions carried outas treatment. Medicine must avoid becoming a precipitate partisanin complex moral and social issues such as those posed by themodern advent of psychedelics. After such perplexities, it is tempting to leave the solutionto the reader's ingenuity. Yet authors customarily give theiropinion and venture at least a few steps beyond the thresholdof their ivory tower. The uses and dangers attending these substancesmust be discussed accurately and dispassionately. Men like Dr.Stanley Yolles, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health,do not seem convinced that "drug abuse," which includesthe unauthorized use of a variety of psychedelics, will be eliminatedin the foreseeable future. (1)If this is indeed so, strenuous efforts must be made to reducethose dangers attendant on clandestine use. We require a varietyof social strategies rather than freezing in a catatonic postureand boasting that this immobility is firm resolution. The verybrief banning of LSD-25 research in 1966 was a classic exampleof precipitate, unintelligent action springing from high governmentlevels. Since then, some research has been restored to a limiteddegree, but expansion has not been greatly encouraged, nor isan atmosphere of panic and politicking conducive to clear thinking,planning, and diligent, long-continued inquiry. Legitimate, ratherthan amateur and bootleg, research is necessary; yet one of themost gifted and distinguished researchers in the country was notable to obtain permission to do this sort of work. Others, too,have been discouraged by the sluggishness of the various bureaucraciesthat must be consulted. The muddled and ambiguous situation regarding the effect of LSD-25on chromosomes (2)might call for restriction of research with this particular drugto those people for whom such changes, if they do indeed occur,would be of comparatively little importance. Other psychedelics,which have never been implicated in this way, could be used morewidely. Subjects for LSD might include some of the several millionafflicted by severe and chronic alcoholism, patients sufferingfrom intractable pain in fatal illnesses (Kast, 1964a), and olderpeople still curious for new experience to enlarge their understandingof themselves, others, and existence. While not everyone mightchoose to die with his mind stimulated by LSD, as did Aldous Huxley(Huxley, L. A., 1968), rather than dulled by morphine, such matterscall for careful consideration, for each of us owes God a death.It is folly to restrict and hamper research in all directionsbecause it may be dangerous in some. If damage to chromosomesshould be proved, and this has not yet been done, some substancesmay be less harmful than others, and it may be possible to discoverprotective measures. As a number of medicines in regular use arealso suspect, and since some virus diseases and certain radiationsproduce similar changes, inquiries here would serve a wider purpose.Indeed, because of the possibility of chromosome-damaging substancesin various medicines and foods, it would be prudent to inquireat once into such protective substances. For instance, it hasbeen shown (in animals) that the teratogenic effect of thalidomide(Frank et al., 1963) can be prevented by greatly increasing theintake of niacin (vitamin B3). It is not known if this protectiveeffect extends to humans, but if it does, the thalidomide tragedy,in which so many babies were deformed, might have been simplyand cheaply avoided. Many years ago, Carl Jung (3)told one of us that by the middle years of life, childhood experiencehad usually done its worst and became of lessened importance asa source of intrapsychic distress. Queen Elizabeth I put it toher godson, Sir John Harrington, who invented the water closet,"When thou dost feel creeping time at the gate, these foolerieswill please thee less." She also reflected, "The daysof man's life are plumed with the feathers of death." Asthe years pass by, many men and women become more concerned withthe purpose and meaning of life, rather than with the drive tosucceed in it. This is an important area of inquiry for psychedelicresearch. Just as important, and at present receiving just as little attention,is our need to explore ways to help people prepare themselvesfor the rapid, all-pervasive, social and technological changescharacteristic of our times. In terms of science and technology,as compared with previous ages, many of us have lived throughthe equivalent of centuries of change. This torrent of changeis itself anxiety provoking, for there are no structures to handlethe kinds of change that change the structures themselves. Fewmoralists seem to have noticed yet that the progress of medicinehas made it harder for us to reflect upon death and so savor lifeto the full. To come to terms with both life and death, each mustbe measured with the cold eye of the reflective mind; change mustbe faced. Until about half a century ago, everyone everywhere was raisedin the ever-present shadow of death. The autobiographies, biographies,and histories of forty years ago show that those plumed featherswere never far away. Life and death were inseparables, the subjectof gossip and conversation. Many people were preparing themselvesfor their own deaths all their lives, for, unhampered by insurancestatistics, they saw death as ever present. Death seems to havebecome taboo today and has taken that place of secrecy from whichsex has just been freed. This exchange of prisoners seems hardlyworth while. It is usually possible to abstain from sex, shouldone want to; death allows no abstentions. As a Ghanaian truckdriver put it, "Death takes no bribes." A generation has grown up in whose life death is an unfamiliarand unnatural event, almost an affront. Their experience doesnot countenance illness for which nothing can be done. But deathhas only been postponed, not defeated, and has dominion over peoplewho have scarcely dared speak his name in polite company. Ourforebears linked holy living and holy dying, and considered thetwo an art. In a society such as ours, which has become almostidolatrous about living indefinitely, it is becoming bad tasteto discuss death. Our position is not unlike that in Victorianlove stories, in which the authors managed to write about loveand passion with few open references to sex7 although its absencemade its presence all the clearer. Those concerned with the religious aspects of psychedelics shouldmake special efforts in this direction. Many members of the Establishmentare in their middle and later years, and there is little doubtthat they recognize that they "owe God a death," inspite of the efforts of their physicians and surgeons. Researchinto these matters should be pursued with ardor, for while therisks are small, the rewards are likely to be great. This stillleaves the question of whether these substances have ill effectson the young and whether such ill effects can be much reduced,easily corrected, or completely avoided. Since controlling themanufacture, distribution, and use of psychedelics is still uncertain,although their containment seems to be possible, at least forthe moment, even this might break down during the next few years,as we noted earlier. If Victor Gioscia (1969) is correct, and there is an LSD subculture,the dangers, particularly to those under thirty, require verycareful consideration. Leaving out chromosome damage, perhapsthe most dramatic misfortune is the development of a schizophreniformillness. There is no doubt that this can happen, though it isnot clear how often it does. Certain myths current among someyoung drug takers increase the danger. One of the most unfortunateis that the appropriate remedy for a bad trip is another one,frequently with a larger dose than that which produced the firstone. This notion is on a par with the alcoholic slogan of havinga hair, or even the tail, of "the dog that bit you."The sensible response to a bad trip is not to have another, butto seek competent advice and guidance without delay. Some people,who are clearly developing schizophrenia and have disturbancesof perception (Hoffer and Osmond, 1966a) combined with usuallydepressed mood changes, with anxiety and sometimes thinking difficulties,take psychedelics because they have heard, or hope, that theywill help. The most probable outcome is a severe and prolongedbad trip, or sometimes the precipitation of a more-severe andacute illness. If these dangers were more widely known and understood,many young people would avoid trying to treat themselves by thesedesperate means and avoid much unhappiness and distress. A number of simple and effective ways of exploring and measuringperceptual anomalies, including the HOD (Hoffer and Osmond, 1961;Kelm, Hoffer, and Osmond, 1967) and EWI (El-Meligi, l968a, 1968b;El-Meligi and Osmond, in press) tests already exist. By meansof these and similar instruments, and by improving public knowledgeabout schizophrenia, it should be possible to diagnose and treatit far earlier and more successfully than usually happens today.Delaying treatment or aggravating the condition with mixturesof impure and often unknown chemicals in inept attempts at self-treatmentonly makes things worse. However, by no means all, or even most,who sample the bewildering array of often dubious substances saidto be psychedelic become gravely ill or likely to be so. Officialpropaganda paints a uniformly gloomy picture, which paradoxicallyincreases rashness by its exaggeration. This same kind of overstatementwas used to discourage masturbation, sex, drinking, dancing, smoking,using make-up, primping, and other disapproved activities. Theresults have been unimpressive. However, even if it were shownthat there were few physiological objections to young people takingpure and reliable psychedelics except for those with a tendencyto schizophrenia, it does not follow that all controls shouldbe removed. Each one of us must learn his own culture before he can eitheralign himself with its values or object to them in a manner likelyto produce constructive change. In most cultures, the attainmentof this is symbolized by the accordance of certain rights, suchas the right to marry, hold property, vote, go to war, receivethe death penalty, and other positive and negative awards withheldfrom children and those not sufficiently acculturated. In somecultures, ceremonies take place to mark entry into adult status,and ritual markings may also be applied in order to indicate thestatus of the new adult. Psychedelics taken before the stabilizationof knowledge about cultural norms, because of their capacity toalter perceptual constancy, might result in a reduced capacityor wish to internalize the already fluctuating and fragmentingvalues of our industrial society. The Establishment, by its hastyand apparently not fully enforceable ban on these substances,seems to have worsened matters by making them symbolic of intergenerationaldifferences. Since the mistake has already been made, what can be done? Societiesthat have sought and used psychedelic experience, however achieved,have nearly always had some kind of initiation ceremony, oftenof a religious kind, aimed at focusing expanded experience ina way that will enhance the participant's identification withand appreciation of his own society. In the United States at present,only indigenous Indians are permitted a religion employing psychedelics,and they have achieved this only by much stubborn courage. Surelybona fide religious groups interested in these matters who areprepared to conduct themselves in a manner in keeping with safetyand public decency, should be encouraged and supported. They arelikely to serve a valuable social function in the future. Eventhe cynical who are not wholly myopic can understand that bannedand persecuted religions frequently spread more quickly and becomemore attractive in times of change. Persecution, even with thegood intention of preserving health, is liable to have unintendedconsequences. In his morality Island, Aldous Huxley (1962)discussed these matters and illustrated them with the learning,perceptiveness, wit, and delicacy in which he had few rivals. Mankind's interest in the psychedelic experience is unlikely tolessen with increase in leisure. This gives us a greater opportunityto be concerned not only with survival, but with the quality ofthose human relationships that are the stuff of life. Wasson (1969)shows in his great book that this is one of mankind's oldest interests.In the years that lie ahead, new drugs, although there will probablybe many more of them, will not, we think, be the focus of greatestinterest. Already various forms of hypnosis, learning-theory applications,and electronics that evoke and reproduce these experiences arebeing explored. Those young people who are alert to them and interestedwill learn how to use them, and some may be doing so even now.If this happens, the Establishment will have to decide whetherit disapproves of the chemicals producing the experience or theexperience itself. Very few of those dealing with these matterslegally, scientifically, or politically seem to have concernedthemselves with this critical issue. Medically, the non-drug methodseliminate many of the current objections to the psychedelic experienceas a hazard to health. The social problems, however, especiallythose of acculturation, would not necessarily be greatly changed. If such capacities, however induced, become widespread, theirimpact is likely to resemble some massive mutation. Perhaps thisis necessary if we are to adapt to that new world that we arebuilding with such a strange mishmash of cunning, inspiration,apprehension, and folly. The sociological, psychological, political,and other consequences of psychedelic experience, however induced,occurring in the majority or even a substantial minority of apostindustrial population, is likely to affect most of us farmore than a few space jaunts for carefully selected heroes andheroines. The record is merciless: practical men of sound senseare nearly always wrong about the future, though never lackingin certainty. While the winds of change strum to gale force aroundus, they perform their ostrich acts and proclaim that they haveeverything under control. But the gale does not blow itself outbecause of their rhetoric, and to survive, we need to set a coursethat carries us into the future. Some years ago one of us wrote(Osmond, 1957a): . . . these agents have a part to play in our survival as a species,for that survival depends as much On our opinion of our fellowsand ourselves as on any other single thing. The psychedelics helpus to explore and fathom our own nature. We can perceive ourselves as the stampings of an automatic socioeconomicprocess, as highly plastic and conditionable animals, as congeriesof instinctive strivings ending in loss of sexual drive and death,as cybernetic gadgets, or even as semantic conundrums. All ofthese concepts have their supporters and they all have some degreeof truth m them. We may also be something more, "a part ofthe main," a striving sliver of a creative process, a manifestationof Brahma in Atman, an aspect of an infinite God immanent andtranscendent within and without us. These very different valuingsof the self and of other people's selves have all been held sincerelyby men and women. I expect that even what seem the most extremenotions are held by some contributors to these pages. Can onedoubt that the views of the world derived from such differingconcepts are likely to differ greatly, and that the courses ofaction determined by those views will differ . . . ? . . . I believe that the psychedelics provide a chance, perhapsonly a slender one, for homo faber, the cunning, ruthless, foolhardy,pleasure-greedy toolmaker, to merge into that other creature whosepresence we have so rashly presumed, homo sapiens, the wise, theunderstanding, the compassionate, in whose fourfold vision art,politics, science, and religion are one. Surely we must seizethat chance.... And so it stands today. [1970]. We predict, to use the Iron Duke'sphrase to Creevey, that it will be "a nice-run thing: thenicest-run thing you ever saw...." (1) Yolles, Stanley F. Speech quoted inHospital Tribune, Monday, June 16, 1969. (Back) (2) Today (July 1969) reports of chromosome changes are bewilderingto those not experts in this field. The various conflicting statementssuggest that the science of studying chromosomes requires an artas great as that needed to interpret Rorschach inkblots. In thatfamous and often valuable test, the non-expert must rely on hisown estimate of the reliability of the particular person who administeredand reported on the test. Great difficulties arise when men ofgood repute publish findings that seem, at least to the naive,to be diametrically opposed and irreconcilable. There is a dangerthat, because of reports in the press based on earlier studiesthat suggested unequivocal damage to chromosomes, some peoplewho were frightened away by this information will now decide thatthere is no danger whatever. It may even be thought that thiswas another trick like that deplorable episode in Pennsylvania,where it was reported with considerable circumstantial detailthat a number of young men had gazed at the sun under the influenceof LSD-25 and were permanently blinded, suffering grave retinaldamage. This proved to be false. Thus are credibility crevassescreated. (Back) (3) Jung, C. Personal communication to H. Osmond.

THE ROAD TO ELEUSIS Acting on an insight into the true nature of the Mysteries of Eleusis, R. Gordon Wasson sought the collaboration of Albert Hofmann and Carl A.P. Ruck, a classical scholar specializing in Greek ethnobotany. Closely coordinating their research, the three scholar-scientists first offered documentation on the religious rites at an International Conference on Hallucinogenic Mushrooms in 1977. These astonishing findings, given here in a much expanded version, leave little doubt that the ancient secret of Eleusis has at last been unveiled.

The ban on practically all research and therapy was soon forced upon the rest of the world by international treaties and also, no doubt, by covert pressure from the CIA and other U.S. government agencies. LSD and the other psychedelic drugs were classed as "Schedule 1" substances, supposedly having no medical value or recognized uses. Yet a significant body of scientific literature of the time indicated quite clearly that psychedelic drugs most certainly did have valuable uses in both therapy and pure research. Work that had been going on for more than a decade in Canada, for instance, had shown LSD psychotherapy to be the most effective treatment for alcoholism ever devised. Other studies had begun to show similar effectiveness for treatment of addictions, personality disorders, and a whole range of conditions. A review of the pertinent scientific literature of the time is of great importance today, for a general review of the whole situation of the War on Drugs is increasingly leading to calls by important and influential individuals for a serious re-evaluation of that policy, if not an outright reversal leading to complete legalization of "drugs of abuse". A close scrutiny of the basis and justification for the War on Drugs is revealing not only inconsistencies, but gross deception, blatant lies, and the worst kind of propaganda used to institute and promote that War. The recognized therapeutic applications of cannabis, for instance, are still being resisted by Drug Warriors in spite of evidence that would long ago have been sufficient to get government approval had cannabis been a "new drug" invented by a pharmaceutical company. Yet cannabis remains a Schedule 1 substance. The following essay is the introductory section of a paper published in 1970 that reveals a similar, if not even greater ignorance in the current official attitude toward therapeutic use of the psychedelic drugs. The authors are noted scientific researchers who had been working with psychedelics for many years. Their work, like that of many others, was brought to an abrupt and premature conclusion by the anti-drug hysteria which still today, perhaps more than ever, is doing far more to poison Western Civilization than any sort of "drug abuse" could possibly do. TOWARD AN INDIVIDUAL PSYCHEDELIC PSYCHOTHERAPY by ROBERT E. L. MASTERS AND JEAN HOUSTON * Widespread therapeutic use of LSD-25 and similar psychedelicdrugs did not begin until the 1950s. By 1965, there had appearedin scientific journals more than two thousand papers describingtreatment, of thirty to forty thousand patients, withpsychedelics (Buckman, 1967). Since 1965, the literature hascontinued to grow and now includes book-length works as well asthe shorter reports published in journals and anthologies. Yetspokesmen for the American psychiatric establishment continue totell the public that there is no evidence to demonstrate thevalue in therapy of psychedelic drugs. Reports of therapeutic successes have come from hundreds ofpsychotherapists working in many of the countries and cultures ofthe world. The psychedelic drugs have been used as"adjuncts" or "facilitating agents" to avariety of existing psychotherapeutic procedures. Some effortshave been made to develop new, psychedelic therapies specificallygrounded in the drug-state phenomena and the new models of thepsyche that have been suggested by the psychedelic experience. The diversity of the approaches to therapeutic use ofpsychedelics makes the evidence supporting their value fortherapy all the more impressive. Individuals and groups oftherapists of various persuasions have worked with one or more ofan ever-expanding family of psychedelic drugs and with a greatmany drug combinations. Dosages administered have variedenormously-in the case of LSD, anywhere from 10 to 1500mcg ormore. The psychedelic treatment has been considered as consistingof from one to well over one hundred drug sessions. In general, therapists working with small doses-such as 25-50mcg of LSD-do so only to facilitate conventional therapy, mostoften psychoanalysis. Such doses may heighten suggestibility andfacilitate recall, association, and emergence of unconsciousmaterials. This type of treatment might involve weekly sessionsthat continue for months or even years. When the very massive dose is administered-LSD: 750-1500mcg-the intent is to achieve the therapeutic result in a single,overwhelming session. The patient's values are changed andpersonality otherwise altered by means of a transcendental-typeexperience akin to a religious conversion. This type of treatmenthas been used mostly with alcoholics. Other therapists work with a "moderate" dose-LSD:150-400 mcg. Exact dose is individually specified on the basis ofthe patient's body weight, drug sensitivity (if that can bedetermined ), and personality factors. The dose should besufficient to allow for a full range of psychedelic response; atthe same time, the patient should not be overwhelmed or madeconfused or unable to communicate effectively. A brief therapy,one or a few sessions in a few weeks or months, is the aim. Types of conditions repeatedly stated to respond favorably totreatment with psychedelics include chronic alcoholism, criminalpsychopathy, sexual deviations and neuroses, depressive states(exclusive of endogenous depression), phobias, anxiety neuroses,compulsive syndromes, and puberty neuroses. In addition,psychedelics have been used with autistic children, to make themmore responsive and to improve behavior and attitudes; withterminal cancer patients, to ease both the physical pain and theanguish of dying; and with adult schizophrenics, to condense thepsychosis temporarily and to help predict its course ofdevelopment. Almost all therapists reporting these successes have statedthat the incidence of recovery or significant improvement wassubstantially greater than with other therapies used by them inthe past. The treatment typically required much less time and wasaccordingly less costly for the patient. Treatment with psychedelics has most often been described asineffective in cases of hysterical neurosis and hysteria,stuttering neurosis, infantile personality, and long-termneurotic invalidism. Despite reported successes, compulsivesyndromes, criminal psychopathy, and depressive states are alsomentioned as contraindicated. The risks frequently have beenconsidered too great for paranoids, severely depressed persons,outpatient psychotics and prepsychotics, and those with a historyof suicide attempts or who may be currently suicidal. However, aswe have previously suggested (Masters and Houston, 1966),psychedelic therapy may be indicated in cases where suicide seemsprobable and imminent. By his being enabled to die symbolicallyand then be reborn, the patient's need to die may be subsequentlyeliminated. That psychedelic drugs have value for psychotherapy hasusually been most vigorously challenged or denied by therapistswho have done no work at all with the drugs. Lack of adequatecontrols to allow more-objective assessment frequently ismentioned. However, it is very hard to devise fully satisfactorycontrols where such drastic alterations of consciousness areinvolved. Some veteran workers with psychedelics believemeaningful controls to be impossible. On the other hand, what oneresearch team regards as adequate double-blind conditions hasbeen achieved by administering a light dose of LSD (50 mcg) tothe control group, while the experimental group received 450 mcg.The small dose produced definite changes in consciousness but didnot permit a full-fledged psychedelic reaction (Unger, et al.,1966). Other charges from opponents of psychedelic therapy haveattributed bias and excessive enthusiasm to workers with thedrugs. Certainly, some of the early papers were extravagant, astends to happen with new therapies. But the time has long passedwhen psychedelics could be hailed as a panacea; and it should beremarked that the bias of the advocates only rarely approachesthat of some "distinguished" critics. Some of thesecritics seem ideologically and emotionally threatened bypsychedelic therapy. This has been especially true ofpsychiatrists heavily committed to psychoanalysis. Psychedelicsemerge at a time when analysis is increasingly under strongattack. Much of the opposition to the drugs is thusunderstandable, but also unjustifiable. Finally, psychedelic therapy has been assailed as toodangerous. Very definitely, the evidence does not bear this out;and in fact, when the drugs are administered by those therapistsand researchers who are most effective, the "dangers"are negligible. This is borne out by studies involving manythousands of patients and experimental drug subjects.(1) (1) For example, Pollard, J., Uhr, L, and Stern, E.(1965): no"persistent ill effects" in experiments with eightysubjects over a five-year period; Masters, R. E. L., and Houston,J. (1966): no psychotic reactions or unfavorable after-effects in206 sessions over a combined fifteen years of research; Unger,S., et al. (1966): one adverse reaction in 175 cases treated, andthat one "readily reversible"; and Cohen, S. (1960): inone thousand LSD administrations to experimental subjects, lessthan one in one thousand psychotic reactions lasting overforty-eight hours. In therapy patients, per one thousandadministrations, there were 1..2 attempted suicides, 0.4successful suicide, and 1.8 psychotic reactions. The resultscompared favorably with incidence of complications followingelectroshock treatments in common use. As compared to almost anyother therapy, LSD seems outstandingly safe when properly used.

Dutton, publisher, New York 1977 copyright 1977 by Grof & Halifax LSD patients who experienced profound feelings of cosmic unityfrequently developed a negative attitude toward the states ofmind produced by intoxication with alcohol and narcotics. In theSpring Grove studies, where the number of LSD sessions wasrestricted, there was a definite tendency among both alcoholicsand heroin addicts to discontinue their habit following a singlehigh-dose LSD session. In a more open-ended treatment situationin the Psychiatric Research Institute in Prague, where it waspossible to administer serial LSD sessions, complete workingthrough of the perinatal material resulted in several instancesof lasting abstinence and deep restructuring of the alcoholic'sor addict's personality. The insights of these patients concerning the nature of theirhabits resembled those of persons with suicidal tendencies. Afterthey had discovered and experienced feelings of cosmic unity intheir sessions, they realized that the state they had really beencraving was transcendence and not drug intoxication. Theyrecognized a certain superficial similarity and overlap betweenalcohol or heroin intoxication and the unitive feelings activatedby LSD, and began to see that their desire to seek these drugswas based on confusing these two conditions. The elements thatthese states seem to have in common are the diminution ordisappearance of various painful emotions and sensations,emotional indifference toward one's past and future, and anundifferentiated state of consciousness. On the other hand,however, many essential characteristics of the unitive state arenot part of the experience of intoxication by alcohol ornarcotics. Instead of inducing a state of cosmic consciousness inits entirety, these drugs produce a caricature that seems closeenough to mislead the individual involved and seduce him or herinto systematic abuse. Repeated administrations then lead tobiological addiction and damage the user physically, emotionally,and socially. After the experiences of ego death, abuse of alcohol ornarcotics as well as suicidal tendencies are seen as tragicmistakes due to an unrec ognized and misunderstood spiritualcraving for transcendence. The presence of strong feelings ofthis kind, as improbable as they might seem to those familiarwith the behavior patterns and life- styles of addicts andalcoholics, can be illustrated by statistics from psychedelictherapy. In the Spring Grove research, alcoholics and heroinaddicts had the highest incidence of mystical experiences of allthe studied groups, including neurotics, mental healthprofessionals, and individuals dying of cancer.

Copyright Aaronson & Osmond. Introduction Alcoholics Anonymous, the great self-help group-therapymovement, is the only established treatment for alcoholics. Untilmuch more is known about the personal (biochemical andpsychological), familial, and social factors that contribute toalcoholism, so it will remain. Most new therapies are merelyadjunctive to AA and will continue to be so until it is shownthat they have therapeutic value when used alone. In my view,psychedelic therapy is best used as a preparation for AA. When Bill W. and Dr. Bob founded AA, alcoholism had not beenaccepted as a disease, either by society at large or by themedical profession. Society considered it a moral problem, butfound itself confronted with an interesting dilemma, for only asmall proportion of the total drinking society drank excessively.No moral sanctions were required for the majority, who eventuallymade social drinking an integral part of the culture. The majority who remained moral drinkers could not understandwhy a minority became intemperate or alcoholic. Moral sanctionswere applied on the premise that excessive drinking arose fromdefects of character, defects of will, and defects in society.These sanctions included education, persuasion, incarceration,and banishment. Unfortunately, the most stringent measures hadlittle permanent effect, and the proportion of the drinkingsociety (a concept developed by Dr. H. Osmond) remained thesame or increased. Medicine also considered alcoholism anon-disease. The founders of AA introduced the medical model first toalcoholics, later to society, and finally to the medicalprofession. This concept was very appealing to alcoholics becauseit gave them a satisfactory explanation for their misfortunes. Ifthey were sick and not evil, then they might expect the same sortof treatment they would receive if they developed pneumonia ordiabetes. Bill W. and Dr. Bob also introduced the concept ofallergy, which thirty-five years ago was incorporated intomedicine as a new group of diseases. (1) But AA insisted that alcoholism was more than a physicalillness. It also carried strong personal responsibility. Analcoholic could not be censured for being an alcoholic, but hecould be for doing nothing about it. Society resisted the idea that alcoholics are sick, since itgot no guidance from a reluctant medical profession. Doctorsexpect diseases to be more or less definable, to have treatmentthat may be ineffective but must be in common use, and to have apredictable prognosis. When they became convinced that AA didhelp large numbers of alcoholics remain sober, they graduallyaccepted alcoholics as patients. Even now, the majority ofhospitals are extremely reluctant to admit alcoholics who aredrunk, and many doctors dread seeing them in their offices.Eventually AA forced the profession to accept the fact thatalcoholism, which has been estimated to afflict 5 per cent of thepopulation, is a disease. This marked the beginning of the finalsolution to the problem. For, having accepted the diseaseconcept, doctors were challenged by the enormous problems, and,in a matter of a few years, several major therapeutic discoverieswere made. The newer adjunctive therapies developed for alcoholism may bedivided into the psychological and the biochemical.Psychotherapy, deconditioning therapy, and psychedelic therapyare examples of purely psychological therapy, while sugar-freediets for relative hypoglycemia, mega vitamin B3, megascorbicacid, and adrenocortical extracts (or extracts of licorice) areexamples of pure chemotherapies. Psychedelic therapy is the only therapy that has preparedalcoholics to become responsible members of AA, when previouslythey had been unable to do so. Psychedelic Therapy We must distinguish sharply between psychedelic reactions andthe means for inducing them. Failure to understand thisdistinction has led to several futile researches, bestexemplified by the study of Smart and Storm (1964), which waswidely circulated in an extreme form before publication of thewatered-down version. Psychedelic therapy refers to a form of psychotherapy in whichhallucinogenic drugs are used in a particular way to facilitatethe final goal, which for alcoholics is sobriety. The drugs maybe mescaline, LSD, psilocybin, and many others, as well ascombinations. It is therefore trivial to test the effect of LSDor other hallucinogens on alcoholics in such a way that there isno psychedelic reaction. In fact, these trivial experiences haveled to trivial data, as reported by Smart et al. (1966), whoclaimed that a group of ten alcoholics given LSD did not differin outcome from a group of ten given another psychoactive drug.Close examination of their report shows that no therapy wasgiven, nor was there any encouragement of discussion of problems.The experience was not psychedelic, but was more in the nature ofan inquisition, with the subject strapped to the bed, pretreatedwith dilantin, and ill from 800 mcg of LSD. Since no investigatorhas ever claimed that LSD used in this way does have anytherapeutic effect, this experiment suggests that LSD used withno therapeutic intent or skill is not apt to help. One of thesubjects given LSD by Smart et al. described his experience incomparison with a psychedelic reaction he received from smallerquantities of LSD in Saskatchewan. The experiences and theoutcome were quite different. Psychedelic therapy aims to create a set and a setting thatwill allow proper psychotherapy. The psychedelic therapist workswith material that the patient experiences and discusses, andhelps him resynthesize a new model of life or a new personalphilosophy. During the experience, the patient draws uponinformation flooding in from the altered environment and from hisown past, and uses it to eliminate false ideas and falsememories. With the aid of the therapist, he evaluates himselfmore objectively and becomes more acutely aware of his ownresponsibility for his situation and, even more important, fordoing something about it. He also becomes aware of innerstrengths or qualities that help him in his long and difficultstruggle toward sobriety. The book The Use of LSD in Psychotherapy and Alcoholism,edited by H. A. Abramson (1967), contains the best collection ofscientific papers on psychedelic therapy. Around 1952, Osmond and I had become familiar withpsychotomimetic reactions induced by LSD. There was a markedsimilarity between these reactions and schizophrenia and thetoxic psychoses. Delirium tremens is one of the common toxicstates. It occurred to us that LSD might be used to producemodels of dt's. Many alcoholics ascribed the beginning of theirrecovery to "hitting bottom," and often "hittingbottom" meant having had a particularly memorable attack ofdt's. We thought that LSD could be used this way with no risk tothe patient. We treated our first two alcoholics at theSaskatchewan Hospital, Weyburn, Saskatchewan, and one recovered. Other early pilot studies were encouraging, and we increasedthe tempo of our research until at one time six of our majorpsychiatric centers in Saskatchewan were using it. As of now, wemust have treated close to one thousand alcoholics. Within a few years after our first patients were treated, webecame aware that a large proportion of our alcoholics did nothave psychotomimetic reactions. Their experiences were excitingand pleasant, and yielded insight into their drinking problems.It became evident that a new phenomenon had been recognized inpsychiatry. Osmond created the word psychedelic to define theseexperiences, and announced this at a meeting of the New YorkAcademy of Sciences in 1957. Following this, our researches were aimed at improving thequality and quantity of psychedelic reactions. Within the pastten years, major studies, under the direction of Dr. RossMacLean, Hollywood Hospital, New Westminster, British Columbia,and under the direction of Dr. S. Unger at Spring Grove StateHospital, Baltimore, Maryland, have added materially to ourknowledge of the effect of psychedelic therapy on alcoholism. I will not review the results of psychedelic therapy indetail. This has been done in the books edited by H. A. Abramsonand in The Hallucinogens by A. Hoffer and H. Osmond(1967). The one striking conclusion is that every scientist usingpsychedelic therapy with alcoholics found the same proportion ofrecoveries. Whether the experiments were considered controlled ornot, about 50 per cent were able to remain sober or to drink muchless. This seems to be a universal statistic for LSD therapy. (1). Dr. Walter Alvarez recently told me that when he wrote apaper on food allergies at the Mayo Clinic about fifty years ago,he was severely criticized by his colleagues. Only strong supportfrom one of the Mayos, who discovered that he himself had a foodallergy, protected Alvarez from even-more-powerful assault.Medicine seems very reluctant to take unto itself new diseases.

Mogar & Robert W. Aldrich Evidence from seven independent studiesindicates LSD may help free the most severely imprisoned minds. Robert Mogar, Ph.D., is Associate Professor ofPsychology at San Francisco State College, and former Director ofthe Institute for Psychedelic Research. Robert Aldrich is agraduate student in psychology at San Francisco State College. Reprinted from PSYCHEDELIC REVIEWNumber 10, 1969 In recent years, a number of exploratory investigations havebeen reported involving the administration of psychedelic agentsto young children suffering from severe forms of psychologicaldisturbance (Abramson, 1960; Bender, et al., 1962; Bender, etal., 1963; Fisher & Castile, 1963; Freedman, et al., 1962;Rolo, et al., 1965; Simmons, et al., 1966). As either therapeuticor experimental undertakings, these studies are extremelyfragmentary and suffer gross shortcomings. As a case in point,wide diversity along major dimensions known to influence drugresponse and treatment effectiveness characterize this work.These include the agent employed, dosage level, number andfrequency of administrations, therapist expectations and previousexperience with psychedelic drugs, and finally the setting andcircumstances surrounding the drug-induced state. With regard topatient characteristics, the children treated weredemographically varied and covered a broad age range. Moreimportantly, the samples were markedly heterogeneous with respectto the nature, severity, and duration of modal symptoms. Themajor experimental shortcomings included small samples,subjective and vague criteria of drug effects and improvement,and grossly inadequate follow-up. Despite their diversity and severe limitations, these seminalexplorations in an extremely complex area of research seem worthyof wider reportage and more serious attention than they havehitherto received. Almost without exception, these reports haveappeared in obscure publications or remain unpublished. A moresignificant reason for their relative neglect has been thepolarized controversy surrounding psychedelic agents which hasall but completely curtailed publicly-sanctioned research. In this critique of the use of psychedelic agents withseverely disturbed children, the various studies conducted thusfar will be comprehensively reviewed and integrated. Particularattention will be given to their similarities and differencesalong known relevant dimensions in order to detect communalitiesand possible reasons for inconsistent findings. While someattempt will be made to resolve seemingly contradictory results,the heuristic value of this work will be emphasized rather thanits conclusiveness . Hopefully, the tentative conclusions derivedfrom these initial efforts will point the way for more definitivestudies into the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelic agents withchildhood disorders. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS A fairly exhaustive search of clinical and research reportsrevealed a total of 91 severely disturbed children who have beenadministered one or more psychedelic agents for experimentaland/or therapeutic purposes. As detailed in Table1, this collective group of patients ranged from five tofifteen years of age, with the large majority between six and tenyears of age. Careful examination of the seven independentstudies disclosed little basis for assuming a significantrelationship between age and drug response. However, tentativerelationships were suggested by both Bender (1963) and Fisher andCastile (1963). Bender noted that in contrast to pre-adolescents, younger children manifest consistently differentreactions to a variety of medical and pharmacological treatments.For this reason, she hypothesized that her older patient group(12-15, N = 8) would not show the dramatic positive changesobtained with the younger children. Contrary to expectations,comparable favorable effects were found irrespective of agedifferences. Fisher and Castile, on the other hand, concludedthat older children were better candidates for psychedelictherapy because verbal communication was possible and alsobecause they tended to be less withdrawn, more schizophrenic thanautistic, and displayed more blatant symptomology. While thesepatient features were obvious advantages for the particulartherapy technique employed by Fisher and Castile, it is unlikelythat this symptom picture consistently distinguishes older fromyounger psychotic children. Thus, on the basis of the availableevidence concerning the immediate and subsequent effects ofpsychedelic drugs on children, age per se appears to be aninconsequential variable. All of the patients treated in these studies were described asseverely and chronically disturbed with a primary diagnosis ofautism or childhood schizophrenia. With regard to duration ofillness, most had been hospitalized for periods ranging from twoto four years. Many were afflicted since birth. An apparentexception was the single patient studied by Rolo and his co-workers (1965). This twelve year old boy had been hospitalizedfor four months. No estimate of the duration of his illness wasreported. At the opposite extreme, the twelve children treated byFisher and Castile were probably the most severely disturbed withan average illness duration of 7.6 years. The modal symptoms characterizing the majority of childrengiven psychedelic treatment were well summarized by Simmons andhis coworkers (1966): (1) preoccupation with and stereotypedmanipulation of objects (toys, etc.); (2) isolation of the selffrom contact with animate objects (including minimal eyecontact); (3) failure to acquire general social behaviors(including speech); and (4) bizarre rhythmic repetitive motorpatterns. This syndrome conforms closely to the classical pictureof infantile autism (see e.g., Rimland, 1964). As suggestedearlier, the symptoms picture of the older children treated byBender and by Fisher and Castile resembled adult schizophreniamore than infantile autism. This was also true of Rolo's singlepatient. Although autism was invariably present, the"schizophrenic" children were less withdrawn andmanifested a greater variety of symptoms including overtaggression, hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and psychosomaticdisturbances. Almost without exception, long-standing mutism wascharacteristic of all 91 patients prior to psychedelic treatment. Despite these significant communalities among the seven groupsof children studied, individual differences in patientcharacteristics extended over a fairly broad range. Withoutdiscounting the possible importance of individual differences,there is little indication in the work reviewed here ofdifferential response or benefit as a function of age, diagnosis,duration or severity of illness. As will become apparent insubsequent sections of this paper, the failure to detect suchrelationships seems partlydueto fragmentary patient data and thecrude estimates available of drug response and subsequent changesin behavior. Consistent with this hypothesis, the differentialfindings reported by Fisher and Castile appear to reflect theirmore detailed assessment of personal history information andindividual differences in both pre- and post- treatmentsymptomology. They also applied more stringent criteria ofimprovement than the other investigators. RATIONALE AND HYPOTHESES Explicit hypotheses or theoretical bases for administeringpsychedelic drugs to disturbed children are almost completelyabsent in these exploratory studies. The lack of a definiterationale is hardly surprising when one considers the enigmasurrounding both schizophrenic behavior in children and responseto psychedelic drugs. Despite great diversity in expectationsandtechnique,there was one point of departure shared by allinvestigators, namely, that all known forms of treatment had beenattempted without success. Thus, the use of a potent experimentaldrug with the particular chronic patients selected seemedjustified. With regard to the purpose of these studies, all were to someextent exploring the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugsrather than their psychotomimetic properties. This was least trueof Freedman and his coworkers (1962) who viewed LSD primarily asa means of studying the schizophrenic process by"intensifying pre-existing symptomology." Thisorientation contrasted sharply with Bender's view. Noting thatwithdrawn children became more emotionally responsive whileaggressive children became less so, she hypothesized thatpsychedelic drugs "tend to 'normalize' behavior rather thansubdue or stimulate it." This basic difference inexpectations seems at least partially responsible for Bender'sextremely favorable outcomes and Freedman's rather poor results.Regarding all forms of psychotherapy, it has become a truism that" where there is no therapeutic intent, there is notherapeutic result" (Charles Savage in Abramson, 1960, p.193). Consistent with their explicit therapeutic intent, Bender,Fisher, and Simmons each offer essentially the same hypothesisbased on a psychological interpretation of childhoodschizophrenia: " The working hypothesis of this study isthat the psychosis is a massive defensive structure in theservice of protecting and defending the patient against hisfeelings and affectual states" (Fisher & Castile, 1963).Psychedelic drugs were viewed as a powerful means of underminingan intractable defense system and thereby making the patient morereceptive to contact and communication with others. In attemptingto explain the predominantly positive results in this area ofresearch (see Table 1), it is worth emphasizing that thecollective work of Bender, Fisher, and Simmons accounts for over75 per cent of the 91 children treated with psychedelic drugs.Although their techniques differed considerably, theseinvestigators shared a psychological conception of autisticsymptoms and a psycho-therapeutic orientation to drug treatment. Although Freedman was prompted to use LSD primarily as anexperimental device to study psychosis, he did mention that hewas influenced to some extent by the dramatic improvement inautistic children reported by Peck and Murphy (in Abramson, 1960)and by the apparent success of Cholden, Kurland, and Savage(1955) in their work with adult mute catatonic patients. As willbecome apparent in the discussion of results, a partial and oftentransient alleviation of mutism by LSD treatment has been one ofthe most consistent effects reported in the children studies. A final secondary objective worth mentioning is that the morerecent studies (Rolo, et al., 1965; Simmons, et al., 1966) wereinfluenced by Bender' s earlier reports of successful LSDtreatment. These studies were attempts to replicate Bender'sfindings using various control measures and other methodologicalrefinements. DRUG REGIME As indicated in Table 1, LSD-25 has been by far the mostfrequently employed psychedelic agent in work with psychoticchildren. An exception was Benders s second study (1963) in whichshe gave one-half of her patients LSD-25 and the other half UML491. The experimental drug UML-491 was described as a morepotent serotonin inhibitor without the psychedelic propertiesassociated with LSD-25. Based on a variety of biochemical indicesand observations of differential behavior changes, Benderreported no apparent differences between the action oreffectiveness of the two drugs. Fisher and Castile employed LSD-25 and psilocybin at timessingly and at times simultaneously. These investigators wereunique in using a variety of dosage leveldrug combinations bothwith the same patient on different occasions and with differentpatients on the same occasion. The specific drug regime adoptedfor a given session was determined by clinical criteria of thepatient' s particular defense structure and his expectedresistance to psychedeliedrugs. Stated differently, Fisher andCastile were the only investigators who attempted to optimize thepsychedelic experience for a given patient rather thanmechanically administering a constant dosage of the same agent toall patients. This feature of their method was consistent withthe greater attention paid to individual patient differences andtheir general orientation to psychedelic therapy as apsychopharmacological process . Concerning dosage level, most investigators settled on 100micrograms as optimal. Although this was the average dosage usedby Bender, she differed from the others by starting treatment ata relatively low level (50 mcgs.) and gradually increasing theamount to as high as 150 mcgs. As suggested earlier, Fisher andCastile usually administered multiple agents and employed a widerange of dosage levels (with LSD, 50 to 400 mcgs.). As their workprogressed, they developed a definite preference for theprolonged high dose psychedelic experience, especially with olderschizophrenic children. Their most effective results wereobtained with pre-treatment medication of 10 mg. Librium, 10 to15 mg. of Psilocybin given approximately one-half hour later,followed by 250 to 300 mcg. of LSD administered twenty minuteslater. In addition, Fisher and Castile often gave"boosters" during the session itself ranging from 25 to100 mcg. of LSD. Boosting was considered beneficial " (a)when the patient seemed to be caught up in a problem area whichhe could not break through; (b) when the patient kept defendinghimself from new experiences; (c) when the patient increased hisdefensive, stereotyped behavior and the psychotic controls becameintensified." With regard to frequency and total number of treatments, theseven studies varied widely ---from Freedman's single session perpatient to Bender's daily sessions over periods as long as oneyear. Although more frequent and prolonged treatment was oftenimpossible for non- clinical reasons, Fisher' s group averagedfive sessions per patient given preferably at two week intervals.With both Rolo' s single patient and Simmons' pair of identicaltwins, experimental requirements precluded an optimal therapeuticregime. Both investigators attempted double-blind procedures andmore objective observational methods. Rolo administered 100 mcg.LSD on 28 consecutive days while Simmons gave a total of nine 50mcg. LSD treatments, approximately two per week, interspersedwith inert placebo sessions and control (no-drug) trials. After citing extensive evidence indicating rapid tolerance ofLSD-25, Freedman concluded that repeated administrations would beineffective with psychotic children. Bender, on the other hand,found little indication of either rapid or sustained tolerance toLSD using her method of continued daily adrninistrations overextended periods. With her relatively large group of patients,Bender did observe a leveling off of reactivity after severalweeks or months of uninterrupted treatment. She considered itunlikely, however, that this effect was due to physiological drugtolerance. The impressive improvement rates obtained by Bender incontrast to Freedman's results offer support for a high frequencyregime of moderately large doses. It is worth noting that Fisherand Castile arrived at a similar conclusion without knowledge ofBender's work. Parenthetically, the significance of a possibledrug tolerance effect is further lessened by the findings of morerecent experiments indicating that tolerance to LSD diminishesalmost as rapidly as it develops (Hoffer, 1965) . PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MILIEU It should be emphasized that the findings obtained in thesestudies are the result of an interrelated set of determinants,only one of which is the ingestion of a particular chemicalagent. The significance of seemingly contradictory results hasoften been obscured by the persistent search for static, "drug-specific" reactions to LSD. Inconsistent findingsbecome more understandable if the psychedelic experience isviewed as a dynamic configuration of intimate patienttherapist-milieu transactions. In short, the administration ofLSD is inextricably embedded in a larger psychosocial processwhich should be optimized in accordance with particular treatmentgoals. Even a cursory examination of the work with autistic childrenclearly reveals that at least some important aspects of thephysical and psychological milieu were considerably less thanoptimal. In the seven studies reviewed here, only Fisher andCastile attempted to create a specifically non-medical atmospherethat was minimally threatening to the patient. Modeled after thewidely-adopted Saskatchewan technique (Blewett & Chwelos,1959; Hoffer, 1965), the procedure developed by Fisher andCastile included the following key features: (1) a high dose, 7to 10 hour session; (2) the use of a variety oftherapeutically-meaningful or aesthetically- pleasing stimuli(music, flowers, pictures, food, etc.); (3) a positivepatient-therapist relationship formed prior to the sessionitself; (4) the presence of both a male and female therapist who"had thorough acquaintance with the phenomena of the drugthrough personal experience"; and (5) active therapistinvolvement with the patient including role-playing (e.g.,father, mother). Importantly, these conditions have repeatedlybeen found to significantly enhance the personal value ofpsychedelic experiences. In each study, the circumstances under which the session wasconducted were consistent with the purpose and expectations ofthe investigator. Consistent with his psychotomimeticorientation, Freedman' s patients were supervised by a familiarpsychiatrist primarily for the purpose of careful observation andnote-taking. No attempts to relate to the children or personalexperience with the drug were reported. The same applies toBender's group although the intent in this case was clearlytherapeutic. She apparently administered LSD as a conventionaldaily medication that did not require any special conditions ofpreparation, therapist involvement, or setting. However, herreports are replete with descriptions of spontaneous interactionsbetween staff and children. Supervision of Bender' s patients wasperformed mainly by ward attendants. The adults present in thesessions conducted by both Rolo and Simmons were also wardattendants. The primary purpose of the studies reported by Rolo andSimmons was explicitly methodological. Both research projectsemployed the double-blind method and attempted to follow apredetermined, uniform procedure during each experimental andcontrol session. As means of standardizing the sequence of eventsand increasing objectivity, both investigators systematicallypresented various playing objects, games, and tasks to the child.Rolo's single patient was encouraged to engage in quite simple,familiar activities such as throwing a baseball or playing cards.Simmons, on the other hand, created a far more elaborate seriesof game-like situations that were novel and intrinsicallyinteresting, requiring sustained patient-adult interactions, andimportantly were specifically designed to simulate or elicitnormal social behavior and emotional responsiveness. A number of probable effects of the physical and psychologicalmilieu are suggested in these studies that bear a significantrelationship to the investigator' s orientation, on the one hand,and differences in benefit or outcome, on the other. As indicatedearlier, the expectations of a particular research team seemhighly related to various aspects of both drug regime andsetting. With regard to differential improvement rates, a majordeterminant seems to be the degree of active therapist-patientinteractions permitted during the drug-induced state. Secondly,greater therapeutic benefit seems to occur in congenial settingsoffering some opportunity to experience meaningful objects andinterpersonal activities. Finally, psychedelic therapy withpsychotic children seems most effective in natural, flexiblesettings that are reasonably free of artificiality, experimentalrestrictions on spontaneous behavior, and mechanicallyadministered procedures. Conversely, barren medical or laboratoryenvironments seem clearly anti- therapeutic. RESULTS As emphasized previously, each of these exploratory studiessuffered major shortcomings either as therapeutic or experimentalundertakings. Almost without exception, the findings reportedconsist mainly of observational data obtained during the acutephase of drug reactivity. The use of pre-treatment baselinesagainst which to measure change either during or afterpsychedelic therapy were generally absent. In most cases,follow-up data was not obtained. Although caution in interpretingresults is certainly indicated, it should be pointed out thatthese limitations are shared by the bulk of research on drug- andpsycho-therapies. Furthermore, objective evaluation ofimprovement in severely disturbed children presents uniqueproblems due to the nature of autistic symptoms, especially theubiquity of mutism. Even the few cases not suffering from acomplete absence of speech were untestable by standardpsychological assessment methods. In their initial study, Bender and her coworkers (1962)administered the Vineland Maturity Scale at the beginning oftreatment and again three months later. At the followup testing,ratings were qualitatively higher for all children. In the secondstudy (Bender, et al., 1963), the Rorschach, Draw-A-Person, andBender-Gestalt tests were given to the ten verbally responsivechildren on at least two occasions; before treatment and againafter a three to eight month interval. In these aggressive,overtly psychotic patients, Bender reports that "there weretwo major changes observed: (1) There was a decrease inpersonalized ideation and a corresponding gain in accuracy ofresponse; and (2) An inhibition of strongly emotional or'feeling' reactions to the cards." Other favorable changesreported included decreases in hallucinations, negativism, andregressive defenses with a corresponding increase in reality-contact. Similar types of improvement were found in the olderchildren treated by Fisher and Castile. With regard to her major group of young autistic children,Bender reported significant improvement in speech and verbalcommunication: ". . .the vocabularies of several of the children increased after LSD or UML; several seemed to be attempting to form words or watched adults carefully as they spoke; many seemed to comprehend speech for the first time or were able to communicate their needs... Very few of these changes in communication had been noted previously in such a large number of children, and at such a relatively rapid rate" (1963, p. 91). Since mutism is a cardinal symptom of autistic children andprobably the major impediment to successful therapy, it is worthemphasizing that at least temporary speech improvement has beenone of the most frequently reported effects of LSD in the workconducted thus far. Other communalities include an elevated mood,less compulsive ritualistic behavior, and increased interactionwith others. All investigators reported some favorable change inthese major areas with the exception of Rolo' s single patient .Rolo's group abandoned the attempt to estimate improvement sincetheir judges could not distinguish between LSD and non- LSDtrials. Bender, on the other hand, made the followingobservations: " They appeared flushed, bright eyed, and unusually interested in the environment... They participated with increasing eagerness in motility play with adults and other children. . . They seek positive contacts with adults, approaching them with face uplifted and bright eyes, and responding to fondling, affection, etc." (1962, pp. 172- 3). "There is less stereotyped whirling and rhythmic behavior. . . They became gay, happy, laughing frequently... Some showed changes in facial expression in appropriate reactions to situations for the first time" (1963, pp. 90-91). As indicated earlier, Simmons' patients were subjected to auniform sequence of game- like situations that evoked a varietyof measurable responses. During each LSD session and non- LSDsession, a total of 20 specific behavioral measurements weretaken by a recorder observing the patient through a one-way,screen. The behaviors recorded included physical contact with theadult present, vocalizations, destructive acts, laughter,stereotyped movements, and eye-to-eye contact. In contrast tonon-LSD trials, the most pronounced and consistent changesobserved during LSD sessions were: "(1) An increase insocial behaviors manifested by increased eye to face contact andincreased responsiveness to adults, (2) An increase in smilingand laughing behavior generally considered an indication of apleasurable affective state, and (3) a decrease in one form ofnon-adaptive behavior demonstrated by a reduction ofself-stimulation." Considering the wide diversity in these studies, the majorfindings of Bender, Fisher and Castile, Freedman, and Simmons areremarkably similar. Differences in orientation, patientattributes, drug regime, setting, treatment technique, researchdesign, etc. seem to affect the frequency and stability offavorable outcomes (see Table 1). The types of improvement, whenand if they occur, appear to be essentially the same in eachstudy. In short, when LSD is effective with autistic children, itis effective in characteristic ways. The influence of non-drug factors is well illustrated in thework of Fisher and Castile. Although they optimized the physicaland psychological milieu, their patients were the most severelydisturbed and displayed the greatest variety of symptoms.Furthermore they made conservative estimates of improvement basedon the extent and stability of favorable changes after treatmentwas terminated. In contrast, most of the findings reported by theother investigators concerned the immediate effects of treatment.These differences account in part for the relatively modestimprovement rates reported by Fisher and Castile. The lack of even short-term follow-up data on the majority ofchildren treated with psychedelic drugs has been a majorlimitation of the work reviewed bere. Follow-up information isparticularly crucial because the available evidence stronglysuggests that when used alone, LSD produces only transientalleviation of symptoms. In order to bring about enduringimprovement, the drug induced state requires active therapistpatient interaction and/or subsequent psychotherapy. In thisconnection, Simmons noted that: " Therapeutic intervention in severely retarded or regressed children utilizes to a great extent close physical interaction to which the child must respond. In the usual state it is often difficult to intrude upon the child because of a general lack of responsiveness... The results of our experiments clearly demonstrate changes in exactly these areas with increased attendance to physical and face contact with an attending adult and concomitant reduction of competing self- stimulatory behavior... Thus, two possible criteria for the successful intervention into autistic children are met... A third piece of data which must be considered is the increase in smiling and laughing behavior. . ." (1966, p. 1207). The collective work reviewed here supports the main conclusionreached by Simmons and his co-workers and argues strongly formore extensive and systematic applications of psychedelic drugsin the treatment of autistic schizophrenic children: "LSD-25 appears to offer a useful adjunct to psychotherapy becauseof its positive effect in the areas described which are closelyrelated to the process of psychotherapy." SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1. Seven independent studies are reviewed involving a total of91 austistic schizophrenic children who had been givenpsychedelic drugs for therapeutic and/or experimental purposes. 2. The large majority of children treated in these studieswere between six and ten years of age and were completelyrefractory to all other forms of treatment. 3. There was only slight indication of any differentialresponse or benefit as a function of age, diagnosis, duration orseverity or illness. 4. A variety of psychedelic agents, dosage levels, frequencyof administrations, and treatment schedules were employed. Themost effective results were obtained with at least 100 microgramdoses of LSD-25 given daily or weekly over relatively extendedperiods of time. 5. Concerning the physical and psychological milieu, greatertherapeutic benefit was related to: (a) the degree of activetherapist involvement with the patient; (b) an opportunity toexperience meaningful objects and interpersonal activities; and(c) congenial settings that were reasonably free ofartificiality, experimental or medical restructions, andmechanically administered procedures. 6. The most consistent effects of psychedelic therapy reportedin these studies included: (a) improved speech behavior inotherwise mute children; (b) increased emotional responsivenessto other children and adults; (c) an elevation in positive moodincluding frequent laughter; and (d) decreases in compulsiveritualistic behavior. 7. Differences in patient attributes, treatment technique,research design, and other non- drug factors seemed to effect thefrequency and stability of favorable outcomes. The types ofimprovement found were essentially the same in each study. 8. Although each of these studies contained serioustherapeutic and experimental flaws, it was concluded that thecollective findings argue strongly for more extensiveapplications of psychedelic drugs in the treatment of austisticchildren.

DUTTON, NEW YORK 1977, copyright Grof & Halifax Our experience with persons dying of incurable diseases hasbeen closely associated with the development of psychedelictherapy, a comprehensive program of brief psychotherapy utilizingmind-altering substances such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)and dipropyltryptamine (DPT). Although this treatment is a directoutgrowth of modern pharmacological and clinical research, it hasclose parallels in various contemporary non-Western cultures andits roots reach back to prehistory and the shamanic rituals andhealing ceremonies of many ancient civilizations. The first suggestion that psychedelic substances could beuseful in the therapy of individuals dying of incurable diseasescame from pediatrician Valentina Pavlovna Wasson. After manyyears of intensive ethnomycological studies, she and her husband,Gordon Wasson, became interested in the use of psychedelicmushrooms in pre-Columbian cultures and in contemporary CentralAmerica. They made several field trips to Mexico to explore thisissue, and finally in June 1955 they became the first Westernersto be admitted to a sacred ritual conducted by the Mazatec curandera,or medicine woman, Maria Sabina. The Wassons were deeplyimpressed by the powerful effect of the mushrooms that theyingested in this ceremony. Roger Heim, the French mycologistwhose aid the Wassons sought, identified the mushroomsbotanically as Psilocybe mexicana and its congeners; hethen sent samples to the laboratories of the Swiss pharmaceuticalcompany, Sandoz, for chemical analysis. In 1957 ValentinaPavlovna Wasson gave an interview in This Week magazineabout the history of this discovery and her own experience afterthe ingestion of the Mexican sacred mushrooms. She expressed theopinion that if the active agent could be isolated and asufficient supply assured, it might become a vital tool in thestudy of psychic processes. She also stated that as the drugwould become better known, medical uses would be found for it,perhaps in the treatment of alcoholism, narcotic addiction,mental disorders, and terminal diseases associated with severepain. Several years later a team of researchers working inBaltimore independently tested the validity of her unusualvision. A group of psychiatrists and psychologists at theMaryland Psychiatric Research Center who were not familiar withthe article in This Week conducted systematic studies ofpsychedelic therapy with LSD, a drug closely related topsilocybin, for exactly the same indications that ValentinaWasson predicted. We ourselves were surprised to discover thenewspaper clipping in Gordon Wasson's library during a 1974 visitto his home. The next stimulus for the use of psychedelics with dyingindividuals did not come from a physician or behavioral scientistbut from the writer and philosopher, Aldous Huxley. He wasprofoundly interested both in the phenomenon of dying and in thereligious and mystical experiences induced by psychedelic drugs.With unusual sensitivity and insight he assisted his first wife,Maria, when in 1955 she was dying of cancer. During her finalhours he used a hypnotic technique to bring her into touch withthe memory of ecstatic experiences that had occurredspontaneously on several occasions during her life. The explicitgoal was to facilitate her experience of dying by guiding hertoward these mystical states of consciousness as death wasapproaching. This deep personal experience has its parallel inHuxley's novel Island, where the character Lakshmi isdying under very similar circumstances. In a letter to HumphryOsmond, a psychiatrist and pioneer in psychedelic research whointroduced him to LSD and mescaline, Huxley wrote: My own experience with Maria convinced me that the living can do a great deal to make the passage easier for the dying, to raise the most purely physiological act of human existence to the level of consciousness and perhaps even of spirituality. To those who are familiar with the effects of hallucinogenicdrugs and with Huxley's personal history, there is no doubt thatthe "soma" in Brave New World and the ''mokshamedicine'' in Island are psychedelic substances similar intheir effects to LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin. In Huxley'svision "moksha medicine'' gives inhabitants of the islandmystical insights that free them from the fear of death andenable them to live more fully. In another letter to HumphryOsmond written as early as February 1958, Huxley was quiteexplicit about his idea of seriously considering the use of LSDwith dying individuals: . . . yet another project--the administration of LSD to terminal cancer cases, in the hope that it would make dying more spiritual, less strictly physiological process. According to his second wife, Laura, Aldous mentioned onseveral occasions that ''the last rites should make one moreconscious rather than less conscious, more human rather than lesshuman.'' In 1963, when he was himself dying of cancer, Huxleydemonstrated the seriousness of his vision. Several hours beforehis death he asked Laura to give him 100 micrograms of LSD tofacilitate his own dying. This moving experience was laterdescribed in Laura Huxley's book, This Timeless Moment. Aldous Huxley's suggestion, although reinforced by his uniquepersonal example, for several years had no influence on medicalresearchers. The next contribution to this area came from arather unexpected source and was unrelated to Huxley's thinkingand efforts. In the early 1960s Eric Kast of the Chicago MedicalSchool studied the effects of various drugs on the experience ofpain in the quest for a good and reliable analgesic. He becameinterested in LSD as a possible candidate for such a substancebecause of certain peculiarities of its effect on humans. Helearned that LSD tends to produce a marked distortion of the bodyimage and alterations of body boundaries; furthermore, it seemedto interfere with the ability to concentrate and maintainselective attention on a particular physiological sensation.Thus, in individuals who are under the influence of LSD, simplevisual impressions may take precedence over sensations of pain orconcerns related to survival. Both the effect of LSD on the bodyimage and its interference with selective focus on significantinput seemed to be worth exploring in terms of their potentialfor altering the perception of physical pain. In a paper published in 1964 Kast and Collins described theresults of a study in which the hypothetical analgesic propertiesof LSD were compared to those of two established and potentdrugs, dihydromorphinone (Dilaudid) and meperidine (Demerol). Ina group of fifty individuals suffering from severe physical painwere thirty-nine patients with various types and stages ofcancer, ten patients with gangrenes of feet or legs, and one withsevere herpes zoster (shingles). The outcome of the statisticalanalysis of this comparison indicated that the analgesic effectof LSD proved to be superior to both Dilaudid and Demerol. Inaddition to pain relief, Kast and Collins noticed that some ofthese individuals showed a striking disregard for the gravity oftheir personal situations. They frequently talked about theirimpending death with an emotional attitude that would beconsidered atypical in our culture; yet it was quite obvious thatthis new perspective was beneficial in view of the situation theywere facing. In a later study of 128 individuals with metastatic cancer,Kast explored in more detail some of his earlier findings. Thistime he was interested not only in the effects of LSD on pain butalso on some additional parameters: emotional changes, sleeppatterns, and attitudes toward illness and death. In view of thefact that there was no psycho therapeutic emphasis and thepatients were not even informed that they were being given LSD,the results were quite remarkable. A precipitous drop in painoccurred in many individuals about two to three hours after theadministration of 100 micrograms of LSD and lasted an average oftwelve hours; pain intensity for the whole group (not necessarilyfor every patient) was decreased for a period of three weeks. Forabout ten days after the session, Kast observed improvement ofsleep and a less concerned attitude toward illness and death. In 1966 Kast published another paper in which he paid moreexplicit attention to the influence of LSD on the religious andphilosophical experiences and ideas of the patients. The group hestudied consisted of eighty persons suffering from terminalmalignant disease, with estimated life expectancies of weeks ormonths, each of whom had been fully informed of the diagnosis. Incontrast to earlier studies, the LSD sessions were terminated byan intramuscular injection of 100 milligrams of chlorpromazineupon the appearance of fear, panic, unpleasant imagery, or thedesire to rest. The beneficial influence of a singleadministration of 100 micrograms of LSD on physical pain, mood,and sleep patterns was similar to the preceding studies. Inaddition, Kast described a variety of changes in the patientsthat made their situation more tolerable. He noticed improvedcommunication both between the observer and the patients andamong the patients themselves; this enhanced their morale andself-respect and created a sense of cohesion and community amongthem. Quite significant, also, was the occurrence of "happy,oceanic feelings" lasting up to twelve days following theadministration of LSD. Kast stated explicitly that a certainchange in philosophical and religious attitudes in relationshipto dying took place that were not reflected in his numerical dataand graphs. In spite of what to an LSD therapist might at present appearas shortcomings in Kast's studies, the historical value of hispioneering effort is unquestionable. He not only discovered theanalgesic value of LSD for some patients with intractable pain,but he also brought forth the first experimental evidence forAldous Huxley's suggestion that the administration of LSD mightease the encounter with death in persons suffering from cancer.Kast concluded the last of his studies by stating that, accordingto his observations, LSD is capable not only of improving the lotof dying individuals by making them more responsive to theirenvironment and family, but it also enhances their ability toappreciate the nuances and subtleties of everyday life. It givesthem aesthetic satisfaction and "creates a new will to liveand a zest for experience, which, against a background of dismaldarkness and preoccupying fear, produces an exciting andpromising outlook." The encouraging results of Kast's studies inspired SidneyCohen, a prominent Los Angeles psychiatrist, friend of AldousHuxley, and one of the pioneers in LSD research, to start aprogram of psychedelic therapy for individuals dying of cancer.Unfortunately the results of his study and the details of histreatment procedure have never been published. In a 1965 articleCohen expressed his feelings about the potential of psychedelictherapy for the dying, based on his pilot experiments with asmall group of patients. He stated that his own work confirmedKast's findings about the beneficial effect of LSD on severephysical pain and suggested that LSD may one day provide atechnique for altering the experience of dying. Cohen saw clearlythe importance of this research endeavor: "Death must becomea more human experience. To preserve the dignity of death andprevent the living from abandoning or distancing themselves fromthe dying is one of the great dilemmas of modern medicine." Cohen's co-worker, Gary Fisher, later published a paper inwhich he discussed the personal and interpersonal problems of thedying. In this context he emphasized the significance oftranscendental experiences--whether spontaneous, resulting fromvarious spiritual practices, or induced by psychedelic drugs. Asa result of such experiences the individual ceases to beconcerned about his or her own physical demise and begins to seeit as a natural phenomenon of the cycling of the life force. Thisacceptance drastically alters a person's life-style; theindividual no longer reacts with panic, fear, pain, anddependency to the changes that are occurring. Rather, the patientis willing and eager to share this new knowledge with closefamily members and friends. Fisher discussed the use of LSDtherapy within the framework of a research project where thisdrug was compared with an experimental analgesic and only onehour was allowed for preparing patients for the session. In spiteof this limitation, he observed what he described as dramaticresults in terms of pain reduction, psychological aftereffects,and adjustment of the patients to their impending deaths. Another series of observations that was later integrated intothe concept of psychedelic therapy for the dying originated inthe Psychiatric Research Institute in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Aresearch team of this institute headed by Stanislav Grof(coauthor of this book) conducted experiments in the early 1960swith psychiatric patients, exploring the potential of LSD forpersonality diagnostics and psychotherapy. These efforts finallyresulted in treatment that involved intense psychological workand a series of therapeutic sessions with LSD. Although thisapproach was initially based in theory and practice onpsychoanalysis, in the course of years it underwent substantialmodifications and became an independent therapeutic procedurecombining work on psychodynamic issues with a definite emphasison transpersonal and transcendental experiences. In the exploratory phase of this work, all psychiatricpatients from various diagnostic categories undergoing serial LSDsessions sooner or later transcended the psychoanalytic frameworkand spontaneously moved into experiential realms that have beendescribed through millennia as occurring in various schools ofthe mystical tradition, temple mysteries, and rites of passage inmany ancient and pretechnological cultures of the world. The mostcommon as well as the most important of these phenomena wereexperiences of death and rebirth, followed by feelings of cosmicunity. This profound encounter with one's own impermanence andmortality was very complex and had biological, emotional,intellectual, philosophical, and metaphysical dimensions.Experiences of this kind seemed to have had very beneficialconsequences for these psychiatric patients; some very dramaticimprovements of various psychopathological conditions wereobserved immediately following the death-rebirth phenomenon and,in particular, the experiences of oneness with the universe. Thissuggested the existence of a powerful therapeutic mechanism asyet unknown to Western psychiatry and psychology that appearedfar superior to those used in conventional psychotherapy. Many individuals who had the experience of death and rebirthsometimes accompanied by feelings of cosmic unity independentlyreported that their attitudes toward dying and their concepts ofdeath underwent dramatic changes. Fear of their own physiologicaldemise diminished, they became open to the possibility ofconsciousness existing after clinical death, and tended to viewthe process of dying as an adventure in consciousness rather thanthe ultimate biological disaster. Those of us conducting thisresearch kept witnessing, to our great surprise, a process thatbore a striking similarity to mystical initiation and involvedexperiential sequences that resembled those described in the Tibetanor Egyptian Book of the Dead. The claims of changes in attitudes toward death were sofrequent that it seemed important to test their practicalrelevance. It was obvious that a deep change of consciousness ofthat sort could be very beneficial for dying individuals,particularly those with chronic, incurable diseases. The firstauthor (S.G.) then had an opportunity to work with severalpersons diagnosed with cancer. These pilot observations indicatedthat the alleviation of the fear of death earlier reported as aresult of LSD therapy in psychiatric patients (most of whom wereyoung and physically healthy) can occur also in those for whomthe issue of death is of immediate relevance. At this point thePrague group began seriously discussing the possibility ofworking systematically with dying people, and Grof designed aresearch program using serial LSD sessions with individuals dyingof cancer. These plans were interrupted by a fellowship grantedto him by the Foundation's Fund for Research in Psychiatry in NewHaven, Connecticut, that took him to the United States. After his arrival in Baltimore in March 1967, he joined theteam in the Research Unit of Spring Grove State Hospital, whichlater became the core of the Clinical Sciences Department of thenewly built Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. Here he found,to his surprise, that some time prior to his arrival this grouphad been interested in exploring the potential of LSDpsychotherapy for alleviating the emotional and physicalsuffering of cancer patients. The sequence of events that spurredthe interest of the research team in this problem area, brieflydescribed, is this: Since 1963 a group of psychiatrists,psychologists, and social workers at Spring Grove had beenexploring the effects of a brief course of LSD-assistedpsychotherapy on the drinking behavior, psychological condition,and social adjustment of alcoholics. In a parallel study thetherapeutic potential of this new treatment was tested in a groupof neurotic patients. During the assessment, based on clinicalinterviews as well as psychological testing, the symptomsparticularly responsive to psychedelic therapy appeared to bedepression and anxiety. In 1965, when the studies with alcoholics and neurotics werewell under way, the Spring Grove research team first focused itsattention on the needs of dying cancer patients in an unforeseenand tragic manner. A professional member of the research team,Gloria, a woman in her early forties, developed a carcinoma ofthe breast. She had undergone a radical mastectomy; subsequentsurgery had revealed inoperable metastases of the liver. Althoughstill ambulatory, she was in severe physical and emotionaldistress. She was fully aware of her condition and her prognosisand shared her feelings of despair with staff members. On thebasis of the relief of depression and anxiety frequently observedin psychiatric patients following LSD-assisted psychotherapy,Sidney Wolf, a psychologist and member of the therapeutic team,suggested that the psychedelic treatment procedure might provehelpful to his colleague. It seemed possible that her depressionand anxiety, although reactive in nature and well substantiatedby a painful life situation, might respond favorably to LSDtherapy, as was the case in other conditions of a psychogenicnature. After discussions with her husband, her physician, and withthe approval of all concerned, a course of psychedelic therapywas initiated, with Sidney Wolf in the role of "sitter.'' Inthe treatment plan at Spring Grove the primary objective was tofacilitate the occurrence of a psychedelic peak experience in thecontext of brief but intensive psychotherapy. The preparation forthe session lasted somewhat over a week; the focus was on theissue of personal identity and on current interpersonalrelationships. When most of the important areas involved weresatisfactorily clarified, a 200-microgram LSD session wasconducted under conditions quite similar to those used forpsychiatric patients. The outcome of this pioneering experimentwas quite remarkable: After careful preparation and severalsubsequent drug-free interviews a single LSD experience seemed tohave changed the quality of Gloria's remaining days. Shortlyafter the LSD session she went on vacation with her husband andchildren. Upon her return, two weeks after the session, shecompleted the following retrospective report: ''The day prior to LSD, I was fearful and anxious. I would atthat point have gratefully withdrawn. By the end of thepreparatory session practically all anxiety was gone; theinstructions were understood and the procedure clear. The nightwas spent quietly at home; close friends visited and we looked atphotograph albums and remembered happy family times. Sleep wasdeep and peaceful. I awakened refreshed, and with practically nofear. I felt ready and eager. The morning was lovely, cool andwith a freshness in the air. I arrived at the LSD building withthe therapist. Members of the department were around to wish mewell. It was a good feeling. ''In the treatment room was a beautiful happiness rosebud,deep red and dewy, but disappointingly not as fragrant as othervarieties. A bowl of fruit, moist, succulent, also reposed on thetable. I was immediately given the first dose and sat looking atpictures from my family album. Gradually, my movements becamefuzzy and I felt awkward. I was made to recline with earphonesand eyeshades. At some point the second LSD dose was given to me.This phase was generally associated with impatience. I had beengiven instructions lest there be pain, fear, or otherdifficulties. I was ready to try out my ability to face theunknown ahead of me and to triumph over my obstacles. I wasready, but except for the physical sensations of awkwardness andsome drowsiness nothing was happening. ''At about this time, it seems, I fused with the music and wastransported on it. So completely was I one with the sound thatwhen the particular melody or record stopped, howevermomentarily, I was alive to the pause, eagerly awaiting the nextlap of the journey. A delightful game was being played. What wascoming next? Would it be powerful, tender, dancing, or somber? Ifelt at these times as though I were being teased, but so nicely,so gently. I wanted to laugh in sheer appreciation of theseresponses, regardless of where I had just been, how sad or awed.And as soon as the music began, I was off again. Nor do Iremember all the explorations. "Mainly I remember two experiences. I was alone in atimeless world with no boundaries. There was no atmosphere; therewas no color, no imagery, but there may have been light. SuddenlyI recognized that I was a moment in time, created by those beforeme and in turn the creator of others. This was my moment, and mymajor function had been completed. By being born, I had givenmeaning to my parents' existence. "Again in the void, alone without the time-spaceboundaries. Life reduced itself over and over again to the leastcommon denominator. I cannot remember the logic of theexperience, but I became poignantly aware that the core of lifeis love. At this moment I felt that I was reaching out to theworld--to all people--but especially to those closest to me. Iwept long for the wasted years, the search for identity in falseplaces, the neglected opportunities, the emotional energy lost inbasically meaningless pursuits. "Many times, after respites, I went back, but always tovariations on the same themes. The music carried and sustainedme. Occasionally, during rests, I was aware of the smell ofpeaches. The rose was nothing to the fruit. The fruit was nectarand ambrosia (life); the rose was only a beautiful flower. When Ifinally was given a nectarine it was the epitome of subtle,succulent flavor. "As I began to emerge, I was taken to a fresh windsweptworld. Members of the department welcomed me and I felt not onlyjoy for myself, but for having been able to use the experiencethese people who cared for me wanted me to have. I felt veryclose to a large group of people. Later, as members of my familycame, there was a closeness that seemed new. That night, at home,my parents came, too. All noticed a change in me. I was radiant,and I seemed at peace, they said. I felt that way too. What haschanged for me? I am living now, and being. I can take it as itcomes. Some of my physical symptoms are gone. The excessivefatigue, some of the pains. I still get irritated occasionallyand yell. I am still me, but more at peace. My family senses thisand we are closer. All who know me well say that this has been agood experience." Five weeks after the date of the session, Gloria suddenlydeveloped ascites (accumulation of serous fluid in the abdominalcavity) and had to be rehospitalized; she died quietly three dayslater. The result of Sidney Wolf's endeavor was so encouraging thatthe Spring Grove staff decided to explore further the potentialof psychedelic therapy for alleviating the suffering of thosedying of cancer. A group of open-minded surgeons at Baltimore'sSinai Hospital expressed interest in this procedure, offeredtheir cooperation, and agreed to refer patients for LSD therapy.Three more persons were treated at this time by Sanford Unger, apsychologist who had played an important role in launching theSpring Grove studies of alcoholics and neurotics. The next important step in this direction was made in late1967, when Walter N. Pahnke joined the Spring Grove team. He wasinstrumental in changing the initial interest of the staff into asystematic pilot exploration and eventually a research project.Pahnke's background made him ideally suited for this type ofwork. He was a graduate of Harvard Medical School, and inaddition had a doctoral degree in comparative religion and adegree in divinity. It is hard to imagine a more useful way to combine medicine,psychology, and religion than psychedelic therapy with dyingindividuals. With unusual energy, enthusiasm, and devotion,Pahnke assumed the role of principal investigator in the cancerstudy. After pilot experimentation he was able to obtainfinancial support from the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation. Hestarted a research program exploring the value of psychedelictherapy utilizing LSD. Later he initiated a similar project inwhich a short-acting psychedelic, dipropyltryptamine (DPT), wasused in lieu of LSD. Walter Pahnke's life and work were drastically terminated in atragic accident on July 10, 1971. While vacationing in his summercabin in Maine, he did not return from one of his scuba-divingexpeditions. His body and diving equipment were never recoveredand the nature of the accident has remained a mystery. Walter'sdemise was a great loss for the Spring Grove team, from thepersonal as well as professional point of view. After Walter'sdeath the first author (S.G.) assumed medical responsibility forthe cancer study as his primary research activity and interest.His objective was not only to complete the research projects andaccumulate enough data but also to formulate a theoreticalframework that would account for some of the dramatic changesoccurring as a result of LSD therapy. It seemed important at thispoint to carefully analyze the data from LSD sessions of normalvolunteers, psychiatric patients, and dying individuals, and toformulate a comprehensive theory of LSD therapy based on a newmodel of the unconscious. A new dimension was added to these endeavors when in 1972,Joan Halifax, the second author, joined the team as co-therapistand anthropological consultant. We could now combine ourbackgrounds in experimental psychiatry and medical anthropologyand view the data from a broad cross-cultural perspective. It wasin this process of interdisciplinary cross-fertilization, when wewere working as a therapeutic dyad, sharing observations andexchanging data, that the ideas expressed in this book started tocrystallize into their present form. Note: Although the Spring Grove psychedelic research continued on until the mid-1970's, it, too, finally came to an end for various reasons. Lack of new funding by the government, discouragement of the workers involved in not obtaining permission to carry out desired projects, continuing bad publicity resulting from clandestine use of psychedelics, and other factors could be cited. And so, by the late 1970's essentially all psychedelic research in North America had ceased, and what remained of European research was a mere ghost of the promising work of the 1950's and 1960's. -Peter Webster Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | The Psychedelic Library WT01-B34-71IA087-000628-B029-109http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/lsd/solomon.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122062107 text/html 3238HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 06:20:59 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Wednesday, 01-Jan-97 22:33:17 GMTContent-length: 3020 LSD, Transcendence and the New Beginning Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | The Psychedelic Library LSD, TRANSCENDENCE, AND THE NEW BEGINNING JAMES TERRILL, Ph.D. CHARLES SAVAGE, M.D. DONALD D.

There isno simple answer to this question. Early in our work with LSD atthe Mental Research Institute it became clear that there are noregular and predictable effects of LSD per se, but rather thatthe effects are the result of a complex interaction4 of the drug, thepsychological and physical environment, the personality structureof the subject and therapist, and the set or expectancy as towhat the drug would do. Judging from the literature on LSD, thispoint about the relativity of LSD effects has not beensufficiently emphasized (2). Our conclusions regarding the psychological effectsof LSD have developed out of a series of exploratory studies thatwere carried out at the Mental Research Institute over a two-yearperiod (1958-59). Ss have included 60 volunteers and 29psychiatric patients. Most of the volunteers Ss were professionalpeople (psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers) who tookthe drug, ostensibly, out of curiosity. The psychiatric patientswere, for the most part, already in regular psychotherapy andwere taking the drug as a part of their treatment. Many of our Sshave had more than one LSD experience. During some of the early work at the Instituteseveral ways of approaching the subject in the LSD state weretried, including the administration of psychological tests andthe utilization of various interview techniques. Experiments inthis regard led to the conclusion that any attempt on theexperimenter's part to impose a structured test or interview onthe situation had the effect of radically altering the subjectiveexperience of S. The most significant effects of the drug seemedto occur when S was allowed to follow his own spontaneous trainof thought. The technique of administration used with most ofSs, therefore, is based on an attempt to provide a relativelypermissive, comfortable and accepting atmosphere. Ss wereencouraged to give themselves up to the effects of the drug asmuch as possible. All the drug sessions were conducted in asmall, sound-proofed room that was very comfortably furnishedwith a couch, carpet, pictures on the wall, and a stereo recordplayer. Ss were usually provided with an opportunity to listen tomusic or look at visual stimuli An attempt was made to reduce theamount of stress to a minimum. Someone was with S during most ofthe day. He therefore had the opportunity to talk with someone ifhe wished, although it was made clear to each S that he need nottalk if he did not feel like it. The dosages used have ranged from 50 to 200micrograms, with the most frequent dosage being 100 micrograms. Volunteer Ss and patients were treated in much thesame manner, except that the patients entered the sessions with avery different set. The LSD sessions were presented to eachpatient as an adjunct to his regular treatment, and his therapistwas usually present during a part of the time. The rolerelationship between the experimenters and the patients wasnaturally quite different from the role relationship between theexperimenters and the professional volunteer Ss. When aprofessional volunteer takes LSD in the presence of a colleaguehe is frequently thrown into considerable conflict as to what hisrole should be. This often presents a rather difficult situationfor the person who is administering the drug as well. In describing the effects that we have observedunder these conditions and with these Ss, it is important todistinguish between two classes of effects. One class is theimmediate effects, i.e., those which occur within eight to twelvehours after ingestion of the drug. The other class consists ofthe more lasting effects, i.e., those which persist for anindeterminate period after the immediate effects have dissipated. In studying the immediate effects, the approach hasbeen to observe the subject's relatively spontaneous behaviorwhile he is under the influence of the drug and also to analyzethe tape recordings made of each drug session. Effects The immediate effects which have been observedcan roughly be classified into five categories: 1) Mood and affect; 2) Interpersonal behavior; 3) Sensory and perceptual effects; 4) Intellectual functioning and reality testing; 5) Intuitive-intellectual effects. In terms of mood and affect, Ss havedemonstrated a wide range of reactions. Often an emotionallability is seen which ranges from tearfulness to euphoria. Thereis frequently an increased intensity to emotions in general.Feelings of well-being or euphoria, which many subjects havereported, tend to merge into feelings of omnipotence. Sometimesthere appears to be an increase in anxiety; while at other timesanxiety is decreased, and there is a feeling that previouslythreatening things can be talked about. Ss tend to show anincreased concern with the feelings and events of the immediatemoment, and sometimes there is a marked lack of concern about thepast and future. In terms of interpersonal behavior, Sstypically have manifested an increased sensitivity to theirinteractions with others. In many Ss this sensitivity has takenthe form of being easily hurt or feeling neglected. With themajority of Ss there has been an enhancement of the relationshipwith the person who is conducting the experience. Sometimespatients have developed paranoid constructions about beingmanipulated. The following varieties of sensory andperceptual effects have been relatively common with our Ss:there is an increased sensitivity to sounds and visual stimuli ingeneral. Distortions of the body image (visual distortions whichare usually illusory but sometimes hallucinatory) also occur.There are synesthesias with all sorts of combinations ofsensations; e.g., music may produce visions of color, picturesmay produce sounds, and odors may produce visual and auditoryimages or somatic sensations. There are transformations of thetime sense, such as time standing still, racing backwards orforwards, or dragging interminably. The external world becomesunstable, receding and approaching, flowing and vibrating. In the area of intellectual functioning andreality testing, LSD usually has resulted in a lability ofthought processes which frequently has manifested itself as aflight of ideas. There often has been a marked disruption of theorganization of thoughts and concepts. In attempting to deal withthis disorganization, S has often come up with new, sometimesinsightful, ways of conceptualizing his experiences. Unless theLSD therapist is equally at home with both old and new ideas hemay overlook creative aspects of the patient's thinking and labelit all as merely confused or psychotic. The therapist's confusionmay in turn confuse the patient. There is still a fifth class of effects which couldbe termed intuitive-intellectual effects. Included in thiscategory are experiences such as a feeling of oneness, a feelingof "understanding" life and existence, religiousexperiences, transcendental experiences, or a strong inclinationto think along philosophical lines. Such experiences have beenreported relatively frequently and appear to be a combination ofboth emotional and intellectual functions. Patients who have hadvivid experiences of this type have tended to value them highlyand often have expressed the feeling that such experiences seemto have some sort of lasting beneficial effect. This list of immediate effects covers a wide range,and frequently S in a single drug session will experience a largenumber of them. It should be noted that many of the effectsmentioned are contradictory. In this connection it has beenobserved that S will often shift from one experience or emotionto its opposite in a very short time. Response Variation Individuals differed greatly in their responsesto LSD. At a given dosage some Ss reported that they experiencedlittle or nothing out of the ordinary, while others reportedextremely intense and unusual experiences. Of those who didreport significant effects, some experienced predominantlyunpleasant effects, while others felt the experience wasprimarily pleasant; some were principally concerned with changesin the body image, while others became preoccupied with estheticexperiences on philosophical issues. It was also noted that thesame individual might show considerable variation in his responseto LSD from one session to the next. In general we have felt that the more positivekinds of experiences have something to do with S's willingness orability to give himself up to the effects of the drug. If S isvery concerned about maintaining control or fighting the effectsof the drug, the experiences can be frightening, sometimesterrifying.5By and large, however, we have observed very few reactions thatcould be termed blatantly psychotic. It would probably be fairlyeasy to induce more psychotic-like behavior if Ss were put into amore stressful situation and made to feel more insecure.6 In studying the effectiveness of LSD as atherapeutic adjunct, attention has been focused on what kinds ofpossible lasting effects might occur as a result of one ormore LSD experiences. Often the more lasting effects seemdifficult for the patient to describe. A study of Ss' reportsalong with observations of their behavior suggests that thefollowing kinds of changes occur as a result of a series oftherapeutically oriented LSD sessions: S becomes less anxious,less rigid, more spontaneous, more tolerant of ambiguity, moreappreciative of esthetic and symbolic modes of expression, morecapable of enjoying intuitive, irrational experiences, and lessconcerned over the past and future. Whether these changes are ofa universal order remains a question for further investigation.It is conceivable that they are a function of the particularsample of Ss, many of whom tended toward emotional constriction,intellectualization and ruminative thinking. In addition to these general kinds of changes,there are specific changes that have to do with the individual'sdynamics. Often S may gain a new perspective on himself or gainan important insight into his defenses which results in a changein behavior. Sometimes, however, what the patient calls"insight" turns out to be an irrational, ineffable andpeculiar experience that seemed to have a very important personalmeaning to S. As an example of this, a man felt during hisinitial LSD experience that his joints were somehow grindingtogether. He felt that all of the rough edges in his joints wereground smooth, and this gave him a "well oiled" feelingwhich seemed to persist for weeks afterwards. One of the most intriguing aspects of the use ofLSD as in psychotherapy is that when positive changes haveoccurred they often seem to have occurred in terms of the person'svalue system rather than in terms of recovered memories,interpersonal insights and the like, as is usually the case withmore traditional forms of psychotherapy. Such changes areapparently in the direction of a higher valuation of esthetic,creative, philosophic and perhaps even religious interests. It should be pointed out that although the use ofLSD in therapy often results in changes that one would not getotherwise, this does not obviate the need for regularpsychotherapeutic procedures. Although the patient may makesignificant gains as a result of an LSD experience, we haveconcluded that the experience needs to be followed up withregular therapeutic sessions in order to work through theinsights that have been gained and the behavioral changes thathave been initiated. How effective is LSD as a psychotherapeutic agent?Ratings of improvement based on therapists' judgments and in somecases pre- and post-LSD psychological tests indicate that 15 ofthe 29 patients who received one or more LSD sessions benefitedtherefrom. This evidence is far from conclusive, however, sincethese patients were receiving regular therapy at the same timeand since no control group was utilized. Plans had been made atthe Mental Research Institute to undertake a more complete andwell controlled study of the therapeutic effectiveness of LSD,but unfortunately we have not yet been able to obtain sufficientfinancial support to carry these out. Although much has beenwritten on LSD as a therapeutic adjunct, there is still a dearthof well controlled studies with adequate measures of change. Comparable data are not available on ourprofessional volunteers. We were primarily interested in learningfrom these Ss their theoretical interpretation of theirexperiences and their judgment as to how LSD might best beutilized. We found it difficult to obtain post-LSD reports fromthese Ss, and their reports when obtained were oriented moretoward the personal experience rather than to theoreticalinterpretation. Even though these sessions were nottherapeutically oriented (though conducted in a therapeuticsetting) many professional Ss reported increased feelings ofwell-being and confidence. For example, one volunteer had theannoying habit of being late and consuming even more time withapologies. Since the LSD experience she has been observed to beless often tardy---and if late she is less guilt ridden andapologetic. Our work with LSD so far has perhaps raised morequestions than it has answered. One of the most important ofthese is the question of the relationship between personalityfactors and response to LSD. Our attempts to predict the kind ofLSD response a person would have, based on pre-LSD test andinterview data, have been discouraging. For example, threepatients had Holzman, TAT, and historical evidence from which theonly possible prediction was a psychotic break under LSD. On thecontrary, they seemed to have richly rewarding experiences.7 It seems clearthat LSD can provide very therapeutic experiences for some,although more research is needed to determine what kind of personis most likely to benefit. Another unanswered question is the relationshipbetween the nature of the experience and its aftereffects. Manyworkers have assumed that positive experiences are most helpfuland that transcendental experiences have the greatest therapeuticpotential. And yet there are instances where frightening orterrifying experiences have had beneficial aftereffects. Severalof our professional Ss have remarked that they believed that muchof the beneficial effect of LSD was due to a person's havingfaced a stressful and ambiguous situation and worked it throughsatisfactorily. Summary Exploratory LSD studies carried out at theMental Research Institute over a two-year period have suggestedthat LSD may prove to be a very powerful tool in speeding upmovement and overcoming resistances in psychotherapy. LSD didnot, on the other hand, show promise as a diagnostic tool. Whentherapeutic changes did occur they often were of a qualitativelydifferent order than those which occur in traditionalpsychotherapy. Under the influence of LSD, the individual goesthrough highly intense and unusual experiences which may wellchange the way in which he views his life. Footnotes 3.

"But I don't want to go among madpeople," Alice remarked. "Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat. "We're all mad here. I'm mad. You'remad." "How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice. "You must be," said the Cat, "or youwouldn't have come here." The Cat recognized what was not apparent to his Victoriancontemporaries. We are all part of a sick society, troubledmembers of a troubled world. Inevitably many people look to drinkfor salvation. For some it is an imperfect salvation, leading tothe couch, the hospital or the grave. Our plight is not unlike that of thenineteenth-century American Indian. His land was stolen, hislivelihood lost, his life forfeit, his language, customs andbeliefs were all deliberately undermined by the white man in thename of Christ, Culture and Civilization. Confronted withphysical and spiritual annihilation, the "red man"faced the future with grim foreboding. Many Indians turned todrink; but others turned to peyote, the Aztec counterpart of LSD.Seemingly they turned to peyote for inner strength. "Peyotegave them faith in a new power and a new road that they mightfollow from the path that was still in their hearts and mind to afeared and little understood future. The meeting of compellingforces, conscious and unconscious, of racial memories, the lossof tribal security and religious beliefs, added to the drive ofthe creative urge to make live in form and color the spirit ofthe Indian" (26).8 Slotkin (24) has reported that peyote hasremarkable physiological and psychological characteristics sothat when taken under proper conditions, the worshiperexperiences a revelation. In most cases this takes the form of avision. In some cases, it is a mystical state, the unification ofall immediate experience with "God." The connection of peyote and LSD is not only intheir psychophysiological properties; it happens also that bothhave been and are used in the treatment of alcoholism. As earlyas 1907 anthropologists (24) had reported that peyote was a curefor alcoholism; and in 1909 it was reported of the Winnebagosthat of the degenerate drunks of thirty years ago (1879), thosewho had turned to peyote had now become the most successful,healthy and outstanding members of the Winnebago community.9 Today (1960) recovery rates as high as 70 percentare being reported with the LSD therapy of alcoholics.10 Rather thanattempt a critical evaluation of these claims, I propose to dealhere with the question: How may LSD be of help to the alcoholic? Long ago William James (14) made the comment:"The cure for dipsomania is religomania." James quoted the following example from a drunkard,S. H. Hadley: "One Tuesday evening, I sat in a saloon inHarlem, a homeless, friendless dying drunkard. I had pawned andsold everything that would bring a drink. I could not sleepunless I was dead drunk. I had not eaten for days, and for fournights preceding I had suffered with delirium tremens or thehorrors from midnight until morning. I often said, 'I will neverbe a tramp. I will find a home in the bottom of the river.' Butthe Lord so ordered it that when the time did come, I was notable to walk one quarter of the way to the river. As I sat therethinking, I seemed to feel some great and mighty presence. I didnot know then what it was. I did learn afterwards that it wasJesus, the sinners' friend. I walked up to the bar and pounded itwith my fist 'til I made the glasses rattle. Those who stood bydrinking looked on with scornful curiosity. I said I would nevertake another drink if I died in the street." And so completewas Hadley's conversion that he never did take another drink. Asan example of a conversion reaction with LSD followed byabstinence: An alcoholic woman was given 150 micrograms of LSD;during her session she fell silent. She closed her eyes andseemed to fall into a trance. She woke with a start, and said:"I thought I had been killed. I thought I was tried, draggedin chains before God, condemned and taken out to beexecuted." She awoke feeling that she had been reprieved,that she had been saved.11 Another patient had had doses of 100 to 200micrograms of LSD without noticeable benefit. She laughed anddanced and listened to jazz records. She once described that shehad talked with the devil and had thrown in her lot with him. Soshe went the devil's way, increasing her drinking and taking"dope." Her final session was with 500 micrograms. Shetalked to the devil and told him: "Look, I tried it your wayand what has it got me?" She then had the feeling that"God" reached out his hand to her, and she was debatingwhether or not to grasp it. Following this experience, thepatient seemed to be in a psychotic or depersonalized state,became very depressed and planned suicide. She wrote a suicidenote in the midst of which she fell asleep, awoke in the morningand found she was still alive. The last word she had written inher suicide note was "church" and she thought perhaps amiracle had occurred. This patient's experience also illustrates the needfor careful aftercare in order to prevent suicide and psychosis.12 James' explanation of such experiences iscompelling: "The difference between a sudden and a gradualconvert is not necessarily the presence of a divine miracle inthe case of one and of something less divine in that of theother, but rather a simple psychological peculiarity, the factthat in the recipient of the more instantaneous grace we have oneof those subjects who are in possession of a large region inwhich mental work can go on subliminally and from which invasiveexperiences abruptly upsetting the equilibrium of the primaryconsciousness may come." Some of these patients (treated with LSD) equateforgiveness of sins with healing. The relentless conscience hasrelented and now the patient is freed of guilt: Thus the oldcycle of drink to still guilt, and drink giving rise to guilt, isbroken. With the slate wiped clean, the patient is free to dealwith the guilt of the moment rather than the guilt of theaccumulated years. Borrowing from analytic metapsychology wemight say the unconscious superego has become conscious, thoughit is still projected onto God rather than recognized as part ofthe self. Made conscious, it has lost some of its minatoryquality.13 The conversion reaction is only one type ofspiritual experience which might lead to recovery fromalcoholism; but there is still another and more basic one: themystic experience. James has suggested that one of themotivations for drinking is to achieve an actual mysticexperience: "The sway of alcohol over mankind isunquestionably due to its power to stimulate the mysticalfaculties of human nature, usually crushed to earth by the coldfacts and dry criticisms of the sober hour. Sobriety diminishes,discriminates and says No. Drunkenness expands, unites, and saysYes. It is in fact the great exciter of the Yes function in man.It brings its votary from the chill periphery of things to theradiant core. It makes him for the moment one with truth. Notthrough perversity do men run after it. To the poor andunlettered it stands in the place of symphony concerts and ofliterature; it is part of the deeper mystery and tragedy of lifethat whiffs and gleams of something that we immediately recognizeas excellent should be vouchsafed to so many of us only in thefleeting earlier phases of what in its totality is so degrading apoison. The drunken consciousness is one bit of the mysticconsciousness and our total opinion of it must find its place inour opinion of that larger whole." A long-shoreman put itmore simply: "If it weren't for whiskey, a poor man wouldnever know how a rich man feels." What, then, is the need for this mystic experienceor the transcendental experience? I believe that Fromm has givenus the answer. The alcoholic suffers from alienation, from the"sickness of the soul." All that has been worthwhile inhim has been projected onto the outer world, whether it be God ormanna. All that is base is retained within himself. "What ishis problem? Is it his drinking or is his drinking only a symptomof his real problem, his failure to live a meaningful life? Canman live with this degree of alienation from himself with so muchhate and so little love without feeling inferior anddisturbed?" (12). An illustration of this appeared in Lifesometime ago (1959) under the ironic title "The GoodLife." The people therein portrayed are so discontented withthemselves that they are continually racing after power saws,power motors, power boats. They cannot stand being withthemselves for a moment. They are alienated from themselves,alienated from their universe. Their transcendental or creativefunction is entirely blocked. Compare them with Wordsworth: Nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room; And hermits are contented with their cells; And students with their pensive citadels: Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom, Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom, High as the highest Peak of Furness Fells, Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells: In truth, the prison, unto which we doom Ourselves, no prison is: Unlike Wordsworth's ideal, modern man is so completelyimprisoned and alienated that for him the happy idle hours becomea rat race, and the time waster spans his weekend with drink.Many drinkers drink because their lives have lost purpose andmeaning. The old drunk might drown his sorrows; the modern drunkfills the emptiness of his existence. The alcoholic attempts to find himself, to fulfillhimself with drink; but the attempt fails and now the guilt overdrink and the wasted opportunity has him trapped. How then mayLSD help with this situation? It may provide a genuinetranscendental or mystic experience instead of the spurious one"bit of mystic consciousness" which the alcoholic hasbeen seeking. The artificial distinction between subject andobject, self and world, conscious and unconscious, ego, id andsuperego are all abolished. The person is at one with theuniverse. In his mystic selflessness he awakens with a feeling ofrebirth, often physically felt, and he is provided with a newbeginning, a new sense of values. He becomes aware of therichness of the unconscious at his disposal; the energies boundup in and by repression become available to him. One patient during LSD was drawn into a mysticexperience by the sound of a floor buffer turning round and roundin the passageway. She was drawn into a mystic participation withthe writer and with God. Yet she struggled for her individuality,even as Jacob wrestled with the Angel. Afterwards she said:"I recognized after this that I was strong, that I didn'tneed to be afraid, that I didn't need to drink." She and herhusband had been refractory members of Alcoholics Anonymous foryears. Now that she has stopped drinking the husband has startedagain.14 What happens when we seek transcendence with LSD?Once we open Pandora's box, we cannot always control what fliesout. The LSD experience may strip the patient of his capacity forlies and rationalization; he may see himself in all hispsychological nakedness. To expose him so violently and suddenlyto his shortcomings may only increase his guilt to an intolerabledegree and leave him very depressed. He should, one would think,have at least some "glimpse of heaven" if he is to be"saved." Some inner strength, some hope, somecreativity and some positive feelings must be revealed to him. This brings us forcibly to the dangers of LSDtreatment. The transcendental experience may open up avenues ofcreativity but it is not creativity itself; the experience ofrevelation while present may lead the person to confuse fantasywith actual achievement. Unless the constructive aspects of theexperience are sufficiently stressed, the individual may not havethe strength to face himself stripped of all his rationalizationsand projections, a "herring lying in the gutter" (2).Therefore, unless he has some awareness of "God's"mercy, unless he can come to terms with himself as through themystic experience, and unless he develops new and free energyfrom the unconscious to alter his life situation, he may developnot only a depression but a frankly paranoid reaction. Theintervention of the therapist makes the difference between ahelpful and a damaging experience. The therapist need arrogate noreligious attributes to himself; indeed he must resist thetemptation to believe in the omnipotent role in which he has beenplaced. For if he does not, he will then reinforce, rather thanalleviate the pathological alienation which he is striving toovercome. There is another danger which is shared with thepeyotists. For years government experts and anthropologists havebeen warring as to whether peyote is or is not harmful. In pointof fact the writer has been able to find authentic evidence ofonly one peyote psychosis, this on a brief personal visit to theNavajo reservation. But the circumstances are instructive. Thiswas a young man who had branched out on his own. He had his ownprivate stock of peyote which he was nipping on the side, insteadof taking it during the highly formalized peyote ritual. 15 In thesame manner self-experimentation with LSD is clearly dangerous.LSD strips off the protective barriers of the ego and allsensitivity and perceptivity is heightened. The effect of anyinput is heightened, so that the drug has great potential forgood and evil. It is possible to induce or reinforce unusualbeliefs which may alienate the individual from his society at atime when he desperately needs it. Finally, LSD causes an inflation of the ego whichmay be an effective antidote for low self-esteem. Lowself-esteem, of course, has many roots. All Good is projectedonto God; all Bad is retained in the form of original sin withinoneself. There are other problems that derive from the Protestantethic. There is the stress on the outward evidence of grace asseen by visible evidence of prosperity, the stress on socialmobility, the existential guilt arising from the fact that fewreach their actual potential: all this adds up to a sort of mass,low self-esteem, a cosmic sense of inferiority, which is actuallyincreased by material achievement and accession of materialgoods. Ordinary psychotherapy brings out a person's shortcomingsand not his assets. But LSD allows a person to face hisshortcomings with honesty, and at the same time experience someof the wealth and reservoirs which lie within him. We can perhapspromise that the Mute Inglorious Milton experience the rapturesfelt by Milton, even if he cannot write his poetry. We should also recall that Vergil guided Dante intothe Inferno and returned him safely, chastened and enlightened.Those who would use LSD should do as well for their patients. Case History of Excessive Drinking with ImprovementFollowing LSD This was a 30-year-old radiologist who consultedthe writer in 1959. He complained that for the past year he hadnightly drunk himself to sleep, and then awoke with nightmares inthe middle of the night. His wife would become enraged at beingawakened and he would spend the rest of the night crying. He wasdepressed, unable to work. However, his chief complaint, of yearsduration, was an inability to feel or experience. "It was asif I was inside a glass shell. I mean I could see out and peoplecould see in, but I couldn't talk or feel." The patient was an only child, whose mother haddied when he was an infant. He was raised by foster parents untilthe age of four and then repossessed by father and stepmother.His relations with them were distant. His father reportedlyinsisted on high standards of intellectual performance, alwaysblamed, never rewarded or praised. Raised as a strict Catholic,the patient married out of the Church and was cut off by hisfamily. He abandoned the Church but it made little difference: ashe expressed it: "When I was on a religious kick, it was'I'm a sinner'; and essentially now it's 'I'm a neurotic.'"His purgatory was in effect merely moved from the future into thepresent. Alienated from God, nature, man, church, mother andfamily, he tried for reconciliation by conquering. His friends hesubdued with words, his patients with his X-rays, and theuniverse with his theories. Only once in his life had he overcomehis alienation. During sexual relations with his secretary, outin the moonlight, he felt "At that instant I had contactedthe universe." He hoped for a repetition of this with hiswife, and had the unwisdom to tell her about it on theirhoneymoon. But he felt nothing for her, could not love her. Toadd to their misery she became pregnant and he had a psychoticbreakdown. She aborted but never forgave, never forgot norallowed him to forget. He wanted a reconciliation but his effortsto force it only estranged them further. The patient said that hehad taken to drink to recapture the experience, but it failed. Psychotherapy seemed futile; words were used ashostile ammunition and playthings; he fielded each interpretationperfectly and returned the appropriate riposte, for he had readand was well versed in Freud, Jung and Watts. Yet when he leftthe hour, he had forgotten everything. It was the patient'ssuggestion that LSD be tried, which was done after fourteenpreliminary psychotherapeutic interviews. He began the session by using the drug as aplatform to preach his private philosophy. "So anyway thissort of thing, Goedel's proof, the Heisenberg principle ofindeterminacy, the insolubility of any mechanical problem thatcontains more than two bodies by a method of other thansuccessive approximation.... There's me sub one and me sub twoand me sub one gets in the way of me sub two." In order to turn off this stream and direct himinward we tried some abstract paintings and then Bruckner."Anyway I'd like to hear a little Bruckner now. Oceanicfeelings. Da dum da da dum. That is what Bach did for a living,Bach did for kicks." Bruckner's music was an effective stimulus: thepatient became ill and then suddenly experienced the nightmare ofwhich he had complained. He shook with fear, trembled and sobbed:"I'm afraid, I'm afraid. I keep looking; there is nothingthere; what am I afraid of?" I replied: "Perhaps that'swhat you are afraid of: nothing." With this the nightmaredisappeared, and years later the patient reported that it hadnever returned. At that moment he reported a mysticenlightenment, a kind of satori. He experienced feeling,closeness with the therapist, with himself and the universe (and,after the session, with his wife). In the evening he telephonedto tell me how grateful he was. He had experienced completelysuccessful sexual relations for the first time. He began to pourhis energy into his work, and nightly drinking sessions were nolonger required. To the therapist he seemed profoundly changed, andfor the better. His wife, on the contrary, became much upset,bitter, angry and depressed. She reminded the patientcontinuously: "You're no different; besides it won't last;you'll see." A self-fulfilling prophecy. We thought torectify the situation by repeating the LSD experience with thepatient, by giving the wife an LSD experience, and then arranginga joint LSD session. The first two were accomplished, but not thethird. She refused, saying it was a terrible experience. (Duringthe LSD the observer would have thought she was having adelightful experience.) Eighteen months of intensive conjointfamily therapy were required before she could accept thepossibility of his being well. Three years after the first consultation we learnedthat he was a professor of radiology at a leading university; andthe couple was happily expecting a baby. Footnotes 8. Monroe Tsa Toke, from whomthis quotation is taken, has done paintings which areunquestionably the best illustration of the Peyote ritually andthe peyote visions. (back) 9. A controversy still ragesabout peyote and its value for alcoholism. Slotkin quotes Hensley[1908] with approval: Jilt [peyote] cures us of our temporal illsas well as those of a spiritual nature. It takes away the desirefor strong drink I myself have been cured of a loathsome diseasetoo horrible to mention. so have hundreds of others. Hundreds ofdrunkards have been dragged from their downward way. La Barrelhowever, is cynical about the antagonism of alcohol and peyote."One can eat lobsters one day and ice cream the next, butone ought not eat them the same day (15)." Radinss CrashingThunder (19) gives an eloquent account of his cure of chronicalcoholism with delirium tremens by the use of peyote. Radinhimself remained skeptical. "So completely did all those who joined thepeyote cult give up drinking that many Indians and whites were atfirst inclined to believe that this was a direct effect of thepeyote. However, this is an error. The correct explanation isthat John Rave, the leader of the cult, gave up drinking when hebecame a convert and included this renunciation of all liquors inthe cult which he so largely moulded and dominated. If anyadditional proof were needed it can be found in the fact that asRave's personal influence decreased and as the membershipincreased the number of people who drank liquor and ate peyote atthe same time increased." But Radin overlooks the fact thatJohn Rave gave up drinking because of peyote! (back) 10. The figure of 70 percentis taken from Hoffer (2) and covers a five-year period, The dataon which the present paper is based, however, derive from aseries of 20 hospitalized alcoholics (in addition to the M.R.I.patients). They were treated in the same manner described byTerrill except the dosage ranged from 150 to 500 micrograms.Fifty percent had stopped drinking at the time of this symposium.Unfortunately follow-ups could not be obtained. (back) 11. Following this experienceshe stopped drinking, became interested in psychotherapy and Ireferred both her and her husband to a psychiatrist. He was anex-alcoholic who had a spontaneous religious conversion and heinsisted hers was synthetic and not genuine, Three years later hefinally proved his point. My sympathies are somewhat with her.After listening to him on the phone for long periods in the lateevening I have often found a drink very soothing. (back) 12. After a period ofaccelerated drinking, dope taking and dalliance, this patientstraightened out, returned to the church, and according to lastreport (1961) had made a good adjustment for two years. (back) 13. The mere evocation of thesuperego into conscious form is not in itself curative. It occursin terrifying fashion in delirium tremens, and can occur interrifying fashion with LSD. In the writer's opinion it is thesupport of the therapist and his ability to maintain contact withthe patient that makes the difference in the outcome. (back) 14. She has since found itprudent to bolster her new found strength with antabuse, tocounteract her husband's importuning her to drink. (back) 15. The writer has found thatwarnings against self-experimentation (22) are ineffective: it islike telling children not to put beans up their noses.

JACKSON, M.D. The experience of LSD and the new beginning issimilar to what the existentialist Ellenberger (10) has calledthe Encounter: "Encounter is, in general, not so much thefortuitous meeting and first acquaintance of two individuals, butrather the decisive inner experience resulting from it for one(sometimes for both) of the two individuals. Something totallynew is revealed, new horizons open, one's Weltanschauung isrevised and sometimes the whole personality is restructured. Suchencounters are manifold, perhaps with a philosopher who reveals anew way of thinking, or with a man of great life experience, ofpractical understanding of human nature, of heroic achievementsor independent personality. An encounter can bring a suddenliberation from ignorance or illusion, enlarge the spiritualhorizon and give new meaning to life." To the writer nothing better exemplifies how LSDcan be useful to us. It can provide us with an encounter, a newexperience which will enlarge our horizon and give new meaning tolife. These experiences are a part not just of therapy, but oflife itself. While in analytic training, I took a three-dayvacation during which I tried a new role—that of a salesman.I happened to meet another salesman and played the role quiteenjoyably for the whole weekend. For my analyst this was anacting out of the transference, but I think this view expressesonly one side of the coin. Not being a doctor, not being apsychiatrist even for a few days forced me to develop differentsets of behavioral tactics and with them a different aspect of methat was enriching. Chancing to meet another person with whom Iwas compatible reinforced the behavioral change. I feel thatthere is an analogy in this experience to what can happenwith LSD. The new experience under LSD can be reinforced bysocial experiences and further experience with the therapist.Without this reinforcement the LSD experience gradually pales anddies away; it becomes a memory, not a personality change. Not everyone is grateful for a new experience.Galileo's contemporaries refused to look at the moons of Jupiterthrough his new telescope. And some of our contemporaries refuseto contemplate the intricacies of the LSD experience, or havingcontemplated them are unable to process the new data. For themthe experience is unpleasant as is the inability to handle newdata. For many this experience cannot be handled, and leads tograndiosity and rationalizations. Some of our professional subjects and patients,learned philosophers, psychologists and psychiatrists, are unableto relax and enjoy the revelations of LSD. Instead of marveling:"My God, I've never been in this land before," theyexplain, interpret and deny all in terms of their conventionalframework. Instead of enjoying the beautiful simplicity ofplanetary motion, they pile epicycle on epicycle. They clingdesperately to the old familiar terminology; they maintain adeath grip on their "cathexes" and"repressions"; and clinging to the old, they cannot letgo and be intrigued with the new. Acute discomfort is their lot,if they cannot hammer their data onto the cross (chi-square) oftheir old methodology.16 The early references to the LSD experience as aschizophrenic-like psychosis were, in my opinion, the naturaloutgrowth of casting the new in the old mold. If the therapistviews the experience as a psychosis he unwittingly helps thepatient develop a psychosis not through suggestion alone but alsobecause he cannot offer the patient a framework to handle the newexperience. The therapist must furnish adequate help inprocessing the new data, or a paranoid reaction, ranging fromtransitory suspicion or accusation to paranoia of several months,may set in. In early work with LSD, when the therapist failedto provide the Encounter, psychotic reactions were inevitable.This led to overgeneralization of the effects of psychotomimeticdrugs. (More accurately, perhaps, we should speak of psycholyticdrugs given by psychosogenic therapists.) The therapist providedthe paranoid reaction by withholding vital information; just aswith mental illness sui genesis, society and the therapistfoster the paranoid reaction by withholding vital data. And oftenthe patient fosters this by refusing to extract the data or,having extracted them, refusing to look at them. Bavelas (3) has devised ingenious experiments todemonstrate the effect of withholding data. He has giveninsolvable problems to a highly motivated, highly intelligentgroup of engineers; they were encouraged to solve the problem,and inevitably came up with an erroneous answer. Theconfrontation that they had the erroneous solution and that theycould not have solved the problem, far from providingenlightenment, only led them to hold to their false solution withdelusional and dogmatic intensity, increasingly buttressed byfalse rationalizations. Having suffered once from the withholding of data,they now refused to process the new data. Could they then havebeen tested with LSD would they then have had suddenenlightenment, or would they have developed fixed paranoic ideasof being played with? Almost surely it would have depended on theEncounter with the therapist. We speak of a new experience with LSD. What does anew experience mean and how can it be beneficial in specificterms? Let me give an example of a patient, a professor, a man ofbrilliant promise yet suffused with hopelessness because of anabiding fear of insanity. He had once the misfortune to consult aworld-famous analyst about a marital problem, and had been toldthat he was a pseudoneurotic schizophrenic and unanalyzable. Thishad been a somewhat less than happy encounter. Given a hopelessprognosis and refused treatment, he was left for years toalternate between lethargy and desperation. In desperation heconsulted me and in desperation we tried LSD after a long periodof counseling and preparation. His first session (100 micrograms)was uneventful, devoted mainly to a preliminary survey of theunknown and the establishment of trust in the situation. In thenext session (150 micrograms) he plunged boldly into thepsychotic state, became wildly agitated and was forciblyrestrained. Together we came face to face with the insanity hehad feared and together we mastered it. He was able to take thewraps off and let himself go because he knew that he and I couldsee it through together. Instead of finding nothing but themonster of pseudoneurotic schizophrenia thinly veiled inprofessorial robes, he found a phantom which he could discard,and he also found his real self, a living human being. A far morefortunate encounter than his first. Sometimes this may be followed by depression. Ithas happened where families have not been able to support the newexperience and the new changes, where for them the new beginningis fraught with danger.17Now when we give LSD we insist that the marital partner beinvolved in the situation lest divorce or depression supervene.Another patient had a remarkable —andunfortunate—experience. He was verbally attacked so roundlyby his depressed wife that within a month's time she had broughthim lower than when he started. Two years of family therapy wererequired to restore what had been lost in a single day.18 The Encounter may be illustrated by the followingbrief case history. The patient was a 35-year-old accountant who hadbeen in intensive psychotherapy for five years because of chronicdepression and crippling obsessive traits. He had had a briefpsychotic reaction and had made an abortive attempt atself-castration. His oldest sister was a semi-invalid; he wasplaced in a position of great responsibility for her; yet he hadalways to be deferential and to accept continuous criticism. Hehad no pleasant experiences of adolescence, and no dating. At thebeginning of therapy he complained of intense loneliness. Bothpatient and therapist were frustrated by his meager progress. Hissolid intellectual defenses were refractory to interpretation.Occasionally he made efforts to improve his isolated socialposition; each time he neatly sabotaged the effort. He improvedslightly, worked a little better, and became a little lessdepressed; but if anything his isolation and loneliness wereintensified. Because of the complete affect block we decidedthat he should have LSD (despite the history of a previouspsychotic break). He agreed and was given 100 micrograms of LSD.He seemed more relaxed and a bit more happy. Yet, though wefocused on his relations to his father, there was little affect,little recall and no fantasy. The writer thought that surely there must be somefantasy available in this constricted personality. What kind of afantasy might such a boy, with such a father, have had? Surely hewould have been pleased to have buried his father in a shallowgrave, supine; and if Father died like Balzac's M. Beaucoq withhis lance erect (because he was hanged) so much the better; andif he reverentially mowed the grass over his father's grave, andif each passage of the blades over his father's grave cut alittle deeper, there might be a gradual diminution, or shearingoff of the parental authority, a trimming of the father imago. Ishared this fantasy with the patient and suggested that he mightwell have had such a one. The effect was electric. He explodedwith laughter. The feelings and fantasies about father camepouring out, as though Moses had smote the rock. For the balanceof the afternoon we reveled in an exchange of fantasies about hisfather. From that day he was a changed man. Previously hehad been a Milquetoast at work, whom everyone pushed around. Nowhe became self-assertive and positive. He no longer let advantagebe taken of him. He was poised and comfortable. It occurred tohim he might do better working by himself. During the next LSDsession (150 micrograms) he was able to continue the work of thepreceding session. With the dread father laid to rest, he couldrelive his adolescent days with the therapist, not as they hadbeen, but as they might have been. He expressed for the firsttime the desire for a girl. In the month following, astoundingchanges developed. He developed a sense of humor; he becameefficient; he began to date; he made plans to leave his job andset up his own business, and this he actually accomplished. Heenjoyed dating and experienced intense sexual feelings. Intherapy he expressed the desire for marriage and children. Hestruck up a friendship with another man, with whom he discussedtopics formerly tabu: sex and women. Following LSD he began to have intense dreams,sometimes pleasurable, often in color, which he had not hadbefore. In seventeen (now nineteen) years of practicingpsychotherapy I have never seen as much change in an individualwith a rigid obsessional character. The change has beenpermanent. While it has leveled off, there has been nobacksliding since our first Encounter using LSD.19 Summary The LSD experience is considered a complextransaction of the amount of material given, the psychologicaland physical environment, the set or expectancy and thepersonality of both the patient and therapist. According to thestructuring of the situation, a psychotic-like (psychotomimetic),a psychotherapeutic (in the sense of facilitating psychotherapy),or a transcendental reaction may evolve. The psychotic-likereaction may emerge where the intent is to produce and studypsychoses, where excess stress and insufficient security isprovided, and where the therapist fails to help the patientprocess new and unfamiliar data. The psychotherapeutic reactionis an intensification of the conventional therapeutic process andleads to an intensification of the traditional psychotherapeuticvalues of recall, reliving, insight and emotional release. Thesemay be experienced where they had not been before theadministration of LSD. The transcendental reaction is a temporaryloss of differentiation of the self and the outer world. It maylead to a lessening of alienation, to a rediscovery of the self,to a new set of values, to the finding of new potential forgrowth and development and to a new beginning. This may befollowed by a change in behavioral patterns, as in the cessationof drinking. If the environment (including therapist) supportsthese changes, they may become a part of the patient's habitualreaction patterns. Otherwise, the social matrix will remold thepatient and the LSD experience will become a memory rather thanan integral part of the personality. An historical paradigm of the therapeutic use ofLSD-25 is found in the use of peyote by the Plains Indians, inthe treatment of alcoholism. Footnotes 16. The logical conclusionof Jackson's remarks would be to jettison all previous models.However, in the discussion he implied that a model borrowed frompsychoanalysis and existentialism might be constructed. VikterTausk (25), in his essay on the origin of the influencingmachine, describes the human need for causal explanations and thefantastic distortions of familiar explanations to processunfamiliar data. (back) 17. This is a danger common tomany therapies, including psychoanalysis (13). (back) 18. See footnote 7 (firstpatient) and Savage's illustrative case history, above. (back) 19 Dr. Jackson's fantasy mayhave been suggested by one of our patients who had thehallucinatory experience of roasting his father over a slow firein Hell, experiencing the most intense glee as he basted him.Despite its effectiveness one is hard put to explain its success.But it seems to have combined an accurate representation of thepatient's feelings with complete nonsense. Thus it derives muchof its force from its absurdity, much as the Zen masters drive apoint home by a seeming absurdity. The combination of the LSD andthe complete nonsense allowed the patient to see the completeabsurdity of his continued subservience to his father, to getbeyond it and to achieve the new beginning. A sensibleinterpretation would probably have remobilized intellectualdefenses and demolished the whole LSD experience. (We havelearned [1962] that this former patient is now president of hismen's service club.) (back) References 1. Abramson, H. A. "Lysergic aciddiethylamide (LSD-25).

UNGER, Ph.D.* from: Psychiatry: Journal for the Study ofInterpersonal Processes Vol. 26, No. 2, May, 1963. � The William Alanson WhitePsychiatric Foundation. . . . our normal waking consciousness . . . is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousness entirely different.... No account of the universe in its totality can be final which leaves these . . . disregarded. How to regard them is the question—for they are so discontinuous with ordinary consciousness.—William James. (1) In recent years, how to regard the "forms ofconsciousness entirely different" induced by mescaline,LSD-25, and psilocybin has posed a seemingly perplexing issue.For articulate self-experimenters from Mitchell to Huxley,mescaline has provided many-splendored visual experiences, or alife-enlarging sojourn in "the Antipodes of the mind"(2). For Stockings, it may be recalled, mescaline producedcontrolled schizophrenia (3)—a thesis which earned theBronze Medal of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association andapparently inaugurated, in conjunction with the advent of LSD-25,a period of concerted chemical activity in the exploration andexperimental induction of "model psychoses" (4). Incounterpoint, this same so-called "psychotomimetic" LSDhas increasingly found use as a purposeful intervention or"adjuvant" in psychotherapy (5). The recently arrived"magic mushroom," psilocybin, has been similarlyequivocal—"psychotogenic" for some,"mysticomimetic" for others (6). The present paper willreview the literature on drug experience—paying particularattention to the effects of extradrug variables, for therealization of the extent of their potential influence has onlyrecently crystallized, and promises to reduce some of theabundant disorder in this area. The phenomenon of drug-associated rapid personalityor behavior change will be discussed in some detail. For example,a number of different alcoholic treatment facilities, especiallyin Canada, have reported, for many of their patients, completeabstinence after a single LSD session (7). More generally,neurotic ailments over the full range have been described aspractically evaporating (8). Given this picture, and the presentstate and practice of the therapeutic art, it is not surprisingto find at least one psychiatrist envisioning ". . . masstherapy: institutions in which every patient with a neurosiscould get LSD treatment and work out his problems largely byhimself" (9). James would have been much attracted by the"spectacular and almost unbelievable results" (10)reported on the modern drug scene; and, in fact, theirresemblance to the "instantaneous transformations"attendant on "mystical" religious conversions—which he discussed so eloquently—may well be more thansuperficial and seems worthy of attention. The Equivalent Action of Mescaline, LSD-25, and Psilocybin Since the evidence and testimony accumulatedover the years on the separate drugs will be treatedinterchangeably, this raises a preliminary point of someimportance. Although the conclusion was delayed by bothdissimilarities in their chemical structure and differing modesof introduction to the scientific community, it is now rathercommonly adjudged that the subjective effects of mescaline,LSD-25, and psilocybin are similar, equivalent, orindistinguishable. Both Isbell and Abramson have administered LSDand psilocybin in the same study; Wolbach and his co-workers haveadministered all three. All have found that their subjects wereunable to distinguish between the drugs (11). The reported equivalence in subjective reactionsseems quite consistent—or at least notinconsistent—with present pharmacodynamic knowledge. Studiesof radioactively tagged mescaline and LSD indicate that thecompounds largely disappear from the brain in relatively shortorder—in fact, at about the same time that the first"mental phenomena" make their appearance (12). Hence,it has been tentatively suggested that the characteristiceffects, which persist for a relatively long period, are to beattributed not to the action of the drug itself but to some asyet unidentified aspect of the chain of events triggeredby drug administration. Isbell, observing the "remarkablysimilar" reactions to LSD and psilocybin, hypothesized"some common biochemical or physiological mechanism" tobe responsible for the effects—that is, that the variouscompounds share a final common path (13). The most direct supportfor this inference of biological identity in ultimate mechanismof action has come from cross-tolerance studies wherein subjectsrendered tolerant to one drug—that is, nonreactive afterrepeated administrations —have then been challenged by adifferent drug. Present indications are that cross-toleranceamong the drugs does in fact develop (14). This is not intended to suggest that a drugexperience is invariable among subjects—quite the contraryhas been the case. In fact, experiences even for the same subjectdiffer from one session to the next (15). But when relevantextradrug variables are controlled, the within-drug variance isapparently coextensive with between-drug variance, and isattributable to ubiquitous personality differences; in otherwords, while a range of reactions is reported to all ofthe drugs, there is no reaction distinctively associated with anyparticular drug. Extradrug variables, which have beenuncontrolled and largely unrecognized until recently, areapparently responsible for much of the variance erroneouslyattributed to specific drug action. Invariant Drug Reactions By common consent, the drug experience isparanormal—that is, beyond or outside the range of thenormal, the everyday. Exclamations of "indescribable"recurrently appear in the literature. However, wheneverdescriptions are essayed, there is relative unanimity aboutcertain features. These, it may be said, are attributable to thedrug administration, per se, independent of the personality ofthe subject, the setting, or the experimenter's or subject'sexpectations. A sampling from the literature of subjectivereports and testimony may communicate, or at least transmit theflavor of, these invariant reactions. First, and perhaps most easily conveyed, is thecharacteristic of the drug experience called by Ellis a"saturnalia" or "orgy" of vision (16).Subsequent authors have been only slightly more restrained: The predominance of visual experiences in the picture is striking— not only on account of the persistent hallucinations and illusions, but by the impressiveness of seen real objects, their shape and color.... (17) There is a great intensification of light; this intensification is experienced both when the eyes are closed and when they are open.... With this intensification of light there goes a tremendous intensification of color, and this holds good of the outer world as well as of the inner world (18). When I closed my eyes . . . I experienced fantastic images of an extraordinary plasticity. These were associated with an intense kaleidoscopic play of colors (19). Changes in the perception of visual form occur in virtually everyone.... Consistently reported [are] the plasticity which the forms of the visual world assume . . . the emphasis upon play of light and color, as though light were alive (20). A second invariant set of drug reactions, moredifficult to characterize or communicate, has been called,variously, depersonalization, dissociation, levitation,derealization, abnormal detachment, body image distortion oralteration, and the like: There is an awareness of an abnormal distance between the self and what happens in its consciousness; on the other hand, the experience of an abnormal fusion of subject and object (21). My ideas of space were strange beyond description. I could see myself from head to foot as well as the sofa on which I was lying. About me was nothingness, absolutely empty space. I was floating on a solitary island in the ether. No part of my body was subject to the laws of gravitation (22). What happens in the LSD experience? . . . the universe is overtly structured in terms of an identification between the perceiver and the thing perceived. You hear the music way off down in a cavern, and suddenly it is you who is way down in the cavern. Are you now the music, or is the music now at the mouth of the cavern? Did you change places with it? And so on? (23) Some degree of depersonalization probably occurs during every LSD experience . . . the detachment of the conscious self, a sort of detached ego. This self is in touch with reality and is in touch with the self experiencing the psychic phenomena (24). Regardless of whatever else a drug experience maybe reported to include, alterations in visual experience and inexperience of self, as detailed above, may be predicted withconsiderable confidence (25). In connection with the so-called dissociationphenomenon— and in view of the connotations of the"psychotomimetic" and "intoxicant"labels—it may be well to emphasize that drug experiences, atleast for most nonpsychotic subjects, do not seem to approximatedelirium: The mescal drinker remains calm and collected amid the sensory turmoil around him; his judgment is as clear as in the normal state.... (26) It is difficult to classify the state of consciousness during the intoxication which allows such self-observation and, at times, seems to foster detachment and self-scrutiny (27). . . . in a state of clear consciousness [the subject] . . . is able to describe in detail the manifold mental changes daring drug intoxication (28). The nondelirious condition of normal volunteers, atleast with low to moderate drug dosage, has been objectivelyattested by their ability to perform psychological tests. Themost exhaustive series of investigations along this line has beencarried out for LSD by Abramson and his associates (29).Generally, although not consistently, subjects show slightdecrements in performance—at least some of which may well beattributable to an altered state of attention-motivation-affect.However, the test setting itself seems to contaminate the drugexperience; Savage, among others, has noted "a less profoundeffect when subjects are kept busy doing psychologicaltests...." (30) Another and final set of seemingly invariantreactions concerns the retrospective impressiveness of the drugexperience. The succession of testimonials to this effect is astriking and salient feature of the history of research withthese compounds: In some individuals, the "ivresse divine" is rather an "ivresse diabolique." But in either case . . . one looks "beyond the horizon" of the normal world and this "beyond" is often so impressive or even shocking that its after-effects linger for years in one's memory (31). The experience of the intoxication, as Beringer also observed, makes a particularly deep impression.... The personality is touched to its core and is led into provinces of psychic life otherwise unexplored; light is shed on boundaries otherwise dark and unrevealed and in this some aid may be given to Existenzerhellung (illumination of existence) (32). . . . most subjects find the experience valuable, some find it frightening, and many say that it is uniquely lovely.... For myself, my experiences with these substances have been the most strange, most awesome, and among the most beautiful things in a varied and fortunate life (33). To be shaken out of the ruts of ordinary perception . . . this is an experience of inestimable value to everyone and especially to the intellectual . . . the man who comes back through the Door in the Wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out (34). . . . the whole experience is (and is as) a profound piece of knowledge. It is an indelible experience; it is forever known. I have known myself in a way I doubt would have ever occurred except as it did (35). The "Psychotomimetic" Label After the above renditions, a querulous readermay be concerned about the appellation "psychotomimeticdrugs." So are many contemporary researchers and therapists,too numerous to mention. Holliday has provided a trenchantanalysis of "how the semantics in the field ofpsychopharmacology became so confused and generallymisleading" (36); here, only a few points will be noted. Early mescaline investigators clearly temperedtheir comparisons between the mescal-induced state and thehallucinations and dissociations of endogenous psychosis. As farback as 1930, it was found that when chronic schizophrenicssuffering from persistent hallucinations were given mescal, theydistinguished the mescal phenomena, remarked on their appearance,and usually blamed them on the same persecutors who had molestedthem before (37). Kluver, though he foresaw and extensivelydiscussed the "model" values of mescal, persisted incalling it "the divine plant" (38). It was apparentlydifficult to consider a sacramental substance—"thecomfort, healer, and guide of us poor Indians . . . the greatteacher" (39)—as unequivocally psychotomimetic. With LSD, a laboratory-born drug having no historyto contend with, the situation changed. The adventurous Hofmann,on that fateful day in 1943, started his self-experiment with 250micrograms of LSD, thinking, as he put it, that such a smallamount would probably be harmless. His response to this quitelarge dose—in terms of present-day experimentalstandards— was as follows: I noted with dismay that my environment was undergoing progressive change. Everything seemed strange and I had the greatest difficulty in expressing myself. My visual fields wavered and everything appeared deformed as in a faulty mirror. I was overcome by a fear that I was going crazy, the worst part of it being that I was clearly aware of my condition. The mind and power of observation were apparently unimpaired (40). Hofmann went on to list, as his most markedsymptoms, visual disturbances, motor restlessness alternatingwith paralysis, and a suffocating sensation, and added:"Occasionally I felt as if I were outside my body. My 'ego'seemed suspended in space. .. ." (41) Stoll, who in 1947 reported experimentalconfirmation of Hofmann's experience, is widely reputed to havewarned informally of a case of suicide as the aftermath of anexperimental trial. The most common accounts thereafter had apsychotic female subject committing suicide two weeks after theadministration; or, in another version, a subject committingsuicide after the drug had been administered without herknowledge. At any rate, this story, though itself never appearingin print, is referred to in one form or another in nearly all ofthe early work with LSD; it apparently influenced experimenterattitudes for a number of years. For many and varied reasons, too involved to tracehere, the initial formulation of the "model psychosis"properties of LSD engendered enormous investigative enthusiasm.In this climate, latent reservations on the score ofpsychotomimesis tended to go unvoiced. In the more recent,postenthusiasm era, however, reservations have been more or lessvigorously expressed—for example: There are considerable differences between LSD-induced and schizophrenic symptoms. The characteristic autism and dissociation of schizophrenia are absent with LSD. Perceptual disturbances due to LSD differ from those due to schizophrenia and, as a rule, are not true hallucinations. Finally, disturbances of consciousness following LSD do not resemble those occurring in schizophrenia (42). Many alternatives to the"psychotomimetic" characterization of"hallucinogenic" agents have recently been proposed. In1957, Osmond offered, among others, "psychelytic"(mind-releasing) and "psychedelic" (mind-manifesting)(43). Other investigators have proposed consciousness-expanding,transcendental, emotionalgenic, mysticomimetic, and so forth. Itbecomes ever more apparent, though, that old labels never die(44). Variable Drug Reactions and Extradrug Variables It may probably be stated as a pharmacopoeiascommonplace that the effects of a drug administration of any kindare likely to be compounded by factors other than specificpharmacologic action. Often this is attributed to"personality," to individual differences (45). However,though there have been as yet very few controlled investigationsin the case of the drugs considered here, it has becomeabundantly clear from the systematic variability reportedin subject and patient reactions—in both the affective andideational dimensions of drug experience—that factors otherthan "personality" are also at issue. Affective reactions attendant on a drugadministration have varied, according to reports, all the wayfrom hyperphoric ecstasy to unutterable terror—though notwith all investigators. The opinion leader Hoch, through a decadeof observations, consistently maintained: LSD and mescaline disorganize the psychic integration of the individual.... (46) . . . mescaline and LSD are essentially anxiety-producing drugs. . . . (47) The following interchange was recorded at the 1959conference on the use of LSD in psychotherapy held under theauspices of the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation: Hoch: Actually, in my experience, no patient asks for it [LSD] again. Katzenelbogen: I can say the same. Denber: I have used mescaline in the office . . . and the experience was such that patients said, "Once is enough." The same thing happened in the hospital. I asked the patients there if, voluntarily, they would like to take this again. Over 200 times the answer has been "No" (48). Subsequently, Malitz also stated: None of our normal volunteers wanted to take it [LSD] again (49). In contrast, DeShon and his co-workers reported theresults of the first LSD study done with normal subjects in thiscountry as follows: ... anxiety was infrequent, transient, and never marked.... All subjects were willing to repeat the test (50). The experience of other investigators has beensimilar: During the past four years we have administered the drug [LSD] hundreds of times to nonpsychotics in doses up to 225 micrograms. . . . Those who have participated in these groups are nearly always definitely benefited by their experiences. Almost invariably they wish to return and to participate in new experiments (51). . . . few patients discontinue treatment, in fact, enthusiasm and eagerness to continue are among the features of LSD patients (52) . The rapidly expanding use of LSD inpsychotherapeutic contexts has provided highly revealing clues tothe patterning of extradrug variability. Busch and Johnson werethe first to report administering LSD to neurotic patients whosetherapy had "stalled" and whose prognosis was"dim." The result was "a reliving of repressedtraumatic episodes of childhood," with "profound"influence on the course of therapy (53). Sandison and hiscolleagues also found that LSD "produces an upsurge ofunconscious material into consciousness" (54), and that"repressed memories are relived with remarkableclarity" (55)—with therapeutically beneficialconsequences. Since these early reports, wheneverpsychoanalytically oriented therapists have employed LSD,practically without exception the patient relives childhoodmemories. The interesting point is that this phenomenon haspractically never been noted in the experimentalliterature! Jungian therapists, on the other hand, haverepeatedly found that their patients have"transcendental" experiences—a state beyondconflict—often with rapid and dramatic therapeutic results.As a matter of fact, in an amusing and somewhat bemused account,Hartman has described his LSD-using group comprised of twoFreudians and two Jungians, in which the patients of the formerreport childhood memories, while those of the latter have"transcendental" experiences. In addition, for Jungianpatients, the transcendental state is associated with"spectacular" therapeutic results, while for Freudians,should such a state "accidentally" occur, no suchspectacular consequence is observed (56). While not from a therapeutic setting, the reportswhich have emanated from Harvard are noteworthy on the score ofideational content. Under psilocybin, Harvard subjects do notrelive their childhood experiences, but grapple with age-oldparadoxes: . . . the problem of the one and the many, unity and variety, determinism and freedom; mechanism and vitalism; good and evil; time and eternity; the plenum and the void; moral absolutism and moral relativism; monotheism and polytheism and atheism. These are the basic problems of human existence.... We need not wonder that the Indians called the mushroom sacred and gave it a name which means "the flesh of the god" (57). Without multiplying or belaboring divergencesfurther, it should be apparent that affective reactions andideational content may be systematically variabledimensions of drug experience; in addition, the possibletherapeutic uses or consequences, however these are conceived,seem clearly variable. Once these "facts" are arrayed,in Baconian fashion, they nearly speak for themselves. At theJosiah Macy conference, the emerging consensus was perhaps bestexpressed by Savage: This meeting is most valuable because it allows us to see all at once results ranging from the nihilistic conclusions of some to the evangelical ones of others. Because the results are so much influenced by the personality, aims, and expectations of the therapist, and by the setting, only such a meeting as this could provide us with such a variety of personalities and settings. It seems clear, first of all, that where there is no therapeutic intent, there is no therapeutic result. . . . I think we can also say that where the atmosphere is fear-ridden and skeptical, the results are generally not good.... This is all of tremendous significance, for few drugs are so dependent on the milieu and require such careful attention to it as LSD does (58). The same conclusion has come from experimentalquarters as well—for example: [The effect] of hallucinogens is not limited to any single agent since, in addition to psilocybin, we have seen it with LSD-25 and mescaline. The environmental setting in which the drug is administered . . . affects the emerging behavior pattern. This factor may account for variations in results with different investigators. Our hospital setting, with the subject, a paid volunteer, receiving an unknown agent, in an experimental framework surrounded by unfamiliar doctors and nurses, differs markedly from the mystical setting which Wasson observed.... Only one of our subjects reported what might be described as a transcendental experience.... The differences in expectation and setting between these two grossly divergent groups may account in part for the disparity in their responses (59). More specifically, anxiety in the therapist orexperimenter about administering the drug, about "inducingpsychosis," seems likely to render the experienceanxiety-ridden for the subject. Abramson has flatly declared:"The response of the subject . . . will depend markedly uponthe attitude of the therapist.... In particular, if the therapistis not anxious about the use of the drug, anxiety in the patientwill be much decreased" (60). Hyde has reported that"impersonal, hostile, and investigative attitudes"arouse hostile and paranoid responses (61). Sandison has observedthat the occurrence of anxiety seems largely to depend on"what the patient is told beforehand [as well as] rumors andmyths current among patients and staff, or even in the press,about hallucinogenic drugs" (62). Huxley had intimated thisbefore it became clarified in the psychiatric literature: . . . the reasonably healthy person knows in advance that, so far as he is concerned, mescaline is completely innocuous.... Fortified by this knowledge, he embarks upon the experience without fear—it: other words, without any disposition to convert an unprecedented strange and other than human experience into something appalling, something actually diabolical (63). That the positive or negative character of theexperience can be systematically directed, overriding evenpersonality factors, seems now to have been fairly conclusivelydemonstrated. With "adequate" preparation—that is,with the specific intent of rendering drug experiences"positive"—approximately 90 percent of thesubjects or patients, in each of the two most recent studies,reported at least a "pleasant" or "rewarding"session, and nearly as many called it "an experience ofgreat beauty" or something equally superlative (64). In content, as in affect, subjects apparentlyrespond to the implicit or explicit suggestion or expectation ofthe therapist or experimenter. The Harvard subjects were preparedfor their metaphysical binges, it may be noted, with suchassigned readings as the "Idols of the Cave" parable inPlato's Republic and passages from The Tibetan Book ofthe Dead. The preparation of psychotherapy patients hardlyneeds specification. Finally, what may be said about therapeuticimplications?— given the fact that the compounds underdiscussion may induce a powerful paranormal experience whoseaffective and ideational content can be guided. Only perhaps thatthe extent to which the experience can serve as a useful adjunctto traditional interview therapies, or vice versa, or even as a"compleat therapie" would seem to depend on theparticular practitioner of the art—his conceptions oftherapeutic gains and consequences, his philosophy andenthusiasm, and his orientation toward "placebo" or"faith" cures (65). Schmiege has summarized the currentstate of affairs as follows: Those using LSD in multiple doses as an adjunct to psychotherapy feel that it is so useful because of its ability to do the following: (I) It helps the patient to remember and abreact both recent and childhood traumatic experiences. (2) It increases the transference reaction while enabling the patient to discuss it more easily. (3) It activates the patient's unconscious so as to bring forth fantasies and emotional phenomena which may be handled by the therapist as dreams. (4) It intensifies the patient's affectivity so that excessive intellectualization is less likely to occur. (5) It allows the patient to better see his customary defenses and sometimes allows him to alter them. Because of these effects, therapists feel that psychotherapy progresses at a faster rate. Of course this poses the age old problem of what is the essence of psychotherapy. There are many reports of patients receivingmeaningful insight about themselves in an LSD experience withoutthe intervention, participation or even presence of atherapist.... Those who administer lysergic acid in a single dosehave as their goal, in the words of Sherwood, et al., anoverwhelming reaction "in which an individual comes toexperience himself in a totally new way and finds that the ageold question 'Who am I?' does have a significant answer."Frequently, this is accompanied by a transcendental feeling ofbeing united with the world.... Some spectacular, and almostunbelievable, results have been achieved by using one dose of thedrug (66) . Rapid Personality Change An increasing number of subjects, patients,experimenters, and psychiatrists—spontaneously or withpriming—have declared their drug experiences to betranscendental, mystical, cosmic, visionary, revelatory, and thelike. There seems to be difficulty in finding the right name forthe experience, even among the professional so-called"mystics": There is no really satisfactory name for this type of experience. To call it mystical is to confuse it with visions of another world, or of god and angels. To call it spiritual or metaphysical is to suggest that it is not also extremely concrete and physical, while the term "cosmic consciousness" itself has the unpoetic flavor of occultist jargon. But from all historical times and cultures we have reports of this same unmistakable sensation emerging, as a rule, quite suddenly and unexpectedly and from no clearly understood cause (67). Whatever this type of experience is called,however, a growing body of "expert" testimonyapparently confirms the possibility of its induction by drugs.Watts, the dean of current Western Zen scholars, has recentlydescribed "cosmic consciousness," courtesy of LSD, inexquisite detail (68). Seminary students and professors in theBoston area are said to have definitely concluded that theircontact with psilocybin was "mystico-religious" (as towhether or not it was "Christian," however, they arestill in doubt) (69). Huxley has been most outspoken about thecapacity of the drugs to induce "traditional"mystical-visionary states: For an aspiring mystic to revert, in the present state of knowledge, to prolonged fasting and violent self-flagellation would be as senseless as it would be for an aspiring cook to behave like Charles Lamb's Chinaman, who burned down the house in order to roast a pig. Knowing as he does (or at least as he can know, if he so desires) what are the chemical conditions of transcendental experience, the aspiring mystic should turn for technical help to the specialists.... (70) Nearly invariably, whenever dramatic personalitychange has been noted following the use of these drugs, it hasbeen associated with this kind of experience—that is, onecalled transcendental or visionary—with the particular namethe experience is given seemingly most dependent upon whether theinvestigator focuses on affect or content. These experiments indrug-induced behavior change will shortly be reviewed in detail. Examples Not Associated with Drugs Since accounts of behavior transformationsattendant on paranormal experience are not without precedent, itmay be helpful to set the stage for present developments byciting some examples not connected with drugs. James reported onthe phenomenon in its most familiar and perhaps prototypiccontext: In this lecture we have to finish the subject of conversion, considering it first through striking instantaneous instances of which St. Paul's is the most eminent, and in which, often amid tremendous emotional excitement or perturbation of the senses, a complete division is established in the twinkling of an eye between the old life and the new. After adducing numerous examples, James continued: I might multiply cases almost indefinitely, but these will suffice to show you how real, definite, and memorable an event a sudden conversion may be to him who has the experience. Throughout the height of it he undoubtedly seems to himself a passive spectator or undergoer of an astounding process performed upon him from above. There is too much evidence of this for any doubt of it to be possible. Theology, combining this fact with the doctrine of election and grace, has concluded that the spirit of God is with us at these dramatic moments in a peculiarly miraculous way, unlike what happens at any other juncture of our lives. At that moment, it believes, an absolutely new nature is breathed into us, and we become partakers of the very substance of the Deity (71). One may also recall to mind the"vision-seeking" American Indians whom Ruth Benedictimmortalized. Adapting Nietzsche's designation"Dionysian" to characterize their cultural pattern, sheportrayed its fundamental contrast with the"Apollonian" Zuni-Pueblo way of life. The Dionysian"seeks to attain in his most valued moments escape from theboundaries imposed on him by his five senses, to break throughinto another order of experience." He values "all meansby which human beings may break through the usual sensoryroutine" (72). Widespread among the western Indians (except in thePueblos) was what Benedict called the "Dionysian dogma andpractice" of the vision-quest—sought by fasting, bytorture, and by drugs. The point of interest, of course, is thatwhen the vision came, it could apparently trigger large-scalebehavior alterations which had the stamp and reinforcement ofsocial approval. . . . on the western plains men sought these visions with hideous tortures. They cut strips from the skin of their arms; they struck off fingers; they swung themselves from tall poles by straps inserted under the muscles of their shoulders. They went without food and water for extreme periods. They sought in every way to achieve an order of experience set apart from daily living. On the western plains they believed that when the vision came, it determined their life and the success they might expect. If no vision came, they were doomed to failure.... If the experience was of curing, one had curing powers; if of warfare, one had warrior's powers. If one encountered Double Woman, one was a transvestite, and took woman's occupations and habits. If one was blessed by the mythical Water-Serpent, one had supernatural power for evil, and sacrificed the lives of one's wife and children in payment for becoming a sorcerer (73). The final example which will be noted here of rapidpersonality change not induced by drugs has emerged quiterecently from Maslow's studies of "self-actualization."Maslow reports that the occurrence of a dramatic "peakexperience"— defined or alternatively described as a"cognition of being," or as "mystic" or"oceanic"—is a major event in the life historiesof his "self-actualizing" subjects. Maslow avers"unanimous agreement" among his subjects as to the"therapeutic" after-effects of such peakexperiences—for example, that they were so profound as toremove neurotic symptoms forever; or were followed by greatercreativity, spontaneity, or expressiveness; or produced a more orless permanently changed, more healthy world-view or view ofself, and so on (74). Drug-Associated Personality Change: A "New Concept"in Psychotherapy It is an intriguing historical accident that, onthe one hand, anthropological studies of the Native AmericanChurch (Peyotism) consistently record the peyote-associatedreformation of alcoholic and generally reprobate characters (75),and, on the other hand, LSD has been increasingly utilized in thetreatment of the white man's "fire-water" ills. LSD wasfirst systematically administered to non-Indian alcoholics inorder to explore a putative similarity between the so-calledmodel psychosis and delirium tremens. Two independentundertakings along this line, one in the U.S. and one in Canada,resulted in highly unexpected and sudden "cures" (76). Investigators in Saskatchewan pursued thisserendipitous result aggressively. The outcome, withlately-evolved refinements in technique, has been an explicitlyformulated "new concept" in psychotherapy (77). Thefollowing narrative, pieced together from Hoffer's statements atthe Macy LSD conference, describes the conditions under which therapid change phenomenon seems first to have occurred in sizeablenumbers: . . . we have what we call the "businessman's special," for very busy people, the weekend treatment.... They come in because the police or Alcoholics Anonymous or others bring them in. They come in on day one. They know they are going to take a treatment, but they know nothing about what it is. We take a psychiatric history to establish a diagnosis. That is on day one. On day two, they have the LSD. On day three, they are discharged. Our objective [in using 200-400 gamma doses] is to give each patient a particular LSD experience. The results are that 50 per cent of these people are changed [that is, they stop drinking or are much improved].... As a general rule . . . those who have not had the transcendental experience are not changed; they continue to drink. However, the large proportion of those who have had it are changed (78). The only other investigators to report a"weekend treatment" are Ball and Armstrong (79). Theydescribe a small series of "sex perverts," at least twoof whom had had, over a number of years, "a variety of formsof psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis . . . [resulting in]no improvement whatever." The large-dose LSD experience,however, is said to have had "remarkable, long-lastingremedial effects" (80). MacLean and his co-workers in British Columbia,Canada have reported on a series which included 61 alcoholics and33 neurotics (personality trait disturbance and anxiety reactionneurosis) (81). Each patient was carefully and intensivelyprepared for the 400-1500 gamma, "psychedelicLSD-day"—which was jointly conducted by a psychiatrist,a psychologist, a psychiatric nurse, and a music therapist. Theirfollow-up data (median follow-up was for 9 months) wereinterpreted to yield a "much improved" or"improved" rating for over 90 percent of the neuroticsand 60 percent of the alcoholics, with just under 50 percent ofthe alcoholics found at follow-up to have remained "totallydry" (82). The results of this single LSD session with thealcoholic cases seem most impressive, in view of the pictureprovided: These were considered to be difficult cases; 59 had experienced typical delirium tremens; 36 had tried Alcoholics Anonymous and were considered to have failed in that program. The average period of uncontrolled drinking was 14.36 years. The average number of admissions to hospital for alcoholism during the preceding 3 years was 8.07 (83). Since Hoffer's account, procedures in Saskatchewanhave apparently been modified to incorporate considerable"psychotherapy"—as an adjunct to, and preparationfor, the LSD experience. In a recent report, Jensen has describeda greatly expanded treatment method and its results: The treatment program includes three weekly A.A. meetings. The patients are strongly encouraged, but not forced, to attend. There are also 2 hours of group psychotherapy, in the course of which those who are not already familiar with the A.A. program are indoctrinated mainly by the other patients' discussion.... Because of the fairly short time available, the group therapy is superficial in nature and primarily educational. Toward the end of hospitalization (which averaged 2 months), the patients were given an LSD experience. They routinely received 200 gamma of the drug.... (84) Of 58 patients who experienced the full program, including LSD, and were followed up for 6 to 18 months, 34 had remained totally abstinent since discharge or had been abstinent following a short experimental bout immediately after discharge; 7 were considered improved, i.e., were drinking definitely less than before; 13 were unimproved; and 4 broke contact. Of 35 patients who received group therapy without LSD, 4 were abstinent, 4 were improved, 9 were unimproved and 18 were lost to follow-up. Of 45 controls, consisting of patients admitted to the hospital during the same period who received individual treatment by other psychiatrists, 7 were abstinent, 3 improved, 12 unimproved, and 23 lost to follow-up (85). Among the reservations that might be expressedabout Jensen's study, two are outstanding. First, there is someambiguity about the assignment of patients to the differenttreatment conditions—it does not seem to have been entirelyrandom. Second, Jensen's assumption that patients who broke orrefused follow-up contact with the hospital staff are safelycategorized, for statistical purposes, as "treatmentfailures" would seem somewhat overweening. At any rate, onhis count, the difference in percentages of patients"abstinent or improved" between the "fullprogram-LSD" group (41 out of 58, or 71 percent) and the"individual psychotherapy" group (10 out of 45, or 22percent) was highly statistically significant. The present "official policy" of theSaskatchewan Department of Public Health may be of interest. Arecently issued document, which reviews the results of four suchfollow-up studies as Jensen's, concludes with the directive thatthe single, large-dose LSD treatment of alcoholism is to beconsidered "no longer as experimental," but rather,"to be used where indicated" (86). There seem to have been only two efforts in theU.S. to explicitly and systematically follow the Canadian model.In quite different contexts, both are reported as at least"doing well." Leary and his co-workers at Harvard, overthe last two years, have conducted a research and treatmentprogram at Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Concord,"designed to test the effects of consciousness-expandingdrugs on prisoner rehabilitation" (87). This undertaking,which emphasizes the crucial importance of drug-induced"far-reaching insight experiences" —prepared for,supported, and reinforced by group therapy sessions—hasresulted in a recidivism rate considerably reduced from actuarialexpectation. The number of post-treatment cases on which thisevaluation is based, however, is only 26. The program is ongoing(88). In a much more familiar setting, a group of workerson the West Coast has been treating the full range ofgarden-variety neuroses. The patients are intensively preparedover a two- to three-week period for a large-dosage,"transcendental" drug session. The stated intent is toinduce a "single overwhelming experience . . . so profoundand impressive that . . . the months and years that follow becomea continuing growth process" (89). Thus far, in over 100treated cases, at least "marked improvement" in thecondition for which treatment was sought has been reported inabout 80 percent—after one so-called overwhelming experience(90). It is a commonplace that new psychiatric treatmentsseem to effect remarkable cures—at least for a short timeand in the hands of their originators. In raising the spectre ofthe powerful placebo effect (91), it need hardly be pointed outthat the results reviewed above should be regarded with healthyskepticism. On the other hand, they are more than merelytrifling. Explanatory Concepts In addressing a recent international assemblageat Copenhagen, Leary asserted: The visionary experience is the key to behavior change. [In its wake] change in behavior can occur with dramatic spontaneity . . . (92). Van Dusen, who bids fair to become thepsychologist-philosopher of the "new concept" movement,puts the issue as follows: There is a central human experience which alters all other experiences . . . not just an experience among others, but . . . rather the very heart of human experience. It is the center that gives understanding to the whole.... It has been called satori in Japanese Zen, moksha in Hinduism, religious enlightenment or cosmic consciousness in the West.... Once found life is altered because the very root of human identity has been deepened . . . the still experimental drug d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) appears to facilitate the discovery of this apparently ancient and universal experience (93). Although reminded on all sides of theincommunicableness of "the transport," as James calledit, of its ineffability, one may, before following him in thedescent toward "medico-materialistic" explanation,inquire further of its nature. James proffered the traditionaldemurrer ". . . it is probably difficult to realize [its]intensity unless one has been through the experience one's self .. ." (94). He then proceeded, with seeming aplomb, todescribe it: The central [characteristic] is the loss of all worry, the sense that all is ultimately well with one, the peace, the harmony, the willingness to be.... The second feature is the sense of perceiving truths not known before . . . insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect.... The mysteries of life become lucid ... illuminations, revelations, full of significance and importance, all inarticulate though they remain.... A third peculiarity . . . is the objective change which the world often appears to undergo. "An appearance of newness beautifies every object" . . . clean and beautiful newness within and without . . . (95). In James' view, "melting emotions andtumultuous affections" were the constant handmaiden of"crises of change" (96). Also Benedict, in the contextof the vision-quest, remarked on ". . . very strong affect,either ultimate despair or release from all inadequacy andinsecurity" (97). Chwelos and his co-workers, describing thetranscendental drug experience as "mainly in the sphere ofemotions or feeling" (98), exemplify this by quoting analcoholic patient: I was swept by every conceivable variety of pleasant emotion from my own feeling of well-being through feelings of sublimity and grandeur to a sensation of ecstasy (99). Finally now, turning from the poetry of phenomenalexperience to medico-materialism, how did James approach thematter of explanation? If you open the chapter on Association, of any treatise on psychology, you will find that a man's ideas, aims, and objects form diverse internal groups and systems, relatively independent of one another.... When one group is present and engrosses the interest, all the ideas connected with other groups may be excluded from the mental field.... Our ordinary alterations of character as we pass from one of our aims to another, are not commonly called transformations . . . but whenever one aim grows so stable as to expel definitively its previous rivals from the individual's life we tend to speak of the phenomenon and perhaps to wonder at it, as a "transformation." Whether such language be rigorously exact is for the present of no importance. It is exact enough, to recognize from your own experience the fact which I seek to designate by it. Now if you ask of psychology just how the excitement shifts in a man's mental system, and why aims that were peripheral become at a certain moment central, psychology has to reply that although she can give a general description of what happens, she is unable in a given case to account accurately for all the single forces at work. In the end we fall back on the hackneyed symbolism of mechanical equilibrium. A mind is a system of ideas, each with the excitement it arouses, and with tendencies impulsive and inhibitive, which mutually check or reinforce one another.... A new perception, a sudden emotional shock . . . will make the whole fabric fall together, and then the center of gravity sinks into an attitude more stable, for the new ideas that reach the center in the rearrangement seem now to be locked there, and the new structure remains permanent (100). More modern discussions of rapid personality changeseem, in large part, to be variations on the theme of"melting emotions and tumultuous affections." Therehave been two relatively recent efforts to deal with rapid changeassociated primarily with conversion. Wallace, who attempted anheroic amalgam of Selye's "stress" theory and culturalanthropology, summed this up as follows: . . . the physiologic events of the general adaptation syndrome [in situations of massive emotion] establish a physicochemical milieu in which certain brains can perform a function of which they are normally incapable: a wholesale resynthesis that transforms intellectual insight into appropriate motivation, reduces conflict by partial or total abandonment of certain values and acceptance of others, and displaces old values to new, more suitable objects (101). Sargant has linked along an axis of abnormal"anger, fear, or exaltation" such "abrupt totalreorientations" in personality as attend religious andpolitical conversion experiences—as well as violentabreactions in therapy, spontaneous or narcosynthetic. Hisexplanatory scheme derives directly from Pavlov—in the finalanalysis, sudden alterations in behavior are attributed to"paradoxical" and "ultraparadoxical" brainprocesses, and the like, induced by extreme emotion (102). To return to LSD-related developments, Ditman andhis coworkers have reviewed a whole range of considerations andtheories which might "rationalize" the sudden changephenomenon—including a highly libidinized psychoanalyticformulation (103). It remains to raise just one final query. Rapidpersonality change, translated into language more congenial tobehavioral psychology, could be taken to describe a situation inwhich formerly dominant or high-probability responses, overt ormediational, were suddenly greatly reduced in frequency ofoccurrence; and, vice versa, uncommon responses, or thoseformerly low in a hierarchy, appear with greatly elevatedfrequency. The only experimental results which even approximatethis order of events seem to be those which have arisen with theaid of direct intracranial electrical stimulation. Withresponse-contingent reinforcement of this kind—that is, withelectrical "trains" delivered to the hypothalamic,so-called pleasure or reward centers—the repertoires of manyrats and monkeys have been dramatically altered in a very fewmoments: Utterly new behaviors have been shaped, old responseseliminated (104). The degree to which such "artificiallyinduced" learning has been sustained has been a function, aswith all behavior, of the ebb and flow of environmentalcontingencies. Thus, to point the issue: Do transcendentalexperiences at the human level, however they are interpreted,tread in this area of superreinforcement—with apotential for radically altering the probability of occurrence of"heuristic" mediating processes (for example, positiverather than negative self-concepts) which might channel behavior,at least temporarily, in new directions, toward a "newbeginning"? With Ruth Benedict's "Apollonian" Zuni,the tendency of the modern West is to regard paranormalexperiences, indiscriminately and often with little idea of theirnature, as "pathological"—to be distrusted,feared, avoided. The Zuni Indian, said Benedict, "findsmeans to outlaw them from his conscious life. . . . He keeps themiddle of the road, stays within the known map, does not meddlewith disruptive psychological states" (105). It would seemunfortunate were this Zeitgeist to unduly prejudice theexploration of therapeutic potential in the drugs here discussed. In conclusion, let it be noted that the publichealth implications of drug-associated rapid personality change,should this phenomenon prove not to be a will-of-the-wisp, areapparently great. Intensive investigation would seem a reasonableorder of the day. The procedures and time involved are manifestlyeconomical—in truth, there seems little to be lost. REFERENCES 1.

COLE, M.D. MARTIN M. KATZ, PH.D.* from: Journal of the American MedicalAssociation, Vol 187, No. 10, March 7, 1964 note: The criticisms expressed in the following paper, relatively typical of those workers whose establishment opinions helped to bring on the current era of Prohibition, are answered by Humphrey Osmond and Abram Hoffer in their 1967 book, The Hallucinogens. An excerpt from that book dealing with the Cole And Katz criticisms can be found in this library. For many years several pharmacologically similardrugs—lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25), psilocybin, andmescaline, among others—have been of special scientificinterest. In volunteer subjects, they have been known to producea variety of intense and unusual psychic effects. These includebizarre visual phenomena, ranging from heightening of theapparent brightness or beauty of colored objects in theenvironment, through distortions in the perceived nature ormeaning of real objects (illusions) to true visual hallucinationsof colors, shapes, or even of complex scenes or events. Thesevisual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and oftenrapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mildapprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) orby concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are notexperienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjectsdescribe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearinglarger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization,including states in which the subject believes he is outside hisown body viewing it from afar, or even sensations of death andrebirth. Occasionally there may be loss of insight into thedrug-induced nature of these sensations, with paranoid delusionsabout other people in the environment who are believed to betrying to harm or kill the subject. Intense self-loathing withsuicidal impulses or great feelings of mystical revelation canalso occur. Distortions in experiencing passage of time and, morerarely, disorientation as to time and place can occur. The exactquality, nature, and content of these experiences appear todepend in a complex manner on the personality and expectations ofthe subject, the dose of the drug, and the setting in which thedrug is administered (1, 2). Particularly since the synthesis of LSD-25 in 1943,there has been intense scientific interest in the possibilitythat these agents reproduce naturally occurring schizophrenicstates. After twenty years of research, it seems most reasonableto state that these drugs can produce a state which is similarbut not identical to naturally occurring schizophrenia, and whichmay also resemble the toxic deliria caused by other agents suchas atropine or scopolamine. Since subjects acquire tolerance toLSD, psilocybin, and mescaline after repeated administration(3-6), the possibility that such compounds are of etiologicalsignificance in naturally occurring schizophrenia seems remote. Because of the assumed similarities of the stateproduced by these agents to schizophrenia, they have been termed"psychotomimetics" or mimickers of psychosis. Even lessaccurately, because of the visual effects, they have been termed,"hallucinogenics." These names reflect a carefulscientific concern with potentially dangerous, though uniquedrugs. More recently Osmond (7) has coined a term,"psychedelic," meaning "mind manifesting,"which has begun to be used widely. Its implications are certainlymore vague than those of the other terms. In the contexts inwhich it is used, it seems to imply that these drugs bring to thefore aspects of the subject's mind previously hidden or at leastless manifest, and suggests that these effects may be"good." Assuredly, many investigators believe that theeffects of these drugs result in an intensity of personalexperience and emotion more meaningful than the terms"psychotomimetic" or "hallucinogenic" imply. Therein lies the present problem in the use orabuse of these agents. Rather than being the subject of carefulscientific inquiry, these agents have become invested with anaura of magic, offering creativity to the uninspired,"kicks" to the jaded, emotional warmth to the cold andinhibited, and total personality reconstruction to the alcoholicor the psychotherapy-resistant chronic neurotic. On the WestCoast, the effects are judged by some to be related to theinsights of Zen Buddhism; on the East Coast, they are judged byothers to lead the way to a new and free social order. Like thebroom in "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," the drugs seem tohave walked out of the laboratory into the outside world on theirown feet and to have turned on the unsuspecting apprentice. To be sure, the therapeutic uses of these agentshave been pioneered by psychiatrists in many instances, includingAbramson (8), Frederking (9), Osmond (7), Savage (10, 11), andSandison (12, 13). With much of the published work, however,there is an implicit or explicit attitude that the self-knowledgeof the leverage for self-change allegedly effected by these drugsmay be of value or benefit to individuals who do not ordinarilyconsider themselves psychiatrically ill. At the extreme of thisattitude-dimension is the International Foundation for InnerFreedom, formed by two psychologists, Doctors Leary and Alpert,who claim that these agents (14) should not be considered drugsat all but should be classed with poetry, music, literature, andart, and should be available to all men wishing to improve theirminds and "expand their consciousness." There is,apparently, an active black market in these drugs in major urbancenters, where these drugs may have more snob appeal thandiacetyl morphine (heroin), marihuana, or dextroamphetamine. Major attention has been focused on these drugs,their effects, and the personal eccentricities and misadventuresof the more notorious people advocating their use by a series ofarticles in national popular magazines—Look (14), TheReporter (15), Cosmopolitan (16), Time (17),the Saturday Evening Post (18), and the Ladies' HomeJournal (19). As with other forms of illicit drug abuse, itis hard to tell the real extent or seriousness of thepsychotomimetic problem, despite this rather florid publicity. The present article has two purposes: first, tounderline the real and important dangers inherent in theself-administration of these agents or in their administration byuncritical enthusiasts and inadequately trained individuals;second, to stress that some of the therapeutic claims made forthese drugs are of sufficient potential importance to warrantserious, unprejudiced study. Psychotomimetic Agents as Therapy We take the second issue first, since the firstissue has already been outlined above. There have been anincreasing series of studies reporting LSD-25 and/or mescaline tobe effective in the treatment of chronic alcoholism, withremission rates of approximately 50 percent being usuallydescribed (20-25). Similar results have been observed in the treatmentof chronic neuroses (9, 10-13, 26, 27). The claims for theutility of these drugs in the treatment of chronic neuroses rangefrom dramatic improvement to modest descriptions of improvedcommunication with the therapist, emotional release, and abilityto talk about difficult personal topics. There have also beeninformal claims that these drugs are useful in producing valuablepersonality changes in juvenile delinquents and other individualswith serious personality disorders. In brief, it is claimed that these agents are ofstriking value in some groups of patients who are highlyresistant to more conventional forms of psychotherapy orpharmacotherapy. Many of these claims stress, further, theoccurrence of basic changes in attitudes or personality, not meresymptom reduction. If these claims are confirmed, this newtherapeutic approach could add substantially to thepsychiatrist's tools. We must stress that none of these claimsare based on detailed, carefully controlled studies designed tobe free from possible distortions due to bias or enthusiasm.Further, the terms in which the effects are often explained arenot formulations common either to medicine in general or topsychiatry in particular. "Our own conception is that peoplelive an inauthentic existential modality (i.e., alienation), andthat illness arises from an inability to see meaning in life. LSDprovides an encounter which brings a sudden liberation fromignorance and illusion, enlarges the spiritual horizon and givesa new meaning to life" (11).Such explanations may have amystical or philosophical sound which appeals to the enthusiast,but they are likely to produce doubt or even violent disbeliefand concern in physicians used to a more pragmatic approach andin scientists used to a more communicative language. The presentauthors occupy a skeptical middle position, favoring the Scotchverdict of "not proven." We feel strongly that thisapproach to therapy should neither be rejected out of hand as"crazy," nor accepted and applied in an uncriticalmanner, but should be subjected to careful study under closelycontrolled conditions. It is important also to note that the"treatment" discussed above is not a drug therapy inthe conventional sense. It is, rather, a complex mixture of drugtherapy and brief psychotherapy, with one or more prolongedsessions, lasting eight to ten hours, during which the patientexperiences the drug effect and discusses his experiences and thelight they throw on his problems, needs, and past experiences ina prolonged and intensive manner. The drug session is usuallypreceded by several interviews in which the patient's problemsand the changes he desires from treatment are explored, arelationship with the therapist is established, and strongpositive expectations concerning the drug session are developed.The treatment, as administered by many, seems to include strongsuggestion, aspects of dynamic insight-oriented psychotherapy,mystico-religious exhortation, catharsis, and pressure on thepatient to confront his problems head on. It is possible thatwith all these components the intense and bizarre drug experiencemay indeed permit an impact on the subject not obtainable by anyother means. It is difficult to break down the therapeuticprocess into its component parts. The proportions of thecomponents may vary from therapist to therapist or from patientto patient, especially with regard to the amount of therapistinterpretation and the extent of his active participation in thesolution of the patient's problems. When this treatment is given in a hospital setting,there is also considerable personal interaction between theindividual patient and other patients who have already undergonethis experience or are about to undergo it. The whole milieu hasan aura of intense conviction that change will occur and that theexperience will be highly meaningful and highly therapeutic.Intensive group therapy sessions may occur before and after theactual LSD experience. The entire therapeutic process, includingpreparation for the psychotomimetic experience and subsequentreinterpretation of it, may resemble the group interaction commonto successful experience with Alcoholics Anonymous. It mayresemble also the intense personalinteraction used at theNational Training Laboratory, at Bethel, Maine (16), whererevelations and emotional experiences are created by intensiveinterpersonal and group interaction alone, without the aid of anydrug. Problems in Evaluation This form of treatment is, therefore, highlyintense and highly complex, necessitating strong convictions andgreat sensitivity on the part of the therapist, and requiring thecreation of a social milieu in which all patients not only sharein a strong conviction that change will occur but also hold apersonal commitment to make certain that change does occur.Dramatic short-term effects under such conditions have beendescribed. The durability on prolonged follow-up study of acutechanges in behavior, induced by therapy or perhaps even changesin personality, is yet to be determined. Several problems face investigators who wish tomake careful studies of such a complex treatment. It seems likelythat people who administer the treatment effectively must beconvinced of its efficacy. Further, they must be highly biased infavor of it for the treatment to have the described effect. Thephysician may be so involved in the treatment that he can notevaluate its effects objectively. Independent evaluation ofoutcome is, therefore, essential to any good research design inthis area. This independent procedure should make it easier toevaluate the efficacy of treatment in a condition like chronicalcoholism where an objective index of success or failure,namely, excessive drinking, exists. A much more complex problem must be faced inevaluating the effects of these drugs on individuals withpersonality disorders, severe or mild. Here a value judgment mustbe made concerning the goodness or badness of the changes whichoccur, if any. For example, how should one evaluate outcome if anindividual were to divorce his wife and take a job which paid himless but which he said he enjoyed more than his previous job? Ifa person becomes more relaxed and happy go lucky, more sensitiveto poetry or music, but less concerned with success orcompetition, is this good? There are suggestions that individualswho take drugs like LSD either illicitly or as therapy may becomemore detached from reality or less concerned with the real world,more "transcendental." A few of the reports concerningthis treatment, both published and unpublished, mix a variety ofpoetic metaphors and occasionally bizarre-sounding elaborationswith serious descriptions of the details of treatment and thevaluable changes to be expected. For example, certain kinds ofartistic experience, certain types of music, etc., are said to beparticularly valuable in inducing the desired effects. Specificcomponents of the therapeutic process described may often have abizarre—almost schizophrenic—component, which tends tomake serious investigators discount this whole area as adelusional belief shared by a group of unstable clinicians andlay enthusiasts. Whether or not this criticism is justified canbe judged only by future studies designed to be immune to suchcriticism. Future studies must decide whether these treatments doindeed have promise for specific clinical conditions which arenow highly resistant to conventional psychiatric approaches. The Current Situation At present a small number of facts arestrikingly clear. None of these drugs has been proved to beeffective or safe therapies for any psychiatric condition.Because of the apparent potential of these agents for producingbizarre behavior, suicidal impulses, or undesirable personalitychange in some subjects or patients receiving them (28, 29),there is some question as to whether they should be administeredoutside a hospital. They are not available for generalprescription use, and there is some question whether they shouldever be so available. Because neither their safety nor theirefficacy has been adequately demonstrated, two of these agents,LSD-25 and psilocybin, are being controlled as investigationaldrugs in conformity with the existing Food and DrugAdministration regulations under the sponsorship of the drugcompany which holds the patent rights for both substances. It isour understanding that this company is at present providing theseagents for scientific study only to investigators functioningwithin federal or state agencies with formal approval of theagency, or to investigators doing research under ,rants fromthese agencies. This policy decision has been made presumably toinsure that these drugs will not be misused by unqualified orunscientific investigators without adequate checks and balancesnecessary for safe and careful research. The other agent,mescaline, is not to our knowledge being sponsored currently byany pharmaceutical company, although it can be obtained foranimal or biochemical research from certain biochemical supplyhouses. Legally none of these agents can be used, even onan investigational basis, except by investigators who have fileda formal research plan with the FDA through a sponsoringpharmaceutical company, or by investigators who have themselvesassumed sponsorship and satisfied the FDA concerning the safetyof the agents and their proposed research use in man. Anyreported use of these agents outside of these approved channelsshould be reported to the FDA. Since there have been a number ofreports of suicide attempts or prolonged psychotic reactionsrequiring psychiatric hospitalization in persons obtaining thesedrugs outside of approved medical channels, their indiscriminateunsupervised use is clearly dangerous. In addition, there havebeen reports of insidious personality changes occurring inindividuals who have indulged in repeated self-administration ofthese agents. It is, of course, difficult to determine whether ornot some of the bizarre behaviors of such individuals are aproduct of the drug itself or are a product of the underlyingpersonality aberrations which lead the individuals to seek outthese agents. In any case, there is no evidence that uncontrolledself-administration of these drugs is either safe or desirable.There has also been concern over the possibility thatinvestigators who have embarked on serious scientific work inthis area may have been subject to the deleterious and seductiveeffects of these agents. Thesee statements are made in hope that warrantedconcern over illicit abuse of these agents will not preventsystematic study of their possible potential in the treatment ofpsychiatric conditions which are otherwise severely treatmentresistant.

Hoffer & H. Osmond, 1967 A C A D E M I C P R E S S, New York and London COPYRIGHT 1967, BY ACADEMIC PRESS INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVEDACADEMIC PRESS INC. 111 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10003 Introduction by Peter Webster The following article is typical of the best of thescientific community's resistance to the prohibition of furtheruse of psychedelics such as LSD, mescaline and psilocybin inresearch and psychotherapy. By the mid-1960's, several importantstudies had indicated not only the great safety of such use ofpsychedelic drugs, but also the great utility of these age-oldmedicines for a variety of modern curing techniques. The Canadiangovernment, for example, had approved psychedelic therapy as byfar the best and most effective treatment for alcoholism everdevised. Yet the prohibitionists both in government and thescientific establishment itself, soon carried the day and a GreatInquisition began, first in the United States but later aroundthe world, in which even legitimate scientific research withpsychedelic drugs was completely stifled. A very small andinsignificant relaxation of these draconian restrictions hasrecently occurred, but the research permitted of late has onlybarely begun to re-trace the territory already well-covered inthe 1950's. The article is taken from pp 197-205 of TheHallucinogens. Within a few months after LSD was introduced into NorthAmerica the ideas generated by the LSD experience produced a gooddeal of criticism. The unhappy Harvard affair brought thissituation to a boil and it spilled over into the popular press.Critics have been very effective in creating a climate of opinionhostile to the use of LSD. There is an inverse square law whichstates that the degree of hostile criticism varies inversely withthe square of the distance from any first-hand experience andknowledge of the drug. Thus, in Canada the greatest resistance against LSD came fromthe professors who were least familiar with it. Our criterion offamiliarity is the number of research papers published inscientific journals. This criticism seems entirely based on factors described byBarber (1961). These include (a) substantive concepts andtheories held by scientists at any given time, (b) anantitheoretical bias, (c) religious ideas, (d) professionalstanding, (e) professional specialization, and (f) societies,schools, and seniority. The criticism has sometimes taken on acultic attitude and there has been private circulation of paperswhich have been unavailable to the general reader (Tyhurst,1964b). In addition, critics have issued public pronouncements tothe press, radio, and television which have not been based uponpublished data. It is therefore important to list the criticismsand then examine them carefully in order to determine whetherthey need be taken seriously or not. Before doing so we willquote Michael Polanyi (1956) because he makes the case so well.If we are to convince our opponents of the potential value of LSDtherapy they must be converted by exposing them to careful data,reasoned argument, and a firm determination to do our work as wesee fit and not to become their laboratory technician trying todisprove every will of the wisp they may conjure up. "Scientists - that is creative scientists - spend theirlives in trying to guess right. They are sustained and guidedtherein by their heuristic passion. We call their work creativebecause it changes the world as we see it, by deepening ourunderstanding of it. The change is irrevocable. A problem that Ihave once solved can no longer puzzle me; I cannot guess what Ialready know. Having made a discovery, I shall never see theworld again as before. My eyes have become different; I have mademyself into a person seeing and thinking differently. I havecrossed a gap, the heuristic gap which lies between problem anddiscovery. "To the extent to which discovery changes ourinterpretive framework, it is logically impossible to arrive atit by the continued application of our previous interpretativeframework. In other words, discovery is creative also in thesense that it is not to be achieved by the diligent applicationof any previously known and specifiable procedure. Its productionrequires originality. The application of existing rules canproduce valuable surveys, but they can as little advance theprinciples of science as a poem can be written according to rule.We have to cross the logical gap between a problem and itssolution by relying on the unspecifiable impulse of our heuristicpassion, and must undergo as we do so a change of ourintellectual personality. Like all ventures in which wecomprehensively dispose of ourselves, such an intentional changeof our personality requires a passionate motive to accomplish it.Originality must be passionate. "But this passionate quest seeks no personal possession.Intellectual passions are not like appetites; they do not reachout to grab, but set out to enrich the world. Yet such a move isalso an attack. It raises a claim and makes a tremendous demandon other men; first it asks that its gift - its gift of humanity- be accepted by all. In order to be satisfied, our intellectualpassions must find response. This universal intent creates atension. We suffer when a vision of reality to which we havecommitted ourselves is contemptuously ignored by others. For ageneral unbelief threatens to evoke a similar response in uswhich would imperil our own convictions. Our vision must conqueror die. "Like the heuristic passion from which it flows, thepersuasive passion too finds itself facing a logical gap. To theextent to which a discoverer has committed himself to a newvision of reality, he has separated himself from others who stillthink on the old lines. His persuasive passion spurs him now tocross this gap by converting everybody to his way of seeingthings, even as his heuristic passion has spurred him to crossthe heuristic gap which separated him from discovery. "We can now see the great difficulty that may arise inthe attempt to persuade others to accept a new idea in science.To the extent to which it represents a new way of reasoning, wecannot convince others of it by formal argument, for so long aswe argue within their framework we can never induce them toabandon it. Demonstration must be supplemented therefore by formsof persuasion which can induce a conversion. The refusal to enteron the opponent's way of arguing must be justified by making itappear altogether unreasonable. "Such comprehensive rejection cannot fail to discreditthe opponent. He will be made to appear as thoroughly deluded,which in the heat of the battle will easily come to imply that hewas a fool, a crank, or a fraud. And once we are out to establishsuch charges we shall readily go on to expose our opponent as ametaphysician, a Jesuit, a Jew, or a Bolshevik, as the case maybe or - speaking from the other side of the Iron Curtain - as an'objectivist,' and 'idealist,' and a 'cosmopolitan.' In a clashof intellectual passions each side must inevitably attack theopponent's person." Here are the current claims made by critics: 1. LSD is a dangerous drug. 2. Long-term personality changes cannot be produced by LSD. 3. No good can come from a chemically induced delirium orpsychoses. 4. It "has not been proved to be effective or safe forany psychiatric condition" (Cole and Katz, 1964). (a) because there are no detailed, carefully controlledstudies designed to be free from possible distortions due to biasor enthusiasm, (b) because explanations given are often formulations notcommon either to medicine in general or psychiatry in particular, (c) because explanations have a mystical or philosophicalsound which appeals to enthusiasts - but are likely to producedoubt or even violent disbelief and concern in physicians used toa more pragmatic approach, (d) because components of the therapeutic process describedmay often have a bizarre - almost schizophrenic - component whichtends to make serious investigators discount this whole area as adelusional belief shared by a group of unstable clinicians. Please read Polanyi's argument again. The rebuttal to thesecriticisms is not difficult. 1. Is LSD a dangerous drug? Of course it is, so is salt,sugar, water, and even air. There is no chemical which is whollysafe nor any human activity which is completely free of risk. Thedegree of toxicity or danger associated with any activity dependson its use. Just as a scalpel may be used to cure, it may alsokill. Yet we hear no strong condemnatory statements againstscalpels, etc. When LSD is used as treatment by competentphysicians who are trained in its use it is no more dangerousthan psychotherapy. It certainly is less dangerous than ECTinsulin subcoma, and the use of tranquilizers and antidepressioncompounds. Statements that LSD is dangerous really aremeaningless as they stand. Every clinician working with LSD whohas published his data uniformly agrees it must be used byphysicians with proper safeguards for the safety of the patient.There are no known physical contraindications. 2. Long-term personality changes cannot be produced. There isa curious quality about these criticisms for while it isgenerally denied that patients who experience LSD can bepermanently changed it is, on the contrary, assumed thatpsychiatrists very readily suffer permanent deformations of theirpersonality, and it is claimed that they are now overlyenthusiastic and even delusional and no longer competent tohonestly judge their own therapeutic efforts. It has been statedthat only claims made by therapists who have not themselves takenLSD are valid (see Cole and Katz, 1964). If this argument weregenerally accepted in medicine no surgeon who had recovered froman acute appendicitis by surgery would be competent to judgeresults of his surgery on patients. The claims of many authors that the psychedelic experiencecould produce a permanent change in patients have been rejectedby many psychiatrists whose orientation is psychoanalytic. It isbasic to their belief to assume that each person has a stablepersonality which is altered with great difficulty. People becomesick because their personality has been warped or not allowed todevelop due to pathological relationships with their parents. Theonly sure way of changing these twisted personalities is by athoroughgoing analysis of many years duration during which allthe roots of the pathological personality are uncovered andtreated. Any other treatment, psychotherapy, or drug therapy isconsidered merely symptomatic treatment which leaves the patientsuperficially better. Obviously these psychiatrists cannot acceptrapid permanent personality changes. Another group arepsychologists who have accepted the hypothesis that personalityis a stable attribute to man. This reluctance to believe that people can be permanentlyaltered in a short time seems strange. History is replete withthese sudden transformations. Religions and mass self-helpmovements, for example Alcoholics Anonymous, originated fromthese changes. William James described many of them in "TheVarieties of Religious Experience" (1902). Unger (1963a) hasgiven a particularly lucid account of the issue of rapidpersonality change. Maslow (1959) has described this phenomena as"peak" experience and Sargant (1957) tried to abstractthose factors which make man susceptible to these rapid changes.According to Sargant two factors are essential, (a) a state ofincreased excitation in the subject, (b) persuasion. He includedpsychoanalysis as one of the conversion techniques together withreligious conversions, etc. We have already referred to research reports where permanentpersonality changes were demonstrated (McGlothlin, 1962, 1964;McGlothlin et al., 1964; Mogar et al., 1963, Mogar and Savage,1964). 3. No good can come from a chemically induced delirium orpsychosis. This criticism so contradicts man's experience withdrugs that it requires no answer. 4. LSD has not been proved to be effective or safe for anypsychiatric condition (Cole and Katz, 1964). These critics assumethat no therapy is "proved" unless a double blindcomparison experiment is conducted. The word "proved"is a strange one in clinical science. Usually clinical scientistsdefine the level of confidence or proof by a probability. Thatis, they will if they are statistically inclined, accept a 5%level of confidence. They will accept as proof a finding if thereis only 5% chance the claims are wrong. Others may demand muchstronger evidence and some may be satisfied merely with anindication. In general no statement demanding proof has anyscientific meaning unless the author indicates which level ofproof he would accept. Using a puristic point of view one couldclaim no psychiatric therapy has been "proven" to beeffective for any psychiatric condition. Criticism 4(a) really is a demand for double blind studies ofLSD. The answer consists of two parts, (a) are double blindstudies really superior to classical methods in proving drugefficiency and (b) is it possible to double blind LSD. The majority of clinicians have not accepted the oft-repeatedclaim that double blind techniques are superior to classicalclinical methods. As an example Baird (1964) stated "Theinsistence in recent years on 'blindness' or 'double blindness'in evaluating the effect of therapy is an insult to theintelligence of the average clinician." In addition a largenumber of scientists who have worked with double blind procedureshave become increasingly disenchanted with it. It has been aclumsy expensive method which has; not convinced anyone of itsvalue and which is readily dispensed with when decisive action isrequired. The toxicity of thalidomide was not proven by doubleblind studies nor have the many new drugs removed from the marketbeen proven toxic by double blind studies. It appears that whenfirm action is indicated classical clinical methods are adequate,but when matters of efficiency are involved these methodssuddenly become much too crude. If Baird were unsupported one could ignore him, but when infact he is supported by (a) eminent statisticians such as Hogben(1957), R. A. Fischer (1963), Chassan (1961, 1963, 1964), Bellakand Chassan (1964), and by others we have reported (Hoffer andOsmond, 1961a, 1962a,b), and by (b) eminent clinicians includingS. Cohen, H. Lehmann, and many others, and also (c) eminentpsychologists like H. Kluver, then we must ask the proponents ofdouble blind methodology to prove at the usual 5% level ofconfidence that their methods are more apt to show whichchemicals are effective for certain conditions and which are noteffective. Until this is done no clinician need feel guilty aboutusing the old-fashioned clinical methods including single casestudies, for these were the methods which introduced intopsychiatry ECT, tranquilizers, antidepression drugs, open wards,eradication of pellagra psychosis and of general pareses of theinsane, and a host of other minor treatments. Better methods willand must be found and double blind methods are indeed useful inmopping up studies. They do serve a useful function aslarge-scale human toxicity trials and they are more convincing toinspectorial physicians concerned about global efficacy. Howeverthey have hung a millstone around our necks which is steadilybecoming more burdensome. It is ironic that one man's observation(Lehmann on chlorpromazine) recently required one million dollarsto be confirmed - see million dollar fizzle ( Margolis, 1964). Some critics (see inverse square law, p. 197) have suggestedthat a placebo be used to double blind LSD. This betrays anextraordinary lack of experience with LSD. No experiencedtherapist would be in any doubt within one hour about determiningwhether distilled water or 200 mcg of LSD had been given even ifhe were blind and could not see the pupillary dilatation producedby LSD. Every scientist who has worked with LSD agrees with this.Only a person completely unfamiliar with psychiatry and with LSDcould mistake situational anxiety for the LSD reaction in anonpsychotic subject. It has been suggested further that a newcompound should be developed which would produce the same (orsimilar) visual changes as LSD. But this is not helpful, since nosuch compound is known, and if it were, would not prove anything,for it is possible these visual changes are responsible for thetherapeutic results. There is no valid reason to suppose LSD ismore effective than psilocybin or mescaline. It is the experiencenot the compound which induces it which is responsible. However if double blind studies were possible investigatorswould use them, not because they are better, but because they aremore fashionable. Perhaps pretreatment with penicillamine wouldprovide such a design. Statistically identical groups could bepretreated with penicillamine and with placebo. Then all would begiven LSD in the usual way. The penicillamine would not interferewith the perceptual component of the experience but would dampenits emotional component. It would be very difficult fortherapists to decide which patients had received placebo orpenicillamine. One could then conclude that the normal LSDexperience was or was not superior to penicillamine-LSD. Our datasuggests that the improvement rates would be 10% afterpenicillamine-LSD and 50% after LSD. However, even such acontrolled double blind experiment would not persuade the criticsfor by then they could have produced newer unverifiedsuggestions. Criticism 4(b) means little. Any new explanation if it is tobe new must be uncommon in medicine or in psychiatry. Commonalityof ideas is usually not appealed to by scientists. It appliesmore to legal and ethical requirements in a court of law. Howeverwe find Cole and Katz' (1964) statement most surprising.Presumably they are unfamiliar with the enormous range oftheoretical formulations from conservative Freudism to radicalbiochemical reasoning. We find it difficult to understand howmodern psychiatry which bases so much on random events, dreams,ideas, and lapsae linguae can find any formulation uncommon. Criticism 4(c) is very like 4(b). It is an inevitableconsequence of any new idea that it should produce violentdisbelief and concern in physicians We should remember that manynovel ideas of our past are commonplace today. Just a fewexamples will demonstrate how science has reversed itself attimes. Mendelian theory was resisted from 1865 until about 1900because Mendel's conceptions ran counter to predominantconceptions of inheritance (were not common to medicine ingeneral). Mendel's peers condescendingly considered his workinsignificantly provincial (not common to medicine). The application of mathematics to biology was seriouslyquestioned for many years. In his biography of Galton, Pearsonreported that he sent a paper to the Royal Society in 1900 whichused statistics. Before it was published the Council of the RoyalSociety passed a resolution "that in future papersmathematics should be kept apart from biologicalapplications." Galton founded a new journal and in its firstissue wrote "a new science cannot depend on a welcome fromthe followers of the older one." Harvey, Pasteur, Magendie,Lister, Funk and Fleming all found their ideas severely tested byunreasoning hostile criticism because their ideas were uncommon.It seems new ideas rarely are accepted with an open mind. Criticism 4(d) is another variant of 4(b) and 4(c). Any newexplanation, however sound it may eventually prove to be, seemsbizarre, almost schizophrenic, to the defenders of the faith. Butit goes a bit further by the adhominem diagnosis of scientistswho use LSD for therapy as having states of paranoia (that issharing a delusional belief). This is, of course, a redundant nonsequitur for the definition of delusion is an uncommon idea fromwhich its possessor will not part when confronted with commonideas. This is what these authors have already said in 4(b) and4(c). Many factors have been suggested which could account for thetherapeutic results claimed by LSD therapists. The usual onesinclude faith, bad samples, bias in observers, etc. These arepossible factors but are they merely possible or are they likely?Before they can be seriously accepted it must be shown that thesevariables do improve a proportion of alcoholics. Where are thedouble blinds which prove that faith, bias, etc. can produceequivalent results? We suggest that proponents of these variablesshould provide data for their favorite hypothesis before theyexpect others to work them into their clinical studies. Thecritics of LSD therapy would enormously strengthen their positionif they would demonstrate a double blind study of placebo orfaith. The scientific literature [excluding editorials (Grinker,1963, 1964) and review articles] is singularly affirmative. Everyworker who has studied LSD's use for treating alcoholism is inunusual agreement. The only study recorded where there is somedisagreement is the study of Ditman et al. (1962). They examinedthe duration of claims for improvement made by subjects who hadbeen given LSD. The authors stated "the subjects hadoriginally been given 100 mcg of LSD-25 orally in a permissivebut non-treatment(1) setting in order to compare the LSDexperience with that of delirium tremens." Ditman andWhittlesey (1959) again stated "our subjects received nointended psychotherapy during the LSD experience."Questionnaires were sent to their subjects about 1/2 to 1 1/2years after their last LSD experience and of those who responded,27 were alcoholics. Of this group of 27, 18 subjects claimed theywere better, that they were in more comfortable circumstances,earning more money, and had decreased or stopped drinking. In as much as this group had not been given LSD as therapy orin a therapeutic setting and had only received 100 mcg of LSD,which we have found is relatively ineffectual for mostalcoholics, this is indeed a surprising result. However, a second questionnaire two years later was answeredby only 16. Of the other 11, 4 had died, 3 from drinking. Of thisgroup of 16, 11 still claimed periods of abstinence ranging from1 to 1 1/2 years and twelve claimed lasting benefit. Theseauthors state that this indicated fewer claims but a chi squareanalysis of their own reported data does not support thiscontention. Thus, in their first questionnaire, 18 out of 27claimed improvement; in their second questionnaire, 11 out of 16.Chi Square is less than 0.5. These results are practicallyidentical. However, none had maintained their sobriety. Weinterpret this to mean that although nearly 2/3 of the groupmaintained they were improved at the time of the secondquestionnaire, three- and-one-half years after having hadreceived an ineffectual dose of LSD, none had been continuouslysober that entire period. We mention this report in some detail because other peoplehave made claims based on this report not made by Ditman et al.,that is, that LSD was not an effective therapy for alcoholism.Their concluding statement merely stated "Three and one-halfyears after exposure to LSD there remained only claims of slightimprovement and none of the alcoholic subjects had maintainedtheir sobriety." Had they given 200 mcg or more with atherapeutic objective in a therapeutic setting by therapistsinterested in the therapeutic experience and had they used thecommunity resources including A.A., perhaps at three and one-halfyears about 50% of their subjects or better would have beensober. Emphasis is ours, not the author's.

MOGAR from: J. Human Psychol., Vol. 2, 1965, pp. 147-166. Since the discovery of d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25)in 1943, a voluminous literature has accumulated concerning itseffects on a variety of animals, including man. Despite the massof published reports, definitive evidence is generally lacking,particularly with regard to the subjective and behavioral effectsboth during and subsequent to the LSD induced state. It is wellestablished that this powerful agent produces major alterationsin cerebral processes and central autonomic functions. There isalso ample evidence indicating a markedly lowered threshold forarousal (Key & Bradley, 1960) and an increased sensitivity tostimuli in all modalities (Klee, 1963). Thesepsychopharmacological effects parallel the findings of clinicaland behavioral studies at least on the molar descriptive level.Pronounced perceptual changes have been almost invariablydemonstrated with concomitant alterations in affect, ideation,and the relationship between subject and environment (Hoffer,1965). Beyond these rather global findings, results have beeninconsistent and often contradictory, even within species farless complex than man (Cohen, 1964). The well-known methodological problems encountered inresearch with centrally acting drugs are at least partlyresponsible for the slow progress thus far (Zubin & Katz,1964). This has been especially true with human subjects.Systematic study of human reactions to LSD poses unique problemsassociated with greater organic complexity, shortcomings ofcurrently available measuring devices, the ubiquity of individualdifferences, lack of an adequate theoretical model, and theinfluence of non-drug variables such as set and setting. Inaddition to these experimental obstacles, LSD has until recentlybeen the center of a complicated medico-legal-social controversy(Harman, 1964). This has tended to obscure the relevant empiricalquestions and inhibit investigations which are both imaginativeand reasonably objective. AMBIVALENCE IN A PERIOD OF TRANSITION The short but illustrative history of LSD-25 (a) as a subjectof research, (b) as a psycho- social phenomenon, and (c) as atheoretical or philosophical enigma may be viewed as a case studyof significant trends in contemporary psychology and psychiatry.It is equally instructive to reverse the process by viewing thegrowing interest and fascination with altered states ofconsciousness from the perspective of recent shifts inpsychological theory and research. As young disciplines lackingstable direction, self-scrutiny and constant revisioncharacterize the social sciences. And in the light of theirsubject-matter, these fields are particularly attuned to thewider culture. In this connexion, recent developments in thephilosophy and sociology of science emphasize the transactionalinterplay between theory, observer, and actuality. Rather thanlaws of nature, theory and evidence are more accurately viewed asworking fictions or convenient myths and reflect the beliefsystem of a given time and place (Holten, et al., 1965). A ratherextreme version of this "Indeterminacy Model" ofscience has been described by Alfred de Grazia (1963, p. 56): The model suggests that the spirit of the times and customs dictate what will and will not be science.... Scientists operate under the indeterminacy system by various myths—primarily of rationality, of causation, and of power of choice—but in fact do not know what they are seeking, what is available, or what are solutions. That their compensation, whether in esteem, position, or money, is related to performance is only an illusion. What is accepted and what is rejected are therefore only a product of chance encounters of purpose and provision. A growing body of empirical evidence supports the view thatscience as a branch of human endeavor is socially andpsychologically conditioned just as any other human activity(Rosenthal, 1963). From this perspective, contemporarytheoretical issues and recent shifts in psychological researchbecome a sensitive barometer of the present social climate andalso a timetable of significant cultural trends. A case in pointis the recent emergence of a "third force" in Americanpsychology with its emphasis on personal growth and greaterrealization of human potentialities. The third force inpsychology has counterparts in each of the arts and science. (1) Collectively, theyrepresent a concerted effort to counteract the progressivesubordination of personal identity to what Erik Erikson calls the"technological superidentity" (1962). Interestingly,they also share a highly positive vision of modern man'sforeseeable possibilities. This ambivalent, somewhat paradoxicalposition suggests that contemporary humanistic thinking has beeninspired not only by the dehumanizing effects of thescientific-industrial complex, but also by its capacity formaking the lives of men healthy, safe, and reasonably secure forthe first time in history. Traditionally, the motive power of western cultures hasnecessarily focused on survival and environmentalmastery—human strivings which are highly congenial to abehavioristic or psychoanalytic frame of reference. In contrastto these orientations, Maslow views the organismic equilibriummade possible by satiated bodily needs, physical safety, and somemeasure of psychological security as merely prerequisite to moreuniquely human pursuits. This hierarchical conception of man'sstrivings depicts him as a self-directed creature with impulsestoward creative expression and self-enhancement as well ashomeostatic maintenance (Maslow, 1962). It is too early to gauge the extent to which Maslow'shumanistic image of man meshes with the modern temper. On theother hand, considerable evidence has already accumulatedindicating that behaviorism and psychoanalysis, in their orthodoxforms, no longer have what Bruner describes as "an immediateresonance with the dialectic of experience" (1962). Yettheir continuing impact on our self- and world-view is clearlysubstantial. Thus, three divergent orientations occupy the samestage concurrently—reflecting and in turn effecting socialvalues and individual conduct. Viewed comparatively, theseequipotent theories of man and the research they generate givetestimony to the preoccupations and uncertainties of our time. Placed within this broader context, the diverse descriptionsand interpretations of the LSD experience become moreunderstandable. And since psychedelic,"mind-manifesting," substances have been known andingested throughout man's history (Barnard, 1963), the currentfascination with this class of experiences seems particularlysignificant. Although presently unclear, one general reason forthe increasing interest in psychedelic phenomena can beidentified: either as a means of investigating higher thoughtprocesses or as a potentially valuable personal experience, theLSD-induced state is intriguing because it meshes with thezeitgeist in the social sciences and with major trends in thelarger culture. There is convincing evidence from a variety ofquarters which supports this contention. EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY: THE RETURN OF THE OSTRACIZED In a recent issue of the American Psychologist, anincisive paper by a well-known research psychologist is entitled,"Imagery: The Return of the Ostracized" (Holt, 1964).After examining the traditional scientific and culturalresistances to such phenomena as pseudohallucinations, hypnogogicand dream images, extrasensory perception, and hypnosis, theauthor goes on to describe the current status in these fields.Echoing Hebb's manifesto as president of the AmericanPsychological Association (1960), he points to a number of recentbreakthroughs in a variety of research areas which signal thesecond phase of a psychological revolution. The first phase,covering the first half of the century, was characterized by thescientific extremism of psychoanalysis and behaviorism; movementswhich purged psychology of the unique and the private. While bothpsychoanalysis and behaviorism in their orthodox forms have madevaluable contributions to our understanding of man, it seemsevident now that these orientations can no longer exclude alteredstates of consciousness and novel perceptual experiences from theprimary subject-matter of a normal psychology. Significantly, some of the leading exponents of both theoriessuch as B. F. Skinner (1963) and H. Hartmann (1958) haverecognized these omissions and indicated a need for revision.Consistent with theoretical developments, behavioristic researchshows an increasing concern with internal processes includingsensations, images, and cognitions (London & Rosenhan, 1964).Similarly, psychoanalytic studies focus more on normal orsuperior functioning and less on pathology (Frosch & Ross,1960). These trends are not surprising since some of the mostexciting developments during the past decade have occurred inexperimental work with dream activity, sensory deprivation,creativity, hypnosis, and the psychedelic drugs. Viewing thisrich array of research activity as occurring within a broadercultural context, one convergent finding seems of majorsignificance; namely, that richness of imagination and so-calledregressive experiences are not the exclusive privilege of madmenand artists. Instead, this work indicates quite conclusively thatunder favorable circumstances, most people can greatly expandtheir experiential horizons without sacrificing effectiveness indealing with conventional reality. The significant parallels among relatively independent linesof investigation are most striking. First it should be noted thateach of these phenomenon (psychedelic, dreams, creativity,sensory isolation, and hypnosis) have traditionally beenassociated with the negative, bizarre, and abnormal. Untilrecently dreams and hypnosis have generally been linked withmagic and the occult. Similarly, "hallucinogenic" drugstates, sensory confinement, and inordinate creativeness havestrong historical associations with defective character andinsanity. As a result, these classes of experience have typicallybeen treated as isolated phenomena, discontinuous with otherpsychological processes and inexplicable in terms of knownprinciples. Although presently accepted as legitimate areas of study, thetainted heritage of novel experiences has continued to exertstrong influence. For example, recent findings indicate that themain features of creativity and the necessary conditions for itsdevelopment run counter to prevailing ideologies (Getzels &Jackson, 1962; Gruen, 1964). Similar cultural and professionalresistances have been documented regarding the psychedelic drugswith particular reference to their presumed"psychotomimetic" properties (Savage & Stolaroff,1965). The same biases have been noted in perceptual isolationresearch. In their recent critique, Arnhoff and Leon (1964)conclude that most studies of sensory deprivation effects havegrossly misapplied the concepts and terms of pathology. In muchthe same vein, Shor's (1960, p. 162) work on"hypnotic-like" experiences in normal subjectsindicates that: In our culture naturally-occurring hypnotic-like experiences tend to be regarded with some misgivings if not as outright pathology. Consequently they are little talked about, but this does not mean that they occur with less frequency or profundity than in cultures where they are encouraged or institutionalized. In many cultures such experiences are seen as a vital source of creative inspiration and gratification. A second significant parallel concerns the remarkablesubjective and behavioral similarities of these experiences.Consistent findings in research on hypnotic, psychedelic, anddream states, certain phases of the creative process, as well assensory and dream deprivation indicate an almost complete overlapof major effects. Reported communalities include significantalterations in perception, dominance of sensation and imageryover verbal-associative thinking, relaxed ego boundaries, changesin bodily feelings, and the suspension of conventionalreality—orientation to space, time, and self. Theoretical accounts of these psychological changes have alsorun parallel. Whether self-induced or situationally induced bymeans of fatigue, drugs, or some form of stress, such states havetypically been viewed as regressive, infantile, or primitive,indicating sudden loss of ego control and the eruption ofunconscious forces. Until very recently, the effects have beeninterpreted as disturbing, incapacitating, quasipsychotic,dissociative, or depersonalizing. Consistent with theseinterpretations, persons prone to altered states of awarenesshave generally been described as poorly adjusted, suggestible,irrational, passive, and low in ego strength. (2) Perhaps the most important parallel concerns the currentstatus and direction of research in these areas. At the presenttime, work in each area reveals a discernible shift away frominvestigating the condition or phenomenon per se, focusinginstead on the situation- and subject-determined variables. Thissignificant turning point calls attention to the key importanceof the psycho-social context in which these experiences areinextricably embedded. Related to this new research strategy,recent findings and shifts in theorizing about altered states ofconsciousness have taken a more positive turn. As a case in point, the aftereffects of dream deprivation,both positive and negative, vary widely across subjects. Dement(1960) found that "the kinds of alterations representextensions or revelations of tendencies native to the individualpersonality" and that their form, degree, and dynamicmeaning were influenced by the setting and by interpersonaltransactions. With regard to hypnotic susceptibility, Barber(1964) has established the central importance of attitudinal andmotivational variables. Similarly, recent findings indicate thatthe nature and intensity of hypnotic experiences are stronglyinfluenced by the sociopsychological milieu, particularly themutual expectancies of subject and experimenter (Sarbin &Lim, 1963). The same trends are found in sensory deprivation research.Considerable evidence has accumulated indicating that greatlyreduced sensory input can impair or facilitate mental functioningdepending on the particular interaction of set, setting, andpersonality (Brownfield, 1964). For example, Leiderman (1964)found that "with the element of fear removed, the imagery ofsensory deprivation becomes like the imagery of daydreams, quitefamiliar and usually not anxiety-producing." Interestingly,sensory deprivation is reportedly therapeutic for some patients(Zuckerman, 1964). The direction of thinking in this area isperhaps best summed up by Suedfeld (1964). Noting that someexperimentally isolated subjects reveal striking creativity insolving problems, he poses the question, "What would happenif creative behavior were externally reinforced by theexperimenter?" Turning to the psychedelics, it has become apparent thatadverse psychological or behavioral effects are notdrug-specific. More generally, the nature, intensity, and contentof the experience are the result of complex transactions betweenthe subject's past history and personality, the set andexpectancies of both subject and administrator, and the physicaland psychological setting in which the experience takes place(see e.g., Unger, 1964a). As in the case of related phenomena,most of these determinants of response to LSD can beintentionally arranged and manipulated so as to foster either apropitious or a stressful experience. In the search forrelatively invariant or "drug-specific" reactions muchof the research until recently has failed to assess, control, orsystematically vary relevant non-drug variables. Laboratory studies of behavioral effects during theLSD-induced state have been particularly insensitive tosituation- and subject-determined variables. Changes inperformance levels on a wide variety of tasks have beenextensively investigated with inconclusive results. Instrumentallearning has been found to be impaired (Krus et al., 1963),enhanced (Rosenbaum et al., 1959), and unchanged (Kornetsky,1957). Both impairment and enhancement of color perception havebeen reported (Wapner & Krus, 1960; Hartman & Hollister,1963). Similarly, studies of the effects of LSD on recall andrecognition, discrimination learning, concentration, symbolicthinking, and perceptual accuracy have yielded contradictoryresults (see e.g., Trouton & Eyesenck, 1961). It is perhapssignificant that most of the laboratory research has used thedrug as a stressor with the intention of simulatingpsychotic-like performance-impairment (psychotomimeticorientation). In contrast, well over three hundred clinicalstudies on the therapeutic effectiveness of LSD have reportedalmost uniformly positive results (Hoffer, 1965; Mogar, 1965a).This more recent line of investigation views the drug as aliberator which facilitates accurate perception, self-insight,and performance-enhancement (psychedelic orientation). Consistentwith their objectives and positive findings, clinical studieshave generally (a) optimized the context of the drug experienceand (b) been particularly attentive to individual differences inpersonality and set. A number of studies have demonstrated that personalitydifferences are as important as preparation and setting indetermining response to LSD. In a study of immediate andlong-term effects of the psychedelic experience, Mogar and Savage(1964) found that post-LSD changes were related to personalitystyles and modal defense patterns. The results indicated thatsubjects with a well-defined but flexible self structureresponded most favorably to the drug, while those with eitherunder-developed or overly-rigid ego defenses responded lessfavorably. Similar differential findings have been obtainedrecently in work with sensory deprivation and hypnosis. Forexample, both neuroticism and "field-dependence"correlate significantly with disturbing, stressful reactions tosensory deprivation (Zuckerman & Cohen, 1964). Otherisolation studies have found positive relationships between"field-independence" and performance-enhancement(Brownfield, 1964), and between "self-actualizingmaturity" and enjoyment of sensory deprivation (Blazer,1963). Particularly relevant to the psychedelics is the findingthat positive visual imagery during isolation correlates highlywith (a) intellectual flexibility, breadth, and richness, (b)acceptance of one's passive, feminine side, and (c) freedom fromemotional disturbance and constriction (Holt & Goldberger,1961). Comparable results in research on individual differences inhypnotic susceptibility have seriously undermined long-standinginterpretations. Specifically, a host of studies recently foundthat hypnotic susceptibility was negatively correlated withneuroticism and placebo-responsiveness, and positively correlatedwith emotional stability (Bentler et al., 1963; Lang &Lazovik, 1962). Although generally unrelated to specificpersonality attributes in normal subjects, independent work byShor et al. (1962) and As (1963) indicate a consistently highrelationship between hypnotizability and the frequency of naturallyoccurring altered states, particularly ecstatic and peakexperiences. The range of personal history experiencesinventoried in these studies were characterized by constructiveuse of regression, tolerance for logical paradoxes, willingnessto relinquish ego control, and the ability to suspend disbeliefor adopt an "as if" attitude. It is worth noting thatthese correlates of hypnotic susceptibility are also associatedwith propitious psychedelic states, certain aspects ofcreativity, and self-actualization. (3) Current findings and theorizing in the various areasconsidered here can be summarized briefly.. Whether self-induced,stress-induced, or drug-induced, altered states of consciousnesswill be welcomed and valuable rather than feared and harmful tothe degree that the sociopsychological demands of suchexperiences are congenial to the "kinetic" needs andvalues of a given individual. Based on an analysis of imagery inRorschach responses, Holt and Havel (1960, p.311) reach a similarconclusion: We find primary process thinking in conscious subjects either out of strength or out of weakness. In the former case, it is more likely to appear in a playful or esthetic frame of reference, accompanied by pleasant affect. If, on the other hand, primary thinking breaks through the usual defenses uninvited and unwanted, the subject may feel anxious or threatened and is likely to act defensively. This view is consistent with recent developments inpersonality theory, particularly the current emphasis on latentcreative potential and self-actualizing tendencies.Representative of this trend, the opposing dualisms inpsychoanalytic theory have undergone major revision so as toinclude regression in the service of the ego and creative fusionsof primary and secondary process thinking (Hilgard, 1962). In asimilar vein, Maddi (1963, p. 193) refers to the id as "thebreeding ground of love and worship, as well as of the novelimaginations which are eventually applauded, instituted, andcherished by society." Stated simply, recent theoreticalinnovations recognize that greater access to unconsciousresources is a cardinal feature of psychedelic, creative, andother novel perceptual experiences, as well as psychosis. Andthat in contrast to hallucinatory states, creative or revelatoryexperiences involve a temporary and voluntarybreaking up of perceptual constancies, permitting one "toshake free from dead literalism, to re-combine the old familiarelements into new, imaginative, amusing, or beautifulpatterns" (Holt & Havel, 1960, p. 304). PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCES AND CONTEMPORARY PSYCHOTHERAPY Consistent with the scene in experimental psychology, asimilar trend away from viewing psychedelic phenomena asundesirable or pathological is also apparent in clinicalpsychology and psychiatry. A growing recognition of the potentialvalue of psychedelic experiences is especially discernible incontemporary psychotherapy. Recent theorizing in psychotherapyreveals an increasing awareness of the restraints imposed byconventional modes of thought and perception. As suggestedearlier, current developments in psychoanalytic theory correctthe previous over- emphasis on maintaining impulse-control and asharp distinction between self and non-self. Instead, presentformulations recognize the relative flatness of consensualreality as well as the creative potential of novel thoughts andimpulses. Representative of this trend, the conditions of mentalhealth proposed by Heinz Hartmann (1958) include the ability to"deautomatize" stereotyped perceptions and the abilityto maintain fluid subject-object boundaries. It is noteworthythat similar attributes have been found to characterize highlyself-actualized persons. More significantly, a number of studieshave found that novel states of awareness including loss ofdistinction between self and non-self, transcendental or peakexperiences, and oceanic feeling states are fairly common in thenormal college population (As, 1962b; Shor, 1960). Furthermore,there has been a greater willingness in recent years toacknowledge and report such experiences without apology orembarrassment. These conceptual revisions and empirical findings also callattention to the well-documented shortcomings of orthodoxtherapies and the critical need for more effective techniques. Ina recent critique of the status of psychotherapy, Colby (1964)concludes that our current paradigms have demonstrably failed andurges a major transition from ordinary to extraordinaryinnovation. Certainly many therapists readily acknowledge whatColby calls an impending crisis. However, Astin (196I) notes that"the principle of functional autonomy will permitpsychotherapy to survive long after it has outlived itsusefulness." A similar view is expressed by Korn (1964,p.38)after examining previous reactions to new methods of treatingpsychopathology. It is notorious that virtually no nostrum has ever been abandoned merely because it failed to work. The old method had always to be overthrown by the new—and it is also notorious that the practitioners of the traditional way will attempt to prevent even the first trial of the method on the strange grounds that it has never been tried and proven—a criterion not applied in their own case. Despite the reluctance to abandon the old and embrace thenew, disillusionment with traditional techniques finds expressionin the current upsurge of interest among therapists of all persuasionsin Zen Buddhism (Maupin, 1962), existentialism (Lyons, 1961), andtranscendental or peak experiences (Maslow, 1962). Alsoindicative of present developments is the host of studiesestablishing personal and cultural belief systems as keyvariables in psychotherapy. The representative work ofHollingshead and Redlich (1958) demonstrated a significantrelationship between social class, incidence and type of mentalillness, and the form of treatment received. The relationshipsfound were remarkably consistent with middle-class Americanvalues. Numerous studies have indicated that improvement intherapy involves a basic change in the patient's core beliefsystem, that therapists' values influence both the process andoutcome of therapy, and that in "successful" outcomes,the patient's value orientation changes in the direction of thetherapist's (see, e.g., London, 1964; Schofield, 1964). These trends are relevant to what is perhaps the major issuein psychotherapy today, namely, the search for positive criteriaof mental health or personal growth which are explicitly based onhumanistic values. It is now generally recognized thatpsychological health or self fulfillment involves more than theabsence of illness or emotional disturbance. These developmentsin mental health concepts have paralleled the recent discoverythat most recipients of psychotherapy are not suffering from thetraditional forms of neurosis and character disorder. Whilecertainly self-dissatisfied and unfulfilled, the person seekingtherapy today is generally not unproductive, ineffective, orcrippled with neurotic symptoms. Many writers have described thetypical therapy patient as one who is relatively free of physicalcomplaints, neurotic anxiety and depression, failures ofachievement, and interpersonal conflicts (Strupp, 1963). Inshort, the hallmarks of emotional disorder are conspicuouslyabsent. Rather, the central struggle for an increasing number ofsuccessful and relatively well-adjusted people seems to be"a loss of meaning in life, an absence of purpose, or afailure of faith" (Schofield, 1964). Modern discontent tendsto take the form of alienation. In William Barrett's terms,alienation from God, from nature, from the human community, andultimately, alienation from self (1958). While recognizing thatthe person with problems in personal identity and life outlookdeserves help, some investigators have concluded that thepsychotherapist is ill-equipped for such a priestly task(Wheelis, 1958). This belief is somewhat substantiated by thedisappointment which many patients of this type experience inpsychotherapy. Yet a dearth of alternative resources seem open tothe person in this predicament. In the light then of what seems to be an incompatibilitybetween psychotherapy, as traditionally conceived, on the onehand, and the nature of modern discontent, on the other, it iscertainly less than a coincidence that many people who fit thisdescription express an interest in the psychedelic experience andfind their way to LSD. It should perhaps be emphasized that theonly sentiment these people share with the stereotyped beatnik isa sense of alienation from traditional values. The attitudes and reactions to LSD, both positive andnegative, become more understandable when viewed against thisbackground of present-day trends in psychology and psychiatry.Within this broader context, it is not surprising that the majorapplication of LSD today is to treat mental illness rather than produceit. Beyond this shift in emphasis, the use of LSD for therapeuticpurposes clearly reflects the ambivalence among therapists towardthe ever-growing number of meaning- and identity-seekers whorequest their services. The research and clinical literatureconcerning LSD as a therapeutic agent reveals two majorviewpoints which seem representative of this ambivalence. Thesetwo orientations are associated with greatly dissimilar methodsof administration. One emphasizes the use of LSD periodically andin small doses as an adjunct to traditional techniques ofpsychotherapy (Crockett et al., 1963). The other major approachemploys LSD in a single, large dose, producing an intense andprolonged psychedelic experience. Applied in this manner, LSDserves as a catalyst for inducing rapid and profound changes inthe subject's value-belief system and in his self-image (Sherwoodet al., 1962). While recognizing the therapeutic benefits of LSD,this latter technique places greater emphasis on its more uniquepotentialities and value, namely, as a means of facilitatingpersonal growth and self-actualization. Rather than freedom fromemotional symptoms, the primary objective of the psychedelicexperience becomes a major reorganization of one's beliefs andlife outlook. In short, the first method is essentiallyillness-oriented, the second, health or growth-oriented. When employed as an adjunct to psychotherapy, mostinvestigators have associated the beneficial effects of LSD withreduced defensiveness, the reliving of early childhoodexperiences, increased access to unconscious material, andgreater emotional expression. In contrast, when used as a primaryvehicle for rapid personality change, emphasis is usually placedon the transcendental quality of the experience, the resynthesisof basic values and beliefs, and major changes in therelationship between self and environment. With regard to effectiveness, both orientations have reportedimpressive results. Since over three hundred studies have beenreported, only the most salient and consistent findings will besummarized. (4)Despite great diversity in the conduct of these studies, highimprovement rates have been almost uniformly reported, with bothadults and children, and in group as well as individualpsychotherapy. Used either as an adjunct or as a primarytreatment method, LSD has been found to facilitate improvement inpatients covering the complete spectrum of neurotic,psychosomatic, and character disorders. Particularly noteworthyare the positive results obtained with cases highly resistant toconventional forms of therapy. High remission rates amongalcoholics, for example, have frequently been reported followinga single, large dose LSD session. Based on their findings withover one thousand alcoholics, Hoffer and his co-workers concludedthat LSD was twice as effective as any other treatment program(1965). Other chronic conditions carrying a poor prognosis whichhave responded favorably to psychedelic therapy include sexualdeviations, criminal psychopathy, autism in children, andadolescent behavior disorders. Since most reports have been based on clinical judgments ofunknown reliability, it is worth noting that comparable resultshave been obtained by investigators in many other countries.Furthermore, Freudian therapists, Jungians, behaviorists,existentialists, and a variety of eclectic therapists havereported positive findings with LSD. It seems safe to concludefrom the breadth and consistency of the clinical evidence thatLSD can produce far-reaching beneficial effects in some people,under some conditions. However, controlled studies of the processvariables involved have yet to be conducted. Specifically, inwhat particular ways do various kinds of people respond to LSD,both during the experience and afterward? What are the optimalconditions of preparation, administration, and follow-up forgiven objectives, and for given subjects? How can we account forthe various kinds and extent of change which follow an LSDexperience? In short, despite the mass of accumulated data on theoutcome of psychedelic therapy, relationships among processvariables remain obscure. Primarily because of the controversy surrounding thesechemical agents (which interestingly is confined to the UnitedStates), controlled research aimed at maximizing their safety,their effectiveness, and their human value has barely begun. Inaddition to questions concerning the possible uses of LSD as atherapeutic or educative device, its potential value as a basicresearch tool for investigating higher mental processes has alsobeen minimally explored. Although clinical evidence andtestimonial reports indicate that LSD promises to be a valuabletool for both the study and enhancement of cognitive andperceptual functioning, such claims have been neither supportednor refuted by means of controlled studies. Other hypothesesreadily testable include the suggested similarities noted earlierbetween psychedelic, hypnotic, and dream states, theinspirational phase of creativity, as well as sensory and dreamdeprivation experiences. PSYCHEDELIC, NADIR, AND PEAK EXPERIENCES The nature, extent, and duration of effects both during andsubsequent to the LSD- induced state has been a major focus ofstudy in the psychedelic research program conducted at theInternational Foundation for Advanced Study, Menlo Park,California. Over a three-year period, extensive assessments wereobtained on almost four hundred subjects before, during, and atvarious points following a psychedelic experience. Each subjectunderwent a single, large dose LSD session conducted in acomfortable, aesthetically pleasing setting. Although trainedstaff members were present throughout the session day, primarilyfor emotional support and human contact, no attempt was made todirect or interpret the experience. Rather, the subject was urgedto explore himself and his universe without external guidance orintrusion. Prior to the LSD experience, each subject was given aphysical and psychiatric examination followed by a series ofpreparatory interviews. These interviews were designed to helpthe individual examine or reexamine his reasons for taking LSD,to clarify whatever problems or questions he wished to explore,and to become accustomed extensive follow-up evaluations weremade covering a minimum of six months. The design of this research program was based on theassumption that significant changes would occur along three majordimensions; values and beliefs, personality, and actual behaviorin major life areas. More specifically, it was hypothesized thata profound psychedelic experience tends to be followed by a majorreorientation of one's value system and life outlook. It wasfurther hypothesized that this change in basic beliefs would interms be followed by slower alterations in personality aswell as changes in modal behavior patterns. The findings so far provide considerable support for thegeneral hypothesis concerning parallel changes in values,personality, and behavior (Mogar and Savage, 1964; Savage et al.,1965a; Savage et al., 1965b). Three days following the LSDsession, a consistent and reliable increase was found in theextent to which an individual agrees with test items reflecting adeep sense of meaning and purpose in life, open-mindedness,greater aesthetic sensitivity, and sense of unity or oneness withnature and humanity. Decreases were found on values pertaining tomaterial possessions, social status, and dogmatism. Alsosignificant was the finding that changes in personal beliefseither remained constant or became still more prominent at laterfollow-ups. These were consistent results cutting across suchfactors as age, sex, religious orientation, or personality type.Thus, it seems safe to conclude that a rapid and extensive changein values does tend to occur in most subjects, and importantly,is maintained over time. The additional hypothesis that slower modifications inpersonality and behavior would occur has also receivedconsiderable support. For example, the data show that if a personvalues human brotherhood more after his psychedelic experience,his personality and behavior reflect this new conviction. Hetends to be less distrustful and guarded with others, warmer andmore spontaneous in expressing emotion, and less prone tofeelings of personal inadequacy. With regard to modal behaviorpatterns, parallel changes tend to occur in such areas as maritalrelations and work effectiveness (Savage et al., 1965a). Although the overall results indicate that almost allsubjects derived some degree of benefit along the lineshypothesized, it is important to emphasize that the nature,extent, and the stability of changes varied considerably.Specific sources or correlates of this variability includedpre-LSD personality structure, the type of presenting problem,and variations in the psychedelic experience itself. With regardto pre-LSD individual differences, subgroups were objectivelydefined according to (a) personality structure (anxietyneurotics, borderline psychotics, nonconforming normals,manic-impulsives, and normal depressives), and (b) major defensepattern (hysterical, intellectual-compulsive). Despite thebrevity of the LSD program, all subgroups displayed positivepersonality changes at two and six months following thepsychedelic experience. The nature and extent of improvementcompared most favorably with longer-term orthodox therapies(Mogar & Savage, 1964). Although each subgroup maintained significant improvement,subjects varied considerably in their capacity to translateprofound insights into attitudes, feelings, and conduct.Individual differences were particularly apparent at six monthssince by this time a leveling off had generally occurred, thatis, most subjects had in large part come to terms with theirrapidly altered self-world image. For six months habitualpatterns of response to situations had been scrutinized andrepeatedly challenged. Dissonance between thought, feeling, andaction had generally been reconciled and a higher level ofintegration achieved At six months some individuals maintainedand consolidated the gains demonstrated at two months(Nonconforming Normals, Manic-Impulsives, Normal Depressives).Others displayed further personal growth which was still inprogress (Anxiety Neurotics, Intellectual-Compulsives). Stillothers showed a tendency to regress from the level of improvementindicated at two months (Borderline Psychotics, Hysterics). Inthese subjects, either the pull of well-entrenched maladaptivedefenses and/or an uncongenial life environment undermined tosome extent the favorable personality alterations demonstratedearlier. With regard to the nature of changes characterizing differentpersonality types, shifts tended to occur consistent with thesymptoms and defense pattern of a given group. Anxiety neuroticswere less anxious, compulsive, and withdrawn while closerelationships were more gratifying. In contrast, impulsive,hyperactive subjects led a more orderly, less hectic existenceand displayed greater impulse control. The "illness-oriented" nature of these findingsreflects the fact that two-thirds of the total sample resembledthe typical case load of an outpatient psychiatric clinic. Theremaining one-third did not present complaints of a psychiatricnature and revealed minimal emotional disturbance according toboth diagnostic evaluation and psychological test data. Instead,the interest expressed by these subjects seemed to be"growth-motivated" rather than"deficiency-motivated." Some were dimly aware ofpotentialities which they hoped to activate and develop morefully. Others expressed a feeling of emptiness and lack ofmeaningful purpose while adequately meeting the exigencies oflife. Still others sought a deeper understanding or moresatisfying resolutions to problems of an existential nature. As a result of their stable life circumstances and relativefreedom from neurotic disturbance, these subjects were morelikely to grapple with ultimate problems during the LSDexperience. In addition to self-identity and personal worth,questions of love, death, creation and rebirth, and theresolution of life paradoxes received frequent attention. Unlikethe neurotic group, childhood memories, intrapsychic conflicts,and specific interpersonal relations were explored minimally.Accounts of the experience written shortly afterward revealedthat healthier subjects were less likely to view the psychedelicstate as fantastic or totally dissimilar from previousexperience. These personal reports together with clinicalevaluations and ratings also indicated that this group benefitedconsiderably from the psychedelic experience along the lines ofself-actualization, richer creative experience, and enhancementof specific aptitudes and talents. At the present time, thesetentative findings are being investigated more objectively withmeasures appropriate for a normal sample. Thus it will bepossible to compare individuals, differing in personality andpresenting problems, with regard to health-growth dimensions aswell as decreases in pathology. Since most subjects in this series of studies were collegetrained and psychologically sophisticated, it is noteworthy thatthe frequency of occurrence of transcendental-like experiences isapparently as great in "naive" prisoners and alcoholics(Unger, 1964a). Such communalities are not surprising in view ofthe key role placed by universal and personal symbolism inpsychedelic experiences and the relatively weak role of theconscious self (including verbal facility, accumulated knowledge,and intelligence). What seems to be affected bysubject-differences is the content of the experience, rather thanits form, intensity, or profundity. Differences in the thematic content of the experience werefound among subjects with diverse cultural backgrounds. Forexample, wide individual differences were demonstrated withrespect to content in the frequent experience of unity. However,the fact that the majority of subjects experienced a sense ofunity or oneness seems far more significant than whether theunity was felt with self, nature, the universe, God, or somecombination of these. This is merely another way of saying thatto the degree an individual can verbalize the experience, he willdraw on his own particular semantic framework and belief system.One can only speculate on the discrepancy between thiscommunicated account of the experience and the experience itself. These findings suggest that the profundity or intensity of apsychedelic experience is more crucially related to subsequentchange than thematic content. More specifically, the hypothesiscurrently being tested is that subsequent transformations invalues, personality, and conduct are a function of theexperience's intensity, either positive or negative-or both. Inother words, painful experiences can be as personally revealingand permanently beneficial as experiences of great joy andbeauty. The hypothesis that a profound and intense psychedelicexperience, regardless of its emotional valence, can serve as acatalyst for rapid personal growth is consistent with currentinterpretations of both nadir and peak experiences. Concerningnadir experiences, Erikson's brilliant analysis of thepost-adolescent identity crisis (1959) has recently been extendedto include periodic "crisis of maturation" (Kahn,1963), naturally occurring "desolation experiences"(Laski, 1961), and the therapeutic value of "existentialcrises" (Bugental, 1965). In each case, these writersemphasize that although negative and painful, a personal crisisis: (a) not pathological, (b) a critical choice point in lifenecessitating a "leap of faith," (c) an essentialcondition of growth and psychological change, and (d) often acatalyst for an emerging inner conviction or new awareness. Thepotential value of nadir experiences has been well-stated byForer (1963, p.280): "Crisis as a psychological experienceis a part of any creative effort, scientific, artistic,therapeutic, or inter-personal." With regard to positive revelatory experiences, Maslowrecently developed the thesis that experiences referred to asreligious, mystical, or transcendental actually denote specialcases of the more generic "core-religious" or peakexperience, described as the hallmark of highly self- actualizedpeople (Maslow, 1964). Similarly, the extensive research oncreativity by MacKinnon and his associates indicates that thetruly creative person is distinguished from the noncreativeindividual by his capacity for "transliminalexperience" (MacKinnon, 1964). Following Harold Rugg's studyof creative imagination, the transliminal experience ischaracterized by an illuminating flash of insight occurring at acritical threshold of the conscious-unconscious continuum.MacKinnon's description of the transliminal experience bears astriking resemblance to the more inclusive peak experience.Interestingly, Maslow (1964) suggests that psychedelic drugs mayoffer a means of producing a controlled peak experience underobservation, particularly in "non-peakers." Although tentative at this point, these lines ofinvestigation seem highly significant and certainly suggestive offuture directions in LSD research. And if the historicalperspective described earlier is relatively accurate, theexploration of ways of expanding human consciousness will soonoccupy a prominent position in the mainstream of contemporarypsychology. Should this prediction materialize, we can lookforward to a far more extensive application of these powerfulagents as a means of facilitating social as well as individualpotentialities. For the present, research with the psychedelicswill continue to seek those conditions which maximize theirsafety, their effectiveness, and their human value. (1) See Rene Dubos' excellent accountof "Humanistic Biology" (1965). Similar trends incontemporary fiction, poetry, and drama have been summarized byMogar (1964). (back) (2) The comparable effects andinterpretations described here are well documented in theresearch literature. Representative and recent reports may befound in Barron (1963) on creativity, Zuckerman (1964) on sensorydeprivation, Cohen (1964) on psychedelic states, Weitzenhoffer(1963) on hypnosis, and Dement (1960) on dream deprivation. (back) (3) The extensive research byTheodore R. Sarbin and his co-workers indicates that the same"as-if" dimension is central to both acting andhypnosis. The as-if attitude prominent in hypnotic states isviewed as analogous to the "creative-if" proposed byStanislavsky as the very essence of acting talent (Sarbin &Lirn, 1963).

Tart, copyright1969, 1972 by John Wiley & Sons. A number of creative people claim to have benefited frompsychotherapy which utilized psychedelic drugs. Actor Cary Grantattributed "a new assessment of life" to LSD (Gaines,1963). Blues singer Ronnie Gilbert, in 1964, was mired in a deepdepressive state from which she found it impossible to breakfree. In desperation, she entered LSD therapy and, during thefollowing six months, went through 20 psychedelic sessions.Frequently, Miss Gilbert and her psychiatrist went for walks inthe park or visited art galleries and churches. During one stroll through the park, Miss Gilbert felt a"sense of life all around me; I looked at trees for thefirst time, really looked at them." She recalled that"everything seemed so rich and so intense." Thisspontaneous experience (which was not chemically induced)hastened her progress and therapy soon terminated. Several yearslater she remarked, "I've been turned on to life and havenever been so happy." Miss Gilbert's psychiatrist commented. "Ronnie waslucky. She was one of the people who have been able to workthrough lifelong problems in a few sessions, and there is noreason why the good results shouldn't stick. Not everybody getsas much out of the experience. She was also lucky because shecame into therapy before federal restrictions clamped down onit" (Gaines, 1963). Only five major research projects in the area of psychedelicdrugs and creative performance have been reported and most ofthese have been described by the experimenters as "pilotstudies" rather than full-scale experiments with conclusiveresults. L.M. Berlin et al., (1955) investigated the effects ofmescaline and LSD upon four graphic artists of nationalprominence. There was an impairment of finger-tapping efficiencyand muscular steadiness among the four artists, but all were ableto complete paintings. A panel of art critics judged thepaintings as having "greater aesthetic value" than theartists' usual work, noting that the lines were bolder and thatthe use of color was more vivid. However, the technical executionwas somewhat impaired. The artists themselves spoke of an increased richness ofimagery and of pleasurable sensory experiences. One said, "Ilooked out of the window into the infinitely splendid universe ofa tiny mauve leaf performing a cosmic ballet." Another spokeof "light falling on light." Frank Barron (1963) administered psilocybin to a number ofhighly creative individuals and recorded their impressions. Oneof Barron's subjects stated, "I felt a communion with allthings." A composer wrote, "Every corner is alive in asilent intimacy." Barron concluded, "What psilocybindoes is to . . . dissolve many definitions and . . . melt manyboundaries, permit greater intensities or more extreme values ofexperience to occur in many dimensions." Some of Barron's artists, however, were wildly enthusiasticabout their apparently increased sensitivity during the drugexperience only to discover, once the effects wore off, that theproduction was without artistic merit. One painter recalled,"I have seldom known such absolute identification with whatI was doing—nor such a lack of concern with itafterwards." This statement indicates that an artist is notnecessarily able to judge the value of his psychedelicallyinspired work while he is under drug influence. McGlothlin, Cohen, and McGlothlin (1967) made an intensivestudy of 72 volunteer graduate students following a preliminarystudy (1964) which involved 15 subjects. (In the preliminarystudy, no significant changes in creativity were noted followinga 200 microgram LSD session; a number of creativity tests weregiven before the session and one week after the session. However,some significant changes were reported on anxiety and attitudetests.) A large battery of psychological tests was administered priorto a series of three 200 microgram LSD sessions, and again atintervals of two weeks and six months following the thirdsession. Among the tests in the battery were three art scales, ameasure of artistic performance, a test of imaginativeness, atest of originality, four tests of divergent thinking, and a testof remote associations. Three groups were created: an experimental group receiving200 micrograms of LSD per session, a control group receiving 25micrograms of LSD per session, and another control groupreceiving 20 milligrams of an amphetamine per session. As therewere no systematic differences between the two control groups atthe end of the study, they were combined for purposes ofcomparison with the experimental group. The most frequently reported change in the experimental groupon a questionnaire filled out after six months was "agreater appreciation of music"; 62 per cent of the subjectsmade this assertion. The increase in number of records bought,time spent in museums, and number of musical events attended inthe post-drug period was significantly greater for theexperimental group. However, the subjects' scores on the arttests did not show a significant increase; the authors concludedthat the data "do not indicate that the increase inaesthetic appreciation and activities is accompanied by anincrease in sensitivity and performance." On the questionnaire filled out after six months, 25 per centof experimental Subjects felt that LSD experience had resulted inenhanced creativity in their work. However, the creativity testsshowed no evidence to substantiate this subjective report for theexperimental group as a whole or for those claiming greatercreative ability. The other tests in the battery produced provocative resultsin regard to personality variables and the taking of LSD. Theauthors reported that "persons who place strong emphasis onstructure and control generally have no taste for the experienceand tend to respond minimally if exposed. Those who respondintensely tend to prefer a more unstructured, spontaneous,inward-turning (though not socially introverted) life, and scoresomewhat higher on tests of aesthetic sensitivity andimaginativeness. They also tend to be less aggressive,competitive, and conforming." On the one measure of artistic performance used (theDraw-A-Person Test), the LSD subjects showed a significantdecrease after six months. Zegans, Pollard, and Brown (1967) investigated the effects ofLSD upon creativity test scores of 30 male subjects chosen from agroup of volunteer graduate students. Upon arrival, the firstbattery of tests was given and certain physiological measures(blood pressure and pulse rate) were taken. A dose of LSD equalto 0.5 micrograms per kilogram body weight was added to the waterof 19 subjects randomly selected to receive the drug; the other 1l subjects did not receive LSD. After ingestion (of the drug),the subject was escorted to a lounge where he relaxed for twohours. Immediately prior to the second half of the test battery(which consisted of alternate forms of the same tests previouslygiven), the physiological measures were repeated. The battery oftests included a measure of remote association, a test oforiginality for word associations, a test for ability to createan original design from tiles, a free association test, and ameasure involving the ability to perceive hidden figures in acomplicated line drawing. A tachistoscopic stimulation task wasalso included; this determined speed of visual perception. When the creativity test data were investigated, it wasdiscovered that the LSD group did significantly better than thecontrol group on the re-test for originality of word associations(a modified form of the Rapaport Word Association Test). Althoughmost other comparisons favored the LSD group, no other resultswere statistically significant. The authors concluded that"the administration of LSD-25 to a relatively unselectedgroup of people for the purpose of enhancing their creativeability is not likely to be successful." A further analysis of the data demonstrated that the authorswere able to predict physiological reactions to a significantdegree of accuracy on the basis of previously administeredpersonality tests. It was also noted that the LSD subjects(although doing significantly better than control subjects on theword association test) made their poorest showing on those testsrequiring visual attention (e.g., the tachistoscopic task, thetile design test, the hidden figures test). It was suggested thatLSD "may increase the accessibility of remote or uniqueideas and associations" while making it difficult for asubject to narrow his attention upon a delimited perceptualfield. As a result "greater openness to remote or uniqueideas and associations would only be likely to enhance creativethought in those individuals who were meaningfully engaged insome specific interest or problem." The Institute of Psychedelic Research of San Francisco StateCollege employed mescaline in an attempt to facilitate thecreative process (Fadiman et al., 1965; Harman et al., 1966). Thesubjects were professional workers in various fields, who wereinstructed to bring a professional problem requiring a creativesolution to their sessions. A number of them had worked for weeksor months on their chosen problems without success. After somepsychological preparation, subjects worked individually on theirproblem throughout their single mescaline session. Virtually allsubjects produced solutions judged highly creative andsatisfactory by practical standards. Two of the five cited studies suggest that unselectedgraduate students cannot expect an increase in creative abilityas a result of their participation in an LSD experiment. On theother hand, creative workers in three studies utilizingpsychedelic drugs showed an enhancement of creative functioning.The results must be regarded as tentative until additional workhas been done in this field and until a greater control isexerted over the many variables present. (footnote) NINETY-ONE ARTISTS During 1967, in an attempt to discover the types ofpsychedelic drugs being used illegally by artists, as well as thesubjective opinions of the users, Krippner (1967) surveyed 9lartists who were reputed to have had one or more"psychedelic experiences." Among the 91 were anaward-winning film-maker, a Guggenheim Fellow in poetry, and arecipient of Ford, Fulbright, and Rockefeller study grants inpainting. A remarkably large number of the artists surveyed (93 percent) agreed with a broad definition of the "psychedelicartist" and 8I per cent felt that the term could be appliedto them personally. It was concluded that the "psychedelicartist" is one whose work shows the effects of psychedelicexperience—usually, but not necessarily, chemically induced.The work may have been produced as a result of psychedelicexperience, during psychedelic experience, or in attempt toinduce a psychedelic experience. In addition, the work may remindsomeone of a previous psychedelic experience or it may be used tofacilitate psychedelic experience brought about by somethingother than the work of art. Of the 91 artists in the survey, 100 per cent reported havinghad at least one psychedelic experience. When asked if they hadever taken a psychedelic substance, 96 per cent answered"yes" while 4 per cent answered "no." Of the chemical substances, LSD was mentioned by more artiststhan any other drug, followed by marijuana, DMT, peyote,mescaline, morning glory seeds, psilocybin, hashish, DET, andyage. A few artists had tried Kava-Kava, ibogaine, bufotenin,Ditran, the amanita muscaria mushroom, and the Hawaiian woodrose. One artist reported experimenting with STP, a powerful andlong-lasting drug manufactured by an "undergroundchemist" in California while several others had toasted andsmoked the inside of banana skins, usually with extremely mildand inconsequential results. A few artists claimed to haveobtained psychedelic effects from substances generally notconsidered psychedelic—benzedrine (an amphetamine or psychicenergizer), opium (a narcotic), ritalin, kinotrine, amyl nitrate,and nitrous oxide. The artists surveyed were asked if their psychedelicexperiences (chemically as well as non-chemically induced) weregenerally pleasant. An unqualified "yes" response wasgiven by 91 per cent of the group while 5 per cent gave aqualified "yes" response. In the latter cases, it wasstated that some of their initial "trips" wereunpleasant but that their later experiences were pleasurable. Oneartist answered this question negatively and three others did notrespond. When the artists were asked, "How have your psychedelicexperiences influenced your art}" none of them felt thattheir work had suffered as a result of psychedelic experience,although some admitted that their friends might disagree withthis judgment. Three per cent of the artists stated that theirpsychedelic experiences had not influenced their work one way orthe other, The others cited a number of effects which fell intothree broad categories: content, technique, and approach. In mostcases, the artists reported effects that fell into more than onecategory. Seventy per cent of the group stated that psychedelicexperience had affected the content of their work, the mostfrequently cited example being their use of eidetic imagery assubject matter. Fifty-four per cent of the artists surveyed said there hadbeen a noticeable improvement in their artistic techniqueresulting from their psychedelic sessions; a greater ability touse color was the example mentioned most frequently. Fifty-two per cent of the artists attributed a change intheir creative approach to the psychedelics. Frequently made wasthe claim that psychedelic experience had eliminatedsuperficiality from the artists' work and had given them greaterdepth as people and as creators. Some referred to their firstpsychedelic experience as a "peak experience," as aturning point in their lives. "My dormant interest in musicbecame an active one," said a musician, "after a fewsessions with peyote and DMT." Another said that apsilocybin experience "caused me to enjoy the art of drawingfor the first time in my life." The impact of psychedelic experience upon an individual wasillustrated in the case of Isaac Abrams, one of Krippner'ssubjects. In an interview, the artist stated that"psychedelic experience has deeply influenced all aspects ofmy life. It was an experience of self-recognition, under LSD,which opened my eyes to drawing and painting as the means ofself-expression for which I had always been seeking. Duringsubsequent experiences, many difficulties, personal and artistic,were resolved. When the personal difficulties were solved, energywas released for the benefit of my art." Upon graduation from college, Abrams got married, touredEurope, and went to work selling furniture. "I had beentaught," he said, "that the most important things inlife were to look neat, act nice, and make money. Yet, I knewthat something was missing. There was something to do that Iwasn't doing. I had a sense of mission but no idea what themission might be." Abrams was offered mescaline by a friend but turned it down.Several years later, in 1962, he was offered psilocybin anddecided to give it a try. On Washington's birthday, Abrams andhis wife took psilocybin. Abrams watched the ceiling whirl,turned off the lights, and realized for the first time thatduring all the years of his life he had been behaving "likea person who had no mind." Abrams enjoyed his psilocybin experience and a few monthslater had another opportunity to try mescaline. "We took itin the country and it was beautiful." His next psychedelicexperiences were with marijuana; once again, these were pleasantand positive in nature. The inner life having been opened up by these episodes,Abrams thought that he might discover his "life'smission." The search was in vain. He sold more furniture. Hewrote a play. He entered graduate school, but this was not forhim and he dropped out. Early in 1965, Abrams took LSD. During his session, he beganto draw. "As I worked," he recalled, "Iexperienced a process of selfrealization concerning the drawing.When the drug wore off, I kept on drawing. I did at least one inkdrawing every few weeks." Abrams attended art classes to learn about technique andmaterials. His wife went to different classes, took notes, andpassed on the information to her husband. The skills developedquickly and he began to paint. Abrams entered psychoanalysis with a well-known psychoanalystwho specialized in the creative process. The artist mused,"Analysis helps me to mobilize the psychedelic experienceand externalize it. I think any individual can go just so far onhis own. At some point he needs a spiritual teacher or guru. Agood psychoanalyst can be a guru. "For me," Abrams continued, "the psychedelicexperience basically has been one of turning on to the lifeprocess, to the dance of life with all of its motion and change.Before 1962, my behavior was based on logical, rational, andlinear experience. Due to the psychedelics, I also becameinfluenced by experiences that were illogical, irrational, andnon- linear. But this, too, is a part of life. This aspect isneeded if life is to become interrelated and harmonious. "Psychedelic drugs give me a sense of harmony andbeauty. For the first time in my life, I can take pleasure in thebeauty of a leaf; I can find meaning in the processes of nature.For me to paint an ugly picture would be a lie. It would be aviolation of what I have learned through psychedelicexperience." Abrams continued, "I have found that I can flow throughmy pen and brush; everything I do becomes a part ofmyself—an exchange of energy. The canvas becomes a part ofmy brain. With the psychedelics, you learn to think outside ofyour head. My art attempts to express or reproduce my innerstate." Abrams concluded, "Psychedelic experienceemphasizes the unity of things, the infinite dance. You are thewave, but you are also the ocean." Krippner noted that he rarely had found artists among thecasualties of illegal drug usage, suggesting that an artist muststand somewhat apart from his culture in order to create."To invent something new," Krippner concluded,"one cannot be completely conditioned or imprinted. Perhapsit is this type of an individual—the person who will not bealarmed at what he perceives or conceptualizes during apsychedelic session—who can most benefit from these alteredstates of consciousness." Cohen (1964) summarized the research data on creativity andthe psychedelics by stating, "Whether LSD does or does notincrease creativity remains an open question. No systematicresearch is available to help in finding an answer. All that canbe said at this time about the effect of LSD on the creativeprocess is that a strong subjective feeling of creativenessaccompanies many of the experiences." (footnote) An additional study(Janinger, personal communication, 1967) is being evaluated atthe present time. Fifty prominent artists painted a picture of astandard object (an American Indian doll) before ingesting LSD.During their psychedelic sessions, they again painted the doll.The 100 paintings are being evaluated on the basis of severalartistic criteria in an attempt to determine what type of changetook place as well as the artistic merit (or lack of merit)reflected by the change.

HARMAN AND JAMES FADIMAN From: PSYCHEDELICS, The Uses and Implications ofHallucinogenic Drugs, Bernard Aaronson and Humphrey Osmond,editors, Doubleday & Company, 1970. Copyright Aaronson &Osmond, Harman & Fadiman. The following article is anoverview of the paper: Harman, et. al., in Psychedelic Reports19, 211-27, 1966, "Psychedelic Agents in CreativeProblem-Solving: A Pilot Study." (This article discusses exploratory work that was interrupted early in 1966 when the Food and Drug Administration, as a strategy in combating the illicit-use problem, declared a moratorium on research with normal human subjects. In view of the preliminary nature of the work, it would not under ordinary circumstances have been submitted for publication. However, because of the significance of the hypotheses, and because they are consistent with experience gained in a previous study of four hundred subjects who received psychedelics in a therapy context, and because of the hope that when it is again possible to resume psychedelic research the non-medical applications will get long-overdue attention, the decision was made to release these results in their present, unfinished form.) Amid much controversy over the place of psychedelic chemicalsin contemporary culture, we have quietly entered a third phase ofthe research on human uses of these agents. The first phase, typically identified in the literature by theuse of the adjective "psychotomimetic," wascharacterized by dominance of a priori structured models.Seriously underestimating the effects that such preconceptionsmight have on the content and aftereffects of the subjectiveexperience, researchers variously reported that psychedelicsmimicked mental illness (when given in a setting that provokedit), illuminated Freudian theory (when administered by acompetent Freudian), evoked Jungian archetypes (when administeredby a sensitive Jungian), substantiated the tenets of behaviortherapy (by increasing suggestibility and modifiability), anddemonstrated the soundness of the existential approach. The second phase, adopting Osmond's neologism"psychedelic," was characterized by an emphasis onallowing the drug session to run its natural course, in anattempt to minimize the influence of the conceptions andinterpretations of the therapist or monitor. Care was taken toprovide such expectations, rapport, and environment that theexperience would be as non- threatening as possible. Opinionsvaried as to what constitutes optimum set and setting, andsubjects and experimenters varied. As a consequence, reportedeffects range from ecstasy to psychosis, from community toisolation, from greatly enhanced mental and perceptual abilitiesto greatly impaired abilities. From this work emerged a varietyof psychotherapeutic applications, well summarized by Hoffer(1965), as well as widespread, mainly illicit, use with sensual,philosophical, and transcendental goals. Growing out of this informal experimentation and clinicalresearch, largely as a consequence of suggestive spontaneousoccurrences, the possibility gradually emerged that specifickinds of performance might be selectively enhanced by deliberatestructuring of psychedelic-agent administrations. Thus a thirdphase of psychedelic research began. Whereas, in the first phase,experiences tended to be controlled and delimited---never mind ifinadvertently---by preconceptions of experimenter and subject,and in the second phase they tended to be more uncontrolled andwide-ranging in scope, now the emphasis was to be on deliberateselection of specific aspects of the psychedelic experience andof specific parameters of functioning. As these experiments on specific performance enhancementthrough directed use of the psychedelics have gone on in variouscountries of the world, on both sides of the Iron Curtain, andas, furthermore, some, at least, of the informal exploration hasbeen in defiance of existing laws governing use of thepsychedelic agents, publicly available information on results isscant and scattered. In the remainder of this chapter we shalldiscuss one pilot study in which the particular type ofperformance chosen for attention was creative problem-solvingability. The implications of the work are, we believe, muchbroader than this particular application. Indeed, the basicassumption underlying setting up the project, and not negated byany of our observations during the course of the research, isthat, given appropriate conditions, the psychedelic agents canbe employed to enhance any aspect of mental performance, in thesense of making it more operationally effective. While thisresearch was restricted to intellectual and artistic activity, webelieve the assumption holds true for any other mental,perceptual, or emotional process. The psychedelic agent acts as afacilitator, an adjunct to the situation it facilitates, neithergood nor evil, efficacious nor powerless, safe nor dangerous. Rationale Behind the Creative Problem-Solving Study Reports in the literature on psychedelic agents that deal witheffects on performance are inconclusive or contradictory. Changesin performance levels have been intensively investigated, bothduring and after the drug session. Instrumental learning has beenfound to be impaired during the drug experience in some studies,enhanced in others. Similarly, contradictory results have beennoted for color perception, recall and recognition,discrimination learning, concentration, symbolic thinking, andperceptual accuracy (Mogar, 1965a). In some of the research, where impairment was reported, thedrug was used as a stresser with the intention of simulatingpsychotic performance-impairment. Practically all of the formalresearch in which improved performance was claimed subsequent tothe drug experience has been in a clinical context. Performanceenhancement during the drug experience has been sporadicallyreported in both experimental and clinical research, but not ingeneral where the psychotomimetic orientation was dominant. Our experience in clinical research (Mogar and Savage, 1964;Fadiman 1965; Savage et al., 1966) had been amply convincing withregard to the possibility of long-term performance enhancementthrough employment of the psychedelic agents in a clinicalsetting. We also had much evidence with regard to the subtletyand pervasiveness of the influence of set and setting.Furthermore, although they had not been deliberately sought,there were numerous spontaneous incidents of what appeared to betemporarily enhanced performance during the drug experienceitself. These observations led us to postulate the followingpropositions: 1. Any human function, as generally elicited, can be performedmore effectively. This amounts to an acknowledgement that we donot function at our full capacity. 2. The psychedelics appear to temporarily inhibit censors thatordinarily limit the mental contents coming into consciousawareness. The subject may, for example, discover his latentability to form colored imagery, to hallucinate, to recallforgotten experiences of early childhood, to generate meaningfulsymbolic presentations, etc. By leading the subject to expectenhancement of other types of performance---creative problemsolving, learning manual or verbal skills, manipulating logicalor mathematical symbols, sensory or extrasensory perception,memory and recall---and by providing favorable preparatory andenvironmental conditions, it may be possible to improve the levelof functioning in any desired respect. 3. Both objective and subjective indicators of mentalperformance are appropriate to use in establishing whether therehas indeed been an improvement (or impairment) of performance. As Table 1 indicates, commonly observedcharacteristics of the psychedelic experience seem to operateboth for and against the hypothesis that the drug session couldbe used for performance enhancement. In this research weattempted to provide a setting that would maximize thosecharacteristics that tend toward improved functioning, whileminimizing those that might hinder effective functioning. For several reasons we chose to focus our efforts on creativeproblem solving. One was its obvious utility, an importantconsideration at that juncture because of the increasing pressurefor stricter regulation of the psychedelics by those who doubtedthat they were good for anything at all. Another factor was thatmany of the observed spontaneous occurrences had been of thissort. Finally, because of extensive recent research activity inthe field of creativity, a number of relevant objective measureswere available for use. Interest centered on three questions: 1. Can the psychedelic experience enhance creativeproblem-solving ability, and if so, what is the evidence ofenhancement? 2. Can this result in enhanced production of concrete, valid,and feasible solutions assessable by the pragmatic criteria ofmodern industry and positivistic science? 3. Working with a non-clinical population and with anon-therapy orientation, would there nevertheless resultdemonstrable long-term personality changes indicative ofcontinued increased creativity and self- actualization? Procedure The subjects in these experiments were twenty-seven malesengaged in a variety of professional occupations (sixteenengineers, one engineer-physicist, two mathematicians, twoarchitects, one psychologist, one furniture designer, onecommercial artist, one sales manager, and one personnel manager).Nineteen of the subjects had had no previous experience withpsychedelics. The following selection criteria were established: 1. Participant's occupation normally requires problem-solvingability. 2. Participant is found to be psychologically stable asdetermined by psychiatric interview- examination. 3. Participant is motivated to discover, verify, and applysolutions within his current work capacity. Each group of four subjects met one another during an eveningsession several days before the experimental day. (In one of thegroups, one subject had to be eliminated, which left only three.)The proposed sequence of events during the experimental sessionwas explained in detail. This initial meeting also served thefunction of allaying apprehension and establishing rapport andtrust among the members and the staff. Subjects were told that they would experience little or nodifficulties with distractions such as visions, involvement withpersonal emotional states, and so on. The instructions emphasizedthat the experience could be directed as desired. Directsuggestions were made to encourage mental flexibility during thesession. An excerpt from those instructions is quoted below: Some suggestions on approaches: Try identifying with the central person, object, or process in the problem. See how the problem looks from this vantage point. Try asking to "see" the solution, to visualize how various parts might work together, to see how a certain situation will work out in future, etc. You will find it is possible to scan a large number of possible solutions, ideas, data from the memory etc., much more rapidly than usual. The "right" solution will often appear along with a sort of intuitive "knowing" that it is the answer sought. You will also find that you can hold in conscious awareness a number of ideas or pieces of data processes simultaneously, to an uncommon extent. You will find it is possible to "step" back from the problem and see it in new perspective, in more basic terms; to abandon previously tried approaches and start afresh (since there is much less of yourself invested in these earlier trials). Above all, don't be timid in the ambitiousness with which you ask questions. If you want to see the completed solution in a three-dimensional image, or to project yourself forward in time, or view some microscopic physical process, or view something not visible to your physical eyes, or re-experience some event out of the past, by all means ask. Don't let your questions be limited by your notion of what can and what cannot happen. Approximately one hour of pencil-and-paper tests wereadministered at this time. Subjects were told that they wouldtake a similar battery during the experimental session. To insurethat the problems to be worked on were appropriate for thepurpose, each participant was asked to present his selectionbriefly. By the end of the preparation session, participants weregenerally anticipative and at ease. They had been given a clearpicture of what to expect, as well as information on how to copewith any difficulties that might arise. The session day was spent as follows: 8:30 Arrive at session room 9:00 Psychedelic material given. Mescaline sulphate (200 mg). 9-12 Music played, subjects relaxed with eyes closed 12-1 Psychological tests administered 1-5 Subjects work on problems 5-6 Discussion of experience; review of solutions. Participants were driven home after this. They were given asedative, which they might take if they experienced anydifficulty in sleeping. In many cases, however, they preferred tostay up until well after midnight, continuing to work on insightsand solutions discovered earlier in the day. Each subject wrote a subjective account of his experiencewithin a week after the experimental session. Approximately sixweeks after the session, subjects were administeredquestionnaires that related to (1) the effects of the session onpost-session creative ability and (2) the validity and acceptanceof solutions conceived during the session. These data were inaddition to the psychometric data comparing results of the twotesting periods. Subjective Reports The literature on creativity includes analytical descriptionof the components of creative experience, the personalcharacteristics of creative individuals, and the distinguishingfeatures of creative solutions. From the participants' reports,it was possible to extract eleven strategies of enhancedfunctioning during the session. The relationship of thesestrategies to enhanced functioning should be self-explanatory.Those readers interested in the relationship of these aspects tocurrent research and theory on creativity can refer to thedetailed technical discussion in Harman, McKim et al. (1966). The factors are listed below with representative quotationsfrom the subjects' reports. 1. Low Inhibition and Anxiety: "There was no fear, no worry, no sense of reputation andcompetition, no envy, none of these things which in varyingdegrees have always been present in my work." "A lowered sense of personal danger; I don't feelthreatened any more, and there is no feeling of my reputationbeing at stake." "Although doing well on these problems would be fine,failure to get ahead on them would be threatening. However, as itturned out, on this afternoon the normal blocks in the way ofprogress seemed to be absent." 2. Capacity to Restructure Problem in Larger Context: "Looking at the same problem with (psychedelic)materials, I was able to consider it in a much more basic way,because I could form and keep in mind a much broaderpicture." "I could handle two or three different ideas at the sametime and keep track of each." "Normally I wouldoverlook many more trivial points for the sake of expediency, butunder the drug, time seemed unimportant. I faced every possiblequestionable issue square in the face." "Ability to start from the broadest general basis in thebeginning . . ." "I returned to the original problem.... I tried, I thinkconsciously, to think of the problem in its totality, rather thanthrough the devices I had used before." 3. Enhanced Fluency and Flexibility of Ideation: "I began to work fast, almost feverishly, to keep up withthe flow of ideas." "I began to draw . . . my senses could not keep up withmy images . . . my hand was not fast enough . . . my eyes werenot keen enough . . . I was impatient to record the picture (ithas not faded one particle). I worked at a pace I would not havethought I was capable of." "I was very impressed with the ease with which ideasappeared (it was virtually as if the world is made of ideas, andso it is only necessary to examine any part of the world to getan idea). I also got the feeling that creativity is an activeprocess in which you limit yourself and have an objective, sothere is a focus about which ideas can cluster and relate." ". . . I dismissed the original idea entirely, andstarted to approach the graphic problem in a radically differentway. That was when things started to happen. All kinds ofdifferent possibilities came to mind...." "And the feeling during this period of profuse productionwas one of joy and exuberance.... It was the pure fun of doing,inventing, creating, and playing." 4. Heightened Capacity for Visual Imagery and Fantasy: "Was able to move imaginary parts in relation to eachother." ". . . it was the non-specific fantasy that triggered theidea." "The next insight came as an image of an oyster shell,with the mother-of-pearl shining in different colors. Itranslated that in the idea of an interferometer-two layersseparated by a gap equal to the wave length it is desired toreflect." ". . . As soon as I began to visualize the problem, onepossibility immediately occurred. A few problems with thatconcept occurred, which seemed to solve themselves ratherquickly.... Visualizing the required cross section wasinstantaneous." "Somewhere along in here, I began to see an image of thecircuit. The gates themselves were little silver cones linkedtogether by lines. I watched the circuit flipping through itspaces.. . ." "I began visualizing all the properties known to me thata photon possesses and attempted to make a model for a photon....The photon was comprised of an electron and a positron cloudmoving together in an intermeshed synchronized helical orbit....This model was reduced for visualizing purposes to a black andwhite ball propagating in a screw-like fashion through space. Ikept putting the model through all sorts of known tests." 5. Increased Ability to Concentrate: "Was able to shut out virtually all distractinginfluences." "I was easily able to follow a train of thought to aconclusion where normally I would have been distracted manytimes." "I was impressed with the intensity of concentration, theforcefulness and exuberance with which I could proceed toward thesolution." "I considered the process of photoconductivity.... I keptasking myself, "What is light?" and subsequently,"What is a photon?" The latter question I repeated tomyself several hundred times till it was being said automaticallyin synchronism with each breath. I probably never in my lifepressured myself as intently with a question as I did thisone." "It is hard to estimate how long this problemmight have taken without the psychedelic agent, but it was thetype of problem that might never have been solved. It would havetaken a great deal of effort and racking of the brains to arriveat what seemed to come more easily during the session." 6. Heightened Empathy with External Processes and Objects: ". . . the sense of the problem as a living thing that isgrowing toward its inherent solution." "First I somehow considered being the needle and beingbounced around in the groove." "I spent a productive period . . . climbing down on myretina, walking around and thinking about certain problemsrelating to the mechanism of vision." "Ability to grasp the problem in its entirety, to 'dive'into it without reservations, almost like becoming theproblem" "Awareness of the problem itself rather thanthe 'I' that is trying to solve it" 7. Heightened Empathy with People: "It was also felt that group performance was affected in. . . subtle ways. This may be evidence that some sort of groupaction was going on all the time." "Only at intervals did I become aware of the music.Sometimes, when I felt the other guys listening to it; and it wasa physical feeling of them listening to it." "Sometimes we even had the feeling of having the samethoughts or ideas." 8. Subconscious Data More Accessible: ". . . brought about almost total recall of a course thatI had had in thermodynamics; something that I had never given anythought about in years." "I was in my early teens and wandering through thegardens where I actually grew up. I felt all my prior emotions inrelation to my surroundings." 9. Association of Dissimilar Ideas: "I had earlier devised an arrangement for beam steeringon the two-mile accelerator which reduced the amount of hardwarenecessary by a factor of two.... Two weeks ago it was pointed outto me that this scheme would steer the beam into the wall andtherefore was unacceptable. During the session, I looked at theschematic and asked myself how could we retain the factor of twobut avoid steering into the wall. Again a flash of inspiration,in which I thought of the word "alternate." I followedthis to its logical conclusion, which was to alternate polaritiessector by sector so the steering bias would not add but cancel. Iwas extremely impressed with this solution and the way it came tome." "Most of the insights come by association." "It was the last idea that I thought was remarkablebecause of the way in which it developed. This idea was theresult of a fantasy that occurred during Wagner [Note: theparticipant had earlier listened to Wagner's 'Ride of theValkyries.'].... I put down a line which seemed to embody this[fantasy].... I later made the handle which my sketches suggestedand it had exactly the quality I was looking for.... I was veryamused at the ease with which all of this was done." l0. Heightened Motivation to Obtain Closure: "Had tremendous desire to obtain an elegant solution (themost for the least) ." "All known constraints about the problem weresimultaneously imposed as I hunted for possible solutions. It waslike an analog computer whose output could not deviate from whatwas desired and whose input was continually perturbed with theinclination toward achieving the output." "It was almost an awareness of the 'degree of perfection'of whatever I was doing." "In what seemed like ten minutes, I had completed theproblem, having what I considered (and still consider) a classicsolution." 11. Visualizing the Completed Solution: "I looked at the paper I was to draw on. I was completelyblank. I knew that I would work with a property three hundredfeet square. I drew the property lines (at a scale of one inch toforty feet), and I looked at the outlines. I was blank. Suddenly I saw the finished project [Note: the project was ashopping center specializing in arts and crafts]: I did somequick calculations . . . it would fit on the property and notonly that . . . it would meet the cost and income requirements .. . it would park enough cars . . . it met all the requirements.It was contemporary architecture with the richness of a culturalheritage . . . it used history and experience but did not copyit." "I visualized the result I wanted and subsequentlybrought the variables into play which could bring that resultabout. I had great visual (mental) perceptibility; I couldimagine what was wanted, needed, or not possible with almost noeffort. I was amazed at my idealism, my visual perception, andthe rapidity with which I could operate." Results: Subjective Ratings As mentioned above, several weeks after the experimentalsession all participants were asked to complete a briefquestionnaire. Here they rated their experience with respect tonine characteristics relevant to enhanced functioning. Items wererated on a five-point scale from MARKED ENHANCEMENT (+2) throughNO CHANGE (O) to MARKED IMPAIRMENT (-2) . The average ratings arelisted in Table 2. These data, too, seem tosubstantiate the hypothesis of enhancement of both verbal andnon-verbal skills. Results: Psychometric Data Test-retest scores on some of the measures used showeddramatic changes from normal to psychedelic-session conditions.Most apparent were enhanced abilities to recognize patterns, tominimize and isolate visual distractions, and to maintain visualmemory in spite of confusing changes of form and color. Specifictests used included the Purdue Creativity, the Miller ObjectVisualization, and the Witkin Embedded Figures. This last testhas been reported to be stable under a variety of experimentalinterventions including stress, training, sensory isolation,hypnosis, and the influence of a variety of drugs (Witkin et al.,1962). With these twenty-seven subjects, enhancement wasconsistent (p<.01), and in some cases improvements were asgreat as 200 per cent. (For a fuller description of thepsychometric evaluation, see Harman et al., 1966.) Long-term Results The practical value of obtained solutions is a check againstsubjective reports of accomplishment that might be attributableto temporary euphoria. The nature of these solutions varied; theyincluded: (1) a new approach to the design of a vibratorymicrotome, (2) a commercial building design, accepted by theclient, (3) space probe experiments devised to measure solarproperties, (4) design of a linear electron acceleratorbeam-steering device, (5) engineering improvement to a magnetictape recorder, (6) a chair design, modeled and accepted by themanufacturer, (7) a letterhead design, approved by the customer,(8) a mathematical theorem regarding NOR-gate circuits, (9)completion of a furniture-line design, (10) a new conceptualmodel of a photon, which was found useful, and (11) design of aprivate dwelling, approved by the client. Table 3 outlines the initial results ofattempting to apply the solutions generated in the experimentalsessions back into the industrial and academic settings of thesubjects. (These data were obtained by questionnaire andfollow-up interview six to eight weeks after the session.) Aquote for a follow-up report written several months after thesession is typical of the relative usefulness and validity of thesession-day solutions: "In the area of ionospheric sourcelocation and layer tilt analysis, I was able in the weeksfollowing the session to build on the ideas generated to theextent of working out the mathematics of the schemes proposed,and of making them more definite. The steps made in the sessionwere the correct ones to start with . . . the ideas consideredand developed in the session appear as important steps, and theperiod of the session as the single most productive period ofwork on this problem I have had in the several months eitherpreceding or following the session." Many subjects in the follow-up interview reported changes intheir modes of functioning that were continuous with theenhancement reported for the session itself (e.g., continuingvisualization ability). Table 4 lists the result of aquestionnaire dealing with changes in work effectiveness. The results given in Table 4 indicatethat approximately half the subjects reporting were stillnoticing some change in their performance level several monthsafter the experimental session. These results are particularlyinteresting in view of the relatively low dosage and the factthat no suggestion was made at any time that continuing changesof this nature were expected. The deliberate anticipation ofenhanced performance level, the incitement to a high degree ofmotivation, and use of a sheltered and non-criticalatmosphere---none of these were directly suggestive of long-termpersonality changes or permanent therapeutic benefit. Yet acertain amount of such change seems to have occurred. Oneimplication is clear: We are dealing with materials andexperimental situations that have long-term effects; it would befoolhardy and irresponsible to treat this kind of research as ifit were isolated from the fabric of the subjects' lives. Comments and Speculations We had originally intended to follow this pilot study with acontrolled experiment employing a double-blind design, in which afraction of the subjects receive an active placebo. This wouldhave addressed the question of whether suggestion alone couldaccount for the performance enhancement. Because of interruptionof the research program by government fiat, this extension wasnever carried out. The need for controlled hypothesis-testingresearch in this perplexing area of chemical facilitation ofmental functioning has become a common plea, and rightly so. Butequally needful of furthering is the exploratory sort of researchthat aims at invention of conceptual models and hypothesisconstruction. Because of the controversy surrounding use of thepsychedelic agents, this latter type of research is even morelikely to be slighted. In the research described, we employed naive subjects. Thereare clear methodological virtues accruing from the use ofuntrained subjects. However, when the central question is not oneof pharmacological effects, but rather the degree to whichcertain processes can be facilitated, the more experience thesubjects can gain the more we are likely to learn about theprocess. Thus we would urge the desirability of furtherinvestigations employing a series of sessions for each subject. A similar comment holds with regard to selection of subjects.Clinical studies already referred to indicate that those subjectswho are more stable and productive beforehand 4 tend to"benefit considerably from the psychedelic experience alongthe lines of self-actualization, richer creative experience, andenhancement of special abilities and aptitudes" (Savage etal., 1966). Subjects for this pilot study were deliberatelyselected to be persons with known reputations as creativeindividuals. In general, we would expect the outcomes of thiskind of research to be more fruitful with gifted rather than"merely normal" subjects. In contrast with reports of other researchers, we experiencedlittle difficulty in getting subjects to work on psychologicaltests. Many studies seem to indicate a temporary debilitatingeffect of psychedelics on higher cortical processes. It seems tous that variables that affect results on these kinds of testsinclude attitude and motivation as well as ability. We found thatdiscussing this problem with subjects in the preparatory meetingseliminated any tendency in the experimental session to shrug offthe tests as meaningless or to resist them as disconcerting. Inshort, on the tests, as well as in problem solving, byestablishing an anticipation of improved performance, we seemedto obtain results that support it. Assuming that these findings are eventually substantiated byadditional research, they find their most obvious application toproblem solving in industry, professional practice, and research.Here the procedure could play a role similar to that played byconsultants, brainstorming, synectics, and other attempts toaugment and "unstick" the problem solver's unsuccessfulefforts. A quote from one of our subjects illustrates thepossibilities: "I decided to drop my old line of thinking and give it anew try. The 'mystery' of this easy dismissal and forgetting didnot strike me until later in the afternoon, because I had manytimes before this session indulged in this line of thinking andmanaged to work up the whole thing into an airtight deadlock, andI had been unable to break, much less dismiss, this deadlock. Themiracle is that it came so easy and natural." A much more important application in the long run, we believe,is the use of the psychedelic agents as training facilitators togradually upgrade the performance level of already effectivepersonnel. This would require establishment of accepted trainingprocedures and certification provisions for those qualified touse them. This may seem to be a utopian projection from ourpresent state, but we live in an age of rapid change, and it isperhaps not out of the question within a decade. Among consequences of this line of exploration, the mostsignificant of all, in our estimation, is the gaining of newknowledge of the mysterious higher processes of the human mind,the framing of new and more productive research questions, andthe eventual effect on our image of man---of what he can be, andof what he is, of the vast potentialities he has seemingly onlybegun to tap. TABLE 1 SOME REPORTED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE (as found in the literature and in subjects' reports) Those supporting creativity 1. Increased access to unconscious data. 2. More fluent free association; increased ability to play spontaneously with hypotheses, metaphors, paradoxes, transformations, relationships, etc. 3. Heightened ability for visual imagery and fantasy. 4. Relaxation and openness. 5. Sensory inputs more acutely perceived. 6. Heightened empathy with external processes, objects, and people. 7. Aesthetic sensibility heightened. 8. Enhanced "sense of truth," ability to "see through" false solutions and phony data. 9. Lessened inhibition, reduced tendency to censor own by premature negative judgment. 10. Motivation heightened by suggestion and providing the right set. Those hindering creativity 1. Capacity for logical thought processes diminished. 2. Ability to consciously direct concentration reduced. 3. Inability to control imaginary and conceptual sequences. 4. Anxiety and agitation. 5. Outputs (verbal and visual communication abilities) constricted. 6. Tendency to focus upon "inner problems" of a personal nature. 7. Experienced beauty lessening tension to obtain aesthetic experience in the act of creation. 8. Tendency to become absorbed in hallucinations and illusions. 9. Finding the best solution seeming unimportant. 10."This-worldly" tasks seeming trivial, and, hence, motivation decreased.

A. J. Ayer (1946, p. 65) once claimed, ". . . we are unable,in our everyday language, to describe the properties of sense-contentswith any great precision, for lack of the requisite symbols...."Ayer's statement about normal, everyday perception has even greaterapplication when chemically altered perception is considered.The difficulties subjects have in describing their experiencesare compounded by the difficulties experimenters often have ininterpreting these reports in terms of some organizational structure. One of the more successful attempts to organize subjective reportsof psychedelic experience has been made by R. E. L. Masters andJean Houston (1966). Having guided and observed 206 subjects througha large number of LSD and peyote sessions, Masters and Houstonproposed the existence of four levels of mental functioning inthe psychedelic state: sensory, recollective-analytic, symbolic,and integral. At the first, or sensory, level, the subject may report a changedawareness of the body, unusual ways of experiencing space andtime, heightened sense impressions, synesthesia ("feelingsounds," "hearing color"), and---with the eyesclosed---vivid visual imagery. Experiences at the sensory leveltend to "decondition" a subject, to loosen his habitualconceptions, and to ease the rigidity of his past imprinting. At the second, or recollective-analytic, level, the subject'sreactions become more emotionally intense. He may relive periodsof his life. He may formulate insights into himself, his work,and his personal relationships. Only 40 per cent of Masters and Houston's subjects reached thethird, or symbolic, level. At this level, visual imagery generallyinvolves history and legend, or the subject may recapitulate theevolutionary process, developing from primordial protoplasm toman. He may also embark upon a "ritual of passage" andimagine himself participating in a baptismal ceremony or a pubertyrite. Eleven per cent of Masters and Houston's subjects reached thefourth, or integral, level, at which religious or mystical experiencesoccur. Masters and Houston have described the religious experienceas a confrontation with "the Ground of Being"; theycontrast it with mystical experience, which they see as a dissolution,as a merging of the individual with the energy field of the universe.One woman related, "All around and passing through me wasthe Light, a trillion atomized crystals shimmering in the blindingincandescence." The Evolution of Language Like psychedelic experience, human language processes may be studiedat four different levels. The development of social language beginsat the approximate age of nine months, with the acquisition ofa simple listening vocabulary (Lewis, 1959). By one year, mostchildren have spoken their first word. In the American culture,two other forms of language -reading and writing-are usually introducedwhen the child enters school, although some children acquire thesebefore formal education begins. Speaking and writing are expressive,and involve encoding one's experiences; listening and readingare receptive, and require decoding of another person's attemptsto communicate. Speaking and listening have developmental priorityover the visual activities of writing and reading. Language may be defined as a structured system of arbitrary vocalsounds and sound sequences, or a system of written or printedsymbols that represent vocal sounds. A language system is usedin social, interpersonal communication, and rather exhaustivelycatalogues the objects, events, and processes in the human environment. The origins of oral language go back over a million years. Primitiveman kept no written records and lost the words he uttered in timeand space. Writing started only a few thousand years ago, whenman developed hieroglyphics and ideographs to represent visibleobjects. Among the cultures bordering the Mediterranean, thesestandardized sets of pictures gave way to phonetic alphabets,in which the written symbol stands not for an object, but fora sound. The alphabet restructured not only man's method of communicating,but also his very conception of the time-space milieu. The alphabetarrested words in spatial rather than temporal segments, and literatehuman cultures began to conceive of the universe in terms of linearspace diagrams as well as temporal cycles. The day-night cycle,the life-death cycle, and other recurring events gave way in importanceto conceiving events as historical, linear, and exhibiting cause-effect relationships. For several centuries, the development of the alphabet affectedmost people indirectly in the cultures where it was used. Writtenlanguage was difficult to master; its utilization was often reservedfor scribes, philosophers, and priests. The invention of the printingpress and movable type made reading a common skill and, accordingto Marshall McLuhan (1964), further exploded the tribal worldand led to the fragmentation of society and to the specializationof mankind's functions. The priestly monopoly on knowledge andpower came to an end. The technical and cultural achievements resulting from movabletype show the tremendous impact of literacy. However, the linearstructuring of rational life forced the Western world to regardconsciousness as sequential, and brought about its habit of investingevents with cause-effect relations. As Western man became dissociatedfrom the tribe and from direct experience, visual sequencing becamethe key skill used in examining and storing the symbolic recordof his accomplishments. Just as the voice-and-ear stage of language once gave way to whatWalter Ong (1967) has referred to as the "chirographic-typographic"stage (dominated by the alphabet and the printing press), so thisstage is now giving way to an electronic stage. Television, telephone,radio, phonograph, film and recording tape have reinstated theimportance of sound in communication. These media also conveya sense of simultaneity in time and space. A new aural structureis being superimposed upon the old visual structure of the chirographic-typographicstage. As technology unites the scattered human cultures intoa new solidarity, the contemporary individual must have all culturespresent within him simultaneously in order to be realized as ahuman being. At the same time that the electronic stage is extending man'sexploration outside the body, it is creating a desire for explorationof the individual's inner world. One example is the widespreadinterest in psychedelic substances. Many Americans, having ingestedthese chemicals, echo McLuhan's and Ong's theories. They statethat their psychedelic episodes bring about "a sense of simultaneityin time and space," and "a sense of solidarity withall the people in the world." Others gather into drug or"hippie" subcultures, in which tribal rites are enacted,in which bright Indian clothes and primitive body markings areworn, and in which an intense sense of community often develops. A limited number of attempts have been made to investigate theeffects of psychedelic experience on either receptive language(listening and reading) or expressive language (speaking and writing).The four levels of psychedelic experience (sensory, recollective-analytic,symbolic, integral) provide an organizational structure in whichthis area may be explored and discussed. Receptive Language Trouton and Eysenck (1961) have pointed out that psychedelic experienceis influenced not only by factors related to drug administration,but by personality, physiology, set, and setting. In their account,they also mention "suggestion" and "reinforcementof responses by the experimenter," which suggests the importanceof language in determining how a subject reacts. The ritual developed by the Native American Church illustratesthe use of language to produce a positive set and setting forthe ingestion of peyote. A ceremonial leader, the head chief,initiates the singing of songs and co-ordinates requests by individualsfor special prayers. The ritual is so arranged and so coordinatedto the needs of the communicants that the maximum possible likelihoodof a positive spiritual experience is enhanced (Flattery and Pierce,1965). Language, however, may also be used to develop a negative setand setting. Jean Houston (1967) has described one of her initialobservations of LSD administration. The subject was told by thepsychiatrist that he would have "a terrible, terrible experience"filled with "strong anxiety and delusions." The drugwas administered in an antiseptic hospital room with several observersin white coats watching him. As the effects came on, the psychiatristasked such questions as, "Is your anxiety increasing?"At the end of the experiment, the subject was in a state of panic.The psychiatrist announced to the group that LSD is indeed a "psychotomimetic"substance, which induces psychotic behavior. Listening is the receptive process by which aural language assumesmeaning. As listening involves attending to a stimulus, the actoften includes a commitment to respond in some way to the messagesthat are received. The Native American Church communicants committhemselves to a positive experience while the unfortunate subjectsof poorly handled LSD experiments commit themselves to a negativeexperience. In both cases, language plays a key role in determiningwhich way the commitment will turn. A vivid description of a psychedelic session has been given byAlan Watts (1962). This description demonstrates how the qualityof what is listened to may change as the listener shifts fromthe sensory to the recollective-analytic, symbolic, and integrallevels. I am listening to the music of an organ.... The organ seems quiteliterally to speak. There is no use of the vox humana stop, butevery sound seems to issue from a vast human throat, moist withsaliva....(p. 33) This is the sensory level of the psychedelic experience. Perceptualchanges have transformed the organ music into a human voice. Senseimpressions other than aural take form as Watts speaks of "avast human throat, wet with saliva." I am listening to a priest chanting the Mass, and a choir of nunsresponding. His mature, cultivated voice rings with the sereneauthority of the One, Holy, Catholic, an-d Apostolic Church, ofthe Faith once and for all delivered to the saints, and the nunsrespond naively it seems, with childlike, utterly innocent devotion.But listening again, I can hear the priest "putting on"his voice, hear the inflated, pompous balloon, the studiedly unctuoustones of a master deceptionist who has the poor little nuns, kneelingin their stalls completely cowed. Listen deeper. The nuns arenot cowed at all. They are playing possum. With just a littlestiffening, the limp gesture of bowing nuns turns into the gestureof the closing claw. With too few men to go around, the nuns knowwhat is good for them: how to bend and survive. (p. 37) This is the recollective-analytic level, at which memories andinsights often occur. Watts is listening to a recording of theMass, but suddenly perceives a pompous quality to the priest'stones. Going deeper into the analysis of what he hears, Wattsdiscovers that the nuns' response displays more than obedience---itis their shrewd way of playing the game of survival. But this profoundly cynical view of things is only an intermediatestage.... In the priest's voice I hear down at the root the primordialhowl of the beast in the jungle, but it has been inflected, complicated,refined, and textured with centuries of culture.... At first,crude and unconcealed, the cry for food or mate, or just noisefor the fun of it, making the rocks echo. Then rhythm to enchant,then changes of tone to plead or threaten. Then words to specifythe need, to promise and bargain. And then, much later, the gambitsof indirection. The feminine stratagem of stooping to conquer,the claim to superior worth in renouncing the world for the spirit,the cunning of weakness proving stronger than the might of muscle-andthe meek inheriting the earth. (p. 38) This is the psychedelic experience's symbolic stage. The priest'svoice reflects the evolutionary process; the nuns' response echoesfemale archetypes. As I listen then, I can hear in that one voice the simultaneouspresence of all the levels of man's history, as of all the stagesof life before man. Every step in the game becomes as clear asthe rings in a severed tree.... I, as an adult, am also back therealone in the dark, just as the primordial howl is still presentbeneath the sublime modulations of the chant.... Down and at lastout---out of the cosmic maze . . ., I feel, with a peace so deepthat it sings to be shared with all the world, that at last Ibelong, that I have returned to the home beyond home.... The surefoundation upon which I had sought to stand has turned out tobe the center from which I seek. (p. 39) This is the integral stage of the psychedelic experience. Wattssees himself in the voice of the priest and in all the precursorsof that voice. His "home beyond home" and "surefoundation" is the very center of his being. Reading, the assigning of meaning to perceived printed symbols,also plays a key role in some psychedelic sessions. In one experiment(Jarvik et al., 1955), subjects ingested one hundred microgramsof LSD and demonstrated an increase in their ability to quicklycancel out words on a page of standardized material, but a decreasedability to cancel out individual letters. The drug seemed to facilitatethe perceptions of meaningful language units while it interferedwith the visual perception of non-meaningful ones. Corroborativeexperimental data are lacking, but a number of clinical casessuggest that if the meaning of printed symbols happens to dovetailwith the ongoing psychedelic experience, the symbols will be perceivedquickly. If their meaning does not happen to tie in with the experience,the words may not be perceived at all. One subject became fascinated by a newspaper headline and reportedlywas able to read the entire article at a distance of thirty feet(Newland, 1962). Another subject, who became interested in studyingfamous paintings after ingesting thirty milligrams of psilocybin,assertedly lost his reading ability entirely while under the influenceof the drug. (1) In college, I had studied central nervous system dysfunction andknew that psycholexia is a condition in which a person has difficultyattaching meaning to printed symbols. I experienced a similarcondition after the psilocybin began to take effect. I glanced at my watch but could make no sense out of the numericalsymbols. I looked at an art magazine The pictures were beautifulalmost three dimensional. However, the script was a jumble ofmeaningless shapes. The same subject, near the end of his "psilocybin high,"reported still another alteration in the reading process: Earlier, I had tasted an orange and found it the most intense,delightful taste sensation I had ever experienced. I tried readinga magazine as I was "coming down," and felt the samesensual delight in moving my eye over the printed page as I hadexperienced when eating the orange. The words stood out in three dimensions. Reading had never beensuch a sheer delight and such a complete joy. My comprehensionwas excellent. I quickly grasped the intent of the author andfelt that I knew exactly what meaning he had tried to convey. In the former instance, motivation for reading was low, sincethe subject was interested in studying art prints. In the latterepisode, the pleasure of eating an orange permeated the act ofreading a magazines which then became a delightful experience. The cases cited above both involved the sensory level of psychedelicexperience. Masters and Houston (1966) presented an intriguingexample of a subject who visualized a reading experience whileat the recollective-analytic level of his LSD session: I recalled detail that under ordinary conditions I could not possiblyhave remembered including the address on an envelope of a letterthat a friend had sent me some years before---an important letter,since it had great significance for me during my analysis. I sawthe envelope in front of me, in my mind's eye, recalled the handwritingand recited the street number and street. (A few days later Iwent to an attic where I had old letters put away, dug into adust-laden box, and took out crumpled and yellowing old papers.There7 among them, I found the envelope, just as I had recalledit, and the details of the address were correct, entirely correct.) P. G. Stafford and B. H. Golightly (1967, pp. 140-41) have citedthe account of a student who utilized the recollective-analyticlevel to practical advantages learning enough German in a weekto enroll for an advanced course in the subject: I hadn't even gotten around to picking up a textbook, but I didhave a close friend who knew German well and who said he was willingto "sit in" while I took the drug and try to teach methe language. ... The thing that impressed me at first was the delicacy of the language.. . . Before long, I was catching on even to the umlauts. Thingswere speeding up like mad, and there were floods of associations.. . . Memory, of course, is a matter of association and boy wasI ever linking up to things! I had no difficulty recalling wordshe had given me-in fact, I was eager to string them together.In a couple of hours after that, I was even reading some simpleGerman, and it all made sense. By the time the student finished the LSD session, he had "fallenin love with German." He secured the original German textand an English translation of Mann's Doctor Faustus. Bythe time he had finished the novel, he found that he was scarcelyreferring to the English version. He also discovered that in havingread Doctor Faustus, he had developed a feeling for grammarstructure and word endings that was "almost intuitive." When he registered for the second-year college course in Germanthe following week, the instructor expressed skepticism when heheard that the student was self-taught. Upon testing him, however,it was evident that the student's German reading comprehensionwas more than adequate, and he was allowed to enroll for the course. Also at the recollective-analytic level fall the examples of renewedspiritual inspiration from reading of sacred literature. Biblicalpassages or religious terms formerly meaningless sometimes acquirevivid meanings for many readers. Like the individual who throughconversion experience suddenly finds himself in possession ofthe meaning of the term "salvation," so the LSD subjectmay find similar terms illuminated for him (Leary and Clark, 1963) . An example may be cited of an individual who found significantmeaning in a biblical passage during a session with morning-gloryseeds: Upon opening my eyes, I found that I was facing the bookcase.The first book that I perceived was the Holy Bible. I seized itand flung it open. Strangely, the smooth, burnished pages feltlike human skin. I fondled, kissed, and caressed the pages. Forthe first time in several hours, I had found some degree of tranquillity I looked at the page I had selected and found that my finger wasdirectly above Ezekiel 11:24. The words of this verse, as wellas the one directly following it, described my liberation fromthe more terrifying aspects of the psychedelic experience as wellas the importance of communicating my experience to others. Theyread, "Then the vision that I had seen went up from me. AndI told the exiles all the things that the Lord had showed me." As I read on, I found a new interpretation for the twelfth chapterof Ezekiel. The prophet spoke of a "rebellious house"and of people---perhaps in need of psychedelic substances---whohave "ears to hear and hear not." The injunction ofEzekiel 12:13 is to "eat your bread with quaking, and drinkwater with trembling," an appropriate description of theconsumption of psychedelics. Ezekiel 12:23-24 states that "thedays are at hand and the fulfillment of every vision." EverythingI read under the spell of the morning-glory seeds became directedtoward the psychedelic experience. Once again, in this instance, there was an integration of theact of reading into the ongoing psychedelic experience. As a result,a number of "connections" were discovered that wouldhave eluded the subject had he not ingested morning-glory seeds.This phenomenon is surprisingly common among frequent LSD users;their belief in the direct interrelations among most of the eventsof their lives may well influence their behavior and their viewof the universe. The reading process is rarely associated with the third or fourthlevels of psychedelic experience, but some individuals have beencatapulted into a deeply moving symbolic or integral episode followinga chance glimpse of a line of Hebrew script or of an Egyptianhieroglyphic. In other cases, a line of print has occurred atthe end of a segment of the experience and has seemed to summarizeit. One subject reported such an episode at the symbolic levelduring a mescaline session: I was propelled back into time, back into the primeval jungle.I saw two savages stalking each other in the underbrush. Eachsavage carried a bow and arrow. Each was prepared to kill theother upon sight. Blood was on their minds- murder was in theirhearts. Suddenly, each saw the other. Each gasped in surprise. Each droppedhis bow. The two bows fell together on the ground, forming a mandala.The arrows fell upon the mandala, dividing it into four sections. The savages fell upon each other---but in an embrace rather thanin an assault. As they strolled into the jungle to enjoy theirnewly discovered companionship, the mandala turned into a whitebutton. Upon the button, in red and blue, appeared the words,"Make love, not war." During one of my own psilocybin experiences I had an unusual visualization.I pictured a whirlwind carrying away all the words, letters, numbers,and verbal symbols that had acculturated and conditioned me throughoutthe years. One might say that my session was a form of non- verbaltraining, a dramatic confrontation with naked events that remindedme not only of the awareness encountered among preliterate tribes,but also of Alfred Korzybski's writings in the field of generalsemantics ( 1933 ) . Korzybski considered man's consciousness of the abstraction processto be the most effective safeguard against semantic problems (suchas confusing words with objects) and the key to further humanevolution. Consciousness of abstraction was defined by Korzybskias an "awareness that in our process of abstracting we haveleft out characteristics." An individual apprehendshimself and his world fully and accurately to the degree thathe continually translates higher-order abstractions back to thelevel of concrete experience. An individual is "sane"to the extent that he becomes experientially aware of the discrepancybetween conceptualization and sense impressions. Developmentally,man (both as a species and as an individual) progresses from thepreliterate stage (in which he is enmeshed in concrete experience)to the early literate stage (in which he confuses words with thingsand becomes split off from non-verbal reality) to a fully developedliterate stage (in which he uses the printed word but does notconfuse it with the object for which it stands). Robert Mogar (1965c) has stated that, at its best, the psychedelicstate can permit the individual to evaluate with some detachmentboth the structure of his semantic framework (i.e., its similarityto reality) and his semantic reactions. These two kinds of learningwere strongly recommended by Korzybski as the most effective meansof increasing one's consciousness of the abstracting process. Richard Marsh (1965) has described how, under LSD, "we seemto come up against that part of our inner world where meaningsare made, where the patterning process operates in its pure form."He has further noted that, semantically, the condition of beingabsolutely present to the outer and the inner reality has at leasttwo advantages. First, it allows a person to tune in on that feedback,both external and internal, that enables him to correct his ownerrors in encoding. He is able to reduce the noise level in thevarious communication systems in which he is involved by re-encodinghis message streams until they convey the meanings that he intendsthem to convey. Secondly, it allows a person to inhabit the worldof the actual, the world of fact, instead of the unreal and emptyworld of the prefabricated abstraction. It allows him to experiencethe world instead of merely to think about it, and perhaps tobegin to live in it at last. Marsh's claim that a new level of reality is opened up by thepsychedelics is a controversial one. It is a further step in theperpetual dialogue concerning language and reality. As long asmen have reflected about their world, this basic issue has dividedthem. Some men have regarded man's language as a straightforwardreflection of reality. Others have looked upon language as a reducingvalve imposed by the limitations of man's consciousness upon theunlimited varieties of his internal and external world (Krippner,1965). Aldous Huxley (1959, p. 22) has described the role thatverbal and written symbols play in helping mankind to utilizethis limited consciousness: To formulate and express the contents of this reduced awarenessman has invented and endlessly elaborated those symbol-systemsand implicit philosophies which we call languages. Every individualis at once the beneficiary and the victim of the linguistic traditioninto which he or she has been born---the beneficiary inasmuchas language gives access to the accumulated records of other people'sexperience, the victim insofar as it confirms him in the beliefthat reduced awareness is the only awareness and as it bedevilshis sense of reality so that he is all too apt to take his conceptsfor data, his words for actual things. The psychedelic session as non-verbal training represents a methodby which an individual can attain a higher level of linguisticmaturity and sophistication. On the other hand, some psychedelicepisodes have been reported in which an apparent regression tookplace, in which language was concretized-the letters becomingtransformed into images and objects. One subject, while smokingmarijuana, looked at a magazine cover and reported a concretizationexperience: The magazine featured a picture story about Mexico, and the coverfeatured large letters spelling out the name of that country.As I looked at the letters, they turned into Aztec men and women.They retained their shape as letters, but subtle shades and shadowsbecame eyes, heads, arms, and legs. That part wasn't so bad, butwhen Atzecs began to move across the page, I quickly turned themagazine over! The concretization of letters has been put to artistic use byillustrators throughout the centuries (Mahlow, 1963). For example,Ferdinand Kriwet designed a mandala composed of nothing but severalhundred capital letters. Joshua Reichert produced another mandalathat consisted of several types of script. A number of contemporaryposter artists have publicized "acid rock" musical performancesby producing advertisements that fuse the letters with the pictures,making the names of such groups as "The Grateful Dead"and "The Byrds" an integral part of the over-all design,thus combining the "medium" and the "message."The "psychedelic poster" has, within a few years, becomean original art form (Masters and Houston, 1968). The variety of effects that psychedelics have upon receptive languagefunctioning have at least one factor in common: they point upthe role that language as a "connecting system" playsin verbal memory (Hastings, 1967). Electric brain stimulationand hypnosis have been able to retrieve long-forgotten memories;psychedelic drugs often produce similar effects, especially atthose periods of time when subjects are at the recollective-analyticlevel. Physical shock and psychic trauma often lead to the forgettingof verbal material or a regression in verbal functioning. In thesecases, the "connecting system" breaks down, just asit does in certain episodes with psychedelics. Henri Michaux (1967)has stated, "After an average dose of hashish, one is unfitfor reading." Other artists and writers, however, say thatthey appreciate receptive language (e.g., listening to poetry,reading novels ) even more when they are "high." A greatdeal of research is needed to explore the variables that determinewhat effects psychedelics have upon language as it connects one'spast memory with his present experience. Expressive Language A number of investigators have reported a reduction or even anabsence of speech among LSD subjects. Some writers have suggestedthat these drugs suppress activity in the cortical levels of thebrain, where the speech centers are located. J. H. Von Felsingerand his associates (1956), for example, noted that there was "aslowing down of speech and expression" with their LSD subjects,none of whom were psychiatric patients. On the other hand, MorgensHertz, a Danish physician, described a patient whose long-standingstuttering condition disappeared following LSD treatment (Stafford& Golightly, 1967, p. 113). An American team of researchersfound that schizophrenic children became more communicative followingLSD treatment ( Bender, Goldschmidt, and Siva Sankar, 1956). Aswith the other types of language, the alteration of expressivelanguage under LSD can take a variety of forms, depending on howit happens to mesh with other aspects of the psychedelic experience. One research team (Lennard, Jarvik, and Abramson, 1956) studiedthe effects of LSD on group communication, using both an experimentalgroup of subjects and a control group. The subjects in the controlgroup increased their verbal output during the observation period,while among those who had taken LSD there was a reduction in wordoutput. In addition, the subjects who took LSD asked more questionsand made more statements pertaining to orientation (e.g., "What'shappening?" "Where am I?") than those in the controlgroup. These findings are consistent with the typical reactionsof subjects at the sensory level when traditional timespace orientationis lost. Another reason for reduced verbalization during psychedelic sessionsmay be the presence of visual imagery. When an individual becomesinvolved in "the retinal circus," he often loses interestin speaking. Finally, relaxation and lethargy often mark a subject'sfirst experiences with the psychedelics. In these instances, thespeech muscles would be inoperative, and verbalization would bereduced still further. E. S. Tauber and M. R. Green (1959) have discussed the difficultyin talking about visual imagery and trying to communicate it tosomeone else. Not only is there difficulty in translating one'sown private world into meaningful public symbols, but there isalso a kaleidoscopic piling up of many different images and meanings.Speech is the vocal expression of one's experiences and feelingsin verbal symbols; wherever communication involves much more thanlanguage can adequately express, there is a high probability ofserious gaps, misunderstandings, and improper inferences. Tauberand Green have stated, ". . . the communication of dreammaterial perhaps most strikingly illustrates the weakness of thetool of language." Much the same could be said of psychedelicexperience at the sensory level; this may be another reason whyspeech often is reduced during a subject's initial LSD experiences. The description of visual imagery is not the only communicationproblem that faces the LSD initiate. At the sensory level, thereis often an increased awareness of bodily feelings. Preliteratetribes paid great attention to these feelings, but the Americanculture generally ignores them, unless they are unpleasant. Thosewords that most quickly come to mind during periods of acute bodilyawareness are "sick to my stomach," "pains in myback," and "nagging headache." Once these wordsbecome linked to what may be quite natural (and potentially pleasurable) sensations, an individual may very well get sick, regurgitate,and interpret the rest of his psychedelic session as unpleasant. It is in this regard that the work of Russell Mason on internalperception ( 1961) assumes importance. Although Mason's experimentsdid not involve psychedelic drugs, they could serve as modelsfor what can eventually be done with such substances. He askedsubjects to specify where various kinds of feelings were located.Love and friendliness, for example, were associated with the centralchest area, sexual feelings with the genital-pubic area. He concluded,". . . the ability of the individual to permit immediateawareness of . . . non-cognitive internal perceptions appearsto be necessary for healthy psychological adjustment." Hisdata offer a possible physiological explanation for the body changesthat take place when drug subjects report feelings of "oceaniclove" or "strong sexual responses." They also suggestthat persons who are unable to allow this immediate awarenessto take place may be poor risks for LSD sessions. Masters and Houston (1966) have reported statements from a numberof subjects who purportedly "felt" the interior of thebody during psychedelic experiments. One subject told about sensinghis "interior landscape," describing the "trees,vines, streams, waterfalls, hills, and valleys" of the body.Another described the sensation of blood flowing through his veinsas well as the receiving and transmitting operations of the nervoussystem. All these reports characterize the first, or sensory,level of psychedelic experience. The verbal reports associated with the recollective-analytic andsymbolic levels are somewhat different. For example, one subjectat the recollective-analytic level reported the insight to Mastersand Houston, "I have never been in love with my own body.In fact, I believe that a major emotional problem in my life isthat I have always disliked it." At the symbolic level, anumber of subjects experience bodily sensations in terms of amythic drama. One anthropologist reported going through a Haitiantransformation rite in which his body began to take on aspectsof a tiger ( Masters and Houston, 966, pp.76-78). At the integral level, bodily sensations are also reported. Oneof Masters and Houston's subjects had a mystical experience inwhich he was ". . . overwhelmed by a bombardment of physicalsensations, by tangible sound waves both felt and seen,"after which he "dissolved." He later stated, "NowI understand what is meant by being a part of everything, whatis meant by sensing the body as dissolving." A great deal of research is needed to correlate the data on bodilysensations with the data on LSD. One important hypothetical formulationthat would be helpful in effecting this correlation was presentedby Gardner Murphy and Sidney Cohen in 1965. Murphy and Cohen suggestedthat psychedelic drugs lower the threshold for internal sensations,especially those from the digestive system, the sex organs, andthe striped muscles. As a result, body feelings emerge into self-consciousness,and an individual may interpret the experience as one of "cosmiclove." Murphy and Cohen also hypothesized that there wasa direct relationship between certain physiological sensationsand such verbal reports as "entrance into the void." In considering the effects of psychedelic substances upon speech,attention could be paid not only to the physiological determinantsbut to the psychological concomitants of the experience. One ofthe most typical phenomena is the statement by the subject thathis experience has been ineffable, that it cannot be communicatedadequately to others. Some subjects assert that no words existto describe internal events such as those they have felt, andthat even if there were such words they would be devoid of significanceunless the listener himself had gone through the same experiences.Richard Blum (1964) reported one man's reaction: Really, when I first took LSD, I didn't know how to describe whathad happened. It was intense and important, very much so, butthere were no words for it. But after talking with others whohad taken it I could see that they were talking about the samething. They did have words for it---"transcendental"was one---and so I started using those words myself. An interestingthing happened to my wife. After I gave her LSD she said verylittle about it. For a whole month she hardly said a word abouther experience. But then I introduced her to some others who weretaking the drug, and it wasn't more than a few days before shestarted talking a blue streak; you see, she'd learned how to talkabout it from them. This explanation describes how one learns a language that signifiesto other users that one understands and has been through a psychedelicexperience. According to Blum, the language is shaped by the cultureof the speakers-in this case by the particular subgroup with whichthe LSD user is socially affiliated and under whose auspices hehas taken the drug. This language is as much a sign of "togetherness"and "belongingness" as it is a device for communicatingthe content of an experience. It is not unusual that a numberof people in drug subcultures become frustrated when talking withnon-users; to the individual who has never undergone psychedelicexperience, the user's words are not understood as affirmationsthat one is a particular kind of person or a fellow member ofan important in-group. Blum has maintained that learning the LSD language and vocalizingthe philosophy of the psychedelic subculture are steps in thecommitment of an individual to an identifiable group. Language,in this instance, becomes a device to provide structure and tocreate a community of experience among persons who have had LSD.Furthermore, whatever one expects from the psychedelics on thebasis of prior information and personal predispositions stronglyinfluences the choice of words later used to describe the experienceitself. The experience of being taught linguistic terminology by membersof the drug subculture is more than instruction in communication.It is instruction in approved words and approved experiences;it is instruction in a point of view. The terms that are learnedcan be used to structure the pharmacological response to a drug,giving the experience sense and meaning that it may not otherwisehave had. After his first trip, a novice might be told, "Ohyes, from what you say I can tell you really did have a transcendentalexperience." Such comments are not only instructive, helpingthe person define and describe his response, but they are alsoapproving and rewarding. As experiments on conditioned behaviorhave demonstrated, rewarded behavior is generally repeated. Inthe case of illegal LSD use, the rewards---often linguistic innature---are frequently great enough to overshadow such potentialhazards as psychosis, suicide, and chromosomal damage. Regarding legal experimental use of the psychedelics, it has oftenbeen observed that the language used by the guide will influencewhat the subject says later to describe his session. This observationis borne out by some of the early research studies. It was initiallybelieved that LSD produced psychotic reactions, and the drug wastermed "psychotomimetic" by psychiatrists and psychologists(Rinkel, 1956). LSD subjects were sometimes told by the physicianadministering the drug, "You probably will go out of yourmind for several hours"; many subjects later reported terrifyingexperiences. One early experimenter took verbatim recordings ofan interview with an LSD subject and of an interview with a schizophrenicsubject, and outside judges could not distinguish which of thetwo was suffering from schizophrenia. (Hoffer, 1956). As research workers became more knowledgeable, the psychotomimeticlabel was discarded by many investigators. Pollard, Uhr, and Stern(1965) noted that psychotic disorders are characterized "bypersonality disintegration and failure to test and evaluate correctlyexternal reality in various spheres." Following the conclusionof their work with LSD, they stated, "In none of the normalexperimental subjects to whom we have given these drugs, nor inour own experience, could these criteria be satisfied." The problem of scientific scrutiny of verbal reports made duringpsychedelic sessions persists. One promising tool for linguisticanalysis is the measure devised by Bernard Aaronson (1955) forthe examination of verbal behavior in psychotherapy. Using standardizedmeasures of word complexity, Aaronson found that, as psychologicalstress is alleviated, word complexity increases. Another researchtool is that used at the Maimonides Dream Laboratory to dividespoken dream reports into units of meaning (Malamud et al., 1967).As the typical subject in experimental dream studies has littleconcern for grammatical formalism when he makes his verbal report,this method determines units of meaning to be analyzed with regardto dream content. Using the Cloze procedure to study grammatical predictability,Cheek and Amarel (1968) administered LSD to ten alcoholics, andanalyzed their speech patterns. It was found that grammaticalpredictability tended to rise as the alcoholics continued to speak,both in the drug and non-drug conditions. A group of ten schizophrenicswas also studied in the non-drug condition; their grammaticalpredictability tended to drop. In another study (Katz, Waskow, and Olsson, 1968), a group ofsixty-nine convicts were administered LSD, amphetamine, and placebos.The subjects receiving LSD were found to be significantly differentfrom the other subjects regarding a number of effects, includinglanguage. LSD subjects in general were described as "giggly";the more-dysphoric subjects spoke little and slowly, the ambivalentsubjects spoke a great deal and rapidly, while the euphoric subjectsfell in the middle regarding speech behavior. Charles Dahlberg, Stanley Feldstein, and Joseph Jaffee (1968)are in the process of making a detailed analysis of the verbalreports of psychoneurotic patients during twenty-two therapy sessions.Before each session, the patient ingested between fifty and onehundred micrograms of LSD. The therapy sessions were spaced overa period of eighteen months. The patients' verbal reports were transferred to IBM punch cardsand are being submitted to several techniques of linguistic analysis.One such technique, the Role Construct Sorting Procedure, is atest to measure changes in the way patients conceptualize peoplewho are important in their lives. Moreover, these measurementsof change are themselves being analyzed for indications of increasedand expanded associations on the part of the patients. In addition, the Cloze procedure, an index of redundancy, is beingused as a measurement of the predictability of interpersonal languagein the patient-therapist interchange. The Type-Token Ratio isa measure of vocabulary diversity and, indirectly, an indicatorof the informational structure of speech. Finally, nurses whoattended the patients after each session have rated the patientsas to speech patterns, periods of silence, periods of withdrawal,mood swings, etc. Preliminary results indicate that LSD facilitates treatment ofearly experiences in patients by producing partial regression.In addition, LSD appears to increase the patients' ability toevaluate their problems clearly and to communicate their insightsto the psychotherapist with facility. Written language attempts to convey meaning through printed symbols.Although S. Weir Mitchell (1896), one of the first to write adescription of a psychedelic experience, stated that his peyoteexperience was ". . . hopeless to describe in language,"he later managed to describe ". . . stars, delicate floatingfilms of color, then an abrupt rush of countless points of whitelight [that] swept across the field of view, as if the unseenmillions of the Milky Way were to flow in a sparkling river beforemy eyes." His account was sufficiently vivid for Troutonand Eysenck (1961) to be able to suggest that he substituted primitivethinking in the form of visual images for conceptual thought. While at the sensory level, during his first LSD experience, asubject attempted to write an account of his subjective reactions,but became fascinated with the very act of writing itself: Amazing! Amazing! The fluidity of the panorama of the room! Itseems like eons of time pass between each letter when I writeit. As I write, I see the loops, the dots, etc., spiral off thepage in colors. Off to infinity! At the recollective-analytic level, imagery persists but conceptualizationis often possible as well. For example, Thomas Ling and John Buckman(1963) have reported the case of a European writer who overcame"writer's block" through LSD therapy. Prior to takingLSD, he had been unable to finish a manuscript. After LSD therapy,he went on to become one of the leading authors in Germany. Hismajor work completed during the time he was in therapy, was translatedinto twelve languages and had a wide audience in the Western world.The writer concluded: I am no longer afraid of putting one letter after the other tosay what I want.... I seem capable of expressing what many peoplewould love to express but for which they cannot find the words.I did not find the words before, because I tried to avoid sayingthe essential things. Material that emerges at the recollective-analytic level doesnot always lead to the well- being of the subject, especiallyif the drugs are taken in unsupervised sessions and with an absenceof preparation. Following an LSD session, a college student wrotethe following account of his experience at the recollective-analyticlevel: Apparently some sort of love-making was going on in the otherroom because the guide would not let me enter it. As it turnedout, this was the wrong thing to do, because it started me onthe road to paranoia, panic, and "the depths." His refusalto let me enter the room aroused my suspicions of an ulteriormotive. I picked one which I have a curious fear of: homosexuality.I was unwilling to submit to what became suggestive words, lewdactions, and a depraved smile. I shudder when I recall it. Myfear was not of the act but that if I submitted I would become"one of them"-"them" being an indefinite butevil sort of being with a depraved smile-and never able to "return."It reminds me of the movie "The Pod People," where "people"are grown in pods and substituted for real people. You don't knowif your best friend is one of these "people" dedicatedto your destruction or conversion until it is too late. Because of the pathological elements in this written description,the student was advised by several people to do no more drug experimentation.However, about a year later, the student accepted a friend's invitationto smoke marijuana. The session began with a number of pleasantbodily feelings and unusual perceptual impressions. Suddenly,the student became obsessed with the notion that his friend desiredto have sexual relations with him. The student's friend calledthe police, and the student was rushed to a hospital, having entereda serious psychotic episode. (2)In this tragic instance, the student's written account could haveserved as a predictor of what would likely happen during futuresessions. An individual attempting to write descriptions of psychedelicexperience at the symbolic level has the difficult job of choosingverbal terms that convey some sense of his mythic encounters.This formidable task was well handled by an attorney in the followingway (Masters and Houston, 1966, pp. 221-22 ): I saw Jesus crucified and Peter martyred. I watched the earlyChristians die in the arena while others moved hurriedly throughthe Roman back streets, spreading Christ's doctrine. I stood bywhen Constantine gaped at the vision of the cross in the sky.I saw Rome fall and the Dark Ages begin, and observed as littlecrossed twigs were tacked up as the only hope in ten thousandwretched hovels. I watched peasants trample it under their feetin some obscene forest rite, while, across the sea in Byzantium,they glorified it in jeweled mosaics and great domed cathedrals. The attorney's written description is imaginative, yet fairlyconcrete, just as the mythical world is concrete. The linguisticconsciousness of primitive man is non-abstract; its concretenessis marked by a concrescence of name and thing (as exemplifiedby the various types of name taboos). Ernst Cassirer (1955) hasnoted that in some primitive religions the worshiper did not dareto utter the name of his gods; in others, certain words were usedfor the purpose of hex and voodoo. This concrescence of name andthing is demonstrated by a subject's report of a peyote session: The guide asked me how I felt, and I responded "Good."As I uttered the word "Good," I could see it form visuallyin the air. It was pink and fluffy, like a cloud. The word looked"good" in its appearance and so it had to be "Good."The word and the thing I was trying to express were one, and "Good"was floating around in the air. Name and thing are often wedded at the recollective-analytic andthe symbolic levels. A subject will say the word "Mother"and feel that the word itself contains aspects of his own mother---orof his memories of her. A theology student will say "Logos"and imagine that God and Christ are both present within the word.Only after the drug's effects begin to wear off can these individualstear the words apart from the experience. As with other language processes, psychedelic substances can affectthe act of writing by bringing about a regressive-type phenomenon(in which words and experience are united, as they often are withthe child and with the primitive tribesman) or else improve theprocess (by removing "writer's block," facilitatingverbal expression, etc.) . In some cases both occur, as when awriter engages in concrescence of word and thing at the symbolicor integral level and later presents a vivid written descriptionof that experience. To assist the encoding of psychedelic experience, an "experimentaltypewriter" has been invented by Ogden Lindsley and WilliamGetzinger (Leary, 1966a). The typewriter has twenty pens, anyof which can be depressed by the subject to describe his ongoingexperience. The subject must be trained in the use of the deviceand must learn the code that assists him to describe his psychedelicsensations and reactions. For example, the first key is depressedwhenever bodily sensations are experienced; the third key is depressedwhen feelings about other people are experienced. Although furtherrefinement of this device is needed, the research possibilitiesseem extensive. A subject could tap out a second-by-second sequenceof his experiences, and communicate them at least in general terms.Experience patterns could be correlated with neurological recordings.A guide could keep a close watch on the subject's reactions shouldit be felt advisable to modify the experience. In one first-person report (Roseman, 1966), a subject claimedthat he learned how to become a skilled typist by means of psychedelicexperience. Instead of emphasizing the more ideational aspectsof the writing process, the subject concentrated on sheer motoractivity. First, he familiarized himself with the keyboard andlearned the proper fingering techniques. To reinforce the matchingof fingers and typewriter keys, he took LSD, began to type, andcontinued for several hours. This subject's claims regarding a facilitation in motor functionare provocative and need to be explored under controlled conditions.Peter Laurie (1967) has suggested that the act of writing maybe feasible under light doses of psychedelic substances but, formost people, impossible under heavy doses. In the case of writing,therefore, one is struck by the same variety of reports as oneencounters with other forms of language; certain people undercertain conditions claim that their writing functions are enhanced,others assert writing is impaired, and still others report nodiscernible difference. Conclusion The emergence of professional and public interest in psychedelicsubstances coincides with the shift in human communication fromthe chirographic-typographic to the electronic stage. Just aselectronic devices have begun to "re-tribalize" theworld and convey a sense of simultaneity to human experience,so the LSD user often engages in mythic episodes, senses a "unityof all peoples," and has an impression that everything ishappening "all at once"-in a nonlinear manner. Psychedelic substances, when they affect language processes, sometimesappear to assist an individual to observe the difference betweenthe word and the object it represents. In this way, the drugsmay serve as catalysts in a non-verbal training program, helpingthe subject translate verbal abstractions in terms of direct experience. Psychedelic substances can produce the opposite result as well.The subject may revert to primitive thinking, his ability to conceptualizemay decrease, and he may effect a union between the word and itsobject. This is exemplified by the concretization of letters intopictures and images, by the concrescence of verbalizations withthe items they represent, and by the use of words in magical wayson the part of several LSD subjects. In other words, any of the human race's communicative stages-voice-and-ear,chirographic-typographic, electronic- may be observed by the researcherduring a round of psychedelic sessions. Therefore, psychedelicdrugs offer an unparalleled opportunity for the investigationof human language processes. The few experimental and clinicalreports that exist in the fields of listening, reading, speaking,and writing differ so greatly as to inspire curiosity as to thereasons that the same drugs can produce varied effects at differentdosage levels, with different individuals, and under differentconditions. An extremely important variable seems to be whetheror not language, either receptive or expressive, becomes integratedwith the ongoing psychedelic experience. If the integration occurs,an improvement in function will often occur. If the connectionis not made, language functioning may deteriorate or become blockedaltogether. At the sensory level, words are encoded and decoded in highlyunusual ways. At the recollective-analytic level, language oftenserves as a "connecting system" in memory and interpretation.At the symbolic level, words often become part of a mythic orhistorical ritual. At the integral level, language rarely is apart of the immediate experience; however, many writers and poetshave effectively transformed their religious or mystical episodesinto words. A permanent state of altered consciousness is neither practicalnor desirable. However, the individual may return to the worldof imprinting, conditioning, acculturation, and verbalizationwith new insights if his psychedelic session has been properlyguided. The research possibilities in the field of language andthe psychedelics are immense. The data obtained by imaginativeand responsible investigators may well point the way to an enhancementof creative functioning and a better understanding of the humanpotential. (1) Except in those cases where a referenceis cited, all first-person reports are from the files of the author.(back) (2) When I interviewed the student, I discovered that no antidotehad been given him once he entered the hospital. Instead, he wasqueried by policemen, who insisted on knowing the names of campusmarijuana and LSD users. This type of treatment, in which thewell-being of the patient is relegated to a secondary status bylaw enforcement personnel, has become very common as the generalpublic's fear of psychedelics has increased.

Rather,external phenomena are filtered through a preexisting structure.This structure itself is shaped by experience and conditioningand expectations which are themselves, to varying degrees, learned.This filter—or "reticular system," as it is more preciselycalled—discriminates. It accepts and rejects information, siftingthrough the daily barrage of sensory input like a kind of organicpre-programmed computer. The philosopher, J. Bronowski, has writtenabout what he calls the "interlocked picture of the world"which the brain constructs. This picture is not the waythe world looks but rather our way of looking at it. All perceptions,after having been picked up by the senses, are graded (interviewed,if you like) and screened by the reticular system before beingforwarded to the mind. Accordingly, we automatically distinguish between what our experiencehas told us is relevant and what is irrelevant—or nonfunctional.This filter is itself shaped by the environment in which the individualfinds himself. The signals and messages he chooses to pick upare those he has been trained to categorize as being of some importanceto his survival. Others will be deflected. Accordingly, it isnot the "eye" of the artist which permits him to detectnuances where the non-artist will see nothing—it is simply thatthe artist will not automatically screen out information which,to the other, is of no value or importance. It is likely that LSD attacks this filter, rendering it more porous,opening up tunnels which would otherwise remain sealed. The effectsof LSD are therefore of deep significance. One's reticular systemis finally the product of one's whole cultural milieu. No culturecould ever remain "intact" if the mental filters ofits members were not synchronized with the larger, more generalizedcultural filter. When LSD disrupts the functioning of the filter,it removes the individual from this over-all cultural context.It drives him not "out of his mind," but out of thefilter surrounding his mind. On the basis of its morality, priorities, prejudices, goals, ideals,and fears, any given society will roughly impress a similar setof mental reflexes on its members. Thus, people who grow up ina given society tend strongly to agree upon certain concepts basicto the structure of the society. Depending upon the technologyand philosophy of the society, its degree of sophistication, theirviews will be approximately representative. And to the extentthat the society is incapable of achieving some kind to overview—oftranscending its own nature, its own habits, its own assumptions—sotoo will the perceptions of the individual be limited and inhibited.The cultural point of view, which is converted into a perceptualmethod, is internalized, and each individual becomes a walkingmicro-culture. Any device or system which tends to break downthe structure of the individual micro-culture assaults, in themost direct and specific way possible, the very foundations ofthe overculture, the partial and culturally-limited point of view-whichmembers of a given society share, if they are to have any commonimpulse or behavior pattern at all. Or, more to the point, ifthey are to be controlled, managed, organized, or led. A Czech doctor once said that LSD inhibits conditioned reflexes.To the extent that it does that, it removes the individual fromthe context of his culture. It takes him-however temporarily awayfrom the familiar board, renders the normal rules of the gameuseless, and opens him up to a radically-altered perception. To a lesser degree, regardless of the differences in the chemicalprocess whereby the effect is achieved, this is also the secretof marijuana, hashish, peyote and so on: not really that they"expand" the mind, but that they widen the doors ofperception, as Aldous Huxley said, sometimes just slightly, althoughat other times not only is the door (the preconditioned mentalfilter) knocked right down, but a whole wall may be demolished,and sensory data previously blocked out comes pouring in. Onestands exposed, literally, to the elements, suddenly naked. Few cultures have ever had as much of a vested interest in compartmentalizedperception as technological society. Specialization insists uponinforming individuals deeply but narrowly. And the organizationof specialists from different fields has become the key to technologicalsuccess. The "partial and culturally limited point of view"which has grown up in the West takes its shape mainly from theincubators of Aristotelian logic, Christian dualism and the conceptof length. These great formative roots have in common an insistenceupon division and fragmentation. Aristotelianism gave us a subject-predicatelanguage, "with its tendency to treat objects as in isolationand to have no place for relations." Christianity, of course,insists upon the theology of God and the Devil, absolute Goodand absolute Evil, Heaven and Hell, the Spirit and the Flesh.We have already noted the effects of the concept of length. Together,they provide the conceptual blueprint for the Western psyche—ablueprint the outline of which has been blurred by electronicmedia, physics and the tremendous insights offered by Gestalttherapy and general semantics, but which remains neverthelessthe operative design. It is worth noting, as several writers have pointed out, thatwhat is existentially astonishing about the LSD experience isthe "discovery" that, mentally, most of us have beenoperating within the confines of a quite narrow and sharply restrictedlevel of consciousness. The dualistic image of the world, whichis our culturally limited way of viewing things, is "real"only along the avenues of this one wavelength of consciousness.It is the Oneness of the universe which becomes apparent oncethe dualistic image to which the reticular system is harnessedhas been dissolved or broken down. Again, this discovery can bemade through less potent (and dangerous) drugs. It can alsobe made without recourse to drugs at all. For the consciousnesswhich the drug experience offers is not unique; it is not "new";it is not unnatural; there is nothing "freaky" or "far-out"or weird about it all, except in the context of contemporary society.The fact that such a holistic consciousness should be seenas being irrational reveals nothing except the degree to whichWestern civilization itself has become unnatural and freaky. [emphasisadded, ed.] What do you "see" while stoned, whether on pot or acidor any other "hallucinogen," that isn't already apparentto a mind not locked in a conceptual cage? The attraction feltby drug-users for ancient Oriental philosophies and religionsis no mere coincidence. Through their drug experiences they havecome to see a reality not split by Aristotelian logic or Christiandualism or operationalism. They see things as they were alwaysseen long before the concrete perceptual foundations of the Westwere poured. The "culturally-limited" point of viewstamped upon generations of Europeans and their colonizing childrenis suddenly seen, through the medium of drugs, to be the productof a "narrow and restricted level of consciousness."To those minds most conditioned by the Western version of consciousness,the attitudes induced by drugs seem appallingly regressive: theidea that "primitives" and "savages" and "barbarians"and "heathens" might have had a better grasp of realitythan their white conquerors does not go down well. It makes whitesupremacy a cruel joke. It makes what we have been conditionedto think of as "civilization" something very close toa farce. Just incidentally, it renders every established politicalcontext meaningless, at least as meaningless as the artificialcontexts established by economics. The real fear behind the generally hostile reaction to drugs isthat the insights offered by these drugs might be more valid thanthe insights offered by established authority, that what is called"hallucination" and "illusion" might in factbe a greater (wider, deeper, more profound) perception of realitythan the ordinary. Suppose that while stoned you do seethings more clearly and directly. Suppose that ordinary (thatis, culturally-conditioned) perception is something like partialblindness, imperfect, distorted, incomplete. And now allow justthe possibility that drugs might open your eyes wider,that you might be able through the medium of drugs to perceivethings in a more complete manner, that you might be able to activaterepressed or dormant perceptual faculties within yourself....Immediately, one can appreciate the threat these drugs representto the established order. It is an order dominated by people whohave learned the tricks of surviving and flourishing inside it.If it may be thought of as an elaborate machine, it is a machinewhich some people have learned to operate, and these people, naturally,have risen to positions of power based on their ability to operatethe controls. They understand this machine. They have a mechanic'slove of its familiar intricacies. Anything which suggeststhe existence of another, more complex and pervasive machine,one whose functioning is not understood by the people who havelearned to work the old machine (or reality) is threatening tothem in the extreme. If a greater reality emerges and claims theminds of men, what becomes of the lesser reality? It will be consigned,inevitably, to the garbage heap. And with it, also inevitably,will go all those who depended on it for their power and authority. The fear of drugs is deep-rooted, but it has nothing to do withworries over whether young minds might be corrupted or ruinedor that people will get intoxicated; after all, alcohol is notso feared. As for fear of young minds being ruined or somehow"lost" to society, this is at the very least a transparentrationalization. If the danger of "losing" young citizenswas the authentic cause of the reaction to drugs, then automobileswould be far more loathed and hated than pot or acid. Who canargue that the automobile does not claim more young "minds"(along with their bodies) every weekend in North America thando drugs in a year? No, the parent who will turn the keys to hiscar over to his teenage son, but who will fly into a rage if hefinds a single joint of grass in that same son's room, is reactingto a fear that runs far deeper than concern for anyone's well-beingother than his own. Instinctively, many in our society have sensedwhat is going on: namely, that the premises and assumptions uponwhich this social order was built are being shaken at their roots,and that drugs, in some mysterious way, are a critical factor.The people who advocate their use, or who, more simply, usethem, are in some fundamental way different. Theycome, rather literally, from another world. They are foreigners,aliens, members of another tribe. The reaction to them is almostas ferocious as the reaction to immigrants in earlier times. It was presumably an understanding of this which prompted EldridgeCleaver to write that the conflict between the generations todayis deeper, even, than the struggle between the races. Althoughit is much more than a purely generational conflict, there areproportionately far fewer older people who perceive the "greaterreality" than there are young ones. This great reality is, to begin with, ecological. Ecology, afterall, is merely one of the first of our Western sciences to escapethe clutch of Aristotelian logic. Of necessity, it abandons subject-predicatemethods in favor of relational methods, extends the concept ofthe organism-as-a-whole to "organism-as-a-whole-in environments,"is non-anthropomorphic, and concerns itself with whole systemsin a functional (rather than merely additive) nonlinear manner.The orders and relations recognized by ecology are "higher;"that is, they are more profound. Peter Henry Liederman notes thatwe are moving from the Dialectic Age to the Ecological or GlobalAge. The "greater reality" is becoming increasinglyapparent. "Western philosophy has taught us to think of everythingin terms of dualisms, diametrically opposed, competing opposites.However, the philosophical base of Western thinking may be undergoingdrastic change, for in science, politics, economics, and evenreligion, it is becoming less and less popular to view everythingin isolation from the total system surrounding it." But ecology recognizes, as yet, only purely physical relationshipsand harmonies. The task of exploring further non-physical relationshipshas fallen to such embryonic sciences as parapsychology. J. B.Rhine has been able to verify experimentally the reality of psychokinesis,extra-sensory perception, precognition, clairvoyance, and telepathy.Evidence is beginning to accumulate that plants have emotions,that there is a "pool" of vegetable consciousness whichfunctions telepathically across great distances and possessesmemory. Experiments by Clive Backster indicate that every livingcell has "primary perception," which implies a mindof sorts. (A test tube sample of human sperm was able to selectits "daddy" from a group of men.) Amoebas, mold cultures,fresh fruits and vegetables, yeasts and blood samples have allshown "emotional" reactions recorded on the galvanicskin-response section of polygraph instruments, and the "powerof prayer" to affect the growth of plants has been repeatedlydemonstrated. The literature which almost overnight has becomeavailable on these new "paranormal" frontiers of themind is staggering. While it is true that much of it can be dismissedas being exploitive and sensationalistic, it remains that empiricaldata is accumulating at a tremendous rate. Much of the seriouswork being done is going on in the Soviet Union, although Sovietscientists take the position that psi results (which many of themacknowledge) must stem from some unknown physical source of energy. J.B. Rhine, after forty years of experimental work in the fieldof parapsychology, was able to put it sweetly: "If a mancriticizes us honestly, I know that he just has his windows cutto a certain size and can't see any further." And can'tsee any further. Here perhaps, is the edge which splits oursociety so cleanly into fundamentally different camps. On theone hand: the predominantly older individuals whose perceptionis filtered through a pre-existing operational structure, theresult of previous experience, conditioning and internalizationof culturally-patterned points of view. And on the other: themainly younger individuals whose reticular system has been softenedin a variety of ways (electronic media would be one) so that itis not so tightly bounded and fixed, in terms of what they areable to perceive; and for these individuals the traditional Westernmode of consciousness is but one wavelength on the spectrum ofperception. Other wavelengths are more apparent to them. The consciousness which emerges once the walls fashioned by Westernscience and religion have been dissolved or penetrated by drugsis not by any means a peculiar consciousness. The extent to whichit is in harmony with the teachings and intuitive knowledge ofother times and places (pre-technological and non-Aristotelian)has been clearly revealed by various studies, perhaps the mostdefinitive one of which was reported by Willis Harman in MainCurrents of Modern Thought : Through the psychedelic experience persons tend to accept beliefswhich are at variance with the usual conception of the "scientificworld view." In a current study (by C. Savage, W. Harman,J. Fadiman, and E. Savage) the subjects were given prior to andimmediately after the LSD session, a collection of 100 beliefand value statements to rank according to the extent they feltthe statements expressed their views. Subsequent personality andbehavior-pattern changes were evaluated by standard clinical instrumentsand independent interviews. It was found that therapeutic consequencesof the LSD session were predictable on the basis of the extentto which subjects indicated increased belief in statements suchas the following: "I believe that I exist not only in the familiar world ofspace and time, but also in a realm having a timeless, eternalquality." "Behind the apparent multiplicity of things in the worldof science and common sense there is a single reality in whichall things are united." "It is quite possible for people to communicate telepathically, without any use of sight or hearing, since deep down our mindsare all connected." "Of course the real self exists on after the death of thebody." "When one turns his attention inward, he discovers a worldof 'inner space' which is as vast and as real as the external,physical world." "Man is, in essence, eternal and infinite." "Somehow, I feel I have always existed and always will." "Although this may sound absurd, I have the feeling thatsomehow I have participated in the creation of everything aroundme." "I feel that the mountains and the sea and the stars areall part of me, and my soul is in touch with the souls of allcreatures." "Each of us potentially has access to vastrealms of knowledge through his own mind, including secrets ofthe universe known so far only to a very few." Note that in accepting these statements the individual is in effectsaying that he is convinced of the possibility of gaining validknowledge through an extrasensory mode of perception. Dr. John Beresford, who has described the discovery of LSD aspossibly the most critical event in human history, remarked: "Takeit once and you know that all you've known about consciousnessis wrong." The point here is simply to emphasize that the consciousness whichcomes into focus through the medium of drugs is basically no differentfrom the consciousness manifest in various ways in most, if notall, peoples who have not been snagged by the inherent limitationsof Western thought-processes. Those belief and value statementsjust quoted might have been uttered as readily by ancient Chinese,aboriginal Bantu tribesmen, Eskimos, American Indians, devoteesof the Upanishads, Buddhists, Taoists and Zen masters, as theywere by Westerners who had taken LSD. And those beliefs and values,while sounding strange coming from the heart of Technology Land,were by no means strange to these other peoples. What was strange,even frightening and insane, to them was the Western brandof logic, which was clearly exploitive, atavistic, and egocentric. "It is my personal belief, after thirty-five years experienceof it," wrote Sioux Indian doctor Charles Eastman, "thatthere is no such thing as 'Christian civilization.' I believethat Christianity and modern civilization are opposed and irreconcilable,and that the spirit of Christianity and of our ancient religionis essentially the same." Dr. Eastman here put his fingeron the crack which has now widened to the point where it is breakingthe established Western churches apart. This Sioux would seemto be closer in spirit to a modern white pothead or acidhead (anda lot of others, all of whom could be loosely grouped togetherunder the heading counter culture) than these whites are to theirown elected representatives, the administrators of their universitiesand, certainly in many cases, to their own parents. Ted Hughes has noted that the fundamental guiding ideas of ourWestern civilization derive from Reformed Christianity and fromOld Testament Puritanism, which are based on the assumption that the earth is a heap of raw materials givento man by God for his exclusive profit and use. The creepy crawlieswhich infest it are devils of dirt and without a soul, also putthere for his exclusive profit and use. By the skin of her teeth,woman escaped the same role. The subtly apotheosized misogynyof Reformed Christianity is proportionate to the fanatic rejectionof Nature, and the result has been to exile man from Mother Nature—fromboth inner and outer nature. The story of the mind exiled fromNature is the story of Western Man. It is the story of his progressivelymore desperate search for mechanical and rational and symbolicsecurities, which will substitute for the spirit-confidence ofthe Nature he has lost. The basic myth for the ideal Westerner'slife is the Quest. The quest for a marriage in the soul or a physicalre-conquest. The lost life must be captured somehow. It is thestory of spiritual romanticism and heroic technological progress.It is a story of decline. When something abandons Nature, or isabandoned by Nature, it has lost touch with its creator, and iscalled an evolutionary dead end. According to this, our Civilizationis an evolutionary error. Sure enough, when the modern mediumisticartist looks into his crystal, he sees always the same thing.He sees the last nightmare of mental disintegration and spiritualemptiness, under the super-ego of Moses, in its original or insome Totalitarian form, and the self-anaesthetising schizophreniaof St. Paul. This is the soul-state of our civilisation. But hemay see something else. He may see a vision of the real Eden,'excellent as at the first day,' the draughty radiant Paradiseof the animals, which is the actual earth, is the actual Universe:he may see Pan, whom Nietzsche, first in the depths, mistook forDionysus, the vital, somewhat terrible spirit of natural life,which is new in every second. Even when it is poisoned to thepoint of death, its efforts to be itself are new in every second.This is what will survive, if anything can. And this is the soul-stateof the new world. But while the mice in the field are listeningto the Universe, and moving in the body of nature, where everyliving cell is sacred to every other, and all are interdependent,the housing speculator is peering at the field through a visor,and behind him stands the whole army of madmen's ideas. So the "greater reality" is an ecological consciousness,coupled with an intuitive awareness of the existence of super-sensoryphenomena; it is, further a pantheistic consciousness well-understoodby non-technological peoples, not bounded by an Euclidean, Aristotelianor Newtonian conceptual framework, a "native" (i.e.,non-literate, less rigidly structured) sensibility. And it involves,as well, a kind of existentialism: that is, the awareness thatman is a creature with no excuses. Meaning is something we inventor create for ourselves; everything we do, whether we are willingto acknowledge it or not, we choose to do. Authoritarianreligions flourish in direct proportion to the unwillingness ofgreat numbers of people to assume responsibility for what theyare and what they do. Reliance on a higher moral authority—ananthropomorphic authority, at any rate—is no different fromreliance on a parent for guidance. It is evidence, simply. thatone has not grown up or learned to stand on one's own feet; itis, in an adult, a form of regressive behavior. The great senseof reality involves an awareness of more complex orders, higherlevels of interaction and influence, but it does not allow thatthese be grasped solely through metaphor or allegory: it demandsthat they be perceived directly. The responsibility for bringingone's behavior into harmony with these more pervasive orders ofexistence remains with the individual. Through the medium of drugs, many people achieve a comprehensionof this reality. Others are "there" to begin with, andmany others find their way to it through other media, such ascreative activity, various kinds of existential group therapy,Gestalt therapy, General Semantics, yoga, meditation, etc. Theseother routes are most arduous, yet when they do finally breakthe mind out of its cage, the effects are more lasting and indelible.By themselves, drugs can awaken individuals to a higherconsciousness, but they cannot keep anyone there. If we may conceiveof "normal" consciousness as being a kind of stupor,then the individual whose only means of awakening involves recourseto drugs is in the position of a person who must have cold waterdashed in his face repeatedly to keep him on his feet. There ismore than a bit of Pavlov's dog in all of us. Inevitably, throughhabitual activity of any kind, whether dependence on drugs oran alarm clock or cold water or hot coffee, we get programmed,and to the extent that we are programmed we are that much lessfree and that much less capable of creative behavior; we are alsothat much less able to respond in new ways to new situations. The drug experience cannot be understood in the absence of anunderstanding of the events and experiences onto which it impressesitself. For people who are genuinely turned on, drugs are incidental.Being turned-on is a state of being which exists to varying degrees,or at least in its embryonic form, before one comes intocontact with drugs; one's consciousness may be liberated by drugsonly to the extent that it was ripe for liberation to begin with.The answer is not to be found in drugs; drugs may make the questionsclearer, or even pose them. But what answers there are can befound only in existence, in the experience of one's being. Turned-offpeople generally remain turned off, no matter how many drugs theyingest. Psychedelics are devices which can be made use of by individualswhose psychology is properly geared to the era we are entering,just as automobiles are devices used (sometimes well, sometimesbadly) by people geared to the age we are just leaving. The riskfactor is probably about the same. And let us not forget the reactionsof horror and loathing with which the automobile was greeted whenit made its debut. Simply, if we do not consider it immoral todrive to the supermarket in the jockstrap of a mechanical monster,why should we consider it immoral to be carried somewhere elsein the arms of a psychopharmacological angel? Drugs lend themselvesto the kind of psychic adjustments which are involved in beingturned on, just as cars lend themselves to the state of mind whichderives some value from mobility. We may understand the drug phenomenon better if we think in termsof the need for equilibrium. It was not until the advent of massmedia that the operational mode of consciousness could penetrateevery level of experience. At every point of contact with theworld out there we found ourselves confronted with engineers.Our emotional responses had been fiddled with, tickled, trained.Every commercial sought to control these responses. Every governmentannouncement had been designed to impress itself upon us at thedeepest level possible. Subtle (and often not-so-subtle) manipulationhad become the overwhelmingly dominant characteristic of the masssociety in whose currents we found ourselves washed. Manipulationis pure operationalism. Almost nothing was said or done "inpublic" without a reason. The whole public sector had beenturned into a fantasy world. Not incidentally, but fundamentally.And not despite "rationality," but strictly in accordancewith the functionalistic imperatives inherent in our concept ofrationality. It was to this world that we related ourselves, incorporatingits distortions into our own systems. Even our "spontaneity,"in part, had become based on emotional responses patterned onfalse memories. Yet in its natural state, human consciousness possesses a "center,"which is not a single point of identity but a psychic ecosystemof sorts. It was this system whose equilibrium had been massivelydisrupted by the full-scale intrusions of technological rationality,and it was this system which needed to right itself in order foridentity, the touchstone of consciousness, to retain some basicintactness. Just as physically we require nourishment (real food)in order to survive, so psychically, we require real, substantialexperience, real events, real people. Certainly, we still havemuch of that. But the servings of real experience, in relativeterms, had shrunk drastically in comparison to the unreal experiencewith which we were daily confronted. The psyche was to becomeundernourished, its internal equilibrium was disrupted, and inorder to regain that equilibrium, to replenish itself, the, psychehad to make some large re-adjustments. It had to become more adeptat distinguishing real from unreal, in order to reject the toxicfood of unreal experience. And it had to find ways of improvingits immediate perception of things and events. Drugs, insofaras their use (as opposed to their misuse) assistedin the process of cleansing the doors of perception, enlargingthem at any rate so that they were no longer contained withinthe artificial operational frame, were admirably suited to oneof the essential psychic requirements of the times. Let us back up a bit at this point and see if we can get a littlecloser to what is meant by a "psychic center." To begin with, not very much is known about the "mind"except that it is assumed to exist somewhere inside the brain.That does not narrow the search very much: exploring the brainis like sending a rocket into space; it is a bottomless universe.One might ask, where in the midst of the uncharted region am "I"? There are roughly twelve billion nerve cells inside the brain.Each is capable of transmitting and receiving impulses from othernerve cells. Some of these cells may have as many as ten thousandtransmitting terminals each. In comparison to the complexity ofthe workings of these cells, the most sophisticated computer isnothing much more than a toy. Roughly, the brain is made up of the left and right cerebral hemispheres,each covered by a deeply folded cortex. Each cortex has a temporallobe having something to do with hearing, an occipital lobe relatingto seeing, a parietal region having to do with skin sensationsand muscular activity, and the crucial frontal lobe which givesus the power to plan. Among other things, the brain also containslarge tracts known only as "Silent Areas" about whichnobody knows very much. Our sense of consciousness is assumedto be housed in the cortex, popularly known as the seat of theintellect. But when Wilder Penfield of the Montreal NeurologicalInstitute explored the cortex of his patients during brain surgeryby "tickling" different parts of it with an electrode,he discovered that the person being tickled could not be "found"there. "I" was always somewhere else. As science writerN. J. Berrill puts it, people make use of the cortex, and mayeven in part be embodied there, but they remain "elusiveeven though fully at home...." The question of consciousnessis two-fold: What is it and where is it? We know almost nothingof the nature of thought and little of the relationship of mindto brain. "One of the few things which is known is that theactivity of the brain is almost pure energy, primarily electrical.All cell activity is accompanied by electrical charges."Marshall McLuhan has defined automation as being "a non-specialistkind of energy or power that can be used in a great variety ofways." This definition could as easily be applied to themind, which could also be referred to as a "total synchronizedelectric field." Or, as Jung has described it, "a questionmark arbitrarily confined within the skull." Science writerBerrill sums up most of what is known about the mind by saying,rather lamely, "consciousness, thought, the mind itself,are the expressions or creations of the sum total of the activitiesof twelve billion cells, each with multiple extensions and connections.Together they seem to embody pure energy of an electrical nature." Our thoughts, our sense of identity itself, somehow emerge outof the seemingly random interplay of forces within this givenarea. How? No one knows. Why? Again, no one knows. Nevertheless,we take this most central of mysteries for granted. It seldom,if ever, crosses our "minds" that we do not know whatour "minds" are. "I" exist and am consciousof being conscious, and it is possible to assume functions, totake on responsibilities, on the basis of this thinnest of threadsof information. Our "center" is therefore not a given point, but a wholeeffect. The impact of mass media and technological rationalitycan now perhaps be better understood. Just as the whole eco-systemof the earth can be disrupted by the addition of certain compounds,so that the system loses its equilibrium and begins to collapse,so too can the "mind" be affected. The acquisition offalse memories, false sets of responses, etc., disrupted the internalharmonies of the psyche in just such a fashion. The mind of technologicalman had become polluted. Well, everyone knew this. But few realizedjust how far the pollution had gone and how dangerous it was.The earth, obviously, had suffered the effects of pollution forthousands of years without its atmospheric balance being decisivelyaffected. It was not until the Industrial Revolution that man'scapacity to pollute took a quantum leap, suddenly threateningthe balance of the whole global eco-system. Individual psychicecosystems had, too, been affected by manipulation and tamperingfor thousands of years, but it was not until arrival of mass societythat these basic harmonies likewise found themselves threatenedon a gigantic scale. Drugs, at this point, may fairly accuratelybe conceived of as detergents being added to oil slick in orderto clean up the mess. The central point about drugs is the most obvious: the fact thatthey do nothing except alter the chemical relationships in thebrain. (The mescaline molecule, for instance, resembles adrenaline.When mescaline is introduced, this enzyme, mistaking the mescalinemolecules for adrenaline, begins to destroy them. While its attentionis focused on the mescaline, however, the adrenaline begins toaccumulate elsewhere: the enzyme can't handle both.) Once thechemical environment has been altered, the brain begins to functiondifferently. It is still functioning. But not in accordancewith established frames of reference. Frequently, it begins towork overtime. Images, thoughts, impressions, always flashingabout in the background, suddenly move to stage center. The brainis now functioning in a different continuum. Like an engine runat high speed, it gets "broken in," accustomed, thatis, to operating at a different frequency, rate of speed, andalong different perceptual avenues. It becomes, in many basicrespects, more agile. It is, as a result, more prepared to move in new evolutionarydirections. The mind trains with drugs. It acquires new reflexes,a new kind of coordination. It exercises its muscles and getsitself ready to take the leap into the future. The drug phenomenonis not an end. It is the beginning of something which has neverhappened before. What will follow is now becoming apparent. Drugs,finally, are only another medium. In the context of technologicalsociety, acting synergistically in relation to rock music, massmedia, urbanization, and a host of other factors, this major newmedium carries the message of change, real change, as opposedto a mere change in flags, label, underwear, or oaths of loyalty.

As with so many research projects,the findings were not at all what prohibitionist functionarieswanted or could accept, and such reports were often vehementlyrejected by their sponsors, and ignored by the media who wouldhave trumpeted the results on high had they supportedProhibition. The study here is of particular interest in that itindicates that drug users in today's societies tend to re-createin a modern context the methods and rituals of drug use seen intribal societies which enable the drugs to be used safely and forcertain defined purposes. The authors conclude: "Our findings show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, controlled use of illicit drugs is possible and is fostered by subcultural rituals and social sanctions that support controlled use and curtail drug abuse... Ironically, the present attempt to eliminate all use of illicit drugs undermines users' ability to control them... What is clear is that the attempt to eliminate all use of these drugs contributes to their abuse by people who take them. "Certainly decriminalization of marihuana should be extended beyond those few states which have adopted it, and federal penalties for use should be dropped. Further research on the possible medical applications of marihuana and the psychedelics should be undertaken, and results sufficiently publicized so that their public image as "bad" drugs can be dissipated. Heroin should be made available to physicians as a legitimate analgesic, and experimentation with heroin maintenance clinics for the treatment of addicts should also begin with careful control. "Drug education programs which are no more than disguised campaigns to eliminate use should be replaced with genuine efforts to provide users and non-users with some rudimentary pharmacological data and with detailed information about the consequences of various patterns of use. Doctors, teachers, counselors, and others who encounter drug users should be instructed in how to distinguish use from abuse—it simply makes no sense to alienate and undermine those segments of the population of drug-takers who stand against abuse. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SUBCULTURE IN DEVELOPING RITUALS AND SOCIAL SANCTIONS FOR CONTROLLED DRUG USE 1 WAYNE M. HARDING & NORMAN E. ZINBERG, M.D.* from: Drugs, Rituals and Altered States of Consciousness, Brian M. DuToit, editor. �1977, A. A. Balkema, Rotterdam * Wayne Harding is a Research Associate at The CambridgeHospital Norman Zinberg is a Faculty Member of Harvard MedicalSchool at The Cambridge Hospital and of The Boston PsychoanalyticInstitute. In the United States, social and legal taboos against thenonmedical use of illicit drugs are reinforced by the prevailingview that these drugs are almost animately pernicious. Accordingto this view, marihuana, LSD, cocaine, heroin, and other illicitdrugs are so overpowering and/ or so dangerous that theircontinued use inevitably leads to drug abuse. The physiologicaland psychological damage evidenced by the most serious abusers ofillicit drugs is regularly invoked as proof of this"pharmacomythology" (Szasz, 1975) . There is nothing in the pharmacology of these drugs, however,that precludes the possibility that they can be used withoutbeing abused. Our study of controlled drug use, sponsored by TheDrug Abuse Council, Inc., has located users of marihuana,psychedelics, and opiates who, like most alcohol users, manage tomaintain regular non-compulsive use of these drugs, Analysis oflongitudinal interview data indicates that this 'controlled' useis chiefly supported by emerging subcultural drug-using ritualsand social sanctions. These rituals and social sanctions providewhat the larger culture does not: instruction in andreinforcement for maintaining patterns of illicit drug use whichdo not interfere with ordinary functioning and methods for usewhich minimize untoward drug effects. In this article we discuss these findings and the relatedwork of other researchers. We also argue that existingsubcultural rituals and social sanctions, elaborated and endorsedby the mainstream culture, could be a more humane and perhapsmore effective means of preventing drug abuse than legalprohibition. Serious consideration of such alternatives is especiallytimely given the recent actions of some states to significantlyreduce the legal penalties surrounding the use of marihuana. Itappears that these reductions have been prompted by a growingrealization that our costly social policy has not succeeded inhalting marihuana use by a large number of Americans. Thus far,however public debate over liberalization of drug laws has nottaken into account changes in drug-using style. DEFINITION OF TERMS As used here. 'ritual' refers to the stylized, prescribedbehavior surrounding the use of a drug. This behavior may includemethods of procuring and administering the drug, selection ofphysical and social settings for use, activities undertaken afterthe drug has been administered, and methods of preventinguntoward drug effects. 'Social sanctions' refers to the norms regarding how orwhether a particular drug should be used. Social sanctionsinclude both the informal and often unspoken values or rules ofconduct shared by a group, and the formal laws and policiesregulating drug use.2These two aspects of social sanctions are not always consonant.Laws prohibiting use of illicit drugs may reflect the values ofthe majority of Americans but are often at odds with the valuesof drug users. Various segments of society thus observe quitedifferent social sanctions (and rituals) although each segment iscognizant of and influenced by the other's. The relationshipamong the rituals and social sanctions of controlled illicit drugusers, of compulsive users, and of the mainstream culture is afocus of concern in later portions of this paper. Our use of the terms 'ritual' and 'social sanction' differsfrom the classic use of the terms 'ritual' and 'ritual belief' inanthropology. The distinction between drug-using rituals andsocial sanctions is one of behavior versus beliefs, or practiceversus dogma. In anthropology, terms such as 'ritual beliefs' and'ceremonial beliefs' are used instead of 'social sanctions' (Leach, 1968) . We prefer 'social sanctions' for two reasons.First, this term emphasizes that beliefs are socially derived andreinforced. Second, 'social sanctions' conveys more clearly than'ritual beliefs' the sense that behavior and belief are separableconcepts. While it is true that rituals and ritual beliefs areintimately related, and sometimes virtually indistinguishable, wehave found that different drug users ( heroin addicts versuscontrolled heroin users, for example) may share very similardrug-using rituals, yet subscribe to dichotomous socialsanctions. In other words, social sanctions can be used topredict the type of drug use when rituals cannot. The terms 'rituals' and 'ritual beliefs' have been appliedmost frequently to magical or religious phenomena. Goody andothers have included secular events (e.g., civil marriageceremony) under the rubric of ritual, but reserve the term todescribe behavior in which "the relationship between meansand ends is not intrinsic is either rational ornon-rational" ( Goody, 1961) . What is usually excluded isany behavior which "is technical or recreational" (Gluckman, 1962) . Our use of ritual and social sanction violates this traditionin two distinct ways. First, we are applying these terms to druguse whether the goal of the user is recreation, improved mentalor physical performance, or religious experience.3 Second, drug-using rituals andsocial sanctions include both rational and nonrational elements.The intravenous injection of heroin is causally related to thesubsequent high while booting (drawing of bloodback into the syringe and re-injecting one or more times ) isnot, although users may believe that it is. Our departure from the more restricted meaning of ritual isnot without precedent among anthropologists. Klauser (1964), forexample, discussed the cocktail party as a ritual. It is worthexplaining, however, why the concept 'ritual', even in modifiedform, is so aptly applied to drug use. Within very broad limits, the objective and subjectiveeffects of a psychoactive drug depend as much on how the drug isused and the expectations of the user as on its chemicalproperties. Booting does increase some heroin users' sense ofeuphoria. A placebo can alleviate pain as effectively as morphineprovided the user believes he is receiving an analgesic. Tobaccoacts as a powerful hallucinogen in some Amazonian tribes where itis used infrequently in high doses (Weil, 1972). These are but afew examples of the mutability of drug effect which can beattributed to the discrete influence of rituals and socialsanctions, whether rational or nonrational, on the drug user.Szasz (1975) similarly justifies applying the term to drug usebecause it reveals the enormous range in the consequences of thatuse which are otherwise hidden by a strictly pharmacologicalperspective: Perhaps because of all the major modern nations, the United States is the least tradition bound, Americans are most prone to misapprehend and misinterpret ritual as something else: the result is that we mistake magic for medicine, and confuse ceremonial effect with chemical cause. Finally, in this paper we are mainly interested in drug-usingrituals and social sanctions of a specific kind: those whichfoster controlled drug use. Drinking muscatel from a bag-wrappedbottle while squatting in a doorway, or soliciting psychedelicsfrom strangers on a street corner is not a controlling ritual.The positive social status attached to the ability to withstandextraordinarily high doses of LSD, the risk involved in gettingloaded on barbiturates and alcohol, or the size of one'sheroin habit does not constitute a controlling social sanction.In the following section we outline the nature of socialsanctions and rituals which do promote control, using alcohol asan example. This discussion will provide a basis from which toexamine the existing subcultural social sanctions and ritualswhich facilitate the controlled use of illicit drugs and inhibittheir abuse. RITUALS, SOCIAL SANCTIONS, AND CONTROLLED ALCOHOL USE Although alcohol is a powerful and addictive psychoactivedrug which can produce profound physiological and psychologicaldamage, the vast majority of Americans who drink alcohol manageto control it. There are an estimated 105 million drinkers in theUnited States compared to some 8 million alcoholics (New YorkTimes, April 9, 1973). Widespread controlled alcohol use can beunderstood in terms of culturally based rituals and socialsanctions which pattern the way the drug is used . Alcohol-using rituals define appropriate use by limitingconsumption to specific occasions or circumstances. Having ahighball before dinner, wine with a meal, a few drinks at acocktail party, a beer with the boys after work, or a drink at abusiness luncheon are examples. Positive social sanctions permitand even encourage moderate use of the drug: one need onlyconsider the occasions when a drink is offered to appreciate howwell alcohol is integrated into the culture as an approved socialintoxicant. This social acceptance of alcohol is paralleled bythe minimal legal restrictions on its consumption, and by thenegative sanctions which condemn promiscuous use and drunkenness."Know your limit," "Don't drink and drive,""Don't mix drinks," and "Never drink beforenoon" are familiar proscriptions. The internalization of these social sanctions and ritualsbegins in early childhood. The child sees his parents and otheradults drinking. He learns the possibilities of excess and thevarieties of acceptable drinking patterns from newspapers,movies, magazines, and television. As he matures, he develops amore unconscious than conscious sense that alcohol use can bepleasant, controlled, and socially approved. In some cases, thissocialization process is more direct—children sip wine atreligious rituals and celebrations, or taste their parents'drinks. Many authorities believe that a gradual and careful earlyintroduction to alcohol by parents contributes to restrainedadult use.4 Many adolescents drink without parental permission, and sometest the wisdom of the social sanctions and rituals with whichthey are already familiar by getting drunk and nauseated.However, the central issue of this testing is not so much how todrink as it is how long the adolescent must defer approved socialdrinking. Neither the adolescent nor his parents have much fearthat occasional undercover experimentation will seriously orpermanently disrupt social relationships and performance atschool or work. Throughout this period of early use, theadolescent has numerous adult role models for controlled use andhe can easily find friends who share his interest in drinking aswell as his resolve to avoid compulsive use. At some point the young user receives direct or tacitapproval for drinking from parents and other significant adults,marking the end of family-centered socialization in the use ofalcohol.5 Asthe user begins to drink in public, he melds the generalculture's rituals and social sanctions and his previous learninginto an individualized but socially acceptable pattern of alcoholuse. Social reinforcement for controlled use continues throughoutadult life. Obviously the influence of rituals and social sanctions onthe alcohol user is partial and imperfect. Othervariables—social forces, personality factors, and perhapsgenetic differences—also influence how groups andindividuals use the drug. The social sanctions and ritualsassociated with controlled use are not uniformly distributed inthe culture. Some ethnic groups (e.g., the Irish) tend to lackstrong sanctions against drunkenness and have a correspondinglyhigh incidence of alcoholism (Wilkinson, 1970) . Furthermore,even when functioning rituals and social sanctions are available,family-centered socialization may break down. Nonetheless,prevailing rituals and social sanctions exert a discernible, andcrucial, moderating influence over the way most Americans usealcohol. The importance of such rituals and social sanctions has beendramatized by the disastrous effects of the introduction ofalcohol to societies which lacked them. American Indian tribesdemonstrate long-standing, controlled, highly ritualized use ofnaturally occurring psychoactive plants such as jimson weed andpeyote (LaBarre, 1938). The Indians' legendary susceptibility toalcoholism stems essentially from a lack of similar culturalconventions for the use of the white man's drug. Becausethe Indian has rejected and has been denied full membership inAmerican society, his inculturation in alcohol-using rituals andsocial sanctions has been retarded. Consequently, alcoholismpersists among Indians and the "consequences of alcohol useare frequently deep inebriation, rather than courtlypleasantries" (Freedman, 1974). Wilkinson (1970) reportsthat when the Eskimos of Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, were firstgranted legal permission to drink, their lack of previouscultural experience and guidelines for alcohol use resulted inpronounced abuse . A similar problem exists for Americans who use illicit drugs.It is not at all surprising that so many of these people wind upas compulsive users. There are virtually no socially acceptedmodels for the controlled use of these drugs, no positivecross-generational education in how to use them, and noreinforcement or assistance in moderate use (Abrams, 1972)6 The mainstreamculture not only fails to assist controlled, illicit drug use, itactively discriminates against it. Any and all use of illicitdrugs is prohibited. Persons who use these drugs are regarded asdeviant: either as sick and in need of counseling andrehabilitation, or as criminal and deserving of punishment. It isclear that use and abuse of illicit drugs must be understood froma socio-cultural as well as a pharmacological perspective. REVIEW OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH By and large, the research literature reflects the reigningcultural outlook on illicit drug use in that it fails todifferentiate between use and abuse. One reviewer of 35 recentstudies states that their most serious flaw is that "theyhave lumped together all drug users without considering theextent of their use" ( Heller, 1972) . Patterns of drug abuse such as heroin addiction have beensingled out for intensive study, but there has been little effortto delineate patterns of use lying between the extremes ofabstinence and abuse or compulsive use. The lack of a definitetypology for drug-using behavior bespeaks the continuing andpervasive tendency to confound quite different patterns of drugconsumption. The terms in the literature which are closest to controlleduse are 'chipping', 'occasional use', 'experimenting', and'tasting'. 'Chipping' and 'occasional use' are usually associatedwith heroin and the opiates. 'Taster' (Kaplan, 1971) and'experimenter' (Keniston, 1968-69) have been specifically appliedto marihuana and psychedelic users. All these terms refer toirregular, nonaddictive, or minimally abusive drug use, but donot necessarily connote the elements of moderation, regularity,stability, and non-abuse which we mean by controlled use. A computer search of the MEDLINE file7 covering a 47-month period(January 1969 through November 1972) produced no articlesspecifically concerning occasional use of any drug. An informalsearch for mention of occasional use, however, yielded severalallusions to occasional use. Jordan Scher (1961, 1966) mentionsthe existence of controlled heroin use in work done through theCook County Narcotic Project. Isador Chein et al. (1964) note theexistence of "long continued, nonaddictive heroinusers." Howard Becker (1963) discusses occasional marihuanause as a stage preceding regular use during which "theindividual smokes sporadically and irregularly" because hehas not yet established a reliable source for the drug. W.H.Dobbs(1971) warns that not all applicants to methadone programs whoare using heroin may be drug dependent. John Newmeyer (1974)found some heroin users who, he feels, should not be regarded asrepresentative of a junkie population because they "couldsample heroin without becoming addicted." The focus in each of these sources is more on regular thancontrolled use, and little importance is attached to differentusing patterns. The authors do not seriously consider regularcontrolled use as a stable use pattern for a significant numberof people. To our knowledge only one published study ( Douglas Powell,1973), also sponsored by The Drug Abuse Council, Inc., focusesspecifically on occasional drug use or occasional users. Powellinterviewed subjects who had been occasional users of heroin forat least three years without becoming physically addicted. Manyof the using patterns described in Powell's report, however,appear so unstable or so damaging that they lie outside thepatterns of controlled use we are investigating. Still, Powell'sstudy supports our efforts in that he established the existenceof occasional ( if not controlled) heroin users and he found thatsuch users "are responsive to research and can be studiedreliably with relatively simple techniques." METHODS OF THE DAC STUDY The major goals of the Drug Abuse Council study are: 1. to locate controlled users of marihuana, psychedelics, andopiates; 2. to describe such users and their various patterns of use;and 3. to identify factors which stabilize and destabilizecontrolled use. Potential subjects were initially solicitedthrough universities, advertisements in the underground press,and a variety of social service agencies including halfwayhouses, drug treatment programs, and counseling centers. Onceunderway, we found, as Powell did, that after completing thescreening/interview procedure, subjects were often willing torefer drug-using friends and acquaintances to the project. Sixindigenous data gatherers ( i.e. members of the drug-usingsubculture) were recruited to assist in locating and interviewingsubjects.8 The following are the minimum criteria developed forparticipation in the project. 1. Subjects had to have used marihuana, a psychedelic, or anopiate for at least one year. 2. Subjects had to be willing to participate in follow-upinterviews. 3. A subject had to have used the drug frequently enough tobe considered a regular user, but not so frequently that he wasphysically addicted to it ( in the case of opiates ) or that hislevel of use was likely to interfere with effective personal andsocial functioning. No precise cutoff points for frequency of usewere established. In practice, a marihuana user who had used onlya dozen times in the previous year was not selected because hisuse seemed too infrequent to be regarded as regular, and a weeklyuser of psychedelics was not selected because such frequencysuggested a possibly abusive drug-using pattern. 4. When subjects were polydrug users, all of the drugs used (including alcohol) had to be used rather than abused. A subjectwho was a moderate bi-weekly heroin user, but who wasphysiologically addicted to barbiturates, was not eligible toparticipate. Interviews lasted from one and one half hours to two hours ormore. Subjects were paid approximately $10 per interview. Aflexible interview schedule was adopted to allow the interviewersto pursue interesting issues as they arose. For each subject datawere gathered on his history of drug use ( including alcohol);his relations to work and school, as well as to family and mates;his relations with drug-using and non-drug-using peers; hisphysical health and emotional stability; details of drug-usingsituations; and basic demographic variables such as age, years ofschooling, and social class. Profile of the sample For approximately two years interview data have been gatheredon 105 controlled users.9The sample consists of 66 white males, 24 white females, 9 blackmales, and 6 black females. Subjects range in age from 14 to 70years with most in the 18- to 25-year-old age bracket.Eighty-seven interviewees demonstrate controlled use ofmarihuana, 42 have used psychedelics in a controlled way, and 46are controlled opiate users ( categories overlap) . Follow-upinterviews have been conducted and are still in progress. We found that the 105 controlled users can be distinguishedfrom compulsive users along several dimensions. Subjects maintainties to institutions like work or school, and regular socialrelationships with non-drug users as well as users. Drug use isimportant to these subjects but is only one of many otheractivities, relegated to leisure time. Most subjects are deviantonly by virtue of their drug use. Some have a history of criminalactivity or school disciplinary problems, which does notgenerally overlap their controlled use of a drug. No subjectsmanifest physiological or psychological impairment as a result ofcontrolled use . Our data contradict the notion that the period of controlleduse is a brief transition stage ending in abuse or abstinence.Subjects with relatively short histories of controlleduse—slightly over one year, for example—are included inthe sample to clarify the manner in which controlled use is firstestablished. Long-term follow-up will reveal how stable thesesubjects' patterns of use are. The majority of subjects, however,have been controlled users for several years, and some havemaintained controlled use for as long as ten years. RITUALS, SOCIAL SANCTIONS, AND CONTROLLED MARIHUANA, PSYCHEDELIC, AND OPIATE USE Having outlined our methods and profiled the sample, we willconfine ourselves here to a discussion of preliminary findings onthe relation between rituals, social sanctions, and controlleduse.10 Themost striking feature of the DAC subjects is that they haveacquired and adhere to rituals and social sanctions which providea structure and a mythology for maintaining controlled use andavoiding untoward drug effects.11 Acquisition of rituals and social sanctions took place overthe course of subjects' illicit drug-using careers. The detailsof this process varied among subjects: some had been controlledusers from the outset of their drug-taking; others had beenthrough one or more periods of compulsive use before firmlyestablishing control. Virtually all subjects, however, requiredthe assistance of other users to construct appropriate ritualsand social sanctions out of the folklore and practices of thediverse subculture of drug takers. It is this association ( often fortuitous ) with one or morecontrolled users which provides the necessary reinforcement foravoiding compulsive use. The using group redefines what is ahighly deviant activity in the eyes of the larger culture, as anacceptable social behavior within the group. It reifies socialsanctions and rituals and institutionalizes controlled use. Thisis consistent with Jock Young's (1971) observations of drug usein London where he found that some groups "contain lore ofadministration, dosage, and use which tend to keep . . . lack ofcontrol in check, plus of course, informal sanctions against theperson who goes beyond these bounds." All but two of the DAC subjects have been connected to acontrolled using group. Although subjects sometimes use drugsalone, upwards of 80 per cent of their use takes place withothers. Use in the company of drug abusers is rare. Controlledheroin users, for example, tend to limit their contact withheroin addicts to those occasions when it is necessary to obtaintheir drug and to decline invitations to shoot up with theiraddict-suppliers. While association with controlled drug-using groups is theprimary source of controlling rituals and social sanctions forillicit drug use, it appears that the alcohol education processmay be a secondary source, especially in the case of marihuanause. Subjects often draw pointed comparisons between socialdrinking and their use of illicit drugs. Younger subjects applythe same language—phrases like getting high and gettingoff—to both alcohol and illicit drugs. Subjects describesocial gatherings where both alcohol and marihuana are availableand where an individual's preference for one of these drugs overthe other is interpreted as a matter of personal choice ratherthan as a symbolic ideological statement about being in or out ofthe drug culture. Some subjects treat alcohol and marihuana inmuch the same way. John L., 26, is enrolled full time in auniversity and holds down a part-time job. When he returns homehe usually has a drink or a joint before dinner, depending, heexplains, on his mood and his plans for the remainder of theevening. It seems then that controlled users adapt alcohol-usingrituals and social sanctions to their use of illicit drugs. Taken as a whole the rituals and social sanctions towardcontrolled illicit drug use have several major features: 1. They define and approve controlled use and condemncompulsive use . 2. They limit use to physical and social settings conduciveto a positive drug experience. 3. They incorporate the principle that use should be keptinfrequent enough to avoid dependence/addiction and to maximizethe desired drug effect . 4. They identify potential untoward drug effects andprescribe relevant precautions to be taken before and during use. 5. They assist the user in interpreting and controlling hisdrug high. Rituals and social sanctions vary with the pharmacology ofthe three drug types we are investigating—marihuana,psychedelics, and opiates—and with the acceptability ofthese drugs within and outside the drug subculture. Therefore,the following, more detailed discussion of rituals and socialsanctions proceeds by drug type. Marihuana Marihuana use is less ritualized than psychedelic and opiateuse. Subjects use the drug in a wide range of settings andcircumstances: before going to a movie, at a party, whilewatching television, or during a walk in the woods. Controlledusers do not usually come together specifically to takemarihuana; they meet to socialize and the drug is sometimes takenas an adjunct to the occasion. Marihuana is also more likely tobe used alone than the psychedelics or opiates. This flexibility in marihuana rituals is in part due to thepharmacology of the drug. Marihuana is a relatively mild andshort-acting intoxicant. Our subjects, as experienced users, findno difficulty in controlling the drug high,12 and they are able to functionnormally if that becomes necessary. The high state, therefore, iscompatible with a variety of public and private settings.13 A marihuanahigh is also easily arranged, requiring neither the apparatus toinject an opiate nor the planning to accommodate a 6- to 8-hourpsychedelic high. Flexibility in marihuana rituals can also be explained interms of the drug's status. The expanding number of marihuanausers as well as the growing acceptance of the drug among usersand non-users alike14has created an environment in which rigid external controls inthe form of rituals are no longer necessary. They have beensupplanted by controlling social sanctions which are lessspecific and can be adapted to various using circumstances. DACsubjects 25 years old and over who began using marihuana in theearly to mid-1960's describe the more marked ritualization ofthat period. They recall with nostalgia and humor the dimly litroom, locked doors, music, candles, incense, people sitting in acircle on the floor, and one joint passed ceremoniously aroundthe circle. They now regard this behavior as quaint andunnecessary. As the number of intermittent marihuana users hasrisen to some 8 million Americans and the number who have triedthe drug to 26 million ( Boston Globe, 1974), marihuana use haslost much of its deviant character. Concurrently, socialsanctions for controlled use have been strengthened and havebecome available throughout most of the using subculture. Under these conditions considerable learning about controlleduse can take place before use actually begins. The choice ofwhether or not to use marihuana has become a reality for Americanadolescents, and most are well aware before making that choicethat marihuana does not cause people to go crazy or to fallapart. Younger DAC subjects ( 18 to 20 years) had known ofteachers in their high schools who used marihuana. Many had oldersiblings who they knew used the drug. These subjects had alsoacquired a sense of what marihuana was like from friends, theunderground press, popular music, novels, and other sources.Their first few experiences with marihuana were usuallyritualized affairs with one or more newcomers introduced to thedrug by a more experienced user in a secure setting.15 Theexperienced users typically provided guidance, demonstrated howbest to smoke the drug, and soothed newcomers' lingering fears.Very quickly, though, neophyte users moved beyond thesestructured situations and began the process of adapting use to avariety of social settings. Most were able to locate friends withwhom to use the drug and with whom they also sharednon-drug-centered interests. The lack of highly specific ritualsshould not, therefore, be construed as evidence that controlledusers are reckless in the way they use marihuana. Rather, therituals that earlier served as rigid and external controls havebeen replaced over the last decade by more general but equallyeffective social sanctions. Due to growing familiarity with everyaspect of marihuana use, these sanctions, like those of alcohol,are internalized; the rituals developed to support thesesanctions no longer need to be so closely adhered to. Interviewswith subjects reveal how these social sanctions operate to ensurecontrol. Subjects describe marihuana as a relatively innocuous drug,easily controlled, and difficult to abuse.16 Some expressed genuine surprisewhen we asked if they had ever had any difficulty in maintainingcontrolled use. Subjects are not, however, messianic aboutmarihuana. They recognize its potential for abuse and offerguidelines for sensible use: In spite of all the rationalizations about how good dope is, I don't see that I have to have a reason for getting high every time but yet getting high consistently without a reason for it seems to be a reason to sort of check things out with yourself. Another subject comments that if marihuana is used too muchthe quality of the high declines and when this happens one shouldstop for a while and then return to a pattern of more infrequentuse. Subjects generally subscribe to the ethic that they shouldnot be high at work or at school. Susan S. works as a housekeeperseveral days a week. She explains that although she can cleanwhen she is stoned, she prefers to restrict her drug useto leisure time. Controlled users also express the idea that too muchmarihuana should not be used at any one time. There are tworeasons cited for this: 1. to avoid transient but unpleasant panic reactions orparanoia, and 2. to keep the high controllable so that other activities canbe better enjoyed . While passing a joint around a group is no longer derigueur, it still serves on many occasions to assist theprocess of adjusting the intensity of the high. It allows time topass between each inhalation during which the user can monitorhis own degree of intoxication. Several subjects state that whenusing alone or with one or two other people, they stop afterseveral tokes to let the high catch up with them and thendecide whether they want more. One subject comments that this isan especially sensible way to proceed when trying out a new batchof marihuana. Psychedelics Psychedelics include a wide range of substances that varyboth in potency and duration of effect: LSD, mescaline, peyote,psilocybin, MDA, DMT, and others. The illicit status of thesedrugs creates a major problem for the user; he cannot be certainwhat is in the drug he is sold.17 What is presumed to be mescalinemay be LSD. It may be adulterated with PCP, amphetamines, andother substances—and its dosage can only be guessed at.Unlike the marihuana high, the psychedelic high18 usually lasts for several hours.It is an intensive though not uncontrollable experience,characterized by perceptual changes, sometimes of a hallucinatoryor illusory nature. The risk of a bad trip is alwayspresent and to some degree increased by the lack of qualitycontrol over the drug. For these and other reasons, psychedelicsare regarded as real, i. e., dangerous, drugs within thedrug subculture. They do not have the widespread appeal ofmarihuana nor are they treated casually. Most of the rituals andsocial sanctions related to the psychedelics deal with making thedrug experience as safe as possible for the user. For the subjects, psychedelic use is almost invariably adrug-centered, group activity. Subjects talk about having otherswith them who can be relied upon to help cope with a bad trip orunforeseen events as a requisite for safe tripping: "I haveto do it . . . with someone that I really know well, that Ireally trust, and there are some people like that." Peoplewho are less intimately acquainted are sometimes included in thegroup but if so, the trip is commonly preceded by a discussion inwhich everyone tries to get comfortable with one another, todetermine who may need extra help or attention, and to establishground rules for the trip. During this preliminary discussion, anexperienced user may be assigned to act as a guide for a moreinexperienced or uneasy user. Group members may decide to forbidwandering off from the group without letting someone know becauseit causes people to worry, and worrying is felt to be detrimentalto a positive drug experience. Subjects agree that planning the trip is an important matter,even when participants have taken the drug together before andfeel quite close to one another. The need for structure varies,but pre-trip planning includes issues such as: what foods orbeverages to take along, what activities to engage in during thetrip, whether thorazine or niacin should be available in case ofa bad trip, or whether talking people down is preferable tomedicating them. This planning reaffirms the participants' senseof shared intentions and strengthens their capability to controlthe drug high. Subjects are adamant about using psychedelics in a propersetting —a good place. For many this means trippingin a relatively secluded spot in the country. What seemsimportant, however, is that the space is secure and comfortable.A city tripper said, "I'll take a walk outside but it'llalways be with the notion that I can come back to this kind ofsanctuary for myself in the house, and so it's no threat."This subject and many others expressed surprise and some disdainfor users who violated the principle that psychedelic use is ataxing experience that should be confined to special settings: I'm amazed that . . . I was living last year with a dude who's 17 years old and is from the West Coast. He was telling me that when he was going to junior high school he would just drop acid in the morning and go to school, which completely weirded me out . . . and just could ride with any kind of horrible thing . . . Amazing. Another social sanction/ritual which subjects observe is theneed to be internally prepared for psychedelic use. One subjectdescribes this as "making peace with the public reality . .. mentally putting your house, your affairs, in order, you know,like, what's the Zen thing . . . emptying out the teacupfirst." Others talk simply about needing to be in a"good mood" and needing "energy" to undertakethe experience. Some subjects appear to ritualize this internalprocess by tidying up the space in which they are going to usethe drug. All the conventions described above represent attempts toensure a good trip and prevent a bad one. We nowturn to the issue of how rituals and social sanctions may inhibitcompulsive psychedelic use. Subjects repeatedly advocate using psychedelics at no lessthan two-week intervals. In practice, their use is far lessfrequent than this—less than once a month is the mosttypical using pattern and, with time, use consistently becomeseven less frequent. Avoidance of compulsive use, however, isprobably not so much the consequence of negative sanctions as itis the result of a combination of two other factors: 1. the positive value controlled users attach to theconsciousness-altering properties of psychedelics, and 2. the fact that tolerance to these consciousness-alteringproperties goes up very rapidly as use becomes frequent. Oursubjects who are interested in experiencing precisely theseeffects find that too frequent use of the drug iscounterproductive. Some psychedelic users who are not interested in theconsciousness-changing qualities of these drugs may becomecompulsive users. For them, it is the speedy, stimulatingeffects of psychedelics that are appealing19 -effects which are enhanced withlarger, more frequent doses of the drug. Although we have littledirect evidence to support it, we would guess that this kind ofcompulsive psychedelic user is associated with those groups inthe subculture which negatively value consciousness change or donot recognize it as a primary drug effect. By comparing older and younger subjects we have identifiedsome shifts in psychedelic-using rituals and social sanctions.Subjects who began use in the mid-sixties share a sense thatpsychedelics should be used for "personal growth"rather than recreational purposes. They discuss tripping as anactivity which is undertaken to accomplish a worthy goal—tolearn more about oneself, to grow intellectually, to transcendordinary perceptual boundaries, and so on. However, subjects whobegan use in the past five years have broadened their reasons forusing psychedelics to encompass plainly recreational goals. Younger subjects may trip for a highly rationalized purposebut they are equally inclined to trip simply to enjoy the highstate. This trend is difficult to interpret and we have yet tomake final judgments. We speculate, however, that the expandedgoals of psychedelic users indicate a growing familiarity withpsychedelics and less guilt about their use. Without wishing todemean the motives of older users we hypothesize that they neededto assign some constructive purpose to tripping to justify theiruse of drugs which were then seen as more dangerous and powerful. We anticipate that as the psychedelic-using population grows,recreational use will increase and, as with marihuana, willbecome less ritualized although not less controlled. We do notexpect, however, that psychedelic-using rituals will everapproach the degree of flexibility and diversity ofmarihuana-using rituals. Quite probably psychedelic use willbecome more acceptable and social sanctions more available; butbecause of the high impact, long duration drug effect and therelated tendency to keep psychedelic use infrequent there is bothless need and less social opportunity to internalize socialsanctions. Thus, there will remain a dependence on rituals ( onexternal controls) which should limit the flexibility anddiversity of psychedelic use. Opiates The larger culture condemns the illicit use of opiates morethan any other drug. Popular mythology about the evils of theopiates and heroin, in particular, extends deep into the drugsubculture itself. Many of the marihuana and psychedelic users inthe DAC study do not recognize the possibility of controlledopiate use, even though they have identified and dispelled manyof the larger culture's myths about their own drugs of choice.20 The controlled opiate users21 in our study are painfully awarethat they are seen as deviant. They tend to keep their use aclosely guarded secret from everyone but their one or two dealersand other controlled opiate users. One of the researchers knew awoman he considered to be a reasonably close friend for severalyears, and although he had been previously involved indrug-related research, it was not until he became part of the DACstudy that she felt free to "confess" that she had beena controlled heroin user all the while. , The relationship of controlled opiate users toaddict/compulsive opiate users is as fraught with dangers anddifficulties as it is necessary. One way controlled users canassert their normalcy is to spurn and condemn junkies, but theymust rely on junkies to obtain opiates.22 Addicts do not understand and are oftenthreatened by controlled users' peculiar relation to opiates. So,on the one hand, controlled users get poor quality opiates atgreat cost from junkies ("You're always gettingburned"), while on the other hand, they are repeatedly andseductively invited to become full-fledged members of the junkiesubculture. The controlled user's constant dilemma is to becomefriendly enough with an addict to establish a reliable contactfor quality opiates, but not so friendly that his refusals tofully participate in the addict's subculture insult the dealerwho might then cut off the supply. Beset on all sides, controlled users are bound together insmall isolated groups that develop idiosyncratic, rigid ritualsand social sanctions. These groups are fragile and drug-centeredbecause it is difficult to find controlled users who arecompatible as friends—the inverse of the situation withmarihuana we described earlier. Most of the rituals of controlled opiate users areindistinguishable from those of compulsive users. In both groups,people squabble over who gets off first, belts are used as ties,eye-droppers are used instead of syringes, booting is common, andworks are cleaned but not boiled. The main reason for thisritual-sharing is that there is no highly visible, communicativepopulation of controlled users from whom discrete rituals canevolve. Rituals are still being borrowed from the addictsubculture—the only readily available source of expertiseabout the drug. There are also two other explanations for thisphenomenon. First, while the life style of the addict isrepugnant to most controlled users, they sometimes find theaddict's bold outlaw stance attractive; partaking of the addict'sritual may be an expression of wistful identification. Second,several subjects were addicts before they became controlledusers, and they have retained their former drug-using rituals(booting is probably the best example) . Several controlled users have added new elements to theaddict ritual. One subject, for example, shifts the emphasis awayfrom getting off by tacking on middle-class amenities—heplays the good host by serving wine and food to his user guests (this without any of the nausea which commonly accompanies opiateuse) and all spend the evening together in conversation. Anotheruser protects herself from a possible overdose by shooting alittle of the drug, waiting to gauge its effect, and thenshooting the remainder. By and large, however. controlled users'rituals are not well distinguished from those of compulsiveusers—especially in details of drug administration. The social sanctions around controlled use are distinctive.Controlled users adhere to a variety of rules for opiates, mostof which are summarized by the maxim: "Don't becomedependent." They well appreciate that they can becomeaddicted or compulsive users. Ex-addict subjects have firm rules about frequency of use.One is a woman who has used heroin on an average of three to fourtimes a month for over four years. Occasionally, when a break inher commitments to work and to her child permits, she goes on ausing spree that lasts about a week. Even while on vacation,however, she will not use heroin more frequently than every otherday. In general, subjects limit their opiate use far more than isneeded to avoid addiction. One subject has confined his heroinuse to weekends only for the past five years. One woman usedheroin twice a month and on special occasions such as birthdaysand New Year's, for a year and a half. Then, troubled by hertolerance to some of the drug's effects, she deliberately cutback use to only once a month. She ignored the fact that thevariability in the potency of black market drugs could haveaccounted for her requiring the use of two bags instead ofthe usual one bag (on only two occasions) to obtain thesame effects as when she used previously. These and other examples indicate that many controlled usersregard heroin as more rapidly addicting than is warranted, thoughthey feel that it can be used moderately. This is understandablein view of the prevailing myths about heroin's power and theexposure controlled users have to addicts who have succumbed tothe drug. Controlled using subjects observe common sanctions againstbehaving like or becoming overly involved with junkies andcompulsive users. Controlled users may chastise one another formanifesting irresponsible junkie-like behavior. Users who areunable to control the drug's effects may be chastised. A user ofcodeine-based cough syrup and of Doriden indicated that despitethe somnolence induced by these drugs, people are expected to actresponsibly— "One (cigarette) burn and you're thrownout. " Being cheated by dealers is a fact of life, but acontrolled user who cheats fellow users is punished by beingcalled a junkie. Controlled users frown upon spending too muchmoney on heroin because it suggests the junkie's lack of control:"Just 'cause I had the money don't necessary mean I wouldcop . . . of course, I wouldn't steal to get the money to cop,there's no need for it 'cause I don't have a habit." Shooting up like a junkie is O.K., but shooting up withjunkies is not, because this symbolizes a loss of control. Acouple who had regular access to opiates through the woman'saddicted sister and brother-in-law stopped relying on them foropiates because of the social pressure to use the drug with them.They began borrowing a car and driving several miles to a coppingsite in another city where they knew they could obtain heroinfrom street dealers. DISCUSSION AND NEW DIRECTIONS Our findings show that, contrary to conventional wisdom,controlled use of illicit drugs is possible and is fostered bysubcultural rituals and social sanctions that support controlleduse and curtail drug abuse. We have also observed how thecontrolled use of alcohol is patterned by established, broadbased rituals and social sanctions. These findings andobservations strongly suggest that the evolution and widespreadacceptance of social controls for illicit drugs, similar to thosefor alcohol, would provide a viable means of preventing drugabuse. Ironically, the present attempt to eliminate all use ofillicit drugs undermines users' ability to control them. Usersreceive no assistance from the larger culture for control.Instruction in how to use illicit drugs is now relegated to peerusing groups which are, at best, an inadequate substitute forfamily-centered socialization. Association with controlled usersis as much a matter of chance as it is of personal choice.23 Becauseillicit drug use must be a covert activity, newcomers are notpresented with an array of using groups from which to choose.Early in their using careers, many DAC subjects became involvedwith groups in which members were not well schooled in controlleduse, or with groups in which compulsive use and risk-taking werethe norms. In both cases subjects went through periods when druguse interfered with their ability to function and when theyfrequently experienced untoward drug effects such as bad trips.These individuals were later able to achieve controlled use, butmany are not. To revoke personal commitments and realign oneselfwith new using companions is a difficult and again uncertainprocess. The culture's active opposition to illicit drug use alsoalienates users from adult guidance. Asking adults for advice orapproval even in a guarded way is risky, and raises difficultissues for parents and users alike. The deviant subculturesbecome more attractive because they insulate the user from themainstream culture's disapproval and facilitate drug use. Of course, the mainstream culture's opposition to illicitdrug use is not wholly negative in its effects. Present legal andsocial sanctions do dissuade some people from taking these drugsand no doubt influence others to abandon their use, therebypreventing some unknown quantity of abuse. Unfortunately, it isnot clear how many people would take these drugs if they weregiven an unobstructed choice about it, nor is it clear how manywould go on to become abusers. What is clear is that the attemptto eliminate all use of these drugs contributes to their abuse bypeople who take them. It seems safe to assume that no matter how massive theinvestments in law enforcement and education, neither the drugsthemselves nor people's interest in taking them will beeliminated. There is every indication that illicit drug use willcontinue to rise as it has over the last decade. Given thisprognosis and the failings and high social costs of our presentrestrictive social policy, it seems not only reasonable butnecessary to place illicit drugs under social control so thattheir abuse can be minimized. Ideally, social management of drug use affords advantageswhich prohibition does not. Drug use is normalized with otherlife activities and is transformed from a covert to an overtactivity subject to the pressures of public scrutiny. Drug usersregulate themselves and other users . Social learning in proper (controlled) drug use becomes available. Rituals and socialsanctions provide freedom to pursue a recreational activity,albeit a complex and at times risky one, in an individualized waywhile discouraging detrimental drug-using behavior. Drug-takingloses its appeal as "forbidden fruit." Users whoexperience difficulties are more likely to seek assistancebecause they can do so without having to declare themselvesdeviant and morally bankrupt, and without the risk of punitivereprisals. The quality of drugs can be regulated and thus,untoward drug effects greatly reduced. The chief difficulty in achieving social control over illicitdrugs is that enormous changes would have to occur in both publicattitude and social policy for effective controlling rituals andsocial sanctions to develop. Rituals and social sanctions cannotbe supplied ready-made to drug users or potential users. Wewould, therefore, not recommend wholesale immediate legalizationof marihuana, psychedelics, and the opiates precisely because tooabrupt a shift in policy would leave many users without theelaborate social support needed to prevent abuse. It is possible, however, 1. to alleviate major legal obstacles to their development,and 2. to provide more comprehensive and value-neutralinformation about licit and illicit drugs to the generalpopulation, making more user/ non-user contact and discussionpossible and, in turn, permitting further dissemination ofcontrolling conventions. Some steps could be taken now whichwould both strengthen the existing subcultural rituals and socialsanctions and serve to demystify the power and danger of thesedrugs generally. Certainly decriminalization of marihuana should be extendedbeyond those few states which have adopted it, and federalpenalties for use should be dropped. Further research on thepossible medical applications of marihuana and the psychedelicsshould be undertaken, and results sufficiently publicized so thattheir public image as "bad" drugs can be dissipated.24 Heroinshould be made available to physicians as a legitimate analgesic,and experimentation with heroin maintenance clinics for thetreatment of addicts should also begin with careful control. Drug education programs which are no more than disguisedcampaigns to eliminate use should be replaced with genuineefforts to provide users and non-users with some rudimentarypharmacological data and with detailed information about theconsequences of various patterns of use. Doctors, teachers,counselors, and others who encounter drug users should beinstructed in how to distinguish use from abuse—it simplymakes no sense to alienate and undermine those segments of thepopulation of drug-takers who stand against abuse. These recommendations represent the first in a number ofchanges which would be required before illicit drugs could bemade available under minimal legal restraints. We cannot detailhere the entire sequence of such changes. In general, werecommend that social policy keep better pace with developmentsamong drug users themselves than has so far been the case. In closing, we suggest that the policy goals and changes wehave outlined are part of a larger historical process by whichdrugs are gradually incorporated into a culture and by which usereplaces abuse as a dominant using pattern. Turning again toalcohol as an example, in the seventeenth and eighteenthcenturies 75 to 80 per cent of those who drank were alcoholics(Harrison, 1964) . A few decades ago alcohol use was prohibitedand the temperance movement pronounced it an evil and dangeroussubstance. Today 95 per cent of those who drink are controlledusers. This figure might still be improved by further normalizingand not glorifying alcohol use, e.g., by banning advertisingwhich relates alcohol use to sexual prowess. In fact, illicit drugs are much further along in the processof becoming acceptable and controllable than the culture has beenwilling to acknowledge. If the incidence of untoward drug effectsis an indication, we can see clear movement with respect tomarihuana and the psychedelics. Becker (1963) notes that shortlyafter World War I the incidence of "panic reaction" tomarihuana was higher than in the mid-1930's by which timemarihuana use had increased in a number of groups. Today, suchreactions are quite rare and are more typical of older (30+)users who have had no prior experience with marihuana. A fewyears ago the treatment of bad trips (resulting from use ofpsychedelics) accounted for as much as 20 to 35 per cent ofhospital emergency admissions. Since that time psychedelic usehas grown at a faster rate than the use of any other illicit drug( Drug Use in America, 1973), but the number of hospitaladmissions has dropped markedly. As of July 1974 theMassachusetts Mental Health Center did not know when they lasthad such an admission, but they were sure that it had been yearsrather than months ago (Grinspoon, 1974) . The Haight AshburyFree Medical Clinic, which furnishes emergency medical teams torock concerts, reports ( Smith, 1975) that at a recent concertattended by some 10, 000 persons where psychedelics were openlydistributed only two adverse reactions came to the attention ofthe medical team. In both cases, the patients were quicklyquieted by talking with members of the team and sent home afterfifteen to thirty minutes. A recent National Drug Abuse CouncilSurvey Project shows that the majority of college and high schoolstudents who use drugs cannot be distinguished from many of thosewho do not and never have used drugs (Yankelovich, Skelly &White, 1975, Yankelovich, 1975) . These data suggest that the development of controlled usingpatterns for illicit drugs by substantial numbers of users isprobably a recent occurrence. The legal system is not able to andprobably should not reflect every shift in using patterns. But,if controlled using patterns stabilize, as our work indicatesthey have for marihuana and the psychedelics, and viable socialsanctions which permit this use develop, then in time the lawsshould respond to the new social position of the illicit drug andthe drug user. Obviously, it is difficult to develop rituals andsocial sanctions which are against the law; both the drug userand the public must tolerate a serious amount of ambiguity andanxiety. The user takes real risks by breaking the law ( greaterrisks than are imposed by the chemistry of the drugs ), and thepublic suffers the disruptions of laws which now punish more thanthey deter. It does not seem likely that this situation will be rectifiedimmediately. However, it is possible to monitor changing usingpatterns in order to determine how best to integrate thesechanges into the legal system. Until now there has beenconsiderable resistance not only to legal changes but even torecognition of changing drug-using patterns. The study anddissemination of new information on how people develop successfuldrug-using patterns can proceed without neglecting the study ofdrug abuse when it occurs. Our work shows that controlled use ofillicit drugs exists in this country and is the result ofsubcultural rituals and social sanctions. N O T E S 1. The material for this paper wasgathered as part of a study of the social basis of drug abuseprevention funded by The Drug Abuse Council, Inc. 1828 L Street,N.W., Washington, D. C. The work of Richard C. Jacobson andDeborah Patt on that study was invaluable to this paper. SinceJuly 1 1976 research on controlled use has continued underNational Institute on Drug Abuse Grant No. 1 R01 DA 01360-OlAl. (back) 2. "In more tribal cultures socialsanctions are rarely institutionalized in a body of abstract law.Principles of rightness which underlie the activities are largelytacit And they are not the subject of much explicit criticism, oreven of very much reflective thought . . .

Presumably drug use for religiouspurposes, such as the use of peyote by members of the NativeAmerican Church, would qualify as a ritual in the more classicalsense. (back) 4.

In many families the formal offer of adrink constitutes an important quasi-rite de passage fromadolescence to adulthood. (back) 6.

All interviews were tape recorded,allowing research staff to monitor their work. Three of the datagatherers were recruited from within the sample—two womenand one man—and proved extremely capable and reliable. Theycontributed the bulk of the data which were not gathered by theresearch staff. (back) 9. Interviews have also been conductedwith approximately 20 non-controlled drug users. Especially atthe outset of the DAC study, potential subjects were referred tous who turned out, in fact. to be compulsive users. Interviewswith these subjects provided valuable comparative data and wereused as a basis to refine the interview schedule. (back) 10.

While the influence of personality,family background, social class, availability of the drug, andother variables on drug use could be traced for individualsubjects, no consistent relationship has been found between thesefactors and controlled use. (back) 12. Weil & Zinberg (1968) founddifferences in ability to control the drug high among naive andexperienced marihuana users in a controlled setting. Becker(1963) observed that users' appreciation and control of the drughigh is learned; and that this learning allows the user tofunction adequately while under the influence of marihuana. (back) 13. Users of the psychedelics andopiates were also able to control their highs but found it moredifficult and usually limited use to protected settings. (back) 14. Most Americans view marihuana as anillicit, "bad" drug, but as less "bad" thanheroin, LSD, cocaine, etc. (back) 15. In effect, new users recapitulatemany of the elements of marihuana rituals of the early sixties intheir preliminary use of the drug. (back) 16. We found it more difficult to locatemarihuana and psychedelic abusers than controlled users. Thissituation was reversed for the opiates. (back) 17. Access to correctly labeledpsychedelics is confined to a few knowledgeable, experienced, andwed connected users. One user in the DAC sample was able toobtain psychedelics from a reputable source, and often had thedrugs tested by a chemist before use. (back) 18. There are substantive differences inthe high states induced by the various psychedelics, which arebeyond the scope of this article (Zinberg, 1974). (back) 19. Psychedelics are chemically relatedto amphetamines. We are presuming here that these compulsiveusers are, in fact, using psychedelics and not wrongly labeledamphetamines. (back) 20. Standing with the larger cultureagainst opiate use may help marihuana and psychedelic users toview their own drug use as comparatively "good". (back) 21. The preponderance of controlledopiate subjects were heroin users who used dilaudid, codeine, andother pharmaceutical opiates on an occasional basis. Only threesubjects did not use heroin ( see footnote following) .Therefore, discussion will center on heroin use. (back) 22. Three controlled users had regularaccess to opiates without going through a dealer: a physician whoused morphine; a hemophiliac who could obtain pharmaceuticalsfrom physicians under the pretense of relieving the pain of ahematoma; a user, whose drug of choice was codeine, who obtainedcough syrup from a pharmacist willing to ignore existing legalregulations. These cases are described in some detail in Zinberg& Jacobson (1975). (back) 23. This is less true for marihuanausers than for psychedelic and opiate users. (back) 24. We are not assuming that the resultsof this research will be uniformly positive. Whatever theresults. by making these drugs the object of medical research theidea that no drug is inherently "good" or"bad", that any drug can be used in a variety of ways,would be advanced.

We are at once thebeneficiaries of our culture and its victims. Without culture,and without that precondition of all culture, language, man wouldbe no more than another species of baboon. It is to language andculture that we owe our humanity. And "What a piece of workis a man!" says Hamlet: "How noble in reason! howinfinite in faculties! . . . in action how like an angel! inapprehension, how like a god!" But, alas, in the intervalsof being noble, rational and potentially infinite, man, proud man, Dressed in a little brief authority, Most ignorant of what he is most assured, His glassy essence, like an angry ape, Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven As make the angels weep. Genius and angry ape, player of fantastictricks and godlike reasoner—in all these roles individualsare the products of a language and a culture. Working on thetwelve or thirteen billion neurons of a human brain, language andculture have given us law, science, ethics, philosophy; have madepossible all the achievements of talent and of sanctity. Theyhave also given us fanaticism, superstition and dogmaticbumptiousness; nationalistic idolatry and mass murder in the nameof God; rabble-rousing propaganda and organized Iying. And, alongwith the salt of the earth, they have given us, generation aftergeneration, countless millions of hypnotized conformists, thepredestined victims of power-hungry rulers who are themselves thevictims of all that is most senseless and inhuman in theircultural tradition. Thanks to language and culture, human behavior canbe incomparably more intelligent, more original, creative andflexible than the behavior of animals, whose brains are too smallto accommodate the number of neurons necessary for the inventionof language and the transmission of accumulated knowledge. But,thanks again to language and culture, human beings often behavewith a stupidity, a lack of realism, a total inappropriateness,of which animals are incapable. Trobriand Islander or Bostonian, Sicilian Catholicor Japanese Buddhist, each of us is born into some culture andpasses his life within its confines. Between every humanconsciousness and the rest of the world stands an invisiblefence, a network of traditional thinking-and-feeling patterns, ofsecondhand notions that have turned into axioms, of ancientslogans revered as divine revelations. What we see through themeshes of this net is never, of course, the unknowable"thing in itself." It is not even, in most cases, thething as it impinges upon our senses and as our organismspontaneously reacts to it. What we ordinarily take in andrespond to is a curious mixture of immediate experience withculturally conditioned symbol, of sense impressions withpreconceived ideas about the nature of things. And by most peoplethe symbolic elements in this cocktail of awareness are felt tobe more important than the elements contributed by immediateexperience. Inevitably so, for, to those who accept their culturetotally and uncritically, words in the familiar language do notstand (however inadequately) for things. On the contrary, thingsstand for familiar words. Each unique event of their ongoing lifeis instantly and automatically classified as yet another concreteillustration of one of the verbalized, culture-hallowedabstractions drummed into their heads by childhood conditioning. It goes without saying that many of the ideashanded down to us by the transmitters of culture are eminentlysensible and realistic. (If they were not, the human specieswould now be extinct.) But, along with these useful concepts,every culture hands down a stock of unrealistic notions, some ofwhich never made any sense, while others may once have possessedsurvival value, but have now, in the changed and changingcircumstances of ongoing history, become completely irrelevant.Since human beings respond to symbols as promptly andunequivocally as they respond to the stimuli of unmediatedexperience, and since most of them naively believe thatculture-hallowed words about things are as real as, or evenrealer than their perceptions of the things themselves, theseoutdated or intrinsically nonsensical notions do enormous harm.Thanks to the realistic ideas handed down by culture, mankind hassurvived and, in certain fields, progresses. But thanks to thepernicious nonsense drummed into every individual in the courseof his acculturation, mankind, though surviving and progressing,has always been in trouble. History is the record, among otherthings, of the fantastic and generally fiendish tricks playedupon itself by culture-maddened humanity. And the hideous gamegoes on. What can, and what should, the individual do toimprove his ironically equivocal relationship with the culture inwhich he finds himself embedded? How can he continue to enjoy thebenefits of culture without, at the same time, being stupefied orfrenziedly intoxicated by its poisons? How can he becomediscriminatingly acculturated, rejecting what is silly ordownright evil in his conditioning, and holding fast to thatwhich makes for humane and intelligent behavior? A culture cannot be discriminatingly accepted, muchless be modified, except by persons who have seen throughit—by persons who have cut holes in the confining stockadeof verbalized symbols and so are able to look at the world and,by reflection, at themselves in a new and relatively unprejudicedway. Such persons are not merely born; they must also be made.But how? In the field of formal education, what the would-behole cutter needs is knowledge. Knowledge of the past and presenthistory of cultures in all their fantastic variety, and knowledgeabout the nature and limitations, the uses and abuses, oflanguage. A man who knows that there have been many cultures, andthat each culture claims to be the best and truest of all, willfind it hard to take too seriously the boastings and dogmatizingsof his own tradition. Similarly, a man who knows how symbols arerelated to experience, and who practices the kind of linguisticself- control taught by the exponents of General Semantics, isunlikely to take too seriously the absurd or dangerous nonsensethat, within every culture, passes for philosophy, practicalwisdom and political argument. As a preparation for hole cutting,this kind of intellectual education is certainly valuable, but noless certainly insufficient. Training on the verbal level needsto be supplemented by training in wordless experiencing. We mustlearn how to be mentally silent, must cultivate the art of purereceptivity. To be silently receptive—how childishly simplethat seems! But in fact, as we very soon discover, how difficult!The universe in which men pass their lives is the creation ofwhat Indian philosophy calls Nama-Rupa, Name and Form.Reality is a continuum, a fathomlessly mysterious and infiniteSomething, whose outward aspect is what we call Matter and whoseinwardness is what we call Mind. Language is a device for takingthe mystery out of Reality and making it amenable to humancomprehension and manipulation. Acculturated man breaks up thecontinuum, attaches labels to a few of the fragments, projectsthe labels into the outside world and thus creates for himself anall-too-human universe of separate objects, each of which ismerely the embodiment of a name, a particular illustration ofsome traditional abstraction. What we perceive takes on thepattern of the conceptual lattice through which it has beenfiltered. Pure receptivity is difficult because man's normalwaking consciousness is always culturally conditioned. But normalwaking consciousness, as William James pointed out many yearsago, "is but one type of consciousness, while all about it,parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potentialforms of consciousness entirely different. We may go through lifewithout suspecting their existence; but apply the requisitestimulus, and at a touch they are there in all theircompleteness, definite types of mentality which probablysomewhere have their field of application and adaptation. Noaccount of the universe in its totality can be final which leavesthese forms of consciousness disregarded." Like the culture by which it is conditioned, normalwaking consciousness is at once our best friend and a mostdangerous enemy. It helps us to survive and make progress; but atthe same time it prevents us from actualizing some of our mostvaluable potentialities and, on occasion, gets us into all kindsof trouble. To become fully human, man, proud man, the player offantastic tricks, must learn to get out of his own way: only thenwill his infinite faculties and angelic apprehension get a chanceof coming to the surface. In Blake's words, we must "cleansethe doors of perception"; for when the doors of perceptionare cleansed, "everything appears to man as itis—infinite." To normal waking consciousness things arethe strictly finite and insulated embodiments of verbal labels.How can we break the habit of automatically imposing ourprejudices and the memory of culture-hallowed words uponimmediate experience? Answer: by the practice of pure receptivityand mental silence. These will cleanse the doors of perceptionand, in the process, make possible the emergence of other thannormal forms of consciousness—aesthetic consciousness,visionary consciousness, mystical consciousness. Thanks toculture we are the heirs to vast accumulations of knowledge, to apriceless treasure of logical and scientific method, to thousandsupon thousands of useful pieces of technological andorganizational know-how. But the human mind-body possesses othersources of information, makes use of other types of reasoning, isgifted with an intrinsic wisdom that is independent of culturalconditioning. Wordsworth writes that "our meddling intellect[that part of the mind which uses language to take the mysteryout of Reality] mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things: wemurder to dissect." Needless to say, we cannot get alongwithout our meddling intellect. Verbalized conceptual thinking isindispensable. But even when they are used well, verbalizedconcepts mis-shape "the beauteous forms of things." Andwhen (as happens so often) they are used badly, they mis-shapeour lives by rationalizing ancient stupidities, by instigatingmass murder, persecution and the playing of all the otherfantastically ugly tricks that make the angels weep. Wisenonverbal passiveness is an antidote to unwise verbal activityand a necessary corrective to wise verbal activity. Verbalizedconcepts about experience need to be supplemented by direct,unmediated acquaintance with events as they present themselves tous. It is the old story of the letter and the spirit.The letter is necessary, but must never be taken too seriously,for, divorced from the spirit, it cramps and finally kills. Asfor the spirit, it "bloweth where it listeth" and, ifwe fail to consult the best cultural charts, we may be blown offour course and suffer shipwreck. At present most of us make theworst of both worlds. Ignoring the freely blowing winds of thespirit and relying on cultural maps which may be centuriesout-of- date, we rush full speed ahead under the high-pressuresteam of our own overweening self- confidence. The tickets wehave sold ourselves assure us that our destination is some portin the Islands of the Blest. In fact it turns out, more oftenthan not, to be Devil's Island. Self-education on the nonverbal level is as old ascivilization. "Be still and know that I amGod"—for the visionaries and mystics of every time andevery place, this has been the first and greatest of thecommandments. Poets listen to their Muse and in the same way thevisionary and the mystic wait upon inspiration in a state of wisepassiveness, of dynamic vacuity. In the Western tradition thisstate is called "the prayer of simple regard." At theother end of the world it is described in terms that arepsychological rather than theistic. In mental silence we"look into our own Self-Nature," we "hold fast tothe Not-Thought which lies in thought." we "become thatwhich essentially we have always been." By wise activity wecan acquire useful analytical knowledge about the world,knowledge that can be communicated by means of verbal symbols. Inthe state of wise passiveness we make possible the emergence offorms of consciousness other than the utilitarian consciousnessof normal waking life. Useful analytical knowledge about theworld is replaced by some kind of biologically inessential butspiritually enlightening acquaintance with the world. Forexample, there can be direct aesthetic acquaintance with theworld as beauty. Or there can be direct acquaintance with theintrinsic strangeness of existence, its wild implausibility. Andfinally there can be direct acquaintance with the world's unity.This immediate mystical experience of being at one with thefundamental Oneness that manifests itself in the infinitediversity of things and minds, can never be adequately expressedin words. Like visionary experience, the experience of the mysticcan be talked about only from the outside. Verbal symbols cannever convey its inwardness. It is through mental silence and the practice ofwise passiveness that artists, visionaries and mystics have madethemselves ready for the immediate experience of the world asbeauty, as mystery and as unity. But silence and wise passivenessare not the only roads leading out of the all-too-human universecreated by normal, culture-conditioned consciousness. In Expostulationand Reply, Wordsworth's bookish friend, Matthew, reproachesthe poet because You look round on your Mother Earth, As if she for no purpose bore you; As if you were her first-born birth, And none have lived before you! From the point of view of normal waking consciousness, thisis sheer intellectual delinquency. But it is what the artist, thevisionary and the mystic must do and, in fact, have always done."Look at a person, a landscape, any common object, as thoughyou were seeing it for the first time." This is one of theexercises in immediate, unverbalized awareness prescribed in theancient texts of Tantric Buddhism. Artists visionaries andmystics refuse to be enslaved to the culture-conditioned habitsof feeling, thought and action which their society regards asright and natural. Whenever this seems desirable, theydeliberately refrain from projecting upon reality those hallowedword patterns with which all human minds are so copiouslystocked. They know as well as anyone else that culture and thelanguage in which any given culture is rooted, are absolutelynecessary and that, without them, the individual would not behuman. But more vividly than the rest of mankind they also knowthat, to be fully human, the individual must learn todecondition himself, must be able to cut holes in the fence ofverbalized symbols that hems him in. In the exploration of the vast and mysterious worldof human potentialities the great artists, visionaries andmystics have been trailblazing pioneers. But where they havebeen, others can follow. Potentially, all of us are"infinite in faculties and like gods in apprehension."Modes of consciousness different from normal waking consciousnessare within the reach of anyone who knows how to apply thenecessary stimuli. The universe in which a human being lives canbe transfigured into a new creation. We have only to cut a holein the fence and look around us with what the philosopher,Plotinus, describes as "that other kind of seeing, whicheveryone has but few make use of." Within our current systems of education, trainingon the nonverbal level is meager in quantity and poor in quality.Moreover, its purpose, which is simply to help its recipients tobe more "like gods in apprehension" is neither clearlystated nor consistently pursued. We could and, most emphatically,we should do better in this very important field than we aredoing now. The practical wisdom of earlier civilizations and thefindings of adventurous spirits within our own tradition and inour own time are freely available. With their aid a curriculumand a methodology of nonverbal training could be worked outwithout much difficulty. Unhappily most persons in authority havea vested interest in the maintenance of cultural fences. Theyfrown upon hole cutting as subversive and dismiss Plotinus'"other kind of seeing" as a symptom of mentalderangement. If an effective system of nonverbal education couldbe worked out, would the authorities allow it to be widelyapplied? It is an open question. From the nonverbal world of culturallyuncontaminated consciousness we pass to the subverbal world ofphysiology and biochemistry. A human being is a temperament and aproduct of cultural conditioning; he is also, and primarily, anextremely complex and delicate biochemical system, whoseinwardness, as the system changes from one state of equilibriumto another, is changing consciousness. It is because each one ofus is a biochemical system that (according to Housman) Malt does more than Milton can To justify God's ways to man. Beer achieves its theological triumphs because, in WilliamJames' words, "Drunkenness is the great exciter of the Yesfunction in man." And he adds that "It is part of thedeeper mystery and tragedy of life that whiffs and gleams ofsomething that we immediately recognize as excellent should bevouchsafed to so many of us only in the fleeting earlier phasesof what, in its totality, is so degrading a poisoning." Thetree is known by its fruits, and the fruits of too much relianceupon ethyl alcohol as an exciter of the Yes function are bitterindeed. No less bitter are the fruits of reliance upon suchhabit-forming sedatives, hallucinogens and mood elevators asopium and its derivatives, as cocaine (once so blithelyrecommended to his friends and patients by Dr. Freud), as thebarbiturates and amphetamine. But in recent years thepharmacologists have extracted or synthesized several compoundsthat powerfully affect the mind without doing any harm to thebody, either at the time of ingestion or, through addiction,later on. Through these new psychedelics, the subject's normalwaking consciousness may be modified in many different ways. Itis as though, for each individual, his deeper self decides whichkind of experience will be most advantageous. Having decided, itmakes use of the drug's mind-changing powers to give the personwhat he needs. Thus, if it would be good for him to have deeplyburied memories uncovered, deeply buried memories will duly beuncovered. In cases where this is of no great importance,something else will happen. Normal waking consciousness may bereplaced by aesthetic consciousness, and the world will beperceived in all its unimaginable beauty, all the blazingintensity of its "thereness." And aestheticconsciousness may modulate into visionary consciousness. Thanksto yet another kind of seeing, the world will now reveal itselfas not only unimaginably beautiful, but also fathomlesslymysterious—as a multitudinous abyss of possibility foreveractualizing itself into unprecedented forms. New insights into anew, transfigured world of givenness, new combinations of thoughtand fantasy—the stream of novelty pours through the world ina torrent, whose every drop is charged with meaning. There arethe symbols whose meaning lies outside themselves in the givenfacts of visionary experience, and there are these given factswhich signify only themselves. But "only themselves" isalso "no less than the divine ground of all being.""Nothing but this" is at the same time "theSuchness of all." And now the aesthetic and the visionaryconsciousness deepen into mystical consciousness. The world isnow seen as an infinite diversity that is yet a unity, and thebeholder experiences himself as being at one with the infiniteOneness that manifests itself, totally present, at every point ofspace, at every instant in the flux of perpetual perishing andperpetual renewal. Our normal word-conditioned consciousnesscreates a universe of sharp distinctions, black and white, thisand that, me and you and it. In the mystical consciousness ofbeing at one with infinite Oneness, there is a reconciliation ofopposites, a perception of the Not- Particular in particulars, atranscending of our ingrained subject4bject relationships withthings and persons; there is an immediate experience of oursolidarity with all being and a kind of organic conviction thatin spite of the inscrutabilities of fate, in spite of our owndark stupidities and deliberate malevolence, yes, in spite of allthat is so manifestly wrong with the world, it is yet, in someprofound, paradoxical and entirely inexpressible way, All Right.For normal waking consciousness, the phrase, "God isLove," is no more than a piece of wishful positive thinking.For the mystical consciousness, it is a self-evident truth. Unprecedentedly rapid technological and demographicchanges are steadily increasing the dangers by which we aresurrounded, and at the same time are steadily diminishing therelevance of the traditional feeling-and-behavior-patternsimposed upon all individuals, rulers and ruled alike, by theirculture. Always desirable, widespread training in the art ofcutting holes in cultural fences is now the most urgent ofnecessities. Can such a training be speeded up and made moreeffective by a judicious use of the physically harmlesspsychedelics now available? On the basis of personal experienceand the published evidence, I believe that it can. In my utopianfantasy, Island, I speculated in fictional terms about theways in which a substance akin to psilocybin could be used topotentiate the nonverbal education of adolescents and to remindadults that the real world is very different from the misshapenuniverse they have created for themselves by means of theirculture-conditioned prejudices. "Having Fun withFungi"—that was how one waggish reviewer dismissed thematter. But which is better: to have Fun with Fungi or to haveIdiocy with Ideology, to have Wars because of Words, to haveTomorrow's Misdeeds out of Yesterday's Miscreeds? How should the psychedelics be administered? Underwhat circumstances, with what kind of preparation and follow-up?These are questions that must be answered empirically, bylarge-scale experiment. Man's collective mind has a high degreeof viscosity and flows from one position to another with thereluctant deliberation of an ebbing tide of sludge. But in aworld of explosive population increase, of headlong technologicaladvance and of militant nationalism, the time at our disposal isstrictly limited. We must discover, and discover very soon, newenergy sources for overcoming our society's psychologicalinertia, better solvents for liquefyingthe sludgy stickiness ofan anachronistic state of mind. On the verbal level an educationin the nature and limitations, the uses and abuses of language;on the wordless level an education in mental silence and purereceptivity; and finally, through the use of harmlesspsychedelics, a course of chemically triggered conversionexperiences or ecstasies—these, I believe, will provide allthe sources of mental energy, all the solvents of conceptualsludge, that an individual requires. With their aid, he should beable to adapt himself selectively to his culture, rejecting itsevils, stupidities and irrelevances, gratefully accepting all itstreasures of accumulated knowledge, of rationality,human-heartedness and practical wisdom. If the number of suchindividuals is sufficiently great, if their quality issufficiently high, they may be able to pass from discriminatingacceptance of their culture to discriminating change and reform.Is this a hopefully utopian dream? Experiment can give us theanswer, for the dream is pragmatic; the utopian hypotheses can betested empirically. And in these oppressive times a little hopeis surely no unwelcome visitant.
