The psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has been shown to ease the adverse effects of chemotherapy, and the symptoms of glaucoma, AIDS, and other life-threatening illnesses. But the synthetic drugs containing THC currently available for medical use may not provide effective relief to all patients in need. The funding for the study came through the efforts of state Senators Jeanne Kohl, D-Seattle and Bob McCaslin, R-Spokane. The two senators co-sponsored a bill (SB-6744) that would have provided funding for two studies on medicinal marijuana. That bill was used as a model for the appropriation provided in this year's budget. The funds will be used by Washington State University, in conjunction with the state Board of Pharmacy, and the state Department of Health to conduct research on cultivating marijuana in a tamper-free environment. The study will also determine the appropriate organization to manufacture and distribute the drug for medical use. Another appropriation will be used to fund a clinical study administered by the state Department of Health under the controlled substances abuse therapeutic program, in statute since 1979. The study will be limited to patients under a physician's care. Only patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation treatments, or suffering from glaucoma, AIDS or HIV-related illnesses, multiple sclerosis, or other life threatening illnesses would qualify for the study. Patients will be informed of the experimental nature of the program, and the risk and side effects of the treatment. Preliminary results of a statewide poll conducted by EvansMcDonough the weekend of March 2nd-3rd indicates a public willing to allow marijuana to be used for strictly medicinal purposes. The statewide survey of 400 voters found that 78 percent favored making marijuana available for patients if prescribed by a doctor. Sharon Gilpin, who worked with EvansMcDonough in conducting the survey, said the results were a complete surprise. "I know the people in the Northwest tend to be compassionate, but the high number was totally unexpected," she said. Gilpin said people who are concerned about the rising cost of health care are willing to look at alternatives to the high cost of fighting diseases such as AIDS and cancer. "This is a great start that will lead to what we hope is a promising finish," said Dr. David Edwards, an Olympia physician and medical coordinator for the Washington Hemp Education Network, an agency working on informing the public on the potential benefits of medicinal marijuana. "I expect the results to have a positive effect in our effort to provide organic marijuana to patients under strict medical guidelines." Joanna McKee, who works with AIDS patients and who has used marijuana under a physician's care to ease chronic pain of a serious spinal injury, said she is confident the study will confirm what other tests have shown: the positive effects of medicinal marijuana. "The medical community is so focused on using chemicals to combat illness, they ignore a simple, organic solution that's readily available," she said. "This test will provide the answer to those who still question the effectiveness of THC." Sen. McCaslin said if the results of the state study on THC is similar to others conducted, organic marijuana could be a boon for the seriously ill. "It will not only aid them in their physical recovery, it could prove to be a psychological boost as well," he said. The Spokane Republican said getting physical relief from their pain will help many patients keep a positive attitude. "It will help them look ahead to a brighter future," he said. Kohl said the study is the first step towards getting needed medicine to those who desperately need it. "If the synthetic drug is not working for a patient, it only makes sense they should be able to have access to organic marijuana." The Seattle Democrat said the studies will not legalize marijuana, nor the use of marijuana for medical purposes. "But if THC does help the seriously ill, we should find a sensible and legal way to cultivate and distribute it to those in need." Sen. Kohl and Sen. McCaslin both applauded the assistance of Sen. Nita Rinehart, D-Seattle and Rep. Tom Huff, R-Gig Harbor for their efforts in getting the funding for the study included in the budget. ### For interviews:   Sen.

This British study also suggests that cultivation of Cannabis plants rich in Cannabidiol (CBD) and other phenolic substances would be useful not only as fiber producing plants but also for medicinal purposes in the treatment of certain inflammatory disorders.  CBD was found to be more effective than aspirin as an anti-inflammatory agent.  "Analgesic and Anti-inflammatory Activity of Constituents of Cannabis Sativa L.," E.A. Formukong, A.T. Evans, and F.J. Evans, Inflammation, Vol. 4, 1988, pp. 361-371. Cannabidiol, CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid of Marijuana, was given to 5 patients with dystonia disorders.  Improvement occurred in all 5 patients by 20-50%.  "Open Label Evaluation of Cannabidiol in Dystonic Movement Disorders," Consroe, et al, International Journal of Neuroscience, 1986, Vol. 30, pp.277-282.  Three patients with Huntington's Disease who had been previously unresponsive to therapy with neuroleptics, were given Cannabidiol, (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid of Marijuana.  After the second week improvement in choreic movement occurred by 20-40%.  Except for transient, mild hypo-tension no side effects were recorded."Effects of Cannabidiol in Huntington's Disease," Sandyk, Consroe, Stern, and Snider, Neurology, 36   (Suppl. 1) April, 1986, p.342.In this Brazilian study of 8 Epileptic patients receiving Cannabidiol, (CBD), 4 were free of convulsions, 3 had partial improvement, and 1 was unchanged.  No serious side effects were found.  This is quite important, as complex partial seizures with secondary generalization are difficult to treat with currently used drugs.  The potential use of CBD as an anti-epileptic drug and its possible potentiating effect on other drugs are discussed.

The effects of marijuana on TS may be related to its anxiety-reducing properties, although a more specific antidyskinetic effect cannot be excluded.  Eliminating the psychoactive properties of marijuana while retaining the antidyskinetic effects (Cannabidiol) could prove beneficial.

The drug-type marijuana is very high in THC.  Cannabidiol (CBD) which is not psychoactive, is very high in fiber-type hemp but low in drug-type marijuana.  This is important as CBD is known to block the effects of THC.  This makes the hemp doubly useless for drug effects.  "Chemistry of Marijuana," Coy Waller.  Pharmacological Reviews, Vol. 23, No. 4, 1971.Wild 'marijuana' growing in Riley County Kansas was found to be very low in THC content.  (Below the European threshold for fiber hemp.)  The leaves and flowering tops averaged from 0.01-0.49% THC with a mean of 0.14% THC.  CBD which blocks the psychoactive effects of THC was as high as 1.7%.  "Seasonal Fluctuations in Cannabinoid Content of Kansas Marijuana," R.P. Latta, and B.J. Eaton.  Economic Botany, 29: April-June, 1975, pp. 153-163.Researchers for the Canadian Department of Agriculture tested over 350 varieties of Cannabis in Ottawa, Ontario.  They determined that there were two basic types of Cannabis based on genetic characteristics:  a drug-type which originates in hot climates such as India and is high in THC but low in CBD and a fiber-type which originates in temperate climates and is low in THC but high in CBD and is used industrially for fiber and food.  This awareness of the separateness of the two phenotypes has vast agronomic potential.  It means fiber hemp can be grown without the drug effect of 'marijuana.'

Man must examine his conscience to see if what he pours out, is what he would readily receive" -- The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.       It has been said by modern historians, that the scarcity of written records has enshrouded the history of Africa in mystery and ignorance: this is not so.  The first recorded history is man, and so history could not be that written piece of paper, but the experience of an individual or people written on the tablets of man's heart.  The history therefore of any Nation belongs only to its people, and so the history of we Ethiopians has been told from generation to generation even until this day.       It is for this reason that, although the forces of evil conspire against us, we of the Coptic Faith know that the leopard cannot change its spots, neither can we alter the commandments and precepts handed down by our fathers; from generation to generation, as a guiding light to lighten all Nations, even the Gentiles, and for the glorification of his people Israel.  THE COPTIC DEITY.       The Deity of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church may be unknown to the billions of Gentiles scattered over the earth, with the exception of the faithful few who are fighting bravely to guide their Nation's life.  However it is not new to the millions of blackman scattered over the earth like sand on the sea shore, even those in America and elsewhere.  It is an inward spirit that once guided Israel along the troubled waters of the past; which he lost because of his disobedience to his teacher and creator, and received the punishment of slavery as a curse; under seven different world powers starting with Egypt, to the British American world power of today.       Punishment by slavery, because blackman had in ages before, and even today, stooped as a scum upon the earth, inferior to the entire race of human beings, and has sold his brother into slavery to be used and tormented by his enemies as a mockery upon our creative heritage that even today, had not their been a righteous branch among us, we also would be like Sodom and Gommorrah.  This dastardly act was contrary to Goud's declaration of individual freedom for every man on earth.  Slavery among Israel came about because we failed to respect each other and in time we became covetous and rebellious against each other.  There was no brotherly louv or trust among brethren of the different tribes and so the strong preyed upon the weak, and sold his own brother into slavery  for the sake of money (caesar), which Europeans taught us was the savior from our miseries.  Before this, when we walked in obedience to Goud, we were taught to keep the commandments and walk in christian principles.  Charity, justice, equality, manliness and respect were also taught.       That spirit of unity, that existed in Israel before they transgressed and were placed into captivity, is still burning and will one day ignite into an eternal flame of desire; the desire to free themselves once and for all from the political slavery brought upon them through their own foolish imaginations, which caused them to be disobedient to Goud.  The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is now in the process of igniting this flame, and very soon we will see billions of blackman worldwide and the strangers within their gates  uniting and giving acclaim to RASTAFARI, KING, CREATOR; who with blessings has returned to reign, reign over HIS PEOPLE; - ISRAEL.  HISTORY OF A PEOPLE.  From Egypt to Rome.       The history of Israel's suffering under slavery during the time of the first six world powers, Egypt, Assyria, Great Babylon, Meda-Persia, Greece and Rome, is well recorded in the Holy Bible, the guidebook of every Nation to resurrect the spirit of moral consciousness, for a moral and spiritual rearmament - man in relationship with his Creator.       What is unknown to the millions who have been lost in vanity fair, including the millions of blackman around the world, whose heritage and dynasty the Coptic Church now declare, is THE HISTORY OF THE BLACKMAN TODAY, FROM THE PERIOD OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.  Let us now continue the history of their sufferings, from the latter part of the Roman Empire until today, the day upon which you read this epistle.  From Rome to the British American world power.       During the latter days of the Roman Empire, the church of Rome, or the Catholic Church as we know it today, was the only recognized church worldwide.  lt. was not until the period of revolution both in England and on the continent, that the church of England, or Anglican church, was formed, then the Quakers, etc.  The Pope of Rome, who was the head of the church, was regarded as the most powerful man in the earth, and received obeisance from kings, princes, cardinals, bishops, abbots and priests.       There were many Nations which were oppressed by the Roman Empire such as Britain, Spain, Portugal and France.  All the great trades were carried out by the merchants of Venice.  As a result, other Nations made their own routes of trade by sailing along the coasts of Africa.  The first to make contact with the natives were the Portuguese during the sixteenth century.  They bought blackman as slaves from the Arabs who had earlier bought them from our own black brothers who had grown to be covetous and rebellious to Goud, as shown earlier in this article. (See Coptic Deity,  2)  Blackman Deceived.       In the sixteenth century when the Portuguese and Spanish adventurers and oppressors started commerce on the continent of Africa, America and the Far East, they were accompanied by the Roman Catholic Church, who under the disguise of missionary priests were used as the agents of pagan religion to spread propaganda and subvert the Goud given Culture and beliefs of the people who they found living in the lands wherein they traded and settled.  Because we warred among each other, we were classified as barbarians, wild animals who needed to be civilised.       Their first deception would be to use their gifts of enchantments to capture the moral spirit of the people.  When they had won the hospitality of the people, they would indoctrinate them with their pagan Roman religion of a sky god called Geysus, hoping they could persuade the natives to give their praise and anthem to their Pope in Rome.  This they did under the pretense of civilisation.       So flourishing and financially successful was the selling of blackman into slavery, that wars broke out among the traders for supremacy and full control of the trade.  Britain finally won supremacy in the eighteenth century.  PUNISHMENT UNDER THE LAST PLAGUE.  The seventh and last plague; British/American world power.       The history of every country today gives a clear picture of the early stages of slavery under the British American world power.  History shows that of over twenty to twenty-four million Blackman enslaved from Africa only fifteen to twenty million survived the horrors meted out to them during their trips to the Americas.  The Coptic Church today holds the British Imperial government responsible for the blood of over four to nine million Black Israel massacred under a bandulu government during the period of the slave trade.       Our suffering, even to the period of emancipation in 1838, is well known and would not be wise to deal with in detail.  Let me bring you closer, however, to the present situation, as it affects us today; and so I start with the period 1765.  This was the period Brother Editor, when you the suffering people of America, pressured by your colonial masters to the point of extinction, placed your shoulders to the wheel in a united effort, to once and for all remove the shackles of British supremacy and corrupt oppressive administration on your colonies.       You stood up not because you were British subjects on British soil, yet because you had a moral conscience in the equality and rights of every man to live upon the earth as a free man; without enslavement from his brother.  We as a people admired your courage for the steps you took in those times.  However, one-hundred years after, when we, who were considered by your colonial masters as barbarians of an inferior race, could no longer bear the pressures of oppression and human destruction laid upon us, and having had our long years of grievances fall upon deaf ears, our race, under the able leadership of Paul Bogle, National Hero and Servant of Goud, rose to the challenge.  Yet because we were divided among ourselves, we failed and Bogle was executed by his oppressors.       As the years rolled on, the British world power by itself became weakened, as many of her colonies gained independence.  As a result, she had to share her power with her younger sister America.  The centre of power was removed from Britain and vested in a mixed worldwide international political organisation, the League of Nations, now called the United Nations, a cage of hateful and unclean, corrupt political birds.  PUNISHMENT UNDER UNITED NATIONS WORLD POLITICS.  Rise of a Prophet.       Fifty years after the execution of Bogle, and around the same time, when the British Empire fell and they conspired in setting up the United Nations, Goud rose up the Prophet Marcus Garvey in Jamaica, the headquarters of the slave trade in the West Indies, the now head of attraction and Biblical lisle of Patmos, where the head of civilisation is.  His message was the same as that of Bogle, only that as a son he was wiser and did not believe in the use of guns and bayonets.  His mission was as a forerunner to Louv Williams, a faithful disciple of Marcus and upon whose shoulder the mantle of leadership fell, so that we, both Jews and Gentiles, can partake of this great spiritual resurrection.  Marcus had started the preparation for the spiritual resurrection of the world at large.  However, because of the animosity and division between black and white, and the scar of slavery and demolition of his people, he had to set about to rebuild the moral conscience of black man, who is the most precious gem, the chosen race of Goud.       It is the same United Nations of today who fought against the Deity of Marcus and persecuted him, even as the American government, an agent of the United Nations, is today persecuting the Coptic Church.  Every nation fights against Herb, the Sacrifice of the Black Goud.  They claim they fight against it because it is a United Nations agreement.  Let the world know that this United Nations is only a worldwide political conspiracy of 1914 when the British world power failed; and when blackman should have been redeemed to his home land, they conspired and set up Politics and thus divided the black suffering masses under the bogus agency called the United Nations, who in its effort to keep the people divided, and thus weak, made their Sacrament to their Goud, the Herb, illegal by their illegal councils.       During the period of Marcus Garvey, a new spirit of unity had awakened in the people, both in Jamaica and America, as it is today through the teachings of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  As a result, the political leaders of the time conspired against him and imprisoned him, at the same time spreading propaganda that he was dead.  By so doing they were able to kill the fire kindled in the hearts of the people, by this great moral teacher.  Early days of Tribulation.       After the imprisonment of the Prophet Marcus; the lot of the black masses worldwide became unbearable, as they were brutally manipulated by the society of the time.  So severely oppressed were they by their colonial masters, that even when in 1937 to 1938, when Bustamante declared himself as an advocate of the people, he was received and looked upon as the Moses who would deliver and return them to the Promised Land, wherein dwells Louv, Peace, Happiness and Prosperity.  The promise of deliverance and final peace of mind was promised through our forefather Abraham, and this promise still lives in the hearts of millions worldwide today.       When Bustamante came to Jamaica in the 1930's, he was unknown to the masses.  He later started business as a money lender among the poor masses and, by doing so, was able to win the confidence of the people.  With the assistance of St. William Grant, one of Garvey's chief lieutenants, he was able to capture the hearts of the people, who thought and looked upon him as the Moses who would deliver them from their perils.  However, Bustamante was not a national figure, and so he could not represent the welfare of a national people.  His help to the masses was only an opportunity to seek power and riches for himself and to further divide the race against itself.       As the prophecy said, "Smite the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered."  The masses who were left without any moral leader to cater for their welfare, adhered to the leadership of Bustamante.  Because he was not ordained as a priest or leader of Goud's people, Bustamante failed to resurrect the moral and ethical principles of the people and to guide them to a land of peace and safety as promised to our forefather Abraham, that Patriarch of old.  Instead, he could only organise the people into divided political forces, thus weakening their strength for liberating themselves  for instead of the masses on the one hand and the colonial masters on the other, the people were now divided among themselves under the disguise of POLITICS.  Trade unions were set up to control the people's labour; and the same oppressors were the ones who negotiated the wages of the suffering people, being ably supported by these political weaklings called Trade unions.       Soon after, the black masses lost the spirit of a moral awakening, kindled in their hearts by that great moral teacher, Marcus Messiah Garvey.  Many of his ardent followers like St. William Grant were captured by these political forces, who with the help of the various pagan religious groups, returned to the pagan religious practice of worshipping an imaginary sky god.  THE DAWN OF A NEW MILLENNIUM.  "LOUV" the first fruit of them that slept.       Since the advent of politics upon the black masses in Jamaica, we succumbed to the dark shadows that loomed around us; and many slept in darkness, having no hope of attaining liberty except on the wheels of the political system which was instituted by the "Buckie Massa's" of the time.  Yet, while many slept and became dormant in their spirit, there was one disciple of Marcus who was fervent in the spirit of Wisdom, Knowledge and Understanding, who took the mantle of Faith, Hope and Charity, to lighten the pathway of us, the masses, in this present generation, so that we could not in this time be deceived, as in the time of our fathers.       I speak of Louv Williams, the first fruit of us who are in darkness within this dispensation.  Louv Williams' charge was for the spiritual awakening of his people from the bonds of moral slavery, serfs and peons, and the inferiority complex which we of the black masses had adopted as our final lot in today's world.       Louv resurrected our moral values and purpose in life, placed us on the right path to individual salvation, as was our custom and culture before we were placed under the awful curse of slavery.  The final advent started in the late 1930's when politics was introduced upon the poor masses of Jamaica.  Louv Williams, who would not bow to political forces, first started his declaration of Rastafari's Holy Trinity (The Man, The Herb and The Word), the true Deity of Marcus, at Mountain View, Southeastern St. Andrew, Jamaica.  During this period, there were brethren like Count Ossie, Jah Lloyd and Bongo Blackheart (now of the natty dread faith) among many others attending school at Jerusalem schoolroom, under the distinguished tutorship of Louv Williams.       Because many who came to the knowledge were disobedient and contrary to sound doctrine, they later left the faith and were captured by the princes of the air.  They adopted a false culture as taught by Hilton and others who were captivated by the religious political forces of 1938.  This false doctrine of Rastafari rose up in the 1950's with its roots in the western section of the corporate area of Kingston, Jamaica, and was formulated by the unprincipled ones in Louv Williams' Camp, who would not live up to the Divine principles of the Holy Bible as taught, and were therefore not allowed to partake in the Sacraments, as they were disorderly.  These, not spiritual minded, soon withered away when tribulations started, and so went and invented their own version of Rastafari, touching only their geneology, yet not the Divinity of PERSONAL ACCEPTANCE through the SON.       During the early days of Louv's declaration at Mountain View, we of the masses were unable to own any land of consequent value.  As a result, most of our Camp sites were on captured government lands.  We were in those times called squatters by our religious and political oppressors and society as a whole.  TODAY THE SQUATTERS ARE STILL HERE WAITING ON THEIR JUSTICE.  In the early part of 1960, after many attacks upon brethren by a wicked covetous and corrupted Poor Lice (police) force, the Camp was removed to August Town in the hills of St. Andrew, Jamaica.  It was first sited on University of the West Indies lands now subdivided into the land settlement called Kintyre.  The Camp was sited at Wilpit, across the Hope river, on a portion of land legally owned by one Mammy Louv, but captured and occupied for a long time by a Coptic brother named Son Latuce.  This brother later left the Faith, joined the security guard, and was stabbed to death.       During our stay at Wilpit, we were subjected to various political harassment, and even one present day Jamaican Minister of government, Keble-you-Feeble-you-Dunn, who was M.P. for the political constituency where the Camp was located, fought against us, saying the Camp should be removed seven miles from the university, as they could not take the Kuminas that we played.  The Camp was then moved to Hall's Delight, further in the hills, on lands owned by a brother named Massa Bouy Brooks.  Upon this spot mighty works were performed, the history of which will be recorded for future volumes.  It is, however, worthy to note at this stage that during the era of Marcus, and the early advent of Louv, we as black brethren did not know that the white man also would be saved in Goud's eternal kingdom.  This feeling came about because of their terrible brutalising of the race and the conflict caused by the RAPE OF ETHIOPIA by these WHITE EUROPEANS.       However, before he transfigured, Brother Louv prophesied the unification of black and white under one Holy Trinity.  We witnessed the fulfillment of this prophecy when, in the latter part of the 1960's, we saw the first white man set foot in Camp, and, being individually convinced of the TRUTH of the doctrine, accepted Christ as his Saviour, confessing his SINS, and partaking in the daily worship, equally with the black brethren.  Louv also prophesied that we would witness the resurrection of the Eternal Spirit on the third Day, meaning the third and eternal leadership in this final dispensation of time of the Church worldwide, which is today's period (THESE ARE THE GENERATION OF US THAT SEEK THY FACE O JESUS Selah).  In 1969, Brother Louv transfigured and ascended to his Brethren.  Coming of the Son: A short work in Righteousness.       History records that, like in the era of Marcus, many brethren who were weak in the Faith, became dis-illusioned on his departure, and so were swallowed up by the various political elements of the world.  So it was also in the period after the transfiguration and ascension of Louv.  Many brethren who were weak in the Faith, and many who did not lay his great spiritual teachings to heart, were early led into captivity, and many forgot the principles and precepts for which they once stood.       However, there were a few who still kept the zeal burning, and chief among them was one filled with the spirit of Grace and Truth, Humble Mantle of Louv in 1969 gathered together Louv's brethren, who were scattered abroad.  It was Brother Ivy who fully opened the doors of Salvation to the white inhabitants of the world within this dispensation, and taught black and white to unite together for one common cause (not for the liberation of the race only, yet), worldwide liberation from SIN and a return to the spirit of oneness in Jes-us our Lord and King Eternal, knowing that there is only one Goud for all races.  During his period of leadership, he prophesied the removal of the Church to the western section of the island.  His work was a short work in Righteousness, to unite mankind in one common cause.  He transfigured and ascended to his brethren in 1970.  FINAL DAYS OF TRIBULATION.  Brother "KEEP"_The shepherd of Brethren.       Those he mark for his own he keepeth them.  In 1970, Elder "Keeper of the Flock" Gordon took over the Mantle of leadership, thus, fulfilling the prophecy of Brother Louv of his resurrected Spirit in the third and eternal leadership of the Church worldwide as we now see it today.  It was during his early period of divine leadership that the Camp was removed from Hall's Delight in St. Andrew, Jamaica, to the Crown Land, Trelawny, in the western section of the island, thus, fulfilling another prophecy as foretold by Brother Ivy earlier.  From this new site many received Salvation, both Jews and Gentiles, and so the Church grew from strength to strength, increasing in numbers daily.       Within this period we were able to plan constructively the proper course on which to sail.  We were able to increase our agricultural production on a better planned basis, chiefly because we were on our own lands.  Cattle rearing was done extensively, as also poultry, etc.  Even upon our own lands we were subjected to political harassment; and one government minister even remarked that because we were teaching the people to be independent, he could not get anyone to work on his banana plantation.  During this period, we had our fields destroyed by government army helicopters which landed in our fields, destroying our crops and our house tops.  We were falsely locked up, then released without being charged.  Our legal properties were seized, and some stolen, under the disguise of law.  Our divine services were broken up at random.       The area, however, was mountainous, and very soon there was not enough pastureland for our cattle, and so, after settling in various parishes, such as St. Elizabeth, Manchester and Kingston, we finally settled at Coptic Heights, St. Thomas, once more in the East, for the final battle with modern Pharaoh.  With more land space, we were able to expand our resources and make sounder planning.  We were able to establish a fully accredited farming institution: - The Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church Farms Eternal Limited, compromising over one thousand acres of land fully cultivated and pastured.  On this farm we cultivate, vegetables, ground provisions, fruits, peanuts, escallion, thyme, onions, peas, melons, pumpkins, okras, bananas, sugar cane.  There is also over one thousand head of beef and dairy cattle, horses, donkeys, goats, sheep, mules and over two thousand head of poultry.  A native lumber industry is also operated by cutting wood from the trees on the farm and sometimes buying from outside supplies.  Coal is burned for the trade, and a stone quarry is operated.  We were also able to establish a trucking department which, along with the produce of the farm, assists the brethren in their everyday needs.  Today, as we look back at our past journey, and of a vast experiment of six thousand years, which are now coming to a close, the achievement that we have made, we now know that these could not be achieved by black alone, or white alone, yet by a united people, fulfilling the Mysteries of Goud in those who fear him and keep his commandments.  COPTIC FOR OUR LIBERATION.       Coptic is the Bible understanding in this present generation.  The entire world today is burdened with SIN, from which, up to now, they have refused to be liberated.  (1) Religion has failed to inspire the generation of today, because their doctrine of a sky god is bogus and without foundation, so that even the ministers of pagan religion are within themselves doubtful of its authenticity.  (2) Commerce has failed, because, by their works, the inhabitants can see plainly that they are corrupt in their dealings and selfish in their gains.  This institution serves only to disorganise the people and to uphold the class barrier placed upon us by our slave masters, and so in this time we see the falling apart of Caesar's kingdom and the coming of Goud's divine reign on earth. (3) Politics, which is the third unclean spirit poured out upon the people, has now failed in its bid to inspire the people and lead them to a land of peace and safety.  Our political leaders are morally corrupted.  They are treacherous to each other, much more the poor people.  They are the tools of commerce, to oppress the people so that they will be poorer and divided.       Coptic is the only LIGHT and SOLUTION in these times of troubled waters. The political leaders have left the people at the unknown crossroad; and all these great boasters who were acclaimed as shepherds of the people have now been found to be hirelings indeed.  COPTIC THE SHEPHERD BRETHREN.       "I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.  Yet he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.       The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.  I am the good shepherd and I know my sheep and I am known of them.  As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my Life for the Sheep.       And other Sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they will hear my voice; and there will be one fold, and one shepherd."       On the foundation of this Deity, handed down to us from our Father of old, the great Patriarch Abraham, and with the blessings he received from the great High Priest Melchizedek when they met in the plain of Mamre, the promise being from generation to generation, the Coptic Church, the advocate of this great spiritual Deity in these present times, is duty bound to enlighten those who are willing to open their moral equilibrium to the TRUTH as it affects them in these times.

Having read in your valuable paper, various articles in connection with members and other operations of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church I am bound by duty to inform your many readers, as to what the "Coptic Church" is all about.  History of the Church       The Coptic Church has been the first, and only true, christian church, since the early days of christianity, in the reign of the Roman empire.  Since the fall of the Roman empire, and the rise of the British empire, its members were taken captive into slavery, in various parts of the British West Indies, and North and South America.       In Jamaica, the headquarters of the slave trade, the work of the church was continued by the great black advocator, Paul Bogle, assisted financially by the great William Gordon, to whom millions worldwide have paid homage as Patriarchs and National Heroes.  Since the departure of these two advocates of black freedom from slavery, the race has been manipulated by oppressive colonial governments.       The year 1914 marked the end of colonial oppression of the black race, and the establishment of the black man's government.  It was in this year, that the slave masters of the time conspired against the freedom of the black race, and organized the United Nations, a worldwide political organization, whose duty it is to deprive the black race of its freedom.  Seeing that the black people (who by Bible history is Israel) had rebelled against their true Goud, and worshipped the pagan religious sky god Geysas, Goud rose up the Prophet Marcus Garvey, to declare to the black race worldwide, their rights, nationality, history and the declaration of the true and living Goud of Israel, Louv, who is from the foundation of the earth (Before Abraham was, I am).       The world at large is well acquainted with the works of this great prophet, and today the world at large is now seeing the fulfillment of his prophecies on the worldwide political systems, which stood in opposition to his true spiritual solidarity, of 'Africa for the Africans, those at home and those abroad.'  It was the leaders of the world's political governments, who opposed Marcus, and later manipulated the people by introducing party politics, which divided the people, thus causing wars, strife and hatred among the race.       Today it is the same political system, which continues to usurp the rights of the people, causing warfare and violence.  Each part (so rightly called, since they divide the people against themselves) are armed with their political gangsters, whose tool of plunder is the guns and bombs and other atrocious acts of violence upon a defenseless people.  During the imprisonment of the prophet Marcus, worldwide politicians were able to indoctrinate the people into believing that he was dead.  As a result the vast majority of his followers, being hypnotized, returned to worship the pagan sky god Geysas, while many held the political belief that he had risen as the physical and now deceased Haille Salassie, political king of physical Ethiopia.       Yet, among his many disciples, was one faithful in heart, fervent in spirit, wisdom and knowledge, who like Marcus had spiritual hope in the redemption of the black race, as Goud's chosen people.  I speak of Louva Williams, a man eminent for his wisdom, and no less so for the genius to which not only men of piety, yet the world at large, must today pay homage.       Louva Williams is the continuance of the spiritual deity of Marcus Garvey, and had resurrected the true name of the ancient christian church, 'THE ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH', first on University of the West Indies lands at Mona, Jamaica, then after strong political opposition, to Halls Delight, in the hills of St. Andrews, overlooking the city of Kingston.  Braving the storm of political harassment, the physical building was removed to White Horses, St. Thomas, Jamaica, where today it has established a firm foundation, both locally-and in all other nations abroad where the deity of Rastafari is being preached.  Non-Political       The Coptic Church is not politically originated, and this was firmly expressed when we met with the political directorate of the land during the period of pre-incorporation.  We support no political organizations, pagan religion or commercial institution, seeing that religion, politics and commerce are the three unclean spirits which separate the people from their Goud.  We declare that guns, drugs, and all implements of human destruction are the tools of the worldwide political organization, so that the people would continue to fight, morally, against the establishment of Goud's peaceful kingdom on earth and thus be disinherited in his Paradise.       The Coptic Church is the representative of Goud's Theocratic government in today's world.  Our aims and precepts are, the teaching and spreading of belief in the Bible, the Moral Laws of Goud, the Fatherhood of Goud and the Brotherhood of man.  We declare that man because of disobedience transgressed the Moral Laws of Goud, whereby he is worthy of death under the law, yet through the louv of the father, he sent his only son for the remission of our sins, that we would have eternal life.  We declare that, in order to partake of this new life, we have to confess these wrongs before one another, and thus be forgiven one of another in Louv.  Opposition       Because of our non-political stand, the church has received tremendous opposition from the politicians, who do not want the eyes of the people to be opened.  Through its agency, the police force, the church has been severely harassed, victimized and discriminated against.  Our members have passed through several acts of police brutality, our legal properties maliciously destroyed, members falsely imprisoned, divine services broken up, and all these atrocities performed upon the Church, under the name of political laws and their justice.  Our Declaration       We have no quarrel with them, we know the time has come, and now is, when the entire human race must be free from political oppression and return to the praise of the true Goud, "I.N.R.I." (I Negus Rule over Israel).  We declare that Goud made man in his own likeness, and so man therefore in himself is Goud.  Gen. 1:26, Deut. 6:15, St. John 10:32.       We declare that the bound duty of man is to praise Goud and live, not die.  Ecclesiastes 12:13-14.  We declare that Goud has given man a chance to redeem himself from the awful curse of death by choosing life through his son.       We declare that in order to live we must talk face to face with Goud as natural man and reason together.  Deut. 5:4 & 24.  We declare that the son of Goud, came in the likeness of sinful flesh, for sin, to condemn sin in the flesh.  We declare that the blood of Christ was shed for the entire world, and as such every individual has to account for the many deeds of shame, which they commit in their temple against the living Goud.  We declare that these political leaders are only boasters and have no love for fellowman.  Luke 11:39-44.  We declare that the apostles of Goud are given power to forgive sins also.  John 20:23.  We declare that these rulers of the people are false, and only feed themselves, not caring for the people.  Ezekiel 34.  We declare that Goud has raised up a plant of renown, so that the black race (known as Israel) would no more be consumed with hunger in the land, or bear the shame of colonial oppressors any more.  Ezekiel 34:29.  Offerings of Devotion       With offerings of devotion, ships from the isles will meet, to pour the wealth of nations, and bring tribute at his feet.  The Coptic Church believes fully the teachings of the Bible, and as such we have our daily oblations, and offer our Sacrifices, made by fire unto our Goud with chants and Psalms and spiritual hymns, lifting up holy hands and making melody in our heart.  It would have been an empty void if I close without making a few comments on the Church's right to its Sacrament.       Herb is a Goudly creation from the beginning of the world.  It is known as weed of wisdom, angels food, the tree of life and even the "Wicked old Ganja tree."  Its purpose in creation is as a fiery sacrifice to be offered to our redeemer during oblations.  The political worldwide organizations have framed mischief on it and call it drugs.  To show that it is not a dangerous drug, let me inform my readers that it is used as food for mankind, and is still cooked as callalloo, and is used as a medicinal cure for all divers diseases.  Ganja is not for commerce, yet because of the oppression on the people, it was raised up at the only liberator of the people, and the only peacemaker among the entire generation.  Ganja is the sacramental rights of every black man worldwide and any laws against it is only the organized conspiracy of the United Nations and the political governments worldwide who assist in maintaining this conspiracy.  Let them know this is our liberation, let us all unite, for Ethiopia sons and daughters win this fight.       I do not wish to weary your patience, yet in closing let me bring to memory these words of a well known chant, and hope that as many as read these words, will be inspired to seek the truth from those who have suffered, and in doing so will revive their moral consciousness.   Ethiopia the land of our father, The land where all gods louv to be, Each swiftly to all sudden gather, His children are gathered to thee. With our red, gold and green floating over, Our emperor shield us from wrong With our Goud and our future before us: We hail, and we shout and we chant.  Chorus: Goud bless, Goud bless, our Negus I, Who keep Ethiopia free To advance with truth and right To advance with louv and light With righteousness leading, we hail to his call Humanity pleading, one Goud for us all  (2) Ethiopia the tyrant is falling Who smote thee upon our knees And our children are lustily calling Over the distant seas Jehovah the great one, art near us He has noticed our sigh and our tear, With the spirit of Louv he has stirred us; To be one in this coming year.  Chorus: Goud bless, Goud bless, our Negus I, Who keep Ethiopia free To advance with truth and right; To advance with louv and light With righteousness leading, we hail to his call. Humanity pleading, one Goud for us all.  (3) Jehovah the Goud of our ages, Grant unto us a son, that we needed. The wisdom thou gave to his ages And Israel is now in need; Thy voice through the dim past was spoken, Ethiopia now stretch forth her hands; And by thee all those barriers been broken! And Zion bless our dear father's land.  Chorus: Goud bless, Goud bless, our Negus I, Who keep Ethiopia free; To advance with truth and right! To advance with louv and light. With righteousness leading, we hail to his call Humanity pleading, one Goud for us all.       We sincerely trust that this review of our history, will prove worthwhile to the lost sheep of Israel, who have gone astray, knowing their King and Redeemer has made his appearance, not as a Lamb this time, yet as a frowning judge, to pay every man according to his work.       Thanking you for your past visit, and looking forward to seeing you again,                           Yours in the Master's service,                          Elder Walter Wells                          (Eld) Walter M. Wells - Spiritual Leader                          ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH INC.  P.S.  The Coptic Church is a covenant of four hundred and thirty years which cannot be dis-annulled.  We spent one hundred and thirty years under slavery building the Panama Canal and three hundred years under colonial oppression.  The rest of the time they rule over us is borrowed time.  It is now the people's time and Coptic is the church of the living man, the gatherer of the people.  It is Coptic time now.                                         W. Wells   Reprinted by Carl E.

Their outraged neighbors and many law enforcement officials call them a fraud, a group of rich dopeheads who have been allowed to laugh at the law and get away with it. That's because the Coptics insist that marijuana, which they call by its Jamaican name, ganja, is their sacrament. Holy Smoke DAN RATHER: One of the things we Americans have always accepted is that people have a right to practice their religion, no matter how unorthodox, without being molested by the law or by the rest of the community. But there's a church in Florida now that lawmen say is stretching that proposition a lot further than most people can accept, at least a lot further than they can accept. The issue will be decided by a case before the Florida Supreme Court that could eventually wind up before the United States Supreme Court, and that issue is whether or not the state can prosecute members of a church who believe marijuana was given to them by God, and that smoking pot is for them a holy ritual. Our story begins on Star Island in the coastal waterway between Miami and Miami Beach. Over the years, the people who've lived in this part of Miami Beach often have been famous, sometimes have been notorious, always have been wealthy. The Duke of Windsor, the abdicated King Edward VIII, often stayed with friends in the island neighborhood. Gangster Al Capone once had a not-so-small castle over there. But even Al Capone could not have disturbed his neighbors as much as have the current residents of Number 43, Star Island. (Coptics chanting) They call themselves the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, a religion these white Americans claim has its roots in black Jamaica. Their outraged neighbors and many law enforcement officials call them a fraud, a group of rich dopeheads who have been allowed to laugh at the law and get away with it. That's because the Coptics insist that marijuana, which they call by its Jamaican name, ganja, is their sacrament; as valid and as necessary to them, they say, as wine is to Catholics during communion. These services take place three times a day, but the Coptics appear to partake of their sacrament just about all the time. Their leader here on Star Island is a six foot seven inch former Catholic from Boston named Thomas Reilly. He prefers to be known as Brother Louv. BROTHER LOUV: Well, let's start from the beginning, page one of the Bible, Genesis, book one, verse 29: "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth..." Now, is there any dispute that marijuana is a green herb bearing seed that grows all over the earth? RATHER: All right, let's -- let's address ourselves to the truth. Is the basic message you should smoke ganja? BROTHER LOUV: The basic message is you should stop your sin. When you and I are neighbors and I have the security that you are a man who keeps the commandments of God, then I know you're not going to rob me, you're not going to murder me, you're not going to covet me. So that's the only security that people can have is to stop their sinful ways, stop becoming homosexuals when they know what the Scripture says about homosexuality; they know what wisdom shows you about destroying your own seed of life. They should stop their abortion. They should stop their birth control. They should stop their oral sex, their hand sex, and any way that they're destroying their own life and their own seed life. They should stop those things immediately. And they should have known to be smoking ganja from a long time. For how is it that I know to? RATHER: The Coptic Church bought this house in 1975 for $270,000, paid for in cash. It's a kind of luxury commune with about 40 members, but a commune that adheres to the Bible, Old and New Testament teachings; a kind of combination of Billy Graham fundamentalism and Kosher law. Though there is no formal marriage ceremony, the Coptic women must be faithful and subject to their husbands. But the women, and even the Coptic children, are encouraged to smoke marijuana, and that's where the trouble first started. It was in early 1978 that the local Miami media began focusing in on activities of the Coptic Church. While it was the constant chanting and the smell of marijuana that upset close neighbors on Star Island, it was those scenes of Coptic children smoking marijuana on local television that brought protests from the city as a whole. Then in November, 1978, news broke of the mass deaths of the Peoples Temple cult in Jonestown, Guyana, and many Miami residents were shocked into wondering if they might not have a potential Jonestown on their doorstep. BROTHER LOUV: I have no knowledge of Jim Jones except what I read in the paper. And I read in the Bible that the wages of sin is death, and I understand he ran a homosexual, perverted, wife-swapping, adulterous, lecherous, camp somewhere in the jungle, and that many of the people were murdered and some committed suicide, and I'm not the least bit surprised. RATHER: Nevertheless, the furor caused by the Coptic Church's activities led the state attorney to take action against them. A civil action for public nuisance was brought against the Coptics, rather than a criminal charge for possession of marijuana. The state attorney's office had in fact offered to drop all charges if the Coptics would move out of Star Island to some place where they were less conspicuous. The Coptics flatly refused. Instead, they hired the best and most expensive lawyers in town. Milton Ferrell, Jr. is their chief defense attorney. RATHER: All right, so it was a civil action; went before the judge. The judge decided that, yes, this was a church under the definition of a church for First Amendment purposes, right? MILTON FERRELL, JR: He decided it was a religion. It was a -- RATHER: It was a religion. And now the question before the Supreme Court is whether it is or isn't. FERRELL: No, the question before the Supreme Court -- the Supreme Court's not concerned as to the sincerity of the religious belief, or as to whether or not marijuana's essential to the conduct of the religion, nor whether the religion is a religion under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Those findings can't be challenged in the Supreme Court. Those have been found as a fact already. There's no controversy about that at all. The controversy in the supreme court of Florida is this: whether the State has a compelling state interest sufficient to override the fundamental interest of any citizen of the United States to practice their religion without governmental interference in it. RATHER: The implications of such a confrontation, says Florida Assistant State Attorney Henry Adorno, extend far beyond the Coptic Church. HENRY ADORNO: If a court were to rule that the Coptics do have a First Amendment right, then I think that would be the opening of the floodgates for possible legalization of marijuana in Florida. I, as a prosecutor, would then have to go around and decide who to arrest for possession of marijuana. They obviously would then come up with the defense, "Well, I'm a Coptic," or "I have, you know, I believe that marijuana is my sacrament," which would then muddle the criminal system to no end in trying to defend or trying to prosecute a case where the defense is First Amendment grounds. RATHER: Meanwhile, quite aware of all the legal problems they have caused, the Coptics continue their activities at Star Island. While the constitutional issue is debated, a federal civil rights ruling allows them to go on smoking marijuana unmolested. One court battle, the right to be considered a church, has already been won. But just what sort of church is it? The Coptics claim that their mother church is on the Caribbean island of Jamaica. Brother Louv and his American brethren first came to Jamaica in the early seventies. They were all graduates of Haight-Ashbury and the campuses of the sixties, a remnant of a lost generation. They came looking for marijuana, and they found it and bought it in the slums of Kingston from this Jamaican, Keith Gordon. At the same time, Gordon introduced them to an obscure Christian sect. This was the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, which claimed for years that the blacks of Africa were the original Jews of the Bible, and that the slaves of the New World were their direct descendants. Marijuana, or ganja, was the "holy herb". Ripe for a new spiritual experience, these Americans could have found nothing better than a religion that extolled the poor, the black man and marijuana all in one tidy package. Coptic Heights lies 30 miles outside Kingston. The Coptic Church owns as far as the eye can see. They have roads. They have trucks, lots of trucks. They have a dozen corporations trading under different names. To the average Jamaican, these Coptics are efficient, prosperous and highly suspect. DAWN RITCH: What they're doing is, on an organized basis, exporting marijuana to Miami. RATHER: Jamaican journalist Dawn Ritch. RITCH: The group in Miami at Star Island, they are the backers. They're the people with the money. They control this thing that they would like to pretend is a church. It is no church. That is a factory for the export of ganja. RATHER: Law enforcement agencies say that with his new-found American friends, Keith Gordon's marijuana business took off like a turpentined cat. From being a small-time pusher, he quickly grew to head an organization that controlled cultivation and large-scale distribution right into the United States. Today, the majority of marijuana grown illegally in fields such as this throughout Jamaica has already been presold to Brother Keith and the Coptics. It's prime marijuana that's much in demand. RITCH: Columbia marijuana, Mexican marijuana, is between two and four percent THC. Our marijuana is between four and eight percent. So we are genuinely the source. Also closest. But Coptic has, I am told, 7,000 acres of farm in Colombia, as well. We are now a branch, you see. They claim, in -- in Florida, that we are the source, we are the home of this church. We are simply a branch of a multinational corporation operating on the wrong side of the law. BROTHER LOUV: When -- when you talk about smuggling, what do you mean by smuggling? RATHER: It is not a fact that you are in the business, the business, of smuggling marijuana into the United States? BROTHER LOUV: I have no knowledge of even what you're thinking about, much less what you're talking about. RATHER: The United States Coast Guard here in Florida long has been interested in activities of the Zion Coptic Church, as have the FBI, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, the Florida Department of Criminal Law Enforcement, and even the Miami Beach police. One of The Miami Beach police who, as an undercover agent, recently spent a lot of time investigating the Coptic Church is Sergeant Rick Baretto. Tell me, if you can and if you will, what I am dealing with when I'm dealing with Brother Louv and Star Island. What is this about? SERGEANT RICK BARETTO: I don't know. I really don't. RATHER: You looked into it for two years and you don't know what it's about? SERGEANT BARETTO: That's correct. They obviously have had -- been in a financial situation where they can afford a lot of very high-priced attorneys. So they've been able to successfully tie us up time and time again and -- through litigation. RATHER: That's the way the system works, isn't it? SERGEANT BARETTO: The wheels turn slowly, yes, sir. FEMALE PATROL BOAT PILOT: This is Coast Guard 459, Coast Guard 459, over. RATHER: On at least two occasions in this state alone, members of the church have been arrested in very large drug busts. November, 1977, Marion County, Florida: 13 tons of marijuana found hidden in a tunnel on a farm owned by the church. February, 1978, Citrus County, Florida: 20 tons of marijuana taken off the vessel Our Seas, owned by the church; 16 persons arrested, including Brother Louv's fellow church leader, Keith Gordon of Jamaica. However, none of the charges stuck. May 14th, 1979: Marion County charges dropped. May 22nd, 1979: Citrus County charges dropped. Lack of solid evidence cited as the reasons; that the state had found church members around marijuana, but was unable to establish a direct link between the members and the confiscated dope. So, the fact remains - and this is important - that not a single member of the Zion Coptic Church ever has been convicted of possessing so much as a single ounce of marijuana in any court in - the state of Florida. Is this whole church, based so conveniently in Miami and Jamaica, just a cover for large-scale organized crime? Well, no, it's certainly not as simple as that. All the law enforcement agencies who have investigated the Coptics agree: they cannot be faulted on the sincerity of their religious views. Moreover, the Coptics have never, never been linked in any way with the smuggling of hard drugs, cocaine and heroin, that right now is so rampant throughout Florida. Nor with other activities associated with so-called mafioso crime, such as prostitution, gambling and gun-running. None of these would be consistent with the Coptics' professed beliefs. Marijuana, and only marijuana, is what the Coptics are about. To them it is a holy mission. (Coptics singing in religious ceremony) RATHER: Back in Miami, the Coptics are pursuing that mission with all the zeal of a political candidate running for office. They recently hired a production company to film their every move, and they study their screen performances with great care. They advertise themselves, together with a biblical plug for marijuana, in the Miami telephone book Yellow Pages. And they publish an expensive newspaper which details with relish their latest costly legal battles. Where does Brother Louv say he gets the money to do all this? BROTHER LOUV: I want you to consider that you're talking to a spiritual person who has solved the physical problems, and we should be talking about the matters that could uplift everyone who's hearing us right now. RATHER: Well, where will the money for this thing come from? BROTHER LOUV: Do you read in the Scripture money is the tool of the Devil. The love of money is the root of all evil. We love the blessing. Within blessing we've found a higher way of thinking than dollars and cents. Money is a tool. A worldly tool. RATHER: How do you feel about the Internal Revenue Service case, which is several (indistinct cross-talk) -- BROTHER LOUV: They're a bunch of robbers and thieves and whores! RATHER: The Internal Revenue Service? BROTHER LOUV: Robbers, thieves and whores. RATHER: On what evidence do you (indistinct cross-talk)? BROTHER LOUV: They have no integrity. They have no foundation. They all have little soft, pink, fleshly little hands. They sit in offices all day long trying to rob the people. RATHER: Brother Louv's brotherly love clearly wears a little thin when reminded of the Internal Revenue Service. Recently, estimating the value of automobiles, property, boats and the amount of marijuana seized so far, the IRS and the U.S. Customs presented the Coptics with a bill for back taxes and penalties totaling $l8-million. Privately, law enforcement officers hope that the tax man may succeed where the police have so far failed, and bring down the Coptic Church. The Coptics have simply refused to pay, and to them it's just one court case among many. Their minds, and a great deal of their money, are right now tied up in a legal battle of greater significance which they are determined to win, if necessary by going all the way to the United States Supreme Court. If you were to become Brother Louv's defense attorney, an unlikely prospect, I think you'll agree -- ADORNO: I agree. RATHER: -- and you were advising him, where is the greatest danger to him legally? ADORNO: Legally it's in the decisions that are -- in the mood of the -- of the country. I don't think this country is ready for the legalization of marijuana, or at least the state of Florida is not ready for that. And I think that for him to win his battle, he's going to have to fight the greater battle, which is not -- not only allowing Coptics to smoke marijuana, but take the one step further and having marijuana legalized. I think that's the only way that he's ultimately going to win his battle. BROTHER LOUV: Not -- from the time you say legalized, that to me sounds like whisky, and whisky's something you can buy from the government but if you make your own they'll put you in jail. So that does not apply to marijuana. Marijuana, ganja, is free. We're not fighting for the freedom or the legalization. We're declaring that it is and always has been free.

Tropic, The Miami Herald, August 2, 1981 His real name is Thomas Reilly, but you probably know him only as Brother Louv of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. For several years, the members of this church have outraged the community by their blatant use of marijuana, which they call ganja and consider a sacrament. Because the law calls it dope and considers it illegal, nine church members were convicted this year of smuggling. In the fall, Reilly goes on trial and could be sent to jail for life. Is the system harassing this religion unfairly, or are the Coptics nothing but big-time smugglers? The story begins on page 6. The cover photograph is by Mary Lou Foy. THE LAW AND BROTHER LOUV Are they persecuting a church or prosecuting a smuggler? By CARL HIAASEN CARL HIAASEN is a Miami Herald staff writer One night early last year, in the foyer of the large house at 43 Star Island, a bony, balding man of 6-foot-7 danced on his toes, popping knobby fists into the air. "I can feel the noose loosen around my neck," he said with a snaggletoothed grin. "I hope they bring on the biggest, meanest f------ they got. That's the one I want to beat. The shadowboxer was Thomas Francis Reilly Jr., better known as Brother Louv, ambassador of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. "They" was the U.S. government. It was February 1980, a heady time for Reilly and the Coptics. Fresh from a "60 Minutes" segment, they felt sure the U.S. Supreme Court would listen to their arguments for the sacramental use of marijuana, which they call ganja. And they had high hopes for an unusual legal petition, filed by their attorneys with a Miami judge, that put forth a comprehensive case for the relative harmlessness of cannabis sativa. In that motion, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark had asked the government to dismiss a list of serious smuggling-related charges against the Coptics, arguing for the First Amendment rights of the church faithful to smoke marijuana during prayer. This is why Reilly was so elated. For once the lawyers had done what the Coptics wanted, which was to tell the world that nothing is wrong with marijuana. Medical doctors, psychiatrists, research scientists, cancer victims, and glaucoma patients testified for the Coptics in pretrial hearings. It is hard to tell whether Reilly, who is an intelligent man, really believed that U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler was going to go for this approach. Hoeveler didn't. He said the issue was smuggling, not religion, so the Coptics went to trial. The government turned out to be bigger and meaner than Reilly had anticipated. Two months ago a jury convicted nine out of nine Coptics on 45 out of 45 smuggling and conspiracy counts. Reilly was spared only because his attorney got sick. He will go to trial again soon and, if convicted faces 10 years to life in prison. "I don't like that prospect," he says pensively now. Much has happened to the Coptic Church in recent months, none of it good. And if Reilly -- the most visible, articulate and telegenic of the Coptic leaders -- goes to prison, the future of the church of ganja would be in jeopardy. Of course, that would suit many people just fine: federal prosecutors, state prosecutors, drug agents, tax investigators, and the city of Miami Beach, for starters. When the television cameras are gone, and the lustrous ceremonial robes are closeted, Thomas Reilly stops preaching and starts talking like a man who's looking at a lot of jail time. "I'll be damned if I'm going to be considered a criminal because of ganja," he says quietly. "It's a mismatch. One man is using his wits and his prayers, and the other is using guns and informers and stakeouts." There is no doubt that Reilly and the other Coptic leaders devoutly religious about marijuana. There is also no doubt, authorities say, that the Coptics are big-time dope smugglers; there is simply no other explanation for what has happened. By dint of an eager media and the congregation's own affection for the melodramatic, the Coptics have come to be regarded as something of a Miami Beach freak show, Cheech and Chong Get Religion. In fact, the rigid and narrow Coptic doctrine has more in common with Jerry Falwell. Among the modern "perversions" the Coptics sententiously denounce: birth control, abortion, fornication, adultery, oral sex, masturbation, homosexuality and the use of alcohol or any hard drugs. "If it weren't for the marijuana," Reilly likes to say, "we would be the Moral Majority." Through an open window at Star Island comes the sound of Psalms being recited by women and children, then slow singing. "This is our defense camp," he says, raising a smoke-stained hand. Reilly sits in a living room filled with fine furniture, heavy Jamaican mahogany. The carpets are Persian. A Betamax is in one corner. Reilly makes no apologies for the wealth of the church, or for the Cadillac and Mercedes-Benz in the driveway. He is 38, well-spoken and media-wise. Last year a UCLA psychiatrist tested Reilly's IQ at 150 -- "not bad for a guy who's supposed to be blown out." His white slacks and open shirt hang from a gaunt frame. As always, he wears sandals. Consistent with church tenets, he has not cut his hair in years. He is missing some front teeth. The ritual smoking that begins each morning before dawn continues "every minute of every day." Reilly cleans a long clay chillum pipe, then packs it with a 50-50 mixture of marijuana and tobacco. Hot embers are tapped into the open bowl, while a damp cloth is folded over the smoker's end to keep live sparks out of the lungs. The Coptics "partake" of marijuana in short inhalations. They condemn as sinful the deep-sucking recreational pot smokers. At Star Island there is no giddy joint-passing. At this meeting, after a full day of smoking, Reilly is about as atoned as your average F-I6 pilot. Which is to say, not at all. He came to the Coptic Church in 1970, one of many disenchanted Peace Movement dropouts who found their way to the hills of Jamaica. Reilly was born and raised in Boston, son of an RCA Victor sales executive, eldest of five children, a Catholic altar boy and prep school basketball ace who wanted nothing more than to attend West Point. Instead he came to the University of Miami, didn't make the basketball team ("Rick Barry was here then," he explains ruefully) and finally left school. He became a salesman at Litton Industries, eventually starting his own data processing business. Reilly smoked his first joint at 25. Later he moved to San Francisco, dropped some acid and began experimenting with other drugs. "I've known the life of a hippie, going from rock festival to rock festival, living out of a tent," he says. "I did all that." In Kingston, Jamaica, Reilly became fascinated with the ganja men. He "confessed" his sins to the elders of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, and was adopted as one of the first white brothers. His credo became the Book of Genesis, Chapter One, verses 29-31: "And God said, Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed ...." The "herb" was marijuana. The Burning Bush was marijuana. The plants on Solomon's grave were marijuana. Everywhere in the Bible, the Coptics assert, you find pot. Question: How do you know the Bible is talking about ganja? Reilly: History. Prophecy. Reality. I never questioned that. We're talking about communion. It is divinity. Q: But how do you know the Bible isn't talking about parsley, or ragweed? Other herbs? Reilly: Is the word ganja in the Bible? No. Is the word marijuana in the Bible? No. Is the Bible a medical dictionary, or is the Bible a book of mystics and symbols and parables? In other forms the same argument has been offered by other Coptics. "What else would you substitute, if not ganja?" demanded Laurenton Dickens, a black church elder who sometimes stays at Star Island. "It is my daily bread," he says, lighting a pipe. "It is the first thing I pick up when I rise in the morning, and the last thing I lay down when I go to sleep at night." "A burnt offering," said Clifton Ray Middleton, 32, a thin white Coptic priest. It was Middleton's wife, Jacquelyn Town, who purchased the verdant Star island compound six years ago for $270,000 cash. The money was provided by a Jamaican Coptic elder, Keith Gordon. Question: Where did the money come from? Middleton: Where do any churches get any of their money? Q: Tithing? Middleton: The wealth of the Coptic Church is the wealth of the black race. Several months after this interview, Middleton and 22 others, many of them Coptics, were arrested on the coast of Maine during a waterfront bust that netted about 27 tons of marijuana. In addition, Middleton -- who has used the names Peter Sheets and Stanley Gilmore -- was one of the nine Coptics convicted of smuggling in Miami last June; he awaits sentencing in that case. Today he is serving a 30-month term for a 1972 smuggling charge. Middleton's wife and newborn daughter wait at Star Island, which pokes into Biscayne Bay from the McArthur Causeway. Things here have been quiet; the neighbors have not complained recently. The Coptics' bayfront property has a 24-hour security guard. The big swimming pool has been drained and fenced off. The Coptics have planted potatoes, papaya trees and peas in the yard. Most of their food and meat comes from farmland they own off Chrome Avenue. The first floor of the main house at Star Island is decorated with religious wall hangings; there are also books and blackboards for the Coptic children, who do not attend public school. There is a video recording center, and a Telex machine with which Reilly can communicate instantly with the Coptics' freighter in the Caribbean. In the chapel area are pianos, organs and drums. This is where the Zion Coptics chant, pray and smoke their ganja, and they did so unmolested until 1978 when it all hit the fan. The Coptics say 43 Star Island is but an embassy; the headquarters of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is in Jamaica. Although law enforcement authorities believe the church is merely a front for a massive pot-smuggling operation, the Florida Supreme Court has recognized the Coptic faith as a true religion whose doctrine stretches back 6,000 years. The exact heritage of the church, however, remains indistinct and fragmented. It was not incorporated until 1976. Its membership is debated: drug authorities say fewer than 200; Reilly says thousands. The Zion Coptics identify as their prophet Marcus Garvey, whose back-to-Africa exhortations in the 192Os gave birth to the Ethiopian Movement in Jamaica. But unlike the Rastafarians, who also believe in the ritualistic use of ganja, the Zion Coptics do not advocate the repatriation of a11 blacks to Africa. They believe the foundation of the black race is in Jamaica. The founder of the Coptic sect is said to be Louva Williams, a carpenter's son who began spreading the doctrine in Jamaica in the 1940s. It was Williams who devised the "reasoning" sessions, lengthy theological dialogues among the men of the church, accompanied always by marijuana smoking. Through Williams, the present Coptic doctrine took form. When he died in 1969, the church collapsed. Church lore has it that Williams' spirit appeared to George Baker Ivy, a young Jamaican who struggled to reassemble the scattered brethren. Ivy was the first elder to admit whites into the "camp," and in fact encouraged disaffected young Americans to come to the island and learn the ways of the ganja church. Reilly, Middleton and other young priests-to-be arrived soon afterward. "You know the last time I took a pill?" Reilly says. "I took LSD in an airplane over Cuba in 1970, on my way to Jamaica. And I met these brothers and I haven't taken an aspirin since then, haven't talked to a doctor. I was converted, I was resurrected, I was cleansed, whatever you want to call it, I found the culture of the ganja men." Reilly and his middle-class companions turned their backs on worldly "corruption" to embrace the rigorous and inflexible Coptic doctrine. The men follow the Levitican laws against cutting their hair or beards. Women have a "servile" position in the church; they must cover their hair, arms and legs at all time in public. Within the church there is no marriage ceremony: a man who sleeps with a woman simply is considered her husband for life. She is expected to "be fruitful" and have babies. On these matters, the Zion Coptic Church is intransigent. Unlike most denominations which label themselves Christian, the Coptic Church does not worship Jesus Christ in a traditional role. Rather, Coptics believe Him to be a black man, crucified not in Jerusalem but in Jamaica, in an act of racial aggression. Moreover, the Coptics believe in the concept of "Jes-us," a living God embodied within all men. Attaining this state of self-perfection requires constant prayers, and the prayers require ganja. A whole heap of ganja. The obscurity of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church ended on Nov. 28, 1977. That was the day police raided a farm in the North Florida town of Dunnellon and found 27,738 pounds of marijuana hidden in a barn and in an elaborate system of tunnels. The property belonged to one Peter Sheets, actually Clifton Middleton. Among those busted was another prominent American Coptic, an Iowa law school graduate named Carl D. Swanson. Swanson was released on bail, but he didn't stay out of trouble long. On Feb. 2, 1978, police staking out a secluded area along the Cross-Florida Barge Canal arrested Swanson and 15 other suspects during an alleged marijuana offloading operation. Nineteen tons of grass were seized, as was a 68-foot motor yacht which had been purchased by the Coptics for $225,000 cash. A Cadillac belonging to Thomas Reilly also was confiscated at the offloading site. It was the closest police would ever come to catching Brother Louv at a smuggling operation. Even more damaging to the church was the arrest at the scene of Zion Coptic elder Keith Gordon, known reverently as "Niah" to his Jamaican followers. Within a month, the Internal Revenue Service revoked the tax-exempt status of the church and socked it with a $3-million lien (still pending). Not far behind was the U.S. Customs Service, which levied a $15-million import penalty against the Coptics for failing to declare the 19 tons of grass as cargo. "If they give it back," Reilly offered good-humoredly, "we'll pay the tax." Government investigators became curious about the source of the Coptic wealth. IRS Agent Mike Marr testified that, between 1973 and 1977, church members spent $910,O00 cash on a small flotilla. The church response: Its income was legitimately derived from "substantial" holdings in Jamaica, including property, a container company, a trucking firm and an auto parts agency. One man who thought, then as now, that the church was a front for smuggling was Manny Funes, an agent for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). Reilly says Funes is "our most bitterest enemy," for it was Funes who helped the U.S. government piece together its successful case against the Coptics. "It is my opinion that they are the biggest exporters of marijuana in Jamaica," Funes says. "What we've done is not stopped them one bit, insofar as the smuggling goes. We've slowed them down ... but we haven't stopped them." As the full weight of the state and federal government came down on the Church in 1978 and 1979, the city of Miami Beach was receiving complaints from the Coptics' Star Island neighbors. The big problem was the prayer chants, at all hours of the day, and the accompanying, distinctive odor of marijuana. A Beach police raid netted $91,000 cash and a few marijuana sprouts, but public opinion was ignited most by television footage showing Coptic children toking on stogie-sized marijuana "spliffs." Curious teenagers began to gather outside the Coptic gates. The Dade State Attorney's Office asked for -- and won -- an injunction banning pot smoking at 43 Star Island. Thomas Reilly had by now christened himself Brother Louv and was conducting regular press conferences. "Have you ever heard of the attempted liquidation of a church?" he stormed. "No murder. No robbery. Just marijuana. Is that historic or not?" Said Clifton Middleton: "The ganja smokers of America are the silent majority. We will win." But the Coptics have not won much of anything so far. Although the Florida Supreme Court conceded that the Coptics' use of marijuana "is an essential portion of the religious practice," it also upheld the local ban on pot smoking at 43 Star Island. "A threat to public safety and welfare," the Court declared. Arguing that they had as much right to use marijuana as the Navajo Indians do to use peyote, church members appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Last October the High Court refused to hear the case. Dade Assistant State Attorney Arthur Berger, who represented the state, asserted that the Coptics' argument was phony: "It's like Al Capone setting up a saloon during Prohibition. Instead of calling himself a racketeer, he says, 'I'm a high priest. Come join my church.' You think he'll get converts? Hell, yes!" More bad news came to the Coptics two weeks after the High Court rebuffed them. A boat called Jubilee landed off the coast of Maine with 1,263 bales of Colombian marijuana. Middleton and several other Coptics -- six of them fugitives -- were arrested at the scene. Hemorrhaging badly from legal fees and bail demands, the Coptics did not need another multiton bust. Reilly says the Maine fiasco has already cost them more than $1 million. The trials are set for September. Question: The government says the Coptics were going to sell this stuff, that it wasn't for personal use ... was this grass going to be sold on the street? Reilly: No. Why couldn't it be for personal use? Q. But the government is going to say, 'We could see a couple hundred pounds for personal use, maybe, but not 27 tons. Reilly: Does the Catholic Church -- St. Peter's or whatever it is here -- go out and buy three quarts of wine for next Sunday, or does it buy 100 cases? Milton Ferrell, Jr. is a tall and gregarious defense lawyer, an ex-prosecutor. He genuinely likes his Coptic clients, but admits he's had easier times behind the defense table. "I represent a good many drug smugglers," Ferrell says, "and, you know they are always so grateful when I show up to help `em. 'Milton, I'll do whatever you want me to, I'll say whatever you want me to. Here, take the money. Just get me off!" "Not these people. They are proud of what they are doing. They tell the government, `Hell, yes, I've got marijuana, and I've got the right to do it.'" Besides Ferrell, the Coptics have retained a battery of top lawyers -- Ramsey Clark, former State Attorney Richard Gerstein, Murray Sams, Terry McWilliams, to name a few. The Coptics are not impressed. By and large, they despise all lawyers. Reilly says they are a necessary evil. They are most necessary because early on the morning of Nov. 20, 1979, a tow truck used by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) rammed the wrought iron gates at 43 Star Island, followed by 35 cops armed with a 15-page federal indictment. Nineteen persons, mostly Coptics, were charged with conspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act. Additionally, Reilly, Middleton and Keith Gordon were accused of conducting a continuing criminal enterprise, a huge pot-smuggling ring. One prominent Coptic not named as a defendant was Carl Swanson. He had been decapitated when a small pot-laden airplane clipped a radio tower and crashed in the Everglades in September 1979. In sweeping fashion, the U.S. government accused church members of using ships, airplanes and outright bribery to smuggle 105 tons of marijuana into the country since 1973. Included in the government's tally of tonnage -- which the Coptics say was ludicrous -- were the 19 tons from the Cross-Florida Barge Canal and the 14 tons from the barn in Dunnellon. After his arrest at Star Island, Thomas Reilly was taken in handcuffs to the federal courthouse, where he gave Miami television viewers a memorable moment. "I'm a priest, man!" he shouted to reporters over his shoulder. "Look what they're doing to a f------ priest!" January 1980. White Horses, Jamaica. "You got a light?" Daniel is a bouncy Coptic kid with hay-colored hair down to the middle of his back. Poised in his 7-year-old hand is a joint the size of a Dutch Masters. "Got a light?" he asks again, then prances away. "Some of them are real burners, laughs Alan Meyerson. "They can smoke 10 times as much as you." Meyerson is acting as tour guide at Coptic Heights, world headquarters for the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. The compound sits high in the steep hills of White Horses, an impoverished farming district 30 miles north of Kingston. From the summit, the vista in all directions is Coptic, at least 2,000 acres. "Our nation," says Meyerson, a white Coptic priest. "This is to show the world what the ganja man can do." "Where did the church get the money for this land?" "This isn't from money, this is from the labor of our hands. Do you see any money here? Money isn't the problem or solution. You might as well ask where the banana plant comes from." A Jeep tour of Coptic Heights is arranged. The driver is young Paul Toledo, late of Miami Beach, who puffs heartily on a spliff while negotiating the mountain roads with enviable certitude. On all sides is the Coptic farm: plantain, red peas, carrots, yams, pumpkins, papayas, tobacco, cane, pineapples, cocoa and peanuts. In four years the church has turned fallow land into one of the island's most productive farm communities. Coptic Heights is self-reliant, with its own reservoir, irrigation system, gas depot, generator, even its own sawmill. The lend is turned by more than a thousand workers, many non-Coptics. Above the farmlands is the church itself, a modest round structure with a slight dome beneath a luminous sign. Though the church claims thousands of black Jamaican followers, there are only about 60 in residence on the farm. Many have assigned responsibilities: the motor pool, the cattle herds, the peanut fields. Brother Alan Meyerson is not involved in such details. He is on the phone frequently to Thomas Reilly at Star Island, plotting strategy. It was Meyerson, for example, who arranged a visit by several physicians to examine Jamaican church members who have been smoking marijuana for year. Though the examinations were brief and limited, the conclusions were laudatory. Typical were the findings of Dr. Arthur Fournier, University of Miami School of Medicine: "I could determine no evidence -- on history or physical examination -- of any adverse effects on their health which could be attributed to the long-term smoking of marijuana." One of the subjects studied was the man believed by many to be the head of the whole church, Keith Gordon, "Niah" himself. It was Gordon who supposedly selected this spot as Coptic Heights, who pointed to a barren hillside and commanded his minions to dig, whereupon they unearthed the natural spring which today nourishes the Coptic valleys. Gordon sits in a deep soft chair, a shy Coptic woman on his left, awaiting orders. Like most Coptic men, Gordon carries a towel slung over one shoulder. Every now and then he pauses to hack into it. He has been smoking ganja for 33 years, and that adds up to one ferocious cough. A federal arrest warrant still awaits Gordon in Miami. He has offered to give himself up, but U.S. prosecutors have not extradited him because of a gap in Jamaican laws that essentially makes it impossible to prosecute Gordon for conspiracy here. Gordon: Dey say I bring in 20 tons. Liars. Where is it? We don't break no law. We don't commit no crimes. Two hundred fifdy dousand people march in San Francisco and call themselves gay! Ha! Dare are no indictments about dat. Why not? Question: Are you innocent of the smuggling charges? Or do you say that there is nothing wrong with ganja, and therefore you have done nothing wrong? Gordon: What dey say I do, I didn't do. And dere's nothing wrong wid ganja ... who do you tink made the herb? Q: God? Gordon: Do you tink He make someding bad for you? No. You can't f--- wid God's work. FDLE agent Manny Funes says that Keith Gordon is the brains behind the Coptics. Clifton Middleton is the organizer and Thomas Reilly is the mouthpiece. However, Kingston journalist Arthur Kitchens believes Reilly runs the whole show from Miami Beach. Although the use of ganja is as old as Jamaica, the Zion Coptic Church has not been a powerful religious movement. During one court hearing in Miami, anthropologist Tasfaye Gulilat, a member of the Ethiopian Orthodox Coptic Church, testified he had never heard of the Zion Coptics until he saw some news film on television. "We are exalted here," Meyerson says. Coptic Heights is laid out so that the road up the mountains to the main gate is clearly visible from the church and living quarters. When Jamaican police stage a raid, as they sometimes do, the Coptics can literally see them coming a mile away. By the time the cops arrive, the ganja is usually stashed out of sight. Three times a day the church members file into the tabernacle -- men in the center, women in back -- passing pipes and spliffs while children lead the Psalms and singing. The prayer sessions last hours, often into the early morning, drums keeping time. All oblations are voluntary, which becomes a significant consideration at 3 in the morning as the singing breaks like a wave over the dark Jamaican valley. If all this is really a fraud, the Coptics are going to epic lengths to preserve the charade. Even Manny Funes, who has played a large role in the Coptics' prosecution, admires their zeal. "You know, they never shaved their heads or their beards to disguise themselves, and that would have made it very difficult to identify them," he says. "That's why I think they believe in something. They believe in marijuana as a sacrament." In a few weeks, Thomas Reilly will go on trial for allegedly spearheading a conspiracy to import a mountain of marijuana in the name of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. Federal prosecutor Barbara Schwartz has not yet decided whether or not to ask for a life sentence if Reilly is convicted. "I definitely think he is a danger to the community, and to the country as a whole, with this smuggling operation," she says. On the issue of smuggling, Reilly is coy. On charges that the Coptics intended to peddle the pot they were caught with, he is adamant in his denials. "I would so much rather have a constitutional trial on the issue of ganja and our generation," Reilly says. The government would rather not. The court will likely be most interested in two subjects that the Coptics do not like to discuss: how they get their money, and how they get their marijuana. Reilly promises, "It will be a clash of light and darkness, not, 'Where were you that night?'" It would he simple for Brother Louv to shed forever the drug agents, the tax man, the prosecutors, so easy to hop a Learjet and melt safely into the hills of Jamaica with his mentor Keith Gordon. But that would prove nothing, and leave the Zion Coptic Church voiceless in the United States. So Reilly says he's prepared for jail: "I'd rather be a martyr than a fugitive." Any good priest, he explains between puffs, would do the same.

Middleton, 690 F.2d 820, 824-826 (11th Cir. 1982) United States v. Middleton, 690 F.2d 820, 824-826 (11th Cir. 1982)II. FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION  Middleton also asserts that the federal statutes prohibiting the importation and possession of marijuana, as applied in this case, violate the free exercise clause of the first amendment of the United States Constitution.  In support of this assertion, Middleton argues that he is a dedicated member of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, that this church is a religion within the meaning of the first amendment, and that the use of marijuana is an essential part of his religious practice.  In order to succeed, the defendant must prove both that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a religion within the meaning of the first amendment and that the statutes in question do not serve a compelling governmental interest.  The defendant argues that the strict daily regimen of the Coptic community in Jamaica and its focus on prayer services in which marijuana is an essential element conclusively demonstrate that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a religion within the protections of the first amendment.  Assuming without deciding that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a religion within the amendment's protections, [Footnote 2.  Although we express no view as to whether the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a religion for purposes of first amendment analysis, we note that other courts have held that any belief that is "arguably religious" is generally accorded protection, provided that the adherent is sincere in his belief and acts upon this belief in good faith.  Compare International Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Barber, 650 F.2d 430 (2d Cir. 1981) with United States v. Kuch, 288 F. Supp. 439 (D.D.C. 1968).] we hold that any interest of the defendant protected by the free exercise clause is outweighed by the compelling governmental interest in regulating and controlling the use of marijuana and its distribution in the United States.  The free exercise clause "embraces two concepts, - freedom to believe and freedom to act.  The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be.  Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society."  Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303-04 (1940).  The Supreme Court has emphasized on numerous occasions that actions and practices are not absolutely protected from governmental regulation merely because the actor classifies these actions as "religious."  See, e.g., United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252 (1982) (social security taxes may be constitutionally imposed on persons who object on religious grounds to the payment of taxes to support public insurance funds); Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333 (1890); Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145 (1878).  In Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), the Supreme Court reversed the conviction of an Amish farmer who had been convicted of violating Wisconsin's compulsory school attendance law.  The Court recognized the interest of the state regarding basic education, but held that the state interest is "not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on fundamental rights and interests, such as those specifically protected by the free exercise clause of the first amendment ...."  Id. at 214.  "The essence of all that has been said and written on the subject is that only those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion."  Id. at 215.  The Court examined the Amish's interest in maintaining its community structure and the state's interests in preparing citizens for effective and intelligent participation in society.  The Court then concluded that the state interests would not be sufficiently advanced by requiring Amish school children, who were enrolled until the completion of a basic education, to attend school for an additional two years.  Id. at 222. [Footnote 3.  [T]he value of all education must be assessed in terms of its capacity to prepare the child for life.  It is one thing to say that compulsory education for a year or two beyond the eighth grade may be necessary when its goal is the preparation of the child for life in modern society as the majority live, but it is quite another if the goal of education be viewed as the preparation of the child for life in the separated agrarian community that is the keystone of the Amish faith.  Id.] Middleton urges that the court analogize between the structure of the Amish and Coptic communities and that Yoder therefore should control our disposition of the case at bar.  However, even if we assume that such an analogy is proper (a contention upon which the court expresses no opinion), we find a difference in the nature of the governmental interests involved in the two cases.  Unlike the state interest advanced in Yoder, the interest advanced by the government in the case at bar is compelling and would be substantially harmed by a decision allowing members of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church to possess marijuana freely.  Congress has strongly and clearly expressed its intent to protect the public from the obvious danger of drugs and drug traffic.  See 21 U.S.C. � 801(2) (1976).  Unquestionably, Congress can constitutionally control the use of drugs that it determines to be dangerous, even if those drugs are to be used for religious purposes.  United States v. Hudson, 431 F.2d 468, 469 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1011 (1971) ("the use of drugs as part of religious practice is not constitutionally privileged"); Native American Church of New York v. United States, 468 F. Supp. 1247 (S.D.N.Y. 1979), aff'd, 633 F.2d 205 (2d Cir. 1980); Randall v. Wyrick, 441 F. Supp. 312 {W.D. Mo. 1977); United States v. Kuch, 288 F. Supp. 439 (D.D.C. 1968).  Extended to its logical conclusion, appellant's argument would protect all drugs, not just marijuana, if any religious group chose to use them as a religious sacrament.  As this court noted in Leary v. United States, 383 F.2d 851 (5th Cir. 1967), rev'd on other grounds, 395 U.S. 6 (1969), both the fact of legislation and the severity of the penalties provided in statutes such as the one in question, clearly evidence "the grave concern of Congress" in controlling the use of drugs.  Id. at 859.  Moreover, the harm of the particular drug in question is not relevant in determining the degree of protection afforded by the free exercise clause to the defendant's actions.  Congress had demonstrated beyond doubt that it believes that marihuana is  an evil in American society and a serious threat to its people.  It would  be difficult to imagine the harm which would result if the criminal  statutes against marihuana were nullified as to those who claim the right  to possess and traffic in this drug for religious purposes.  For all  practical purposes the anti-marihuana laws would be meaningless, and  enforcement impossible.  The danger is too great, especially to the youth  of the nation ... for this court to yield to the argument that the use of  marihuana for so-called religious purposes should be permitted under the  Free Exercise Clause.  We will not, therefore, subscribe to the dangerous  doctrine that the free exercise of religion accords an unlimited freedom  to violate the laws of the land relative to marihuana.Id. at 860-61.  We cannot agree that the free exercise clause embodies the type of protection urged by the defendant in view of the clearly articulated and compelling governmental interests in regulating the possession and distribution of drugs.  In support of his argument, Middleton analogizes to various state court decisions which have held that the use of peyote by the Native American Church is constitutionally protected.  This Court, however, remains bound by the Leary precedent and is not bound by these state court decisions.  In view of all of these factors, this court cannot agree with the defendant's argument that his possession of marijuana is constitutionally protected under the first amendment.United States v. Middleton, 690 F.2d 820, 824-826 (11th Cir. 1982).WT01-B19-9IA087-000632-B044-121http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/COPTIC/cir-1st.html 206.61.184.43 19970122072756 text/html 8841HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:27:50 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:07:19 GMTContent-length: 8626 United States v.

FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE AND EQUAL PROTECTION  Appellants claim that they were denied the opportunity to assert a valid, legally sufficient defense based on the free exercise clause of the first amendment. [Footnote 29.  "Congress shall make no law ... prohibiting the free exercise [of religion) ...."  U.S. Const. amend. I.]  For purposes of this case the government stipulated to the following facts, which we assume, without deciding, are true:  1) that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a religion embracing beliefs  which are protected by the First Amendment; 2) that the use of marijuana  is an integral part of the religious practice of the Church; and 3) that  [all of the defendants] are members of the Church and sincerely embrace  the beliefs of the Church.On November 23, 1982, the district court ruled as a matter of law that the first amendment did not protect the possession of marijuana with intent to distribute by the defendants, and further ordered that the defendants be precluded from introducing at trial any evidence concerning the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church and the use of marijuana by its members, insofar as such evidence related to their alleged first amendment defense. [Footnote 30.  The ruling was carefully tailored to exclude evidence only in relation to the first amendment defense; at trial, two defense witnesses were permitted to testify as to the quantity and methods of marijuana consumption by Church members in support of the Swiderski defense discussed in part IV.]  It is well established that the absolute constitutional protection afforded freedom of religious belief does not extend without qualification to religious conduct.  Braunfield v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 603 (1961); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940).  When a law is challenged as interfering with religious conduct, the constitutional inquiry involves three questions: (a) whether the challenged law interferes with free exercise of a religion; (b) whether the challenged law is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental objective; and (c) whether accommodating the religious practice would unduly interfere with fulfillment of the governmental interest.  See United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 256-59 (1982).  In light of the government's stipulations, the first limb of the Lee standard is clearly met; there is no question that marijuana use is an integral part of the religious doctrine and practice of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, and that appellants are sincere practicing members of that Church.  The conflict with the criminal sanctions against possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is self-evident.  The question whether the government has an overriding interest in controlling the use and distribution of marijuana by private citizens is a topic of continuing political controversy.  Much evidence has been adduced from which it might rationally be inferred that marijuana constitutes a health hazard and a threat to social welfare; on the other hand, proponents of free marijuana use have attempted to demonstrate that it is quite harmless.  See Randall v. Wyrick, 441 F. Supp. 312, 315-16 (W.D. Mo. 1977); United States v. Kuch, 288 F. Supp. 439, 446 & 448 (D.D.C. 1968).  In enacting substantial criminal penalties for possession with intent to distribute, Congress has weighed the evidence and reached a conclusion which it is not this court's task to review de novo.  Every federal court that has considered the matter, so far as we are aware, has accepted the congressional determination that marijuana in fact poses a real threat to individual health and social welfare, and has upheld the criminal sanctions for possession and distribution of marijuana even where such sanctions infringe on the free exercise of religion.   United States v. Middleton, 690 F.2d 820, 825 (11th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1051 (1983); United States v. Spears, 443 F.2d 895 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1020 (1972); Leary v. United States, 383 F.2d 851, 859-61 (5th Cir. 1967), rev'd on other grounds 395 U.S. 6 (1969); Randall, 441 F. Supp. at 316 & n. 2; Kuch, 288 F. Supp. at 448.  Only last year, the Eleventh Circuit rejected identical claims raised by some of the very appellants before us in this case, see Middleton, 690 F.2d 820, and the United States Supreme Court denied review.  We decline to second-guess the unanimous precedent establishing an overriding governmental interest in regulating marijuana.  Finally, it has been recognized since Leary that accomodation of religious freedom is practically impossible with respect to the marijuana laws:    Congress has demonstrated beyond doubt that it believes marihuana is an  evil in American society and a serious threat to its people.  It would be  difficult to imagine the harm which would result if the criminal  sanctions against marihuana were nullified as to those who claim the  right to possess and traffic in this drug for religious purposes.  For  all practical purposes the anti-marihuana laws would be meaningless, and  enforcement impossible.Leary,383 F.2d at 861, quoted in Middleton, 690 F.2d at 825; see also Kuch, 288 F. Supp. at 447.  Although a narrow administrative exception has been carved out from the Schedule I classification of peyote for the benefit of the Native American Church, see 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31, we think this exemption is properly viewed as a government "effort toward accommodation" for a "readily identifiable, narrow catagory" which has minimal impact on the enforcement of the laws in question.  Lee, 455 U.S. at 260 n. 11 & 261.  No broad religious exemption from the marijuana laws is constitutionally required.  We therefore affirm the district court's ruling rejecting appellants' first amendment defense as a matter of law.  We reject as well appellants' claim that members of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church are entitled as a matter of equal protection to a religious exemption from the marijuana laws on the same terms as the peyote exemption granted the Native American Church.  Marijuana is not covered by the peyote exemption; this in itself distinguishes this case from Kennedy v. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, 459 F.2d 415 (9th Cir, 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1115 (1973).  Moreover, the peyote exemption is uniquely supported by the legislative history and congressional findings underlying the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, which declares a federal policy of "protecting] and preserv[ing] for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express and exercise the[ir] traditional religions including but not limited to access to sites, use and possession of sacred objects, and the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites."  42 U.S.C. � 1996.  The legislative history of the Act "is clear in finding that religion is an integral part of Indian culture and that the use of such items as peyote are necessary to the survival of Indian religion and culture."  Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Smith, 556 F. Supp. 632, 637 (N.D. Tex. 1983).  In light of the sui generis legal status of American Indians, see Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 1, 16-17 (1831) (Marshall, C.J.), and the express policy of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (which was passed after Kennedy was decided), we think the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church cannot be deemed similarly situated to the Native American Church for equal protection purposes.United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497, 511-513 (1st Cir. 1984).WT01-B19-10IA087-000632-B044-148http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/COPTIC/court-ia.html 206.61.184.43 19970122072812 text/html 4887HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:28:05 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:07:12 GMTContent-length: 4672 State v.

Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him of unlawful possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, a violation of Iowa Code section 204.401(1).  AFFIRMED.  Carl Eric Olsen, Miami Beach, Florida, pro se.  James R. Cook of Cook & Waters, Des Moines, on the brief.  Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, Joseph P. Weeg, Assistant Attorney General, and Stephen J. Petersen, County Attorney, for appellee.  Considered by Reynoldson, C.J., and Uhlenhopp, Larson, Schultz, and Wolle, JJ.PER CURIAM.  Defendant, Carl Eric Olsen, appeals from a judgment convicting him of unlawful possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, a violation of Iowa Code section 204.401(1).  This case was before us in State v. Olsen, 293 N.W.2d 216 (Iowa), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 993 (1980), in which we reversed and remanded when a State's witness was permitted to testify beyond the scope of the minutes of testimony.  Following his conviction on a second trial, defendant again appeals and we affirm.  Olsen admits that when stopped by the West Liberty police in May of 1978, he was transporting 129 pounds of marijuana and $10,915 in cash.  His sole defense is that his possession and use of marijuana are protected by the first amendment's guarantee of religious freedom.  Olsen is a member and priest of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. Testimony at his trial revealed the bona fide nature of this religious organization and the sacramental use of marijuana within it.  Testimony also revealed church members use marijuana continuously and publicly, commencing at an early age.  Olsen admitted to smoking marijuana while driving and to using the drug a few hours before testifying in his second trial. Nonetheless, he asks us on this appeal to afford his religious use of marijuana unlimited constitutional protection.  I.  This court dealt at length with Olsen's first amendment claim in State v. Olsen, 315 N.W.2d 1, 7-9 (Iowa 1982), a case involving this defendant but based on a different automobile stop and arrest.  We find no reason to retreat from our holding there that "[a] compelling state interest sufficient to override Olsen's free exercise clause argument is demonstrated in this case."  In fact, since our last Olsen decision, we have been joined in our analysis by yet another court, see Whyte v. United States, 471 A.2d 1018 (D.C. 1984).  Olsen now contends we must make an independent finding of a compelling state interest rather than defer to the legislature's decision to regulate marijuana.  The cases do not support Olsen's assertion.  See Leary v. United States, 383 F.2d 851, 860-61 (5th Cir. 1967), rev'd on other grounds, 395 U.S. 6 (1969); Whyte, 471 A.2d at 1021; State v. Rocheleau, 451 A.2d 1144, 1148 (Vt. 1982).  II.  Defendant also raises an equal protection challenge, based on the legislative exemption granted the peyote ceremonies of the Native American Church.  See Iowa Code � 204.204(8) (1983).  This statutory exemption maybe derived from the California Supreme Court's decision in People v.Woody, 394 P.2d 813 (Cal. 1964).  The Woody court noted in granting the prosecution exemption that peyote was use only in a desert enclosure and only during a special Saturday sundown to Sunday sunrise ceremony.  The participants were fed breakfast at the close of the ceremony and were kept isolated from the general population until the drug's effects had dissipated.  Defendant can point to no such safeguards in the Coptic Church's indiscriminate use of marijuana; the drug is smoked publicly and continuously and made available to church members regardless of age or occupation.  These significant distinctions render meritless defendant's equal protection argument.  We affirm the judgment of the district court.  AFFIRMED.State v.

Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit Judge BUCKLEY.       RUTH BADER GINSBURG, Circuit Judge:       Petitioner in this case seeks a religious-use exemption from federal  laws proscribing marijuana.  We hold that the first amendment's free  exercise of religion guarantee does not require the requested exemption,  and that petitioner was not denied equal protection-establishment clause  rights by the government's refusal to accommodate his church's sacramental  use of marijuana.                                       I.       Petitioner Olsen is a member and priest of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic  Church.  While the church is alleged to have several thousand members in  Jamaica, it has never had more than between 100 and 200 members in the  United States.  Olsen assets, and the government concedes for purposes of  this case, that the church's sacrament is marijuana; under church  teachings, marijuana is combined with tobacco and smoked "continually all  day, through church services, through everything we do."  State v. Olsen,  315 N.W.2d 1, 7 (Iowa 1982) (quoting Olsen's testimony).  Olsen and his  fellows have been convicted several times in federal and state courts of  various marijuana offenses, including importation of twenty tons of the  drug, and first amendment challenges to these convictions have been  uniformly rejected.  See Olsen v. Iowa, 808 F.2d 652 (8th Cir.1986); United  States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497 (1st Cir.1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1004,  105 S.Ct. 1355, 84 L.Ed.2d  378 (1985); United States v.

The federal convictions were based on the Controlled Substarces Act,  21 U.S.C. �� 801-904 (1982), which lists marijuana as a "Schedule I"  controlled substance with a "high potential for abuse."  Id. � 812(b)(1)(A)  & (c).  Between 1983 and 1985, Olsen several times petitioned the Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA), which administers the Act, for an  exemption permitting his church's sacramental use of marijuana.  Olsen  maintained that such an exemption is required by the first amendment's  guarantee of the free exercise of religion.  He further urged, under an  establishment clause-equal protection rubric, that his church is entitled  to an exemption similar to that granted by federal regulation to the Native  American Church for its sacramental'use of peyote.  See 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31  (1987).       In an effort to prompt a response from the DEA, Olsen unsuccessfully  sued in the Eleventh Circuit to compel agency action.  Olsen v. DEA, 776  F.2d 267 (llth Cir.1985) (affirming district court's dismissal of 01sen's  complaint), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1030, 106 S.Ct. 1236, 89 L.Ed.2d 344  (1986).  Thereafter, in January 1986, Olsen petitioned the U.S. District  Court for the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus, and that court,  in March 1986, directed the DEA to show cause why the writ should not  issue.  In April 1986, in a three-paragraph letter ruling, the DEA denied  01sen's petitions; the letter reported the DEA's conclusion that "the  immensity of the marijuana abuse problem," and the correspondingly  "compelling governmental interest" in controlling trafficking in and use of  the substance, "outweighed" the church's interest in access to marijuana.   Letter from John C. Lawn, DEA Administrator, to Carl Eric Olsen (Apr. 22,  1986).  The district court then dismissed Olsen's mandamus petition as  moot.      Olsen, acting pro se, both petitioned this court for review of the  DEA's decision, and appealed from the district court's dismissal of his  mandamus petition.  In February 1460 878 FEDERAL REPORTER, 2d SERIES  1988, this court, on its own motion, directed appointment of members of the  law firm of Hogan and Hartson to serve as amicus curiae "to address those  issues raised by [Olsen] and any other issues appropriate for the court's  consideration in this case." [footnote 1]  After amicus filed a brief, the  DEA moved to remand the matter for renewed agency consideration.  In April  1988, we authorized further agency proceedings and instructed the DEA to  supplement the record and return it with a final order by July 29, 1988.   On remand, amicus presented 01sen's proposal for a "restrictive religious  exemption" that would include the following limitations:     --Church members would be restricted    to using marijuana during their Saturday    evening prayer ceremony, which lasts    from 8:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m.;     --During that ceremony, and for the    eight hours following that ceremony,    Church members would not leave the    place where the ceremony is conducted;    they would not drive automobiles or oth-    erwise go out in public;     --Ingestion of marijuana would be limit-    ed to Church members who had reached    the age of majority, according to the    laws of the state in which the ceremony    takes place;     --Ingestion of marijuana would be limit-    ed to full Church members who had un-    dergone the confession ritual for enter-    ing the Church's community....  Memorandum of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in Support and on Behalf of  Petitioner Carl E. Olsen at 29-30 (submitted to DEA on remand).       On July 29, 1988, the DEA issued its Final Order, reaffirming its  denial of 01sen's exemption requests.  That order, which we set out in full  as an Appendix to this opinion, first disclaimed statutory authority to  grant the exemption.  According to the DEA, Congress intended no religious- use exemption from Controlled Substances Act proscriptions other than the  peyote-use permission granted the Native American Church.  Next, the DEA as  sumed, in order to rule completely, that it had authority to consider  Olsen's exemption petition.  It further accepted, for purposes of its  decision, that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a bona fide religion  with marijuana as its sacrament.  The agency then rejected Olsen's free  exercise claim, concluding that the government has a compelling interest in  the regulation of controlled substances and that accommodation to religious  use of drugs is not required.  Final Order, infra pp. 1466-1467.       The DEA also rejected Olsen's establishment clause-equal protection  plea, stating why, on the matter in controversy, it deemed the Ethiopian  Zion Coptic Church not similarly situated to the Native American Church.   Id. p. 1467.  First, Olsen's church "advocates the continuous use of  marijuana or 'ganja', while the Native American Church's use of peyote is  isolated to specific ceremonial occasions."  Id.  Second, the DEA reasoned:  "[W]hile peyote and marijuana are both Schedule I controlled substances  with a defined high potential for abuse, the actual abuse and availability  of marijuana in the United States is many times more pervasive ... than  that of peyote."  Id. p. 1467 (emphasis added).  Third, the DEA noted that  Olsen was convicted in Rush for importing twenty tons of marijuana, "an  outrageous quantity to supply [his church's] religious needs."  Id.  The  DEA also rejected 01sen's proposal to restrict usage, saying monitoring  compliance would be "impractical."  Id. p. 1468.       The DEA's July 1988 Final Order is now before this court for review.  [footnote 2]                                      II.       The DEA initially asserted in its July 1988 Final Order that Congress  had given  ____________________  [footnote 1]   William A. Bradford, Jr. and Steven J. Routh    were appointed and filed briefs in support of    Olsen's position, with the assistance of Emily E.    Moskowitz.  Mr. Routh appeared on Olsen's be-    half at oral argument.  The court commends    appointed counsel for work of excellent quality    and service in the best tradition of the bar.  [footnote 2]   Because the DEA completely responded to 01-    sen's exemption petition in its Final Order, we    hold that 01sen's petition for mandamus to    compel a response is now moot. 1461 OLSEN v. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMIN. Cite as 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1989)  the agency no authority to grant the exemption Olsen sought.  Apart from  permitting legitimate medical and scientific or research use, the DEA  maintained, Congress intended no exemption other than the one, supported in  the legislative history of the Controlled Substances Act, for the Native  American Church.  Final Order, infra p. 1466.  This argument did not figure  in the DEA's original denial of Olsen's petitions; the agency's April 1986  letter ruling, we note, responded immediately and directly to the merits of  Olsen's request.       The DEA's contention that Congress directed the Administrator  automatically to turn away all churches save one opens a grave  constitutional question.  A statutory exemption authorized for one church  alone, and for which no other church may qualify, presents a  "denominational preference" not easily reconciled with the establishment  clause.  See Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 245, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 1683-84,  72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982); cf. infra pp. 1463-1464.  We resist an interpretation  dissonant with the "cardinal principle" that legislation should be  construed, if "fairly possible," to avoid a constitutional confrontation.   See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 348, 56 S.Ct. 466, 483, 80 L.Ed. 688  (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).       Furthermore, we recognize that even if the DEA were not empowered or  obliged to act, Olsen would be entitled to a judicial audience.   Ultimately, the Courts cannot escape the obligation to address his plea  that the exemption he seeks is mandated by the first amendment's religion  clauses.  See Peyote Way Church of God v. Smith, 742 F.2d 193 (5th  Cir.1984) (upholding church's standing to seek a declaratory judgment that  denying church access to peyote is unconstitutional).  We are aided in this  task of judicial review by the consideration given the matter, in the first  instance, by the expert administrator.       In sum, for purposes of this case, we accept the position that  Congress did not strip the DEA of authority to rule on the merits of  Olsen's petitions, [footnote 3] and we turn to the questions whether the  free exercise of religion clause or the equal protection principle (coupled  with the establishment clause) commands the exemption Olsen seeks.                                      III.       Olsen's free exercise claim has been raised, considered, and rejected  in the context of criminal proceedings.  See Olsen v. Iowa, 808 F.2d at  653; Rush, 738 F.2d at 512-13; Middleton, 690 F.2d at 824-26; State v.  Olsen, 315 N.W.2d at 7-9; Town v. State ex rel. Reno, 377 So.2d at 650-51.   We agree, substantially, with those dispositions, and therefore need not  treat the issue expansively.       [1]  It is familiar doctrine that the free exercise clause "embraces  two concepts,-- freedom to believe and freedom to act.  The first is  absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be.  Conduct  remains subject to regulation for the protection of society."  Cantwell v.  Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303-04, 60 S.Ct. 900, 903, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940).   As the Supreme Court recently restated:     [T]he Court has rejected challenges un-    der the Free Exercise Clause to govern-    mental regulation of certain overt acts    prompted by religious beliefs or princi-    ples, for "even when the action is in    accord with one's religious convictions,    [it] is not totally free from legislative    restrictions."  Braunfeld v. Brown, 366    U.S. 599, 603, 81 S.Ct. 1144, 1146, 6 L.Ed.    2d 563 (1961).  The conduct or actions so    regulated have invariably posed some    substantial threat to public safety, peace    or order.  See, e.g., Reynolds v. United    States, 98 U.S. 145, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1879)    [upholding ban on polygamy]; Jacobson    v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 25 S.Ct.    358, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905) [compulsory vac-    cination law]; Pnnce v. Massachusetts,  ____________________  [footnote 3]   But see Olsen v. DEA, 776 F.2d 267 (11th    Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1030, 106 S.Ct.    1236, 89 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986) (while the DEA is    obliged to respond to all exemption petitions,    religious exemption for marijuana use falls out-    side the scope of 21 U.S.C. � 811).  Subsequent    to this Eleventh Circuit decision, 01sen broad-    ened beyond 21 U.S.C. � 811 the bases of his    exemption claim.  See Reply Brief of Court-Ap-    pointed Amicus Curiae at 7 n. 5. 1462 878 FEDERAL REPORTER, 2d SERIES     321 U.S. 158, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645    (1944) [child labor law]; Cleveland v.    United States, 329 U.S. 14, 67 S.Ct. 13,    91 L.Ed. 12 (1946) [application of Mann    Act to religiously motivated polygamy].  Employment Division v. Smith, 485 U.S. 660, 108 S.Ct. 1444, 1450 n. 13, 99  L.Ed.2d 753 (1988) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 403, 83 S.Ct.  1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963)).       [2]  In appraising laws alleged to constrain religious conduct, the  Supreme Court has instructed lower courts to consider: (a) whether the law  interferes with the free exercise of sincere religious belief; (b) whether  the law is essential to accomplish an overriding governmental objective;  and (c) whether accommodating the religious conduct would unduly interfere  with fulfillment of the governmental interest.  See United States v. Lee,  455 U.S. 252, 256-59, 102 S.Ct. 1051, 1054-56, 71 L.Ed.2d 127 (1982); Rush,  738 F.2d at 512.  The first two factors stated in Lee are not contested in  this case.  The DEA, "[f]or purposes of this decision ... accepts that the  Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a bona fide religion whose sacrament is  marijuana."  Final Order, infra p. 1466.  And "Olsen does not dispute the  government's compelling interest in controlling the distribution and drug-  related use of marijuana," Brief of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae at 18.   Indeed, "[e]very federal court that has considered the matter, so far as we  are aware, has accepted the congressional determination that marijuana in  fact poses a real threat to individual health and social welfare."  Rush,  738 F.2d at 512.       [3]  The pivotal issue, therefore, is whether marijuana usage by Olsen  and other members of his church can be accommodated without undue  interference with the government's interest in controlling the drug.  Three  circuits have so far considered pleas for religious exemption from the  marijuana laws; each has rejected the argument that accommodation to  sacramental use of the drug is feasible and therefore required.  Rush, 738  F.2d at 513 (First Circuit); Olsen v. Iowa, 808 F.2d at 653 (Eighth  Circuit); Middleton, 690 F.2d at 825 (Eleventh Circuit).  We have no reason  to doubt that these courts have accurately gauged the Highest Court's  pathmarks in this area.       Olsen refers to his proposal for restrictive use, see supra p. 1460,  and claims that this case is now differently contoured than earlier ones.   Even if the government is not required to accommodate to the extent of  allowing a broad religious exemption, he argues, it can and must  accommodate to the time- and place-specific use he has proposed.  Because  the tenets of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church endorse marijuana use every  day throughout the day, however, Olsen's proposal for confined use would  not be self-enforcing.  It is hardly unreasonable to forecast a large  monitoring burden in light of evidence that in years past, the church's  "[c]hecks on distribution of cannabis to nonbelievers in the faith [were]  minimal," there was "easy access to cannabis for a child who had absolutely  no interest in learning the religion," and "[m]embers [partook] of cannabis  anywhere, not just within the confines of a church facility."  Town v.  State ex rel. Reno, 377 So.2d at 649, 651.       Critically, Olsen's proposal would require the government to make  supplies of marijuana available to Olsen's church on a regular basis.  See  Reply Brief of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae at 7, 17.  We are unaware of  any "free exercise" precedent for compelling government accommodation of  religious practices when that accommodation requires burdensome and  constant official supervision and management.  Cf. Wissconsin v. Yoder, 406  U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) (religious exemption from  compulsory school law at issue imposed no toll on the state); Sherbert v.  Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) (payment of  unemployment compensation to person fired for refusing to work on Saturday  Sabbath required no administrative mechanism other than the one already in  place); Leahy v. District of Columbia, 833 F.2d 1046, 1049 n. 6  (D.C.Cir.1987) (noting plaintiff Leahy's observation that government could  readily accommodate religious objection to use of 1463 OLSEN v. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMIN. Cite as 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1989)  social security number in driver's license application, "for the city  already had in place an alternate system of numbers, used for issuing  diplomatic driver's licenses"). [footnote 4]       In sum, we conclude that the DEA cannot accommodate Olsen's religious  use of marijuana without unduly burdening or disrupting enforcement of the  federal marijuana laws.  We therefore hold that the free exercise clause  does not compel the DEA to grant Olsen an exemption immunizing his church  from prosecution for illegal use of marijuana.                                      IV.       [4]  In addition to the argument that the free exercise clause  requires government accommodation to sacramental use of marijuana by  members of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, Olsen asserts an establishment  clause-equal protection challenge.  He maintains that members of his church  are entitled to a religious exemption from the marijuana laws on the same  terms as the peyote exemption granted the Native American Church.  See 21  C.F.R. � 1307.31 ("The listing of peyote as a controlled substance in  Schedule I does not apply to the nondrug use of peyote in bona fide  religious ceremonies of the Native American Church, and members of the  Native American Church so using peyote are exempt from registration.").   Olsen has urged before that members of his church are similarly situated to  the beneficiaries of the exemption prescribed in 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31.  See  Olsen v. Iowa, 808 F.2d at 653; Rush, 738 F.2d at 513.  We join our sister  courts in rejecting this plea.  Indeed, had the DEA timely objected, we  might have held the issue precluded.  See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS  � 27 (1982). [footnote 5]       The DEA has cogently explained why a tightly-cabined exemption for  peyote use in a religious rite need not mean that religious use of  marijuana (or any other widely used controlled substance) must be  accommodated:     [T]he actual abuse and availability of    marijuana in the United States is many    times more pervasive ... than that of    peyote....  The amount of peyote seized    and analyzed by the DEA between 1980    and 1987 was 19.4 pounds.  The amount    of marijuana seized and analyzed by the    DEA between 1980 and 1987 was 15,302,-    468.7 pounds.  This overwhelming differ-    ence explains why an accommodation can    be made for a religious organization    which uses peyote in circumscribed cere-    monies, and not for a religion which es-    pouses continual use of marijuana.  Final Order, infra p. 1467.       We agree that the vast difference in demand for marijuana on the one  hand and  ____________________   [footnote 4]   Amicus cites the permission for medical and    scientific research use of marijuana ae evidence    that a religious accommodation can be arranged    without undue burden to the government.  See    Brief of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae at 7-9,    21.  We think the tightly-drawn, closed system    for access to controlled substances by, or on the    order of, medical doctors and researchers can-    not tenably be compared to the permission    sought here.  Government may a1low use of    marijuana in programs to lessen the negative    side-effects of chemotherapy and to treat glau-    coma, for example, without thereby opening the    way to licenses for the use of marijuana by the    healthy.        Amicus also cites the peyote exemption ac-    corded the Native American Church as afford-    ing "reason ... to believe that a workable ac-    commodation exists in this case."  Id. at 21.    This argument is addressed infra in the context    of Olsen's establishment clause-equa1 protection    claim.   [footnote 5]   The dissent describes Olsen as choosing "an    Establishment Clase battleground" in prefer-    ence to an equal protection one.  Dissent at    1468.  01sen's own petitions to the DEA, how-    ever, featured equal protection.  See Brief of    Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae at App. 7, 19 ("I    would like you to respond to the issue of equal    protection....  Why are you discriminating    against my religion by denying the same bene-    fits which are given to the sacramenta1 uses of    peyote and wine?").  Court-appointed amicus    curiae, it is true, did put the comparison with    the Native American Church uder an etablish-    ment clause heading, drawing strength from    the Supreme Court's characterization in Larson    v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72    L.Ed.2d 33 (1982).        We do not believe the label consequential.  As    court-appointed amicus recognized, in cases of    this character, establishment clause and equal    protection analysis converge.  See Walz v. Tax    Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664, 694, 696, 90 S.Ct. 1409,    1425, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) (Opinion of Harlan,    J.) (estblishment clause requirement of neu-    trality "in its application requires equal pro-    tection mode of analysis"). 1464 878 FEDERAL REPORTER, 2d SERIES  peyote on the other warranted the DEA's response to Olsen's petition.  Were  the DEA to consider a marijuana exemption, equal protection (and/or the  establishment clause, see supra note 5) would indeed appear to command that  it do so evenhandedly.  See Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 102 S.Ct.  1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982); cf. Kennedy v. Bureau of Narcotics and  Dangerous Drugs, 459 F.2d 415 (9th Cir. 1972) (petitioning church not  entitled to peyote-use exemption that leaves nonexempt other churches that  use peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1115,  93 S.Ct. 901, 34 L.Ed. 2d 699 (1973).  The DEA would have no warrant to  contain the exemption to a single church or religion.  See, e.g., Randall  v. Wyrick, 441 F.Supp. 312 (W.D.Mo.1977) (Aquarian Brotherhood Church);  Whyte v. United States, 471 A.2d 1018, 1020 (D.C.1984) (Rastafarians);   State v. Rocheleau, 142 Vt. 61, 451 A.2d 1144, 1148-49 (1982)  (practitioners of Tantric Buddhism).        [5]  Even if we were to credit Olsen's equal protection argument or  the dissent's portrayal of it in terms of the establishment clause, the  remedy Olsen requests hardly follows.  Faced with the choice between  invalidation and extension of any controlled-substances religious  exemption, which would the political branches choose?  It would take a  court bolder than this one to predict, as our dissenting colleague appears  to suggest, that extension, not invalidation, would be the probable choice.   Compare Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76, 89-93, 99 S.Ct. 2655, 2663-65,  61 L.Ed. 2d 382 (1979) (majority opinion) with id. at 94-96 (Powell, J.,  dissenting).  See generally Miller, Constitutional Remedies for Under- inclusive Statutes: A Critical Appraisal of Heckler v. Mathews, 20 HARV.  C.R.-C.L. L.REV. 79 (1985); Ginsburg, Some Thoughts on Judicial Authority  to Repair Unconstitutional Legislation, 28 CLEVE.ST.L.REV. 301 (1979).        While we rest our decision on the immensity of the marijuana control  problem in the United States, we note some further distinctions.  The  peyote exemption was accorded to the Native American Church for a  traditional, precisely circumscribed ritual.  In that ritual, the peyote  itself is an object of worship; for members of the Native American Church,  use of peyote outside the ritual is sacrilegious.  See People v. Woody, 61  Cal.2d 716, 40 Cal Rptr. 69, 73, 394 P.2d 813, 817 (1964).  Thus the  church, for all purposes other than the special, stylized ceremony,  reinforced the state's prohibition.  In contrast, the Ethiopian Zion Coptic  Church, as earlier observed, teaches that marijuana is properly smoked  "continually all day," as Olsen himself stated, "through everything that we  do."  State v. Olsen, 315 N.W.2d at 7; see also Town v. State ex rel. Reno,  377 So.2d at 649.  True, for purposes of the exemption requested, Olsen  narrowed the permission he sought to track the one accorded the Native  American Church.  See Memorandum of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in  Support and on Behalf of Petitioner Carl E. Olsen at 29-30 (submitted to  DEA on remand).  But "narrow" use, concededly, is not his religion's  tradition.        We mention too--but express no opinion concerning--the view of the  First Circuit that the peyote exemption is bound up with the federal policy  of preserving Native American culture, and thus can be comprehended  properly only "[i]n light of the sui generis legal status of American  Indians."  Rush, 738 F.2d at 513; accord Peyote Way Church of God v. Meese,  698 F.Supp. 1342, 1346-49 (N.D.Tex.1988) (Native American Church is "the  only one of its own kind" and exemption afforded it since 1965 "cannot be  expanded to include non-Native American Church use of peyote"), appeal  filed, Dec. 22, 1988; United States v. Warner, 595 F.Supp. 595, 600-01  (D.N.D.1984) (exemption for Native American Church is tied to fulfillment  of "government's unique obligation" to preserve Indian culture).  Contra  Native American Church of New York v. United States, 468 F.Supp. 1247  (S.D.N.Y.1979) (peyote exemption must be made available to another church  if in fact it similarly uses peyote for sacramental purposes), aff'd mem.,  633 F.2d 205 (2d Cir.1980).      In sum, assuming arguendo the legitimacy of an exemption for religious  use of 1465 OLSEN v. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMIN. Cite as 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1989)  peyote, [footnote 6] we are persuaded that the Executive was not obliged by  the Constitution to spread that exemption to church-users of marijuana.                                    CONCLUSION        For the reasons stated, in No. 86-1442 we deny Olsen's petition for  review and affirm on the merits the DEA's July 1988 Final Order; and in No.  86-5455 we declare Olsen's petition for a writ of mandamus moot and  properly dismissed on that basis.        It is so ordered.                                     APPENDIX                            UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF                           JUSTICE DRUG ENFORCEMENT                                ADMINISTRATION   In the Matter of   PETITION OF CARL E. OLSEN FOR THE ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH FOR AN  EXEMPTION FROM THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT                         On Remand From the United States                       Court of Appeals for the District                             of Columbia Circuit                                   No. 86-1442                                   FINAL ORDER        This order is issued pursuant to an Order from the United States Court  of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which remanded the matter  of a petition from Carl Eric Olsen on behalf of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic  Church to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in order to construct a  complete record for review.        On April 22, 1986, the Administrator of DEA denied Mr. Olsen's request  for an exemption from the Controlled Substances Act for use of marijuana  for religious purposes by the, Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  Mr. Olsen  petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit for review of the Administrator's denial.  The Court remanded the  matter to the DEA for further findings and a more complete record for  review.  Pursuant to the Court's Order, agency counsel requested Mr. Olsen  and the law firm of Hogan & Hartson, appointed amicus curiae by the Court,  to present any documents, evidence or arguments which they wished the  Administrator to consider in rendering a final decision.        Hogan & Hartson submitted a Memorandum of Law with attachments.   Counsel for DEA has also provided the Administrator with a Memorandum of  Law and attached documents.  The Administrator has considered the evidence  before him, and hereby renders a final decision.        In his petition for exemption to use of marijuana for religious  purposes, Mr. Olsen requests an exemption similar to that granted to the  Native Arnerlcan Church for use of peyote in bona fide religious  ceremonies.  This exemption is found in Title 21, Code of Federal  Regulations, Section 1307.31.  Mr. Olsen cites Constitutional principles  relating to the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and Equal  Protection as the basis for his request.  He also out-   ____________________   [footnote 6]   Several state courts have held that the free    exercise clause compels the government to ex-    empt from criminal sanctions the use of peyote    by members of the Native American Church.

Federal courts of ap-    peals have not yet reled definitively on the ques-    tion.  See Warner v.

For the reasons that follow, Mr. Olsen's request  is denied.        The Administrator finds that he does not have the authority to grant  the exemption requested by Mr. Olsen.  The Administrator's authority to  conduct rulemaking and to make waivers to regulatory and statutory  provisions of the Controlled Substances Act is specifically circumscribed  by that Act.  The Controlled Substances Act contemplates legitimate  manufacturing, distribution and use of controlled substances for medical,  scientific and research purposes.        The Controlled Substances Act provides that all persons who desire to  manufacture, distribute or dispense controlled substances must obtain a  registration to do so.  The Attornev General is authorized to waive the  requirement of registration if he finds that it is in the public interest.   The terms manufacture, distribute and dispense are defined in the  Controlled Substances Act and contemplate activity involving medical and  scientific use of controlled substances.  Neither manufacturing,  distribution or dispensing contemplates the possession of controlled  substances for other than legitimate medical or research purposes.        The Administrator does not have inherent authority to make exemptions  to the statute.  In granting the exemption for the Native American Church,  the Director of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) relied  upon the intentions of Congress in the legislative history of the  Controlled Substances Act for his ailthority.        The courts have found that the Administrator has authority to schedule  substances under the Controlled Substances Act.  This authority was granted  to the Attorney General by Congress with specific criteria and procedural  requirements for scheduling.  The authority was subsequently delegated to  the Administrator by the Attorney General as provided by the Act.  See: 21  U.S.C. � 871(a).  The criminal sanctions of the Act are dependent upon a  substance being scheduled, and into which schedule it is placed.  The  criteria for scheduling do not include provisions for religious use.  There  is no mechanism for an exemption to scheduling for religious purposes.  The  courts have closely reviewed the Administrator's scheduling of substances,  and have recently held that he did not have the authority to temporarily  schedule a substance without a specific delegation from the Attorney  General.  If the courts refuse to expand the Administrator's authority  under the Act to permit temporary scheduling which imposes criminal  sanctions, it is expected they would refuse to expand the Administrators  authority to waive those same criminal sanctions without specific authorization.        Because of the possibility that the United States Court of Appeals for  the District of Columbia may find that the Administrator does have the  authority to grant a religious exemption to the provisions of the  Controlled Substances Act, the Administrator will also address the issue of  whether the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church should be granted an exemption for  the use of marijuana for religious purposes.        In the Memorandum of Law filed on behalf of Mr. Olsen in this matter,  Mr. Olsen represents that he has been denied basic procedural due process  because no hearing has been held.  Where there is no issue of fact to be  decided, and no statutory requirement for a hearing, a hearing is not  necessary.  For purposes of this decision, the Administrator accepts that  the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church is a bona fide religion whose sacrament is  marijuana.  The Administrator also accepts Mr. Olsen's representations of  the method and manner of use of marijuana by members of the church.  The  acceptance of these facts means there are no facts in dispute, and,  therefore, no necessity for a hearing.        The Administrator finds that the federal courts that have interpreted  the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution have  held that an individual's religious practices may be curtailed by  government statute or requirement if the government can show that its  action serves a compelling state interest.  See: Bowen v. 1467 OLSEN v. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMIN. Cite as 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1989)                               APPENDIX--Continued   Roy, 476 U.S. 693 (1986); Unlited States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252 (1982).  The  government must make a reasonable effort to accommodate the religious  practice, but it is not always possible to make such accommodation, nor is  it Constitutionally required.  The lower courts have found, in cases where  religious practices were raised as a defense to criminal drug charges, that  the government has a compelling state interest in the regulation of  controlled substances and that accommodation is not usually possible.  The  cases addressing the religious use of marijuana are consistent in finding  that the Free Exercise Clause does not require the government to permit  religious use of controlled substances.  Beginning with Leary v. United  States, 383 F.2d 851 (5th Cir.1967), rev'd on other grounds, 395 U.S. 6  (1969), the federal appellate courts have found that the government has a  compelling interest in controlling marijuana use.  See: United States v.  Spears, 443 F.2d 895 (5th Cir.1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1020 (1972);  United States v. Middleton, 690 F.2d 820 (llth Cir.1982), cert. denied, 460  U.S. 1051 (1983); United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497 (1st Cir.1984), cert.  denied, 471 U.S. 1120 (1985) and Olsen v. State of Iowa, 808 F.2d 652 (8th  Cir.1986).  It should be noted that the Petitioner in this matter, Mr.  Olsen, was an appellant in both the Rush and Olsen cases, in which he  raised his religious use of marijuana in defense of criminal charges  involving possession and trafficking in marijuana.  The Middleton case  involved a defendant who was a member of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.        While Mr. Olsen maintains that these cases are not relevant to the  Administrator's decision because they involve the defense of a criminal  charge, the Administrator finds that they are indeed relevant in that the  courts discuss the very Constitutional issues which must be addressed in  this matter.  In addition to finding that the members of these religions  had no Free Exercise guarantee to use controlled substances for religious  purposes, the courts also found that as a matter of equal protection, these  individuals' religions were not entitled to the same exemption as that  given by DEA to the Native American Church for use of peyote for bona fide  religious purposes.  In finding that members of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic  Church are not entitled to the same exemption as the Native American  Church, the courts have made a distinction between the practices of the  Native American Church and other churches, and the court in Rush stated,  "we think the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church cannot be deemed similarly  situated to the Native American Church for equal protection purposes."   United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497, 513 (1st Cir.1984), cert. denied, 471  U.S. 1120 (1985).  The Administrator finds that there is indeed a  distinction between the practices of the Native American Church and the  Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  Mr. Olsen has stated that the Ethiopian Zion  Coptic Church advocates the continuous use of marijuana or "ganja", while  the Native American Church's use of peyote is isolated to specific  ceremonial occasions.        In addition, the Administrator finds that while peyote and marijuana  are both Schedule I controlled substances with a defined high potential for  abuse, the actual abuse and availability of marijuana in the United States  is many times more pervasive in American society than that of peyote.  The  statistics of DEA confirm this conclusion.  The amount of peyote seized and  analyzed by the DEA between 1980 and 1987 was 19.4 pounds.  The amount of  marijuana seized and analyzed by the DEA between 1980 and 1987 was  15,302,468.7 pounds.  This overwhelming difference explains why an  accommodation can be made for a religious organization which uses peyote in  circumscribed ceremonies, and not for a religion which espouses continual  use of marijuana.  The Administrator also notes that Mr. Olsen's conviction  in United States v. Rush involved the illegal importation of 20 tons of  marijuana.  Mr. Olsen and the other 19 defendants all claimed to be members  of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church and raised the religious use of  marijuana as a defense to criminal charges.  If Mr. Olsen's assertions that  the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church in the United States has 1468 878 FEDERAL REPORTER, 2d SERIES                               APPENDIX--Continued  never had, "more than between 100 and 200 members in this country,"  (Petitioner's Memorandum at page 11), 20 tons of marijuana would be an  outrageous quantity to supply their religious needs.        Mr. Olsen submits that his church will submit to a reasonable  accommodation to their use of marijuana, limiting its ingestion to specific  days and specific time periods, Given the large amounts of marijuana  available in this country, and the difficulty the DEA would have in trying  to monitor compliance which [sic] such a requirement, the Administrator  finds that accommodation is impractical.  The public interest dictates that  the exemption granted for religious use of peyote to the Native American  Church should not be expanded to include marijuana for the Ethiopian Zion  Coptic Church, or any other religion.        Based upon the record in this proceeding, the legal precedents, and  for the reasons outlined, the Petition by Carl Eric Olsen submitted on  behalf of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church for an exemption to the  Controlled Substances Act to use marijuana for religious purposes, is  hereby denied.                                        /s/ John C. Lawn                                      JOHN C. LAWN                                      Administrator   Dated: July 26, 1988        BUCKLEY, Circuit Judge, dissenting:        I dissent because the majority fails to address the Establishment  Clause implications of the Drug Enforcement Agency's rejection of Olsen's  request for a limited religious exemption.  That denial creates a clear-cut  denominational preference in favor of the Native American Church, which has  been granted such an exemption.  As the agency has not adequately explained  why the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church must not be accorded comparable  treatment, I would grant Olsen's petition for review on the Establishment  Clause claim and remand to the agency.                                        I.        The majority treats Olsen's denominational preference claim as an  equal protection challenge rather than as one involving the Establishment  Clause.  Majority Opinion ("Maj. op.") at 1463-65.  While the Supreme    Court has at times discussed the principle of neutrality among religions in  terms of equal protection rights, see, e.g., Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345  U.S. 67, 70, 73 S.Ct. 526, 527, 97 L.Ed. 828 (1953) (Frankfurter, J.,  concurring), Olsen's choice of an Establishment Clause battleground is  consistent both with the facts of this case and with the Supreme Court's  more recent precedent that applies the Establishment Clause to  denominational preferences (see Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 et  seq., 102 S.Ct. 1673, 1683 et. seq., 72 L.Ed. 2d 33 (1982)).                                       II.        Although certain aspects of the Supreme Court's Establishment Clause  jurisprudence are complex, the doctrine applicable in this particular case  is straightforward.  "The clearest command of the Establishment Clause is  that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over  another."  Id. at 244, 102 S.Ct. at 1683; see also Everson v. Board of  Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 15, 67 S.Ct. 504, 511, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947) ("The  'establishment of religion' clause ... means at least this: Neither a state  nor the Federal Government can set up a church.  Neither can pass laws  which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over  another.").  When we are presented with government action "granting a  denominational preference, our precedents demand that we treat the law as  suspect and that we apply strict scrutiny in adjudging its   constitutionality."  Larson, 456 U.S. at 246, 102 S.Ct. at 1684.        In the instant case, the DEA has permitted the Native American Church  to make sacramental use of a drug listed as a Schedule I controlled  substance under the Controlled Substances Act, but denied the Ethiopian  Zion Coptic Church a similar accommodation.  This denominational preference  constitutes a violation of the Establishment Clause unless the DEA is able  to demonstrate that "it is justified by a compelling governmental interest  ... and ...  1469 0LSEN v. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMIN. Cite as 878 F.Zd 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1989)  is closely fitted to further that interest."  Larson, 456 U.S. at 247, 102 S.Ct. at 1685.        The DEA asserts that it does not have the inherent authority to grant exemptions, and that "[i]n granting the exemption for the Native American Church, the [DEA's predecessor] relied upon the intentions of Congress in the Controlled Substances Act for its authority." [footnote *]  In the Matter of Petition of Carl E. Olsen for the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, Final Order (July 26, 1988) ("Final Order"), supra at 1466.  On appeal, the agency also implies, DEA Brief at 24, that the Native American Church is to be distinguished not on the basis of its religious character, but on "the sui generis legal status of American Indians" (quoting United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d 497, 513 (lst Cir.1984)).        Neither explanation is relevant.  Whatever the DEA's authority to grant exemptions,  it has in fact granted one to the Native American Church.  Furthermore, that Church's status as an indigenous faith does not affect its religious character.  As the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel wrote when reviewing the Native American Church's exemption:      [T]he special treatment of Indians under    our law does not stem from the unique    features of Indian religion or culture.    With respect to these matters, Indians    stand on no different footing than do    other minorities in our pluralistic society.    Rather, the special treatment of Indians    is grounded in their unique status as    political entities, formerly sovereign na-    tions preexisting the Constitution, which    still retain a measure of inherent sover-    eignty over their peoples unless divested    by federal statute or by necessary impli-    cation of their dependent status.  See    United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313,    98 S.Ct. 1079, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978).         An exemption for Indian religious use    of peyote would not be grounded in the    unique political status of Indians.  In-    stead, the exemption would be based on    the special culture and religion of the    Indians.  In this respect, Indian religion    cannot be treated differently than other    religions similarly situated without viola-    tion of the Establishment Clause.   Memorandum Opinion for the Chief Counsel, Drug Enforcement Administration, Peyote Exemption for Native American Church 403, 419 (Dec. 22, 1981), reprinted as attachment 16 of Memorandum of Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae in Support and on Behalf of Petitioner Carl E. Olsen (submitted to DEA on remand) ("Amicus Memorandum").        As the United States Government unquestionably has granted the Native American Church an accommodation that it has declined to extend to the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, it has the burden of demonstrating that its action was required by its paramount responsibility for the control of drugs.   I submit that the DEA's' explanation in its Final Order falls far short of meeting Larson's strict scrutiny standard.        In its discussion of the issues implicated by the Establishment Clause, the DEA finds two points of distinction between the Native American Church and the Ethiopian   ____________________   [footnote *]     It is by no means certain that the present exemp-    tion has its origin in a congressional mandate    rather than in an agency determination that it    was constitutionally required.  As the DEA    notes in its brief, DEA Brief at 4-5 n. 4, the first    regulation exempting the Native American    Church's use of peyote was issued following the    enactment of the Drug Abuse Contro1 Amend-    ments of 1965.  Shortly before final House ac-    tion on the bill, the Chairman of the House    Committee on Interstate and Foreign Com-    merce, Congressman Harris, introduced a letter    from the Food and Drug Administration (the    agency then concerned with drug enforcement)    in support of his recommendation that his col-    leagues accept a Senate amendment striking a    House provision exempting the sacramental use    of peyote.  The letter contains the following    statement:        If the church is a bona fide religious organiza-      tion that makes sacramental use of peyote,      then it would be our view that H.R. 2, even      without the peyote exemption which appeared      in the House-passed version, could not forbid      bona fide religious use of peyote.  We believe      that the constitutional guarantee of religious      freedom fully safeguards the rights of the      organization and its communicants.      111 Cong.Rec. 15,977-78 (1965).  The House    concurred in the Senate amendment immediate-    ly thereafter.  Id. at 15,778. 1470 878 FEDERAL REPORTER, 2d SERIES  Zion Coptic Church.  The first turns on differences between the practices of the two churches as they relate to the use of peyote and marijuana; the second hinges on the differences in the law enforcement problems posed by the two drugs.        The first distinction is addressed in a single sentence: "Mr. Olsen has stated that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church advocates the continuous use of marijuana or 'ganja', while the Native American Church's use of peyote is isolated to specific ceremonial occasions."  Final Order, supra at 1467.  The problem with this statement is that it wholly ignores the stringent restrictions on the members' sacramental use of marijuana that would be imposed by the terms of the limited religious exemption requested by Olsen.  See Maj. op. at 1460.  The DEA later acknowledges that Olsen has proposed limiting the use of marijuana "to specific days and specific time periods," but dismisses the proposal because of "the large amounts of marijuana available in this Country, and the difficulty the DEA would have in trying to monitor compliance" with the stipulated restrictions.  Final Order, supra at 1468.  Without more, I find this explanation utterly unsatisfactory as any member of the Church found in possession of the drug outside the limited hours and place set aside for its ceremonial use would not be shielded by the exemption.        Moreover, the restrictions proposed by Olsen, which are similar to those imposed by the Native American Church on the sacramental use of peyote, clearly distinguish this case from those cited by the DEA (id. at 1467-68) and the majority (Maj. op. at 1463) to show that other circuits have rejected comparable claims advanced on behalf of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  None of those cases involved the facts now before us: the denial of a request for a limited, prospective exemption from the Controlled Substances Act that the government had already granted another denomination.        The second distinction made by the DEA, and the one that the majority finds compelling, is the dramatic disparity between our society's abuse of the two substances as illustrated by the fact that 19.4 pounds of peyote were seized by the DEA between 1980---and 1987 in contrast to the 15,302,468.7 pounds of marijuana seized during the same period.  Final Order, supra at 1467.  "This overwhelming difference," the DEA asserts, "explains why an accommodation can be made for a religious organization which uses peyote in circumscribed ceremonies, and not for a religion which espouses continual use of marijuana."  Id.  With all respect to the DEA and my colleagues, I must demur.  The difference in pounds seized is indeed overwhelming but, again, the explanation is not.        The government's interest in preventing abuse of a given drug is not proportional to the drug's prevalence.  By classifying both marijuana and peyote as Schedule I controlled substances, Congress has determined that the federal government has a compelling interest in preventing the illegal distribution and use of both drugs.  Moreover, this quantitative justification, standing alone, is difficult to reconcile with Larson.  In that case, the Supreme Court invalidated a provision of a Minnesota statute exempting religious organizations that receive more than fifty percent of their funds from members ("fifty percent rule") from certain registration and reporting requirements imposed on charitable organizations engaged in fundraising.  The practical consequence of this provision was to confer a preference on well-established denominations.  Applying strict scrutiny to the State's justification of the preference, the Court conceded Minnesota's compelling interest in protecting it's citizens from abusive solicitation practices but concluded that it had failed to demonstrate that the fifty percent rule was closely fitted to further that interest.  456 U.S. at 251, 102 S.Ct. at 1686-87.        Minnesota justified the rule on the ground that it could be assumed that members of religious organizations exercise control over both the internal solicitation of contributions and the expenditure of the funds that they contribute.  Id. at 248, 102 S.Ct. at 1685.   The State asserted that where these safeguards do not exist, public 1471 OLSEN v. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMIN. Cite as 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1989)  disclosure is necessary.  Id.  The Court rejected this justification for three reasons.  First, it determined that the State had failed to provide any evidence demonstrating that members of religious organizations "will effectively control the organization if they contribute more than half of its solicited income," id. at 249, 102 S.Ct. at 1686 (emphasis original); second, the State had not suppported its assumption "that membership control is an adequate safeguard against abusive solicitations of the public by the organization," id. at 250, 102 S.Ct. at 1686; and third, the Court rejected a premise behind the fifty percent rule that the need for public disclosure corresponds to the percentage of nonmember contributions.   Id. at 251, 102 S.Ct. at 1686-87.        The Supreme Court's detailed scrutiny of Minnesota's justification of the fifty percent rule underscores the superficiality of the DEA's Justification of its denominational preference in this case.  The DEA offers no reason why it could not have tailored a closer fit than its out-of-hand denial of the requested exemption.  The DEA finds no difficulty in monitoring the compliance by the more than 250,000 members of the Native American Church with the limited use of peyote permitted for ceremonial purposes, and the majority offers good reasons why this should be so.  Maj. op. at 1464.  Yet the only reason the agency gives for concluding that monitoring compliance by the estimated one to two hundred communicants of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church living in the United States (Amicus Memorandum at 11) should be more difficult is that our streets are awash in marijuana.  Without further explanation, I find this reasoning less than compelling.  As in the case of the Native American Church, the exemption would place no restriction on the ageney's normal enforcement activities beyond the parameters of the Church's place of worship during the limited number of hours in which the sacramental use of marijuana would be permitted.        The majority notes a significant problem the DEA might face if it were to grant Olsen's request:      Were the DEA to consider a marijuana    exemption, equal protection (and/or the    establishment clause ...) would indeed    appear to command that it do so even-    handedly.  The DEA would have no war-    rant to contain the exemption to a single    church or religion.   Maj. op. at 1464 (citations omitted).  I find the majority's "opening the floodgate" argument more persuasive than anything the DEA has offered.  It is for the agency, however, to make the argument and to explain why it would find itself unable to cope with the flood of similar applications, not for us to speculate about them.        Finally, the majority supports the denial of the exemption to Olsen by arguing that         Even if we were to credit Olsen's equal    protection argument or the dissent's por-    trayal of it in terms of the establishment    clause, the remedy Olsen requests hardly    follows.  Faced with the choice between    invalidation and extension of any con-    trolled-substances religious exemption,    which would the political branches    choose?  It would take a court bolder    than this one to predict, as our dissenting    colleague appears to suggest, that exten-    sion, not invalidation, would be the prob-    able choice.   Maj. op. at 1464.  I have two responses.  First, the Supreme Court has consistently recognized that conceptual problems regarding appropriate remedial actions do not relieve us of our obligation to review government classifications that are impermissibly underinclusive.  See, e.g., Arkansas Writer's Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987) (finding Arkansas statute unconstitutionally underinclusive).  Second, we would not be called upon to make the choice the majority describes if, as I believe appropriate, we were to remand the case to the DEA for further consideration in light of its Establishment Clause implications.                                       IV.        The DEA has chosen to accommodate one religion but not another.  The Establishment Clause compels the agency to justify its distinction and requires us to scrutinize the agency's rationale strictly.  Given this demanding standard of review, I must 1472 878 FEDERAL REPORTER, 2d SERIES  conclude that the agency has failed to satisfy its burden.  Accordingly, I would grant Olsen's petition for review and remand to the agency for reconsideration without reaching Olsen's Free Exercise challenge.

He's offered to go smiling to the gallows, throw the noose  around his own neck, then pull the lever.  He'd prefer that the  rope be made of hemp, but it's not a demand.       The U.S. government has not taken him up on his offer.   Instead -- as a consolation prize of sorts -- the government has  given him 35 years in a federal prison.  A sentence tantamount to  life for the 50-year-old Tranmer.       A gothic drama of changing times and values, the story of  James Tranmer reveals a great deal about the government's "War on  Drugs," and our society as a whole.       If you listen to Tranmer, he's being persecuted for his  religious belief in a plant that's fallen out of political favor.   A euphoric, spiritual herb that's a part of creation and  completely harmless.       If you listen to the government, Tranmer is being punished  for conspiracy to import into Panama City thousands of pounds of  marijuana -- a pernicious, addling Schedule I drug.  A drug with  no redeeming qualities and a vast potential for abuse.       According to the government, Tranmer is just another drug  dealer.       But even hardened courtroom regulars admit that there's  something different about Tranmer.       Most people brought into court on drug charges vehemently  deny any association with drugs, says Johnny Johnson, Bay County  liaison for the U.S. Marshals.       And never, he says, do they sing a drug's praises -- which  is exactly what Tranmer did.  "In a way," Johnson admits, "you  gotta respect the guy."       Tranmer's lawyer refused to put him on the stand during the  trial.  But at his July sentencing in Panama City's federal  courthouse, Tranmer spoke his piece, praising marijuana -- over  and over and over.       "I'm an herb man.  I've always been an herb man," Tranmer  said in part.  "You cannot win this fight against marijuana.  If  you fight against the herb, you fight against creation."       The judge was having none of it.  "By the look on the  judge's face," Tranmer says, "I knew it was boring him -- I knew  it didn't really make any difference.  But, you know, I did say  what I felt."       Soon after Tranmer gave his impassioned speech, a pelican  crashed into a power line outside the courthouse, dying in a huge  fireball.  The courthouse went dark.       Friends of Tranmer took the pelican's death as a good sign - - a sign that even if the judge wasn't listening, maybe somebody,  somewhere was.       At it's core, the story of James Tranmer revolves around a  hardy weed that grows wild in all 50 states.  An herb that  continues to inspire debate like no other "drug."       Supporters tout marijuana as a spiritual herb with near- magical powers and a host of medical and societal uses.       Opponents decry it as a mind-erasing gateway to more drugs  and to increasing irresponsible behavior.       Both sides admit it is addling, but disagree wildly whether  or not this is good.       Marijuana's "high" is difficult to measure, but its other  effects, when examined objectively, seem rather benign.       The entry under marijuana in the 1992 edition of the MERCK  Manual reads, in part: "Although many dangers of marijuana are  frequently cited, there is still little evidence of biologic  damage, even among relatively heavy users.  This is true even in  the areas intensely investigated, such as immunologic and  reproductive function."  The MERCK Manual, used by medical  personnel nationwide, is the definitive guide on substances'  effects on people.       No person in the 5,000-year history of marijuana use has  ever died from the herb, and it is one of the few "drugs" for  which there is no known fatal dose.       It has been estimated that in order to ingest a lethal dose  of marijuana, a person would have to smoke 100 pounds of the  stuff every minute for 15 minutes.       "I'd like to be the first to try that," Tranmer says,  laughing.  "What a great way to go."       Tranmer first laid eyes on marijuana in 1965.  He promptly  smoked it.       "I realized immediately that there was something to the  marijuana," he says.  "I realized everybody had lied to me.   Realized that this was not the demonic thing that everybody  claimed it was.  It was a wonderful sensation, a wonderful  feeling.  The rapport and the camaraderie among the people was  very different than anything I ever experienced before.  I still  didn't really understand or comprehend anything about it, but I  knew I was going to be smoking marijuana for quite some time."       So began a fierce devotion.  A devotion that's led Tranmer  on a most unlikely journey.       After 1965, Tranmer traveled the world looking for good  ganja.  Then, in 1970 he smoked some Jamaican stuff -- and it was  off to Jamaica.  He lived there on and off throughout the 70s,  becoming a priest in the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church and growing  to appreciate the true spiritual nature of the magical herb.   While there, he was interviewed by 60 Minutes' Dan Rather.       In the late 1970s, a little known Miami-area prosecutor  named Janet Reno battled Tranmer and the Coptics in court over  their claimed religious right to smoke ganja.  The Coptics lost,  Reno won.       Through it all, Tranmer smoked.  Thousands and thousands of  times.       He is a ganja man, and his record reflects this: over 20  marijuana arrests.       For his latest offense, he will probably die in jail.       He wouldn't change a thing.  "I'm overjoyed," he says.       Johnny Johnson admits that Tranmer seems intelligent, but  fears the man is sadly misled.       Tranmer insists he's not.  His salvation, he says, revolves  around doing what he knows to be right.  His salvation revolves  around marijuana, his sacrament, his personal window to the  spirit of God.       "The more they persecute me wrongfully," he says, "the  better off I am."       Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug by the federal  government.  In other words, it has a high potential for abuse,  no approved medical uses and no safe dose.  Cocaine and PCP, on  the other hand, are classified as Schedule II, and can be  prescribed by doctors.       Thanks to machinery put in place by Ronald Reagan, the same  legal tools associated with drugs like cocaine are being brought  to bear on marijuana and marijuana users: broad search-and- seizure powers, civil forfeiture laws, expanded application of  conspiracy laws.  The list is long.       You almost have to be stoned, Tranmer says, to comprehend  the awesome size of the umbrella called "conspiracy."  Tranmer is  reluctant to discuss the merits of his case, but there are others  that are illustrative.  Consider, for example, the case of Mark  Young, now serving a life sentence in federal prison for  "conspiracy to manufacture" marijuana.  He simply introduced a  marijuana buyer to a marijuana seller/manufacturer.       According to federal records, roughly one in six inmates in  the federal prison system has been prosecuted primarily for a  marijuana offense.  About 15,000 people -- a number that now  includes Tranmer.       It wasn't always that way.       Thanks largely to an increase in popularity among the white  middle class, marijuana use was widely tolerated in the 1960s and  1970s on both the state and federal levels.       During the 1970s, 11 states decriminalized marijuana, and  many other states relaxed their laws.       The Shafer Commission -- appointed by President Richard  Nixon in 1972 to study the marijuana question -- advocated  federal de-criminalization of marijuana for personal use.  During  his presidency, Jimmy Carter came out for this de facto  legalization.  In 1977, the DEA said it was a viable policy  option.       But when Reagan came to office in 1980 and began his  ballyhooed "War on Drugs," marijuana suddenly and mysteriously  became a scourge on the national character.       States gradually tightened their laws.  Federal laws became  more and more stringent.    IT'S COMPLICATED       With more than 60 unique components, many of which are  addling, the gummy yellow resin secreted by the marijuana plant  is complicated.       And perhaps the same could be said of James Tranmer.       He is a terribly difficult man to describe.  An interesting,  intelligent, contradictory man, Tranmer does not fit easily into  any simple classification.       He regularly sings in jail and laughs with visitors about  how society is unraveling.  He is surprisingly upbeat at the  prospect of facing 35 years -- and probably death -- in prison.   This, despite his assertion: "I know I'm not a criminal.  And I  know I've never hurt anybody."       Nicknamed "Judge" by his prison inmates, he will not let  them lapse into immorality in his presence.       He is an optimist, yet he holds out little hope that he'll  be free again.       He wants to be the first person executed for ganja, but  admits the world would little notice.    UNFAIR FIGHT       Both sides of the marijuana debate agree that thousands of  lives have been ruined, but disagree as to the culprit: marijuana  or the laws that forbid its use.       But, in a way, it is not a fair fight.       Marijuana opponents, after all, are far better organized and  better financed than marijuana supporters.       Bay County's foremost marijuana advocate outside of Tranmer  is Robert Lawrence -- a subsistence farmer and sometimes musician  living in virtual exile in the dusty hamlet of Fountain.       "He is a simple man," Tranmer says, "but full of wisdom."       Lawrence says that a lot of people agree with him.  "But if  all the rich and famous people in Bay County came out and said  the laws are wrong, they'd lose their jobs and end up poor  hippies like us."       The marijuana opponents, after all, include the federal  government.  There is a huge bureaucracy backing the status quo.   And there are prison sentences.       Most of Tranmer's "brothers and sisters" are either in jail  or so battered and beaten up by years of evading the law that  they've all but given up the struggle.       The government insists it's right.  Tranmer does the same.       But, in the final analysis, there is no question that  proposing the legalization of marijuana is political poison.  And  no question that legalization is a long shot.       James Tranmer doesn't care.       He knows he's right.  And he's sticking to it.  Damn the  government.       "People hate to hear the truth," he says.  "They hate the  spirit person.  And they hate the ganja man.  That's why they  must persecute me."       Tranmer is now being transferred from Panama City's downtown  jail to a federal prison in Lewisburg, Penn.       But one suspects that wherever he goes, he will continue his  devotion to marijuana.  Wherever he goes, he will ask to be  hanged for his beloved herb.       And wherever he goes, an odd jailhouse sound will be heard:  singing.

Count 2 alleged that appellant did wilfullypossess marijuana for sale in violation of section 11359 of theHealth and Safety Code, a felony. (C.T. pp. 1-2.)     A bench trial commenced on April 11, 1995. (R.T. p. 6.)  OnMay 19, 1995, appellant was found guilty of transportation ofmarijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of sale undercounts 1 and 2 of the indictment. (R.T. pp. 519-20.)     Sentencing was conducted on July 10, 1995. (R.T. p. 523)  Theproceeding was suspended and formal probation was granted for aperiod of 60 months. (R.T. pp. 535-539; C.T. pp. 271-273.)                               2                       STATEMENT OF FACTS     Appellant is a member and priest of the Israel Zion CopticChurch which is incorporated in the state of Wisconsin. (C.T. p.71; 114 [Appellant's testimony at the August 29, 1994 hearing1 wasadmitted into evidence at trial. (R.T. pp. 9-10)].  The IsraelZion Coptic Church is an offshoot of the Rastafarian movement andthe Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, (R.T. pp. 334-342 and C.T. p.84.) and is comprised of approximately 200 to 250 members. (C.T.p. 74.)  The Israel Zion Coptic's doctrine incorporates the use ofmarijuana, or ganja, as a sacrament during religious services andgatherings. (C.T. pp. 71-73; 114.)     In the past, appellant had attempted to provide the sacramentfor the church by growing marijuana in Wisconsin. (R.T. p. 392.)However, he was arrested for this activity, and was thus prohibitedfrom growing the sacrament. (R.T. p. 392-393.)     Appellant eventually decided to travel to San Diego topurchase a supply of marijuana for the church's use. (R.T. pp.391-394.)  Approximately $4,000.00 was collected from appellant andtwo other church members in order to make the purchase. (R.T. 349-395.)     Appellant then travelled to San Diego and bought 40 pounds ofmarijuana. (R.T. pp. 400-402.)  On March 27, 1994, appellant wasdriving his automobile through the Temecula border patrol__________________     1On August 29, 1994, the Consolidated Superior/MunicipalCourts of the State of California in and for the County ofRiverside heard the People's Motion in Limine under Evidence Codesection 402 regarding religious freedom evidence.                               3 checkpoint when he was stopped at the primary inspection area.(C.T. p. 19-26 [A transcript of the Grand Jury proceedings wasadmitted into evidence at trial. (R.T. p. 14)].)  Appellant'svehicle was subsequently directed to the secondary inspection areawhere a canine sniff was performed. (C.T. pp. 19-21.)     The canine "alerted," and the border patrol conducted a searchof the vehicle. (C.T. pp. 21-23.)  Consequently, border patrolagents located the 40 pounds of marijuana which appellant hadplaced in two duffle bags in the trunk of his vehicle. (C.T. pp.23-24.)  Agent Joel Ontiveros then advised appellant of his Mirandarights and placed appellant under arrest. (C.T. p. 37.)  Afteradditional searching, agents also confiscated $2,350.00 cashlocated in the interior of appellant's vehicle. (C.T. p. 39.)                               4                                 I          THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A          CONVICTION OF GUILT BASED UPON INTENT TO SELL          MARIJUANAA.   Summary of Argument     Appellant was found guilty of possessing marijuana forpurposes of sale in violation of section 11369 of the Health andSafety Code. (R.T. pp. 519-20.)  However, the evidence presentedat trial demonstrated that appellant had no intent to sell themarijuana he had obtained.  Rather, the marijuana was to be givenaway as a sacrament.B.   Standard of Review     In determining whether a reasonable trier of fact could havefound a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the appellatecourt must view the evidence in a light most favorable to therespondent and presume in support of the judgment the existence ofevery fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.(People v. Johnson (1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 567-577.)  The court doesnot, however, limit its review to the evidence favorable to therespondent.  Rather, the task is two fold:  First, the court mustresolve the issue in the light of the whole record and may notlimit the appraisal to isolated bits of evidence selected by therespondent.  Second, the court must judge whether the evidence ofeach of the essential elements is substantial.  It is not enoughfor the respondent simply to point to "some" evidence supportingthe finding, because not all surface conflicts of evidence remain                               5 substantial in the light of other facts. (Id., at p. 577.)C.   Insufficient Evidence of Intent to Sell     Unlawful possession of a controlled substance for salerequires proof the defendant possessed the contraband with theintent of selling it. (People v. Meza (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1741,1745.)  However, the evidence in this case establishes that theappellant had no intention, whatsoever, of selling the marijuana heobtained in California.     At trial, the prosecution questioned appellant regarding hisintended use of the sacrament as follows:     Q.   Well, isn't part of that 13 pounds going to go to          some other people?     A.   Possibly.  It probably would have.  It would have--          it was a--it's the sacramental food or object that          I need to practice my religion, and of course it          would have been consumed that way within a          communion and shared with others.     Q.   But you're not going to break off, say, a pound or          two and give it to somebody else?     A.   I've given a pound or two to Brother Michael at          times.     Q.   So you just give him the pound?     A.   Yes.     . . . .     Q.   Within your Church, though, you don't have any kind          of like a --- you might see in Christian church an          offering plate that people donate money to for the          ganja to be purchased, do you?     A.   No.     Q.   It really comes from the money you earn from your          work?                               6      A.   Right.  But I would--I would--brothers and sisters          are free and welcomed to put some money towards--if          that's what we have to continue to do and that's          our access to the sacrament, then we'll do that.     Q.   Do they do that from time to time?     A.   Yes.     Q.   And you talked about other people who might not be          members of the Church.  If they come over and          partake of the sacrament and stay with you for a          day or so, do they sometimes contribute money?     A.   No.  There's no--there's no--I don't require          somebody to give me some money to be able to          partake in the sacrament.     Q.   I understand that.  I'm not saying you require.          Sometimes do they--     A.   I don't accept it.  I don't accept it at all.  To          sit and partake of the sacrament with me, there's          no--no, there is no money offering like that at          all.(R.T. pp. 406-407.)     It is true that possession of a large amount of a controlledsubstance "itself affords a reasonable inference of possession forsale." (People v. Grant (1969) 1 C.A.3d 563, 570.)  However, theevidence presented at trial entirely rebutted any reasonableinference that the appellant was involved in illegal sale of acontrolled substance.  On the contrary, appellant's testimony hasestablished that he did not require others to pay money in exchangefor partaking in the sacrament.  Moreover, he would not acceptmoney for the sacrament, even if it was offered to him.  Given thistestimony, there is absolutely no basis upon which to support aconviction of guilt for the possession of marijuana for sale inviolation of section 11359 of the Health and Safety Code.                               7                               II          THE TRIAL COURT CANNOT SIDE-STEP THE FIRST          AMENDMENT FREEDOM OF RELIGION ISSUE ON THE          BASIS THAT APPELLANT'S ACTS CONSTITUTED A          COMMERCIAL ACTIVITYA.   Summary of the Argument     Although the court acknowledged that appellant's "religiouspractices may be constitutionally protected," it neverthelessconvicted appellant for illegal commercial activity, i.e.,possessing and transporting marijuana, in violation of the Healthand Safety Code.  The court thus "side-stepped" the freedom ofreligion issue.  Although appellant has been convicted ofpossessing and transporting marijuana, he argues that hisconstitutional right to free exercise of religion through thepartaking of the sacrament is meaningless without the right topossess and transport that sacrament.  Thus, the court must addressthe First Amendment issues presented in this case and determinewhether there is some compelling state interest which would justifythe burden which has been placed on appellant's religious freedom.B.   Appellant's Church Affiliation     The evidence presented at trial established that appellant wasa bona fide member of the Israel Zion Coptic Church. (R.T. pp.518-519.)  Appellant testified as follows:     Q.   . . . Do you follow a practice of a particular          religion, Mr. Peck?     A.   Yes, I do.                              8      Q.   What is that?     A.   I follow the Israel Zion Coptic Church religion.     Q.   Is that an organized church in some state?     A.   Yes, it is.  We're incorporated in the state of          Wisconsin.     Q.   Do you have a particular position in the church          that you occupy?     A.   Yes, I do.  I'm an elder.  And as far as the          incorporation of the church, I'm the president on          the document.     Q.   And would you characterized your position in the          church as a lay person or an official or priest of          the church?     A.   I'm an official priest of the church.     Q.   And did you, in fact, have in your possession 40          pounds of marijuana or ganja sometime earlier in          the year?     A.   Yes, I did.     Q.   Why did you have that in your possession, sir?     A.   To obtain sacramental ganja for the members of my          church.(C.T. p. 71, 114 [Appellant's testimony at the August 29, 1994hearing was admitted into evidence at trial. (R.T. pp. 9-10)].)     As a member and priest of the Israel Zion Coptic Church, itwas necessary for appellant to obtain the sacramental marijuana, organja, used in the religious practices.  Appellant testified to theimportance of this sacrament:     Q.   Can you tell me how it is that ganja is a part of          the religious practices that you practice?     A.   The Coptic is a three-part doctrine, the way it was          taught to me.  And the three elements that make up          the body of Christ are the ganja, the word of          truth, and the man.                              9      Q.   Do you feel, sir, that the--let me phrase it this          way:  If ganja, or marijuana, was prohibited to          you, could you practice the Israel Zion Coptic          religion?     A.   No.     Q.   Is the prohibition of ganja or marijuana, does it          have an effect on the services that you could          perform in the church?     A.   Well, it creates a burden, because we can be          arrested for it.     Q.   If you didn't have ganja or marijuana, would it be          possible for you to conduct the services, the          sacramental services of the church?     A.   No.     Q.   If you--during the church services, what part does          ganja play in the church service?     A.   Ganja is shared as communion.  It's the body and          blood of Christ.  When we share the ganja and touch          upon the subject of the King, which is the word of          truth, and blend that with man, ourselves, then we          are--we are Christ in the flesh.  That is Christ in          the flesh.     Q.   When you use ganja, do you use it as something that          will allow you to achieve a particular state of          mind?     A.   No.  It's the herb, the word, and the man.  Those          three elements together are Christ, that we then          become a member of that body, which is Christ.(C.T. pp. 72-73.)     Based upon this evidence, the trial court found that for morethan ten years appellant had been a practicing member of the IsraelZion Coptic Church, a religious organization incorporated under thelaws of the state of Wisconsin. (R.T. pp. 518-519.)  Furthermore,the court found that a principal tenet of the Israel Zion CopticChurch was to use marijuana as a sacramental herb. (R.T. p. 519.)                               10      The courts have considered similar cases involving controlledsubstances and the defense of free exercise of religion in thepast, and yet failed to reach the First Amendment issue.  However,these cases did not present evidence of a bona fide membership ina belief system which reguired the use of marijuana as an integralpart of the religion, such that prohibition of the herb wouldcompletely inhibit the religious practice.     For example, in People v. Mitchell (1966) 244 Cal.App.2d176, the defendant was charged with possession of marijuana andwith planting and cultivating marijuana in violation of the Healthand Safety Code.  The defendant argued that his use of marijuanawas in accordance with his religious beliefs, and therefore, he hada constitutionally protected right to possess and use the narcotic.(Id., at p. 177.)     However, on cross examination, Mitchell acknowledged that hewas not a member of any organized religion.  Further, when askedwhether his smoking of marijuana was pursuant to a religiouspractice, he stated, "in the sense that I believe that religion isrelated to law or constitutionality, I was exercising the freedomin my own home to smoke something actually better than tobacco."(Id., at p. 181.)     The Mitchell court thus found that the defendant had offeredno evidence that his use of marijuana constituted a religiouspractice in any sense of that term. (Id, at p. 182.)  The courtconcluded that because the record raised no issue as to theexercise of religion, it was unnecessary to address the subject.                               11 (Id., at pp. 182-183.)     Similarly, in People v. Collins (1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 486, thedefendant testified that he used marijuana in order to extend andintensify his ability to engage in meditative communication withthe Supreme Being, to attain spiritual peace through union with Godthe Father, and to search out the ultimate meaning of life andnature. (Id., at p. 487.)  However, the record demonstrated thatthe defendant did not worship or sanctify marijuana, but merelyemployed its hallucinogenic biochemical properties as an auxiliaryto a desired capacity for communication. (Id., at p. 487.)  Thus,the court merely held that the existing law did not bar thedefendant from a practice which was indispensable to the pursuit ofhis faith. (Id., at p. 488.)     Unlike Mitchell and Collins, however, appellant in the instantcase has proven that he is a bona fide member of a legitimatereligious organization, that marijuana is an object of worship tohim, and that his use of marijuana as a sacrament is central,integral, and necessary to the practice of that religion.Therefore, the trial court had no rationale to side-step the issueof free exercise of religion which is presented in this case.C.   Appellant's Right to Obtain the Church's Sacrament     The trial court convicted appellant for the transportation ofmarijuana in violation of section 11360 of the Health and SafetyCode. (R.T. pp. 519-20.)  In doing so, the court held thatalthough appellant's "religious practices may be constitutionally                               12 protected," his actions on or about March 24, 1994 in Californiaconstituted "commercial activities outside the practice of [his]religion, and therefore, were not constitutionally protected."(R.T. p. 533.)  However, the result of such a ruling is toacknowledge appellant's right to practice his religion, and yeteffectively deny him the means to go about exercising thosebeliefs.     Appellant testified that he had tried to avoid thetransportation of marijuana by growing the sacrament himself:     Well, we had tried to provide our own sacrament.  I had     grown the herb in Verona, Wisconsin, and was arrested for     it.  I tried to provide it growing it with Brother     Michael in Soldiers Grove, and we were unable to provide     it that way.  The only alternative that was left was to     purchase it somewhere.(R.T. p. 392.)     In sum, the court has told appellant that he has a right topractice his religion (which includes the sincere belief in theworship and use of marijuana as a sacrament); however, he may notgrow the ganja himself, and he may not obtain it by transporting itfrom another location.  Such a result is not only disingenuous, butit renders appellant's right to "free exercise of his religion"absolutely meaningless.  The court must therefore address the FirstAmendment issues in this case and set forth any compelling stateinterest which would justify the burden which has been placed uponAppellant's religious practices.2___________________     2The Woodv test involved in a determination of burden onreligious freedom and compelling state interest is discussed indetail in Section V below.                               13 D.   Peyote and the Native American Church     At trial, Randolf White, a member of the Native AmericanChurch, testified with regard to the use of peyote within theChurch:     Q.   Mr. White, in regards to your religious          affiliation, sir, are you affiliated with a          particular church or organization?     A.   Yes, I am.     Q.   What is that, sir?     A.   Native American Church     Q.   Is that Native American--is that the Native          American Church of North America Incorporated?     A.   It is.     Q.   Are you a member of any particular sect or part of          that religion?     A.   I'm active in the group called the Ghost Clan of          the Native American Church.     Q.   As part of the rituals of the Ghost Clan, do you          consume peyote?     A.   Yes.     Q.   Do you also consume cannabis as part of those          rituals?     A.   Sometimes, yes.(R.T. pp. 36-37.)     Q.   Mr. White, are you aware of whether or not there is          a system in place that allows or accommodates the          distribution of peyote?     A.   There is such a system, yes.     Q.   Could you explain to us how it works?                               14      A.   Someone who wishes to be a peyote distributor          applies to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous          Drugs--or I guess it's the DEA now--for a permit to          get what's called a narcotics dealership.  Peyote          is a Schedule 1 controlled substance which makes it          extraordinarily difficult to meet the reguirements          of the government, but essentially the state of          Texas and the federal government have gotten          together.  There is a permit issued by the DEA for          the narcotics permission license.  It's issued to          the location rather than the individual.  It's a          location that's owned by the church, and there are          certain security measures which are reguired to be          in place that I'm not at liberty to discuss.          Essentially, these are all located in the state of          Texas, primarily Amarillo City.     Q.   When the people go out and gather the peyote          buttons from the field, do they go to an          intermediary, one of these distributors in general?     A.   In general, people--members of the Native American          Church don't have the time to harvest the peyote          themselves because it's a laborious and time-          consuming affair.  It's kept by these licensed          distributors.  They hold it.  The peyote itself is          never sold as such.  However, you can place a          monetary value on the peyote, which at this time is          about $125 per thousand buttons of various sizes.          Sometimes the cash payment is actually made, but          it's generally understood the peyote--the medicine          itself is a gift.  It's not subject to cash, and          this is part of the bylaws of the church, and it          is--when you take the peyote--let's say you did          take it.  You leave something there.  It might be          a cigar in a plastic case where you picked up the          first peyote button.  But the philosophy is if you          take something, you leave something.          The same philosophy holds true later in what might,          in other words, be described as commerce where          there's a trading.  A barter agreement takes place.          If I would give you a gift, it would not be          unreasonable to give me another gift.  Some people          say they buy it, but technically they try to avoid          it.     Q.   In obtaining the medicine, peyote, do you have to--          you have to arrange for transportation from that          area of Texas to wherever it is in the United          States that it is being used?                               15      A.   Yes.     Q.   Does peyote grow naturally in this area of the Rio          Grand Valley?     A.   No.     Q.   So if you were in Oklahoma and you wanted to          practice your religion, you would necessarily have          to get that from Texas to Oklahoma somehow?     A.   You would either do that, or you would have to grow          it yourself.(R.T. pp. 43-45.)     Mr. White's testimony reveals that a state and federal systemhas been established for the harvesting, distribution, andtransportation of peyote, a Schedule I narcotic, for use in thereligious services of the Native American Church.  To deny theIsrael Zion Coptic Church members the establishment of a similarsystem is simply to discriminate against this religiousorganization.  Thus, appellant's right to the free exercise of hisreligion requires that he not only be allowed to harvest themarijuana necessary for the sacrament, but that he also be allowedto transport marijuana, if necessary, to his place of worship.                               16                              III          THE TRIAL COURT CANNOT SIDE-STEP THE FIRST          AMENDMENT ISSUE AND IMPOSE PROBATION          CONDITIONS WHICH BURDEN APPELLAAT'S FREEDOM OF          ASSOCIATION AND FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGIONA.   Summary of the Argument     Under the terms of appellant's probation, he is prohibitedfrom associating with anyone who uses marijuana.  However, such aprohibition effectively prevents appellant from associating withhis church brethren given that members are typically marijuanausers.  Before appellant's right of religious association can beburdened, the court must find some compelling state interest.However, the trial court, in "side-stepping" this First Amendmentissue, has failed to designate such a compelling state interestwhich would justify the infringement on appellant's right toassociate.  Likewise, the probation conditions prohibitingappellant from using marijuana must also be justified by a findingof a compelling state interest.B.   Factual Backaround     Appellant was sentenced on July 10, 1995. (R.T. p. 523.)  Theproceeding was suspended and formal probation was granted for aperiod of 60 months under certain terms and conditions.  Under theterms of probation, appellant is, inter alia, not to associate withany unrelated person known to be a possessor, user, or traffickerof controlled substances, and not to possess or use any controlledsubstance. (R.T. pp. 536.)                               17 C.   Freedom of Association     Although the freedom of association is not explicitly set outin the First Amendment, the right to associate with others inpursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, andcultural ends, including religious beliefs, has long been held tobe implicit in the freedoms of speech, assembly, and petition.(Roberts v. United States Jaycees (1984) 468 U.S. 609, 622 [82L.Ed. 2d 462, 104 S.Ct. 3244]; Healy v. James (1972) 408 U.S. 169,181 [33 L.Ed.2d 266, 280, 92 S.Ct. 2338].)     The freedom to associate with the persons of one's choice,without unwarranted governmental intervention or interference, isdivided into two components: the freedom of intimate associationand the freedom of expressive association. (Roberts v. UnitedStates Jaycees, sunra, 468 U.S. 609, 617-618.)     Intimate association stands constitutionally protected because"choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate humanrelationships must be secured against undue intrusion by the Statebecause of the role of such relationships in safeguarding theindividual freedom that is central to our constitutional scheme."(Roberts v. United States Jaycees, supra, 468 U.S. 609, 617-618.)Thus, "freedom of [intimate] association receives protection as afundamental element Of personal liberty. (Roberts v. United StatesJaycees, supra, 468 U.S. 609, 618.)     Freedom of expressive association stands protected as an"indispensable means of preserving" the liberty to "associate forthe purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First                               18 Amendment--speech, assembly, petition for the redress ofgrievances, and the exercise of religion." (Roberts v. UnitedStates Jaycees, supra, 468 U.S. 609, 618.)     The right to associate for expressive purposes is not,however, absolute.  Infringements on that right may be justified byregulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelatedto the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through meanssignificantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.(Roberts, 468 U.S. at 623.)     The probation condition which prohibits appellant fromassociating with any unrelated person known to be a user ofcontrolled substances effectively prohibits appellant fromassociating with his brethren in the Israel Zion Coptic Church,given that the use marijuana is a principal tenet of theirreligion. (R.T. p. 519.)  Before appellant's freedom ofassociation can be infringed, however, there must first be afinding of some compelling state interest which justifies theburden.     The trial court avoided the First Amendment issues in thiscase, and convicted appellant for transportation and possession ofmarijuana under the Health and Safety Code.  However, even if thecrimes under which appellant was convicted did not implicate aburden on his religious freedom, the terms of probation do createsuch a burden.  Thus, the issue of a compelling state interest mustbe addressed, and the court should not be allowed to side-step thematter.  In addition, without a finding of some compelling state                               19 interest which would justify the burden on appellant's religiousassociation, the condition prohibiting appellant from associatingwith marijuana users must be stricken.D.   Other Terms of probation     The terms of probation also included the conditions thatappellant would not possess or use any controlled substances unlessmedically prescribed, and that he would submit to chemical tests ofblood, breath, and urine, and physical tests for the detection ofcontrolled substances. (R.T. p. 536.)  However, the trial courtfound that "a principal tenet of the Israel Zion Coptic Church isto use marijuana as a sacramental herb. . ." and that "Churchmembers believe that God is experienced or that one may communewith God through the smoking of marijuana." (R.T. p. 519.)  Thus,by instituting probation terms which prohibit appellant from usingmarijuana, the trial court has burdened appellant's freedom ofreligion.  However, the trial court then failed to address theFirst Amendment issues, as discussed more fully below.  In choosingto evade these issues, the trial court has failed to designate acompelling state interest which would justify the probationalinfringements upon appellant's right to free exercise of hisreligion.  Thus, these conditions must also be stricken.                               20                                IV          APPELLANT'S USE OF MARIJUANA IS PROTECTED BY          THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S FREE EXERCISE CLAUSEA.   Summary of the Argument     Appellant has been a member of the Israel Zion Coptic Churchfor more than ten years. (R.T. pp. 518-519.)  As such, heconsiders marijuana to be a sacrament as well as an actual objectof worship. (R.T. p. 519.)  Thus, appellant argues that the FirstAmendment's free exercise clause protects his use of the sacramentduring worship.  Furthermore, appellant contends that there is nocompelling state interest which would justify the state'sinfringement upon his use of marijuana in the free exercise of hisreligion.B.   Applicable Law     Appellant contends that his use of marijuana is protected bythe free exercise clause of the First Amendment.3     The Health and Safety Code statutes which deal with the use,possession, and sale of marijuana and hashish were enacted pursuantto a legislative determination that such laws promote the publichealth, safety, and welfare, and are necessary for the protectionof society as a whole. (People v. Aguiar (1968) 257 Cal.App.2d597, 601.)___________________     3The First Amendment provides in pertinent part, "Congressshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, orprohibiting the free exercise thereof, . . . ."  The FirstAmendment is made applicable to the states through the libertycomponent of the Fourteenth Amendment. (Cantwell v. Connecticut(1940) 310 U.S. 296, 303, 84 L.Ed. 1213, 1217-1218, 60 S.Ct. 900.)                               21      Appellant argues that these statutes unconstitutionallyinfringe upon the free exercise of his religion by prohibiting hisuse of marijuana, a sacrament in the Israel Zion Coptic Church.  Insupport of his argument, appellant relies upon People v. Woody(1964) 61 Cal.2d 716.     In Woody, a group of Navajo Native Americans performedreligious ceremonies involving the use of peyote.  The evidence inWoody demonstrated that the Navajo considered peyote not only asacrament, but an actual object of worship similar to the bread andwine in certain Christian churches. (Woody, supra, 61 Cal.2d 716,721.)     The Navajo were convicted of violating former Health andSafety Code section 11500.  In reversing that conviction, theCalifornia Supreme Court held that the state may abridge religiouspractices only upon a determination that some compelling stateinterest outweighs the defendant's interests in religious freedom.(Woody, supra, 61 Cal.2d 716, 718.)  The Court then set forth atwo-pronged test with respect to the defense of religious freedom:First it must be determined whether the statute in question imposesany burden upon the free exercise of the defendant's religion, andsecond, if there is such a burden, whether some compelling stateinterest justifies the infringement. (Woody, sutra, 61 Cal.2d 716,718, citing, Sherbert v. Verner (1963) 374 U.S. 398 [10 L.Ed 2d965, 83 S.Ct. 1790].)     In Woody, the Court held that the Navajo's use of peyote wassuch an integral part of their religious faith that it would be                               22 impossible to prohibit its use without inhibiting the practice ofthe faith itself, and therefore, prohibition of the use of peyotewould constitute a burden on their exercise of religion. (Woody,supra, 61 Cal.2d 716, 716.)  The Woody Court then found that theevidence indicated there was no compelling reason for theprohibition of Peyotism.  Specifically, peyote was not used inplace of proper medical care, and there was no evidence that theNavajo who used peyote were more liable to become addicted to othernarcotics than non-peyote-using Navajo.  Additionally, the recorddid not substantiate the state's fear of indoctrination of smallchildren.  Finally, the expert evidence demonstrated that the useof peyote presented no permanent deleterious injury to the Navajo.(Woody, 61 Cal.2d at 722.)    In Employment Division Department of Human Resources of Oregonv. Smith (1990) 494 U.S. 872 [108 L. Ed. 2d 876], the Supreme Courtheld that under the Free Exercise Clause, a law that burdensreligious practice need not be justified by a compellinggovernmental interest if it is neutral and of generalapplicability.  However, Congress responded to that Supreme Courtdecision by enacting The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993,42 U.S. 2OOObb.  The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, in itsdeclaration of purpose, states that Congress finds "in EmploymentDivision v. Smith (1990) 494 U.S. 872 [108 L.Ed.2d 876, 110 S.Ct.1595], the Supreme Court virtually eliminated the requirement thatthe government justify burdens on religious exercise imposed bylaws neutral toward religion."  Congress thus enacted the Religious                               23 Freedom Restoration Act in order "to restore the compellinginterest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner (1963) 374 U.S.398 [10 L.Ed.2d 965, 83 S.Ct. 1790] and Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972)406 U.S. 205 [32 L.Ed.2d 15, 92 S.Ct. 1526] and to guarantee itsapplication in all cases where free exercise of religion issubstantially burdened." (42 U.S.C. 2OOObb, subd. (b) (1).)C.   Burden on Appellant's Free Exercise of Religion     Like the peyote used by the Navajo church in Woody, theevidence in the instant case demonstrated that the Israel ZionCoptic Church considers marijuana to be a sacrament as well as anactual object of worship.  At trial, appellant testified on cross-examination as follows:     Q.   You spoke yesterday about the importance of          religion to your life.  Now describe for us the          importance of marijuana, ganja, to your religion.     A.   The herb was part of the whole doctrine that I          received when I came and reasoned with brothers in          the church.  They--they told me about the          Rastafarian doctrine, that it was a three-part          doctrine, it was the herb, the word, and the man.          They explained that to me.  They said that the man          is what we are, and that the word is the truth and          the wisdom and understanding that God has given to          us, and the herb is the sacrament, the burnt          offering that we offer to God, and that the smoke          carries our prayers up to God then.     Q.   What I'm asking is not for you to describe the          particular uses and meaning of marijuana, but just          to tell us how important it is to the religion          itself.     A.   It's one of the three parts of the Trinity, the          herb, the word, and the man.     Q.   What I'm saying is--                               24      A.   Without the herb, you wouldn't have the Holy          Trinity.  You would have the word and the man.  It          would be a two-part doctrine.  It wouldn't be a          three-part doctrine.  To be a Trinity, there has to          be three.  Herb, word, and man.  You can't take any          one of those parts away and have that three-part          doctrine.     Q.   All right.     A.   It's so important that if you take it away, you no          longer have a three-part doctrine.  You no longer          have a holy Trinity.     Q.   Would it be fair to say that the ganja is at the          center of the belief?     A.   When you have three things--I don't know if it          would be at the center.     Q.   But sharing with those other two?     A.   Pardon me.     Q.   Sharing with those other two, is it at the center?     A.   It--right.     Q.   And you said that your life yesterday would lose          meaning without your religion?     A.   Absolutely.     Q.   So would it be fair to say that your world revolves          around ganja?     . . . .     A.   My world revolves around ganja?  Ganja is a part of          my religion.  It's a part of my spiritual          expression and understanding and trying to          understand the mysteries of God.  Whether my--my          world revolves around ganja as much as it revolves          around the word of God and my brothers and sisters.     Q.   When you say that--when you describe that          centrality of marijuana to your beliefs, how do you          know that?  How do you know that marijuana is          critical to your religion, or ganja?                               25      A.   I know that because that's how I began to revelate.          That's how I began to understand.  And the mystery          of the scriptures was open to me.     Q.   This is personal enlightenment?     A.   Yes, it's personal enlightenment.     Q.   I assume you had that enlightenment while consuming          ganja?     A.   Yes, I did.(R.T. pp. 377-379.)     Appellant's testimony demonstrated that under the Israel ZionCoptic doctrine, marijuana, or ganja, is a sacrament as well as apart of the holy Trinity.  It is one of the three central elementsof the Israel Zion Coptic doctrine, and is critical to the exerciseof the religion and to personal enlightenment.     The trial court's decision also reflected that the evidencehad proven the importance and centrality of marijuana to the IsraelZion Coptic Church.  Specifically. the trial judge held:     The Court will further find that a principal tenet of the     Israel Zion Coptic Church is to use marijuana as a     sacramental herb in an unstructured fashion not confined     to any particular time/place, or ritual of worship.     Church members believe that God is experienced or that     one may commune with God through the smoking of     marijuana. (R.T. p. 519.)As in Woody, the evidence in the instant case demonstrated thatappellant's use of marijuana is such an integral part of hisreligious faith that it would be impossible to prohibit its usewithout inhibiting the practice of the faith itself.  Prohibitionof appellant's use of marijuana would constitute a burden on thefree exercise of his religion.  Therefore, appellant passes thefirst prong of the Woody test.                               26 D.   Compelling State Interest     The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that there is nocompelling state interest which justifies the impingement ofappellant's free exercise of religion.  The testimony of John P.Morgan, M.D.4, included a discussion of a 1995 study performed inJamaica regarding the toxicological effects of marijuana. (R.T.pp. 150-154.)  The study was funded by the United States NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse, NIDA. (R.T. p. 151.)  According to thisstudy, the long-term effects of high doses5 of cannabis wereextremely modest.     Specifically, there was no evidence of impaired immune systemsor impaired pulmonary function, and no evidence of cognitive orpsychological dysfunction. (R.T. p. 153.)  Likewise, there are noepidemiologic studies showing any increased prevalence of cancer inmarijuana smokers (R.T. p. 163).  And there is no evidence of braindamage as a result of marijuana use. (R.T. p. 168.)  Furthermore,there is no evidence that cannabis causes harm to the endocrinesystem or the reproductive system, (R.T. p. 169) and no evidence of___________________     4Dr. Morgan is a medical professor in the Department ofPharmacology at the City University of New York Medical School.  Hewas at one time the acting chairman of that department; however, heresigned two years ago.  He is also a member of the AmericanSociety of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, the Drug PolicyFoundation, and the International Association of Cannabis Research.Dr. Morgan's various publications include his work which appears inthe Merk Manual, a medical resource which sells a million copiesper year. (R.T. pp. 141-146.)     5The typical American joint contains one-half to one gram ofmarijuana.  However, Jamaican joints contain five to ten times thatamount.  In the Jamaican study, the individuals selected consumedseven to eight of the Jamaican marijuana cigarettes daily. (R.T. p.151.)                               27 damage to newborn babies whose mothers are very heavy ganja users.(R.T. p. 171.)     Surprisingly, despite the various studies funded by the UnitedStates Government, the only adverse effect which has been proven isthat chronic marijuana smokers sometimes show bronchitis, orirritation in their trachea and bronchiolus. (R.T. p. 161.)However, Dr. Morgan testified that such changes are very minor andwill resolve when the marijuana is discontinued. (R.T. p. 161.)     The increased incidence and severity of bronchitis inmarijuana users is much less than that of tobacco smokers. (R.T.pp. 161-162.)  Dr. Morgan testified that:     . . . [T]he kind of change seen in the large bronchiolus     is not the kind of change that we see in tobacco smokers     in the periphery of the lungs which leads to chronic     bronchitis and emphysema.  None of the cannabis smokers     have progressed at all to the pulmonary cripples that we     see in chronic bronchitis and emphysema. (R.T. p. 161.)     Further, unlike tobacco, cannabis has an extremely lowaddiction potential. (R.T. p. 156-157.)  There is no evidence thatthe use of marijuana will lead to "hard drugs." (R.T. p. 181-182.)With regard to addiction and toxicity, Dr. Morgan testified:     Q.   What is your opinion as to the relative toxicity of          cannabis as opposed to alcohol?     A.   Basically, cannabis is much, much lower in toxicity          than alcohol any way you look at it.  Even given          that most individuals who consume alcohol consume          it at relatively low doses and don't have much          harm, those individuals who consume it in high          doses often experience harm, harm of a serious          sort, and cannabis does not produce that kind of          harm.          Tobacco is a slightly different issue but still a          very important one.  Tobacco, because of its means          of administration and to some degree because of the                               28           effects of nicotine, is also a substance that in          chronic use produces significant harm to humans and          much, much greater than this shown for cannabis.     Q.   Has cannabis ever demonstrated an addictive          potential as nicotine?     A.   Not addiction, addiction as an exponentially tested          concept, and without being wordy, people still          argue about what constitutes addiction, but there          certainly--even though there are a few users of          cannabis that appear to use in very, very high          doses and say to themselves and to others I wish I          could stop but I find it hard to stop, and those          people could be described as having an addictive-          type behavior.  The prevalence of that is so low in          comparison to tobacco users or even to alcohol          users that I prefer to say that cannabis has an          extremely low addiction potential.(R.T. pp. 156-157.)     Dr. Morgan also testified that the Israel Zion Coptic Churchmembers follow certain rituals to prevent adverse effects frommarijuana use:     Q.   Briefly for the record, could you describe what you          mean by a ritualistic use from your observation or          from the reports you've learned?     A.   When I use the term "ritual," I'm talking about a          rule-bound circumstance of use.  Whether the rules          are written out or lectured about is not important          but that the rules tend to be followed.          For example, the Zion Coptic users, both the Israel          and the Ethiopian sect, tend to use [marijuana] in          groups, although not always.  They tend to use it          in the context of a process they call reasoning in          which they will sit and talk to each other and          explore the spirituality of their lives and the          impact of the drug. . . .     Q.   Do you have an opinion as to what effect this          ritualistic use has on abuse potential of cannabis?     A.   I certainly do.  When people use drugs in a rule-          bound, constrained ritualistic fashion, they really          are protected from toxicity.  They are protected          from both behavioral and other kinds of harmfulness                               29           because, of course, it's rules that keeps us all          safe when using dangerous substances and dangerous          things.  You know, the power tool manufacturers          publish rules on how you should use power tools,          and if you follow those rules, by and large you          will be protected.(R.T. pp. 158-159.)     The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that marijuana,even in very high doses, is a relatively benign substance, and isnot nearly as detrimental as other legalized substances such asalcohol and tobacco.  Given these factors, there is no compellingstate interest which would justify the state's infringement uponappellant's use of marijuana in the free exercise of his religion.     In conclusion, the final passage of Woody speaks to theimportance of preserving the right to free religious expression:          We know that some will urge that it is more     important to subserve the rigorous enforcement of     narcotic laws than to carve out of them an exception for     a few believers in a strange faith.  They will say that     the exception may produce problems of enforcement and     that the dictate of the state must overcome the beliefs     of a minority of Indians.  But the problems of     enforcement here do not inherently differ from those of     other situations which call for the detection of fraud.     On the other hand, the right to free religious expression     embodies a precious heritage of our history.  In a mass     society, which presses at every point toward conformity,     the protection of self-expression, however unique, of the     individual and the group becomes ever more important.     The varying currents of the subcultures that flow into     the mainstream of our national life give it depth and     beauty. . . .(Woody, supra, 61 Cal.2d 716, 727-728.)                               30                           CONCLUSION     Although the appellant was found guilty of possessingmarijuana for purposes of sale, the evidence presented at trialdemonstrated that appellant had no intent to sell the marijuana hehad obtained.  Rather, the marijuana was to be given away as asacrament.  Hence, the judgment of conviction should be vacated.     Further, the trial court acknowledged that the appellantsincerely adheres to a religion which considers marijuana to be asacrament as well as an actual object of worship, and that theappellant's "religious practices may be constitutionallyprotected."  Nevertheless, the trial court convicted appellant forillegal commercial activity, i.e., possessing and transportingmarijuana.  The court thus "side-stepped" the freedom of religionissue.  Appellant's constitutional right to free exercise ofreligion through the partaking of the sacrament is meaninglesswithout the right to possess and transport that sacrament.  Thus,the First Amendment issues presented in this case must be remandedfor a determination of whether there is some compelling stateinterest which would justify the burden placed on appellant'sreligious freedoms.     Finally, the terms of probation prohibiting the appellant fromassociating with anyone who uses marijuana effectively preventappellant from associating with his church brethren.  This issuemust also be remanded for a determination regarding any compellingstate interest which would justify the burden on the appellant'sFirst Amendment rights.                               31                         PROOF OF SERVICE            STATE OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO     I reside in the county of SAN DIEGO, State of California     I am over the age of 18 and not a party to the within action.My business address is 5385 Toscana Way, San Diego, CA. 92122.

The court of appeals ruled against Olsen in an opinion written by Ginsburg. 'We hold that the First Amendment's free exercise of religion guarantee does not require the requested exception, and that petitioner (0lsen) was not denied equal protection-establishment clause rights by the government's refusal." Ginsberg displays her adherence to a bigoted consensus excluding the use of cannabis as a religious sacrament. She joins the collective denial of the judiciary despite extensive evidence of cannabis use in the Hindu and other religions. A Jew sold out to the pharaohs. Capo for the state. "We conclude that the DEA cannot accommodate Olsen's religious use of marijuana without unduly burdening or disrupting enforcement of the federal marijuana laws." She unwittingly acknowledges Olsen's religious motivation for using marijuana. She then affirms and rationalizes his persecution. The grounds: inability of the vast DEA organization to accommodate are "burdening and disrupting". Ginsberg, state religious persecutor. Judge Ruth Bader Ginsberg bares her view of the state and the individual which is clearly authoritarian, and will guarantee the continuation of the erosion of civil rights by the supreme court.WT01-B19-17IA087-000632-B046-80http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/COPTIC/LETTERS/letters.html 206.61.184.43 19970122073302 text/html 2509HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:32:56 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:04:12 GMTContent-length: 2294 LETTERS LETTERS Jim Tranmer to Jeff Brown - October 29, 1996 Brian Tranmer to Carl Olsen - October 23,1996 Jim Tranmer to Carl Olsen - September 6, 1996 Jim Tranmer to Carl Olsen - September 4, 1996 Jeff Brown to Carl Olsen - August 20, 1996 Carl Olsen to Brian Tranmer - July 23, 1996 Brian Tranmer to Carl Olsen - July 18, 1996 Carl Olsen to Brian Tranmer - June 29, 1996 Brian Tranmer to Carl Olsen (June 22, 1996) Christopher Harrison to Carl Olsen (May 24,1996) Carl E.

Sept. 3, 1991       Non-Indian member of Native American church was indicted for importing peyote through mail and possessing it with intent to distribute.  He moved to dismiss.  The District Court, Burciaga, Chief Judge, held that: (1) permitting Indians' nondrug use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of Native American church, but prohibiting such use by non-Indians, would violate free exercise and equal protection clauses; (2) compelling interest test applied to free exercise challenge to prosecution of non-Indian member, and (3) prosecution would violate free exercise clause.

THERE is a genius to our Constitution.  Its genius is that it speaks to the freedoms of the individual.  It is this genius that brings the present matter before the Court.  More specifically, this matter concerns a freedom that was a natural idea whose genesis was in the Plymouth Charter, and finds its present form in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution -- the freedom of religion.       The Government's "war on drugs" has become a wildfire that threatens to consume those fundamental rights of the individual deliberately enshrined in our Constitution.  Ironically, as we celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, the tattered Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and the now frail Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination or deprivation of liberty without due process have fallen as casualties in this "war on drugs."  It was naive of this Court to hope that this erosion of constitutional protections would stop at the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  But today, the "war" targets one of the most deeply held fundamental rights -- the First Amendment right to freely exercise one's religion.       To us in the Southwest, this freedom of religion has singular significance because it affects diverse cultures.  It is as much of us as the rain on our hair, the wind on the grass, and the sun on our faces.  It is so naturally a part of us that when the joy of this beautiful freedom sings in our souls, we find it hard to conceive that it could ever be imperiled.  Yet, today, in this land of bright blue skies and yellow grass, of dusty prairies and beautiful mesas, and vistas of red earth with walls of weathered rock, eroded by oceans of time, the free spirit of the individual once again is threatened by the arrogance of Government.       The issue presented is the recurring conflict between the Native American Church members' right to freely exercise their religion through the ceremonial use of peyote and the Government's efforts to eradicate illegal drugs.  To the Government, peyote is a dangerous hallucinogen.  To Robert Boyll, peyote is both a sacrament and a deity essential to his religion.  But this matter concerns competing interests greater than those relating to this small, spineless cactus having psychedelic properties.  It draws forth a troublesome constitutional conflict which arises from fundamentally different perspectives of peyote.       In its "war" to free our society of the devastating effects of drugs, the Government slights its duty to observe the fundamental freedom of individuals to practice the religion of their choice, regardless of race.  Simply put, the Court is faced with the quintessential constitutional conflict between an inalienable right upon which this 1335 U.S. v. BOYLL Cite as 774 F.Supp. 1333 (D.N.M. 1991)  country, was founded and the response by the Government to the swelling political passions of the day.  In this fray, the Court is compelled to halt this menacing attack on our constitutional freedoms.       On May 10, 1990, the Federal Grand Jury indicted Robert Lawrence Boyll, a non-Native American, for unlawfully importing through the United States mail and possessing peyote with the intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. �� 952(a), 960(b)(3), 843(b) & (c), & 841(a)(1) (1981).  The three-count indictment arose out of Mr. Boyll mailing himself a quantity of peyote front Mexico to his home in San Cristobal, New Mexico.       In his motions to dismiss, Mr. Boyll argues that the indictment violates his First Amendment right to freely exercise his religion.  Mr. Boyll also claims that, pursuant to 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31 (1990), the listing of peyote as a controlled substance does not apply to him because he is a member of the Native American Church and he imported and possessed peyote for use in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native American Church.       The United States adopts a racially restrictive reading of 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31, arguing that the protection contained therein applies only to members of the Native American Church who are American Indians.  It claims that Mr. Boyll cannot be a member of the Native American Church because "membership is limited to persons who [sic] ethnic descent is at least twenty-five percent derived from American Indian stock, and to the spouses of such persons"; that, therefore, Mr. Boyll cannot be a member of the Native American Church since neither he nor his spouse is twenty-five percent American Indian.       The Court held an evidentiary hearing in this matter on October 18, 1990.  It immediately became apparent that an examination and understanding of the history and present structure of the Peyote Religion and the Native American Church, as well as of 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31, is essential to a faithful resolution of the issues presented by Mr. Boyll's motions.       The following will constitute the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law.       The peyote plant is a small, spineless cactus having psychedelic properties and the experience of eating it is central to the Peyote Religion. [footnote 1]  Unlike traditional religions which have sacramental symbols such as bread and wine, peyote is more than a sacrament to members of the Native American Church.  Peyote is, itself, considered a deity which cannot be owned by any individual.  Peyote is worshipped and eaten at a religious ceremony called a peyote meeting.  "Peyote is a sacred medicine; peyote protects; peyote allows one to see the future, or to find lost objects; peyote gives power to the user that may be manifest in various ways; peyote teaches; peyote may be used by Christians or may be incorporated with Christian ideas; a pilgrimage to gather peyote plants is viewed as an act of piety to be undertaken if possible...."  Omer C. Stewart [footnote 2], Peyote Religion 41 (1987).  It is considered sacrilegious to use peyote for nonreligious purposes.       The peyote ceremony is unique and the very cornerstone of the Peyote Religion.  It is always conducted by individuals who hold honored posts which have specially assigned duties.  The leader of the ceremony is called a "roadman."  The roadman is responsible for initiating the participants, although worshipers who are not personally invited are usually welcomed as well.  Other officials present at a peyote meeting  --------------------    [footnote 1]  This Court is mindful that "[i]t is not within   the judicial ken to question the centrality of particular   beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of    particular litigants interpretation of those creeds."   Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U.S. 680, 699, 109 S.Ct.   2136, 2149, 104 L.Ed.2d 766 (1989).    [footnote 2]  Mr. Omer C. Stewart testified at the   evidentiary hearing in this case.  He is a distinguished   scholar of the Peyote Religion.  The Court found his   testimony invaluable.  Many of the Court's findings of fact   relating to the Peyote Religion and the Native American   Church can be attributed to Professor Stewart's testimony   and his well-known book on the subject which was admitted   into evidence as Defendant's exhibit 1. 1336 744 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT  include the chief drummer, who sits on the right of the roadman; the cedarman, who sits on the left of the roadman and sprinkles sagebrush "incense" on the fire; and the fireman or doorman, who tends the fire and sits near the opening of the teepee.  Each meeting also has a sponsor who is responsible for securing a site, the roadman, the teepee and other materials necessary for the service.  Although not all ceremonies of the Native American Church are identical, the general concepts have been so well defined, so established in traditional practice, that they have not changed significantly for nearly a hundred years.  Peyote Religion at 36, 339-75.  At these peyote meetings, the worshipers usually gather in a teepee at dusk and the ceremony passes through a series of ritualistic stages.  During these rituals, a staff and a rattle are passed around and the person who receives them leads in singing peyote hymns and prayer.  Around midnight, peyote is ingested by the worshipers and the singing, praying and drumming continues throughout the night until dawn.  When the "buttons" of the plant are eaten, or brewed into tea and imbibed, the user experiences hallucinations.  The peyote plant produces "a warm and pleasant euphoria, an agreeable point of view, relaxation, colorful visual distortions, and a sense of timelessness that are conducive to the all-night ceremony of the Native American Church."  Peyote Religion at 3.  Finally, at noon of the following day, all worshipers share in a ceremonial feast.  See generally Peyote Religion at 327-336 (description of peyote ritual); T. Hillerman, People of Darkness 153 (1980) (description of Navajo peyote ritual).       The Native American Church combines elements of Christianity with traditional Native American beliefs and the sacramental use of peyote.  Peyote Religion at 33; Toledo v. Nobel-Sysco, Inc., 892 F.2d 1481, 1485 (10th Cir.1989), cert. denied, --- U.S. ---, 110 S.Ct. 2208, 109 L.Ed.2d 535 (1990).  Although the religious use of peyote has existed for centuries, the Peyote Religion's corporate form, the Native American Church, was established in Oklahoma in 1918.  At that time, the leaders of the Peyote Religion reasoned that an "incorporated" church would provide greater protection from early attempts to suppress the use of peyote for religious purposes.       While the Oklahoma Chapter of the Native American Church is sentimentally referred to as the Mother Church, no single branch speaks for the numerous branches throughout the United States.  Unlike more traditional churches, the Native American Church is a non-hierarchical church and has no central organization which dictates church policy.  The Native American Church consists of a number of loosely affiliated local chapters.  Each chapter is responsible for establishing its own charter, if it so chooses.  "Each congregation makes its own rules, just as each meeting is conducted by its own roadman."  Peyote Religion at 334.  Nevertheless, the teachings of all the Native American Church chapters are essentially the same.       "Church" refers to a body of believers and their shared practices, rather than the existence of a formal structure or a membership roll.  Membership in the Native American Church derives from the sincerity of one's beliefs and participation in its ceremonies.  Historically, the church has been hospitable to and, in fact, has proselytized non-Indians.  The vast majority of Native American Church congregations, like most conventional congregations, maintains an "open door" policy and does not exclude persons on the basis of their race.  Racial restrictions to membership have never been a general part of Peyote Religion or of the Native American Church. See Peyote Religion at 333-34; State v. Whittingham, 19 Ariz.App. 27, 28, 504 P.2d 950, 951 (1973) (membership to non-Indians is usually not refused), review denied, 110 Ariz. 279, 517 P.2d 1275, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 946, 94 S.Ct. 3071, 41 L.Ed.2d 667 (1974).  Although one branch of the Native American Church, the Native American Church of North America, is known to restrict membership to Native Americans, most other branches of the Native American Church do not.  As a result, non-Indian  1337 U.S. v. BOYLL Cite as 774 F.Supp. 1333 (D.N.M. 1991)  members are accepted within the Native American Church. [footnote 3]       Since attending his first ceremony of the Native American Church at Taos, New Mexico, in 1981, Mr. Boyll has been, and continues to be, an active member of the Native American Church.  In fact, while living in Mill Valley, California, from 1981 until 1989, Mr. Boyll participated in ceremonies of the Native American Church an average of once every two to three weeks.  Mr.  Boyll often sponsored these meetings or participated as a drummer, cedarman or fireman.  He sincerely believes in the teachings and practices of the Native American Church. [footnote 4]  He has only used peyote in connection with bona fide religious purposes and has never been excluded from the Native American Church because of his non-Indian race.       In 1989, motivated in part by his commitment to the Native American Church, Mr. Boyll moved to New Mexico.  He continues his active participation in meetings of Native American Church congregations in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado.  During one specific peyote meeting, Mr. Boyll was explicitly recognized as a member of the Native American Church by Rutherford Loneman, a well-known roadman who is also a former Vice-Chairman of the Native American Church in Oklahoma.  Yet, Mr. Boyll has always considered himself a member of the Native American Church rather than of a specific branch.       The act of traveling to the place where peyote is harvested is considered an act of piety which has its own rewards.  The long, sacred pilgrimage to harvest peyote is considered to be one of the most important aboriginal traditions of the Peyote Religion.  Peyote Religion at 31-32 ("When the [peyote]-seekers arrive [back] at their homes, the people turn out to welcome the plants with music, and a festival....").  Peyote is grown only in northern Mexico and the Rio Grande Valley of southern Texas.  Peyote is not grown anywhere else and its growth area, especially in the United States, is being considerably depleted.  Peyote Religion at 334-35.       Because the peyote fields in Texas are depleted, Mr. Boyll went on a "pilgrimage" to Mexico to obtain peyote for himself and members of the congregations with whom he worships.  From Mexico, Mr. Boy11 mailed the peyote to his post office box in San Cristobal, New Mexico, to avoid violating Texas law, which restricts religious possession and use of peyote only to Native Americans.  See Tex. Health & Safety Code Anno. � 481.111 (Vernon 1989).  On April 27, 1990, Mr. Boyll picked up the parcel of peyote from the post office in San Cristobal, New Mexico.  He was on his way to deliver the peyote to Tellus Goodmorning, an elder of the Taos Pueblo and nationally respected roadman, when he was arrested.       The Court will first address whether 21 C.F.R. � 1307.21 applies to all sincere menders of the Native American Church, in-  --------------------    [footnote 3]  See Stacy Diven's affidavit (August 17, 1990)   ("During my fifteen years as a member of the Native American   Church, I have encountered isolated instances of opposition   by Indian members of the church to non-Indian participation.   However, in my experience, most Indian members of the Native   American Church accept sincere white worshipers willingly");   John Kimmey's affidavit (August 3, 1990) ("The attempt by   some members of the Native American Church and by the   government to restrict membership in the church to Indians   is foreign to the basic beliefs of many Native American   Church members in the American Church of God [the Taos, N.M.   branch] and in other branches of the Native American Church.   Non-Indians have been and continue to be full, legitimate   members both of the American Church of God and of other   branches of the Native American Church."); Alden Naranjo's   affidavit (August 15, 1990) ("As the son of practicing   members of the Native American Church, I have been taught   since early childhood that the door to our church is open to   all faithful, sincere, and believing persons.  Many   non-Indians in my experience are and continue to be full   legitimate members of the Native American Church.  I regard   any attempt to restrict membership to Indians as misguided").    [footnote 4]  See Lawrence Boyll's affidavit (August 2, 1990)   (attesting to his sincere participation in the Native   American Church); Stacy Diven's affidavit (Aug. 17, 1990)    (same); Jimmy Reyna's affidavit (Aug. 1, 1990) (same); John   Kimmey's affidavit (Aug. 3, 1990) (same); Alden Naranjo's   affidavit (Aug. 15, 1990) (same). 1338 774 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT  cluding Mr. Boyll, or whether it excludes non-Indian members.  Stated differently, does the federal exemption place a racial restriction on membership in the Native American Church?       [1]  As far back as the late 18th century, efforts were being made to restrict the ceremonial use of peyote.  See Peyote Religion at 128-147.  However, not until the popularity of psychedelic drugs in the 1960's did Congress restrict the possession, consumption and sale of peyote.  See Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, 79 Stat. 226 � 3(a).  Thereafter, for the first time, peyote was classified as a Schedule I controlled substance.  See Controlled Substance Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. � 812(c), Schedule I(c)(12).  But Congress never intended to prohibit the ceremonial use of peyote.  See Kennedy v. Bureau of Narcotics & Dangerous Drugs, 459 F.2d 415, 419 (9th Cir.1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1115, 93 S.Ct. 901, 34 L.Ed.2d 699 (1973); Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Meese, 698 F.Supp. 1342, 1346 (N.D.Tex.1988); Native American Church of New York v. United States, 468 F.Supp. 1247, 1449-51 (S.D.N.Y.1979), aff'd, 633 F.2d 205 (2d Cir.1980); People v.  Woody, 61 Cal.2d 716, 40 Cal.Rptr. 69, 73-74, 394 P.2d 813, 817-18 (1964).  In implementing regulations, Congress exempted the religious use of peyote by members of the Native American Church.  See 11 Cong.Rec. 14608, 15977 (1965); see also Native American Church, 468 F.Supp. at 1249-50; Peyote Way Church of God, lnc. v. Smith, 742 F.2d 193, 197 n. 15 (5th Cir.1984). The Drug Enforcement Administration regulation relating to the listing of peyote as a controlled substance provides:    SPECIAL EXEMPT PERSONS   � 1307.31  Native American Church.      The listing of peyote as a controlled substance   [under federal law) does not apply to the nondrug   use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of   the Native American Church, and members of the   Native American Church so using peyote are exempt   from registration.  21 C.F.R. � 1307.31.  As many as three states have similar statutory or judicially crafted exemptions in their drug laws for the religious use of peyote.  N.M.Stat.Ann. � 30-31-6(D) (Supp.1989); Colo.Rev.Stat. � 12-22-317(3) (1990); Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. � 13-3402(B)(l)-(3) (1989); Kan.Stat.Ann. � 65-4116(c)(8) (1985); Utah Code Ann. � 58-37-3(3) (1986).       "The language of a regulation or statute is the starting point for its interpretation."  Dyer v. United States, 832 F.2d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir.1987) (citing Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980)).  "The plain meaning governs unless a clearly expressed legislative intent is to the contrary."  Id.  "When we find the terms of a statute unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete."  Rubin v. United States, 449 U.S. 424, 430, 101 S.Ct. 698, 701-02, 66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981); see also, e.g., Wilson v. Stocker, 819 F.2d 943, 948 (10th Cir.1987).       The language of 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31 is clear, unambiguous and wholly consistent with the regulation's history and purpose.  The plain language of 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31 exempts all worshipers engaged "in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native American Church."  The regulation plainly declares Congress' purpose to exempt Native American Church members.  Nowhere is it even suggested that the exemption applies only to Indian members of the Native American Church.  Had the intent been to exclude non-Indian members, as the United States argues, the language of the exemption would have so clearly provided.  Indeed, the federal peyote exemption makes no reference whatsoever to a racial exclusion.  Compare 21 C.F.R. � 1307-31 & N.M.Stat.Ann. 30-31-6(D) (Supp.1989) with Tex.Health & Safety Code Anno. � 481.111 (Vernon 1989) (including the language "[t]he exemption granted to members of the Native American Church under this section does not apply to a member with less than 25 percent Indian Blood").  The plain language of the federal peyote exemption applies to all members of the Native American Church, regardless of race.  Cf.  Native American Church, 468 1339 U.S. v. BOYLL Cite as 774 F.Supp. 1333 (D.N.M. 1991)  F.Supp. at 1251 (rejecting the argument that the exemption should apply to "Indian" churches alone); Kennedy, 459 F.2d at 416-17 (rejecting the Government's proposed racial reading of the exemption: "[w]e cannot say that the Government has a lesser or different interest in protecting the health of Indians than it has in protecting the health of non-Indians").       A racially neutral reading of the exemption is consistent not only with the racially neutral language of the exemption but also with its legislative history.  During hearings on the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, a representative of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, presently the Drug Enforcement Agency, explained the rationale for the special exemption and assured Congress that the exemption would not be affected by the new legislation:    We consider the Native American Church to be sui   generis.  The history and tradition of the church   is such that there is no question but that they   regard peyote as a deity as it were, and we will   continue the exemption.  (emphasis added).  Native American Church, 468 F.Supp. at 1251 (quoting Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1970, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Public Health & Welfare of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 117-18 (1970)).  Clearly, the nature and history of the Native American Church played a significant role in the promulgation of 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31.  As the uncontradicted evidence in this case shows, the history of the Native American Church attests to the fact that non-Indian worshipers have always been, and continue to be, active and sincere members of the Native American Church.       The Government's racially restrictive reading and application of the exemption reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the history and present structure of the Native American Church.  Indeed, the Drug Enforcement Administration's own rationale acknowledges that the exemption is not based on the racial makeup of the Native American Church membership.  See Olsen v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 878 F.2d 1458, 1465-1468 (D.C.Cir.1989) (final order of the Drug Enforcement Administration in connection with the exemption makes no mention of any distinction between Indian and non-Indian members of the Native American Church).  While there may exist some legitimate support for the argument that Congress never intended to extend the exemption to non-Native American Church members, see Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Thornburgh, 922 F.2d 1210 (5th Cir.1991); but see Native American Church, 468 F.Supp. at 1249-51, the plain language of the exemption and the legislative history clearly support this Court's finding that Congress intended the exemption to apply to all members of the Native American Church, Indian and non-Indian alike.       The Court also finds persuasive Mr. Boyll's argument that to construe the racially neutral language of the exemption "to provide only racially discriminatory protection would place the exemption unnecessarily in direct conflict with the first amendment."  Such a consequence would, at the very least, violate the canon of statutory construction that "[f]ederal statutes are to be construed as to avoid serious doubts of their constitutionality."  Int'l Ass'n of Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 749, 81 S.Ct. 1784, 1789-90, 6 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1961); see also Hooper v. California, 155 U.S. 648, 657, 15 S.Ct. 207, 211, 39 L.Ed. 297 (1895); United States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459 U.S. 70, 78, 103 S.Ct. 407, 412, 74 L.Ed.2d 235 (1982).  "[T]his principle is fully applicable to cases such as the instant one, in which a ... constitutionally suspect statutory interpretation is embodied in an administrative regulation."  Rust v. Sullivan, --- U.S. ---, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 1778, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).       [2]  The Court will next address the constitutional question of whether the indictment violates Mr. Boyll's First Amendment right to freely exercise his religion.  It is disingenuous for the Government to contend that its racially restrictive reading of 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31 -- which would restrict 1340 774 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT  religious freedom through the imposition of a racial exclusion -- does not give rise to valid constitutional concerns.  Since the use of peyote by Native American Church members is the very essence of their religious beliefs, the proposed racially restrictive reading of 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31 would have the sure effect of imposing a racial exclusion to membership in the Native American Church itself.  To exclude individuals of a particular race from being members of a recognized religious faith is offensive to the very heart of the First Amendment.  See Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York, 397 U.S. 664, 668-69, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1411-12, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) (the First Amendment's Establishment Clause ensures that governmental interference with religion will not be tolerated).  In fact, there can be no more excessive entanglement of Government with religion than the Government's attempt to impose a racial restriction to membership in a religious organization.  The decision as to who can and who cannot be members of the Native American Church is an internal church judgment which the First Amendment shields from governmental interference.  Cf. Paul v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society, 819 F.2d 875, 878, n. 1. (9th Cir.) (constitutionally improper for government to resolve a dispute about religious doctrine or practices), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 926, 108 S.Ct. 289, 98 L.Ed.2d 249 (1987).  It is one thing for a local branch of the Native American Church to adopt its own restrictions on membership, but it is entirely another for the Government to restrict membership in a religious organization on the basis of race.  Any such attempt to restrict religious liberties along racial lines would not only be a contemptuous affront to the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of religion but also to the Fourteenth Amendment right to equal justice under the law.       Applying the above-mentioned canon of statutory construction, we find that the United States' racially restrictive reading of 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31 does raise the sort of "grave and doubtful constitutional questions," United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408, 29 S.Ct. 527, 535, 53 L.Ed. 836 (1909), that would lead this Court to assume Congress did not intend such an interpretation.  Federal Trade Comm'n v. American Tobacco Co., 264 U.S. 298, 305-307, 44 S.Ct. 336, 337-338, 68 L.Ed. 696 (1924) (assuming Congress legislates in the light of constitutional limitations).       The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging of freedom, ... or the right of the people to assemble...."  U.S. Const.Amend. I.  While the freedom to act upon religious beliefs is not absolute, "only those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion."  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 215, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1533, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972).  Traditional free exercise jurisprudence has long held that in order for government to substantially burden religiously motivated conduct, Government must justify such restrictions by a compelling state interest and use means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See Hernandez v. Commisioner, 490 U.S. 680, 699, 109 S.Ct. 2136, 2148-49, 104 L.Ed.2d 766 (1989); United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 257-58, 102 S.Ct. 1051, 1055-56, 71 L.Ed.2d 127 (1982); Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Secur. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 717-19, 101 S.Ct 1425, 1431-32, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 403, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1793-94, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963).       In order for government action to withstand a challenge under the Free Exercise Clause, the action must satisfy the two-step analysis of the compelling interest test.  The Court must first determine whether the Government's action "imposes any burden on the free exercise of [defendant]'s religion."  Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 403, 83 S.Ct. at 1794.  Then, if such burden exists, the Court must "consider whether some compelling state interest ... justifies the substantial infringement of [defendant]'s First Amendment right."  Id. at 406, 83 S.Ct. at 1795.  "The compelling 1341 U.S. v. BOYLL Cite as 774 F.Supp. 1333 (D.N.M. 1991)  interest test reflects the First Amendment's mandate of preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society."  Employment Division, Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 1613, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990) (O'Connor, J., concurring).       [3]  Recently, the Supreme Court in Employment Division, Dept. of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 1603, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990) ["Smith"], elected to abandon the compelling interest test in cases involving a "neutral, generally applicable [criminal] law," reasoning that the application of such a statute does not implicate First Amendment concerns.  Accordingly, without the benefit of any constitutional scrutiny at all, the Court held that Oregon's across-the-board prohibition against peyote was constitutional.       [4]  This Court is convinced that 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31 is "specifically directed to religious practices and therefore not within the ambit of Smith."  Salvation Army v. Dept. of Community Affairs of State of New Jersey, 919 F.2d 183, 194, 204 (3d Cir.1990) (Becker, J., concurring).  The Drug Enforcement Agency regulation in the present case, unlike the statute in Smith, is neither neutral nor generally applicable.  Indeed, the plain language of the exemption speaks directly to "bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native American Church."  Therefore, this Court will proceed to apply the traditional compelling interest test.  See Cf. Id. 110 S.Ct. at 1603 ("where the [Government] has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of 'religious hardships' without compelling reason").       With respect to the first step of the analysis, it is uncontradicted that the racially restrictive interpretation of 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31 would impose a substantial burden on Mr. Boyll's free exercise of religion.  On this issue, the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are not very different from those in Woody, 40 Cal.Rptr. at 72, 74, 394 P.2d at 816, 618, which concluded:    An examination of the record as to the nature of   peyote and its role in the religion practiced by   defendants as [Indian and non-Indian] members of   the Native American Church ... compels the   conclusion that the [racially restrictive]   prohibition most seriously infringes upon the   observance of the religion.       ....    The record thus establishes that the [indictment   for] ... the use of peyote results in a virtual   inhibition of the practice of defendants'   religion.  Id.  Indian and non-Indian "believers who worship at the Native American Church cannot freely exercise their religious beliefs absent the use of peyote."  Whittingham, 19 Ariz.App. at 29, 504 P.2d at 952.  "There is no dispute that [the] criminal prohibition of peyote places a severe burden on the ability of [Defendant] to freely exercise [his] religion."  Smith 110 S.Ct. at 1613 (O'Connor, J., concurring); Peyote Way Church of God, 742 F.2d at 200-01.  Additionally, the Court finds that Mr. Boyll's trip to Mexico to obtain peyote is an integral part of the Peyote Religion practiced by the Native American Church.  Such a substantial infringement necessarily triggers further First Amendment scrutiny.       The Court must next "consider whether some compelling [governmental] interest ... justifies the substantial infringement of [defendant]'s First Amendment right."  Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 406, 83 S.Ct. at 1795.  While the Court is well aware that drug abuse is "one of the greatest problems affecting the health and welfare of our population" and, thus, "one of the most serious problems confronting our society today," National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 668, 674, 109 S.Ct. 1384, 1392, 1395, 103 L.Ed.2d 685 (1989), this amorphous problem, without more, cannot justify the serious infringement on the observance of religion.       First, the United States has failed to present any evidence of a compelling interest to justify its actions in the present case. 1342 774 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT  "In the absence of evidence, we cannot simply assume that the psychedelic is so baneful that its use must be prohibited to a group of [non-Indian] members but poses no equal threat when used by [Indian] members of the Native American Church."  Peyote Way Church of God, 742 F.2d at 201.  In fact, in light of the absence of factual support and the scarcity of legal support for the United States' opposition to Defendant's motions to dismiss, this Court cannot help but believe that the present prosecution is, at best, an overreaction driven by political passions or, at worst, influenced by religious and racial insensitivity, if not outright hostility.       Finally, the existence of 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31 itself, negates the existence of a compelling governmental interest in prosecuting non-Indian members of the Native American Church for their religious use of peyote.  Id. ("The exemption granted both by federal and [state] law to the ritual use of peyote by the Native American Church tends ... to negate the existence of a compelling [governmental] interest in the same use of it").  Indeed, the federal exemption explicitly establishes a governmental interest in preserving the exemption of peyote as a controlled substance for its ritual use by Indian and non-Indian members of the Native American Church.  The only compelling interest in the present case is Congress' considered and continued conviction that the use of peyote in the Native American Church is the kind of free exercise of religion the First Amendment protects.  See, e.g., Native American Church, 468 F.Supp. at 1249-50; Peyote Religion, 128-147.  Finding no compelling interest to justify the constitutional infringement at issue, the Court need not reach the often critical question of balancing two competing interests.       Congress has articulated an unequivocal federal policy protecting the right of the Native American Church and its members to worship, possess and use peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies.  This policy arises out of our country's recognition of the importance of individual freedom.  For,    the right to free religious expression embodies a   precious heritage of our history.  In a mass society,   which presses at every point toward conformity, the   protection of a self-expression, however unique, of   the individual and the group become ever more   important.  The varying currents of the subcultures   that flow into the mainstream of our national life   give it depth and beauty.  Woody, 40 Cal.Rptr. at 77, 394 P.2d at 821; see also 111 Cong.Rec. 15977 (1965).  The court in Woody eloquently speaks to the freedom of the individual.       Individual freedom, whether it be freedom of religion, expression or association, has been particularly important to maintaining the culturally diverse character of New Mexico.  Here, we celebrate the right of the individual to revel in the passions of the spirit.  The survival of this right owes much to the protection afforded by the First Amendment, which has allowed New Mexico's distinct cultures to learn mutual respect for each other's jealously-guarded customs and traditions.  Diversity is New Mexico's enchantment.       For the reasons set out in this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court holds that, pursuant to 21 C.F.R. � 1307.31 (1990), the classification of peyote as a Schedule I controlled substance, see 21 U.S.C. � 812(c), Schedule I(c)(12), does not apply to the importation, possession or use of peyote for bona fide ceremonial use by members of the Native American Church, regardless of race.       Wherefore,       IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Defendant Robert Boyll's motions to dismiss the indictment be and hereby are GRANTED.WT01-B19-19IA087-000631-B004-73http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/RELIGION/rfra.html 206.61.184.43 19970122073648 text/html 6288HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:36:39 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:38:15 GMTContent-length: 6073107 STAT. 1488 PUBLIC LAW 103-141 -- NOV. 16, 1993 Public Law 103-141 103d Congress RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT OF 1993 An Act To protect the free exercise of religion.

(c) JUDICIAL RELIEF.---A person whose religious exercise has been burdened in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.  Standing to assert a claim or defense under this section shall be governed by the general rules of standing under article III of the Constitution. SEC. 4. ATTORNEYS FEES.

Legislative History Section. An Act to emend the American Indian Religious Freedom Act to provide for the traditional use of peyote by Indians for religious purposes, and for other purposes.   Be it enacted by the Senate and House  of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.   This Act may be cited as the "American Indian Religious Free- dom Act Amendments of 1994". SEC. 2. TRADITIONAL INDIAN RELIGIOUS USE OF THE PEYOTE       SACRAMENT.   The Act of August 11, 1978 (42 U.S.C. 1996), commonly referred to as the "American Indian Religious Freedom Act", is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new section:   "SEC. 3. (a) The Congress finds and declares that--       "(1) for many Indian people, the traditional ceremonial    use of the peyote cactus as a religious sacrament has for cen-    turies been integral to a way of life, and significant in    perpetuating Indian tribes and cultures;       "(2) since 1965, this ceremonial use of peyote by Indians    has been protected by Federal regulation;       "(3) while at least 28 States have enacted laws which    are similar to, or are in conformance with, the Federal regula-    tion which protects the ceremonial use of peyote by Indian    religious practitioners, 22 States have not done so, and this    lack of uniformity has created hardship for Indian people who    participate in such religious ceremonies;       "(4) the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case    of Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), held    that the First Amendment does not protect Indian practitioners    who use peyote in Indian religious ceremonies, and also raised    uncertainty whether this religious practice would be protected    under the compelling State interest standard; and       "(5) the lack of adequate and clear legal protection for    the religious use of peyote by Indians may serve to stigmatize    and marginalize Indian tribes and cultures, and increase the    risk that they will be exposed to discriminatory treatment.    "(b)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the use, possession, or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide traditional ceremonial purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited by the United States or any State.  No Indian shall be penalized or discriminated against on the basis of such use, possession or 108 STAT. 3125 P.L. 103-344 LAWS OF 103rd CONG.--2nd SESS. Oct. 6 transportation, including, but not limited to, denial of otherwise applicable benefits under public assistance programs.   "(2) This section does not prohibit such reasonable regulation and registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration of those persons who cultivate, harvest, or distribute peyote as may be consistent with the purposes of this Act.   "(3) This section does not prohibit application of the provisions of section 481.111(a) of Vernon's Texas Health and Safety Code Annotated, in effect on the date of enactment of this section, insofar as those provisions pertain to the cultivation, harvest, and distribu- tion of peyote.   "(4) Nothing in this section shall prohibit any Federal depart- ment or agency, in carrying out its statutory responsibilities and functions, from promulgating regulations establishing reasonable limitations on the use or ingestion of peyote prior to or during the performance of duties by sworn law enforcement officers or personnel directly involved in public transportation or any other safety-sensitive positions where the performance of such duties may be adversely affected by such use or ingestion.  Such regulations shall be adopted only after consultation with representatives of traditional Indian religions for which the sacramental use of peyote is integral to their practice.  Any regulation promulgated pursuant to this section shall be subject to the balancing test set forth in section 3 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103-141; 42 U.S.C. 2OOObb-1).   "(5) This section shall not be construed as requiring prison authorities to permit, nor shall it be construed to prohibit prison authorities from permitting, access to peyote by Indians while incar- cerated within Federal or State prison facilities.

The amendment is as follows:   Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the  following:  SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.   This Act may be cited as the "American Indian Religious Freedom Act  Amendments of 1994".  SEC. 2. TRADITIONAL INDIAN RELIGIOUS USE OF THE PEYOTE SACRAMENT.   The Act of August 11, 1978 (42 U.S.C. 1996), commonly referred to as the American Indian Religious Freedom Act", is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new section:   "Sec. 3. (a) The Congress finds and declares that--        "(1) for many Indian people, the traditional ceremonial      use of the peyote cactus as a religious sacrament has for      centuries been integral to a way of life, and significant      in perpetuating Indian tribes and cultures;        (2) since 1965, this ceremonial use of peyote by Indians      has been protected by Federal regulation;        (3) while at least 28 States have enacted laws which are     similar to, or are in conformance with, the Federal     regulation which protects the ceremonial use of peyote by     Indian religious practitioners, 22 States have not done so,     and this lack of uniformity has created hardship for Indian     people who participate in such religious ceremonies;      79-006                                   2        "(4) the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case     of Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), held     that the First Amendment does not protect Indian practitioners     who use peyote in Indian religious ceremonies, and also raised     uncertainty whether this religious practice would be protected     under the compelling State interest standard; and        "(5) the lack of adequate and clear legal protection for     the religious use of peyote by Indians may serve to stigmatize     and marginalize Indian tribes and cultures, and increase the     risk that they will be exposed to discriminatory treatment.   "(b)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the use, possession, or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide traditional ceremonial purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited by the United States or any State.  No Indian shall be penalized or discriminated against on the basis of such use, possession or transportation, including, but not limited to, denial of otherwise applicable benefits under public assistance programs.   "(2) This section does not prohibit such reasonable regulation and registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration of those persons who cultivate, harvest, or distribute peyote as may be consistent with the purposes of this Act.   "(3) This section does not prohibit application of the provisions of section 481.111(a) of Vernon's Texas Health and Safety Code Annotated, in effect on the date of enactment of this section, insofar as those provisions pertain to the cultivation, harvest, and distribu- tion of peyote.   "(4 Nothing in this section shall prohibit any Federal depart- ment or agency, in carrying out its statutory responsibilities and functions, from promulgating regulations establishing reasonable limitations on the use or ingestion of peyote prior to or during the performance of duties by sworn law enforcement officers or personnel directly involved in public transportation or any other safety-sensitive positions where the performance of such duties may be adversely affected by such use or ingestion.  Such regulations shall be adopted only after consultation with representatives of traditional Indian religions for which the sacramental use of peyote is integral to their practice.  Any regulation promulgated pursuant to this section shall be subject to the balancing test set forth in section 3 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103-141; 42 U.S.C. 2OOObb-1).   "(c) For purposes of this section--         "(1) the term 'Indian' means a member of an Indian tribe;         "(2) the term 'Indian tribe' means any tribe, band, nation,     pueblo, or other organized group or community of Indians,     including any Alaska Native village (as defined in, or estab-     lished pursuant to, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act     (43 U.S.C. l601 et seq.)), which is recognized as eligible for     the special programs and services provide by the United States     to Indians because of their status as Indians;         "(3) the term 'Indian religion' means any religion--               "(A) which is practiced by Indians; and               "(B) the origin and interpretation of which is from           within a traditional Indian culture or community; and         "(4) the term 'State' means any State of the United States       and any political subdivision thereof.   "(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed as abrogating, diminishing, or otherwise affecting--               "(1) the inherent rights of any Indian tribe;               "(2) the rights, express or implicit, of any Indian             tribe which exist under treaties, Executive orders, and             laws of the United States;               "(3) the inherent right of Indians to practice their             religions; and               "(4) the right of Indians to practice their religions             under any Federal or State law.".                             PURPOSE    The purpose of H.R. 4230 is to amend the American Indian Religious  Freedom Act to provide for the traditional use of peyote by Indians for  religious purposes, and for other purposes.                                   3                       BACKGROUND AND NEED    Peyote, the scientific name of which is Lophophora williamsii, is a  small, spineless cactus that grows only in the Rio Grande valley of  southern Texas and northern Mexico.  Anthropologists date the sacramental  use of the peyote cactus among indigenous peoples back 10,000 years.   Native American religious use of peyote was discovered by Spanish explorers in the 1600's and has continued to the present.  Such use exists today, largely through the Native American Church (NAC), among more than 50 Indian tribes in the United States.  The NAC is the present-day embodiment of one of the oldest religious traditions in the western hemisphere.  The contemporary NAC was first incorporated in Oklahoma in 1918, and now has chapters in 25 States.  Approximately 250,000 American Indians are affiliated with the NAC.   The Federal District Court in New Mexico, in the 1986 case of Toledo v.  Nobel-Sysco, Inc., 651 F.Supp. 483 (D.N.M. 1986) held that the religious  use of peyote was not illegal.  The court found that;       Church peyote users believe that peyote is a sacred and    powerful plant.  Peyote is seen as a medicine, a protector,    and a teacher.  In terms used by other religions, peyote can    be called a sacrament, something which when eaten gives    awareness of God.  The use of peyote is central to the Na-    tive American peyote religion.  The religion teaches that    those who use peyote must not use alcohol.  It encourages    love of parents and obedience to parents, fidelity to a    spouse, and charity towards others.  The peyote religion    does not prohibit members from also practicing other reli-    gions.    Medical evidence, based on scientific studies and. opinions of scientific and other experts, including medical doctors, former directors of the Indian Health Service and Enthropologists, clearly demonstrates peyote is not injurious to the Indian religious user, and, in fact, is often helpful in controlling alcoholism and alcohol abuse among Indian people.  Ingested as a solid or tea in strictly prescribed and controlled religious ceremonies, the sacrament is neither addictive nor habit forming.  Courts which have made factual findings regarding the religious use of peyote by Indians have concluded that such use is not harmful.   While the First Amendment right of Indian practitioners of the peyote  religion is endangered by the Smith decision, its religious use is  basically non-controversial.  Attempts by the Congress to recognize and  protect this right have a long history.  When the House of Representatives passed H.R. 2, which became the "Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965", it protected the right of Indians to use peyote in connection with the ceremonies of a certified religious organization.  The Senate omitted that specific protection, preferring that substances be included on such a list on a case-by-case basis.  Congressman Harris assured House members that such omissions would not prevent bona fide religious use because courts had already upheld peyote use as a First Amendment right.  The Administration then added peyote to Schedule I by administrative                               4  regulation in 1966, but provided an exemption for non-drug use of peyote in religious ceremonies of the Native American Church.   When Congress passed the Controlled Substance Act of 1970, it enacted  Schedule I into law.  During hearings on the legislation, Congressman  Satterfield expressed concern that the religious use of peyote by Indian  practitioners be protected.  The Administration assured him that this would be taken care of by regulation.  The regulations, adopted in 1971 to implement the Act, provide at 21 CFR � 1307.31:       The listing of peyote as a controlled substance in Sched-    ule I does not apply to the nondrug use of peyote in bona    fide religious ceremonies of the Native American Church.    Since that time, Native American Church use of peyote as a religious  sacrament has had the limited protection of Federal regulation.  Officials of the Drug Enforcement Administration of the Department of Justice testified at House hearings in 1993 and 1994 that the religious use of peyote by Indians has nothing to do with the vast and violent traffic in illegal narcotics that plagues this country.  The DEA further testified that it is unaware of the diversion of peyote to any illicit market.  The NAC has a good, cooperative relationship with the DEA in ensuring that peyote is lawfully harvested and distributed solely for American Indian religious use.  The distribution of peyote is strictly controlled by Federal regulations, and by the laws and regulations of the State of Texas, the only State in which the sacrament grows in significant quantities.   In addition to the Federal regulatory exemption of the DEA, 28 States  provide some degree of legal protection for the religious use of peyote by Indians.  However, neither the Federal regulation nor the State laws  provide the full range of protection needed for the unhindered religious  use of peyote by Indians, and 22 States still have no legal protection at  all.  In some States, the legal protection for Indians is limited to the  opportunity to assert the religious use of peyote as an affirmative defense in the context of felony prosecution.  Thus, bona fide NAC members can be arrested, finger-printed, incarcerated and subjected to all the indignities of a felony prosecution before they can be vindicated and set free.  Even then, they will have a criminal record--simply for practicing a bona fide religion that predates the founding of this country by some 10,000 years.   As a result of the diverse State laws governing the use of peyote,  Indians in different tribes from different States, as well as from  different tribes within some States, are treated differently regarding the traditional religious use of peyote. [Footnote 1]  NAC members who have    [Footnote 1] For example, there are three Indian reservations in Nebraska where Native Americans reside: the Winnebago, Omaha and Santee Sioux.  Nebraska state law does not provide for an exemption for the religious use of peyote by Indians.  Therefore, Native American Church members transporting the sacrament to any of the three Nebraska reservations could be arrested, prosecuted and incarcerated if caught in possession of the sacrament anywhere in the state before they enter the reservation.  As a result of federal Indian policy and related jurisdictional matters, the State of Nebraska does not have criminal jurisdiction over the Winnebago or Omaha reservations, but does have such authority over the Santee Sioux Reservation.  Thus, Omaha and Winnebago Indians may lawfully use peyote for religious purposes on their own reservations, because state law is not applicable there and such use is protected by the federal exemption of the DEA.  However, Indians using the sacrament on the Santee Sioux Reservation could be prosecuted under state law since Nebraska criminal law is applicable at Santee and there is no state law exemption for the religious use of the sacrament.  Such anomalous situations are not uncommon and underscore the need for a uniform national law that will provide American Indians with equal protection throughout the nation.                              5  lawfully acquired the sacrament in Texas can still be arrested and  subjected to felony prosecution and imprisonment in 22 States, States in  which they may live or through which they must travel on their way home  from Texas after lawfully acquiring the sacrament.  This current State-by-State patchwork of laws has a chilling effect on the freedom of many Indian people to travel in this country and to practice their religion.   Legislation is therefore needed to assure comprehensive, equal and uniform protection of the religious use of peyote by Indians throughout the United States, without regard to the State or reservation of residence, or tribal affiliation.   While 28 States do provide varying legal protections for the religious  use of peyote by Indians, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1990 in the Smith case that it is constitutionally permissible for States to prohibit such use.  This legislation is made necessary by the Smith ruling.    THE SMITH DECISION AND RESTORATION OF THE COMPELLING              GOVERNMENT INTEREST TEST    The Smith case began as an unemployment compensation dispute involving  Alfred Smith, a Native American employee of a private drug and alcohol  rehabilitation facility.  Smith was fired and denied unemployment benefits after acknowledging he had ingested the peyote sacrament during a traditional religious ceremony of the Native American Church.  The Oregon Employment Division believed that the State had a compelling interest in proscribing the use of certain drugs pursuant to a controlled substance law.   Smith filed a case disputing the denial of unemployment benefits and  questioning the constitutionality of the controlled substance law as it  applied to his religious practice.  Following protracted litigation, the  Oregon Supreme Court ruled that the prohibition on the sacramental use of  peyote violated the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.   The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, holding that the free exercise clause of the First Amendment did not prohibit the State of Oregon from banning the sacramental use of peyote through its general criminal prohibition laws, or from denying unemployment benefits to persons dismissed from their jobs for such religiously inspired use.  In an opinion written by Justice Scalia (joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, Stevens, and Kennedy), the Court discarded the long-standing compelling interest test, holding that facially neutral laws of general applicability that burden the free exercise of religion require no special justification to satisfy free exercise scrutiny.   Finally, the Court asserted that the free exercise of religion may be  protected through the political process.  According to the majority, its  inability to find constitutional protection for religiously inspired action burdened by generally applicable laws does not mean statutory exemptions to such laws are not permitted or even desired.  However, the majority noted:       It may fairly be said that leaving accommodation to the    political process will place at a relative disadvantage those    religious practices that are not widely engaged in; but that                               6     unavoidable consequence of democratic government must    be preferred to a system in which each conscience is a law    unto itself or in which judges weight the social importance    of all laws against the centrality of all religious beliefs.     [Footnote 2]    To reach its decision, the majority had to strain its reading of the  First Amendment and ignore years of precedent in which the compelling  government interest test was applied in a variety of circumstances.  In a  strongly worded concurrence, Justice O'Connor took sharp issue with the  Court's abandonment of the compelling government interest test.  Justice  O'Connor reviewed the Court's precedents and found that they confirmed that the compelling interest standard is the appropriate means to protect the religious liberty guaranteed by the First Amendment:       To say that a person's right to free exercise has been    burdened, of course, does not mean that he has an abso-    lute right to engage in the conduct.  Under our established    First Amendment jurisprudence, we have recognized that    the freedom to act, unlike the freedom to believe, cannot    be absolute.  Instead, we have respected both the First    Amendment's express textual mandate and the govern-    mental interest in regulation of conduct by requiring the    government to justify any substantial burden on reli-    giously motivated conduct by a compelling state interest    and by means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.    [Footnote 3]    This controversial decision by a divided Court has been heavily  criticized by constitutional law scholars, religious leaders, and civil  libertarians.  In 1993, Congress overturned portions of the Smith decision by enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), Pub. L. 103-141, 107 Stat 1488 (42 U.S.C. �� 2OOObb et seq.,).  However, RFRA left open the question of whether the reinstated compelling government interest test would provide adequate legal protection for the traditional religious use of peyote by American Indians--the precise religious practice at issue in Smith.  As President Clinton emphasized when he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on November 16, 1993:       The agenda for restoration of religious freedom in Amer-    ica will not be complete until traditional Native American    religious practices have received the protection they de-    serve.  My Administration has been and will continue to    work actively with Native Americans and the Congress on    legislation to address these concerns.    NEED FOR H.R. 4230 NOTWITHSTANDING THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM                  RESTORATION ACT OF 1993    The Committee recognizes that H.R. 4230 remains necessary notwithstanding the recent enactment of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.  Justice O'Connor agreed with the judgment of the majority in Smith that Oregon's prohibition of the sacramental use of peyote was constitutionally permissible.  However, she thought it unnecessary to discard the compelling government inter-    [Footnote 2] 494 U.S. at 890.   [Footnote 3] Id. at 894 (citations omitted).                              7  est test in order to reach this result.  Instead, Justice O'Connor would  have retained and applied the traditional test to rule that the religious  use of peyote by Indians is not protected by the first Amendment, since in her view the "State in this case has a compelling interest in regulating peyote use by its citizens-- * * *" [Footnote 4]  In Justice O'Connor's view, Oregon would have met the compelling government interest test solely on the judgment of the State legislature to list peyote as a Class 1 controlled substance, and notwithstanding factual considerations.   The Supreme Court's reliance on Oregon's position in Smith that the State has an interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens from the "dangers" of peyote is highly questionable.  As pointed out by Justice Blackmun in his dissent in Smith, Oregon's position "rests on no  evidentiary foundation at all," and is therefore entirely speculative".  [Footnote 5]  As underscored by the dissent, the majority agreed with  Oregon's assertion, notwithstanding that Oregon failed to offer any  "evidence that the religious use of peyote has ever harmed anyone." [Footnote 6]  To the contrary, the record in Smith amply showed that:       (1) Factual findings of other courts contradict Oregon's as-    sumption that the religious use of peyote is harmful;      (2) Medical evidence, based on the opinion of scientists and    other experts, including medical doctors and anthropologists, is    that peyote is not injurious;      (3) The distribution and use of peyote has nothing to do with    the vast and violent traffic in illegal narcotics that plagues this    country;      (4) There is virtually no illegal trafficking in peyote--Drug    Enforcement Administration (DEA) data indicates that be-    tween 1980 and 1987, only 19.4 pounds of peyote was con-    fiscated, while during the same period the DEA seized over 15    million pounds of marijuana;      (5) The distribution of peyote is strictly controlled by Federal    and Texas State regulations--the only State where peyote    grows in significant quantities;      (6) The carefully circumscribed religious context in which pe-    yote is used by Indians is far removed from the irresponsible    and unrestricted recreational use of unlawful drugs, and is    similar to the sacramental use of wine by the Roman Catholic    Church, which was exempted from the general statutory ban    on possession and use of alcohol during Prohibition;      (7) The Federal Government and 23 States [now 28] provide    an exemption from respective drug laws for the religious use    of peyote by American Indians;      (8) Native American Church doctrine forbids the non-reli-    gious use of peyote, and also advocates self-reliance, familial    responsibility and abstinence from alcohol;      (9) Spiritual and social support provided by the Native    American Church has been effective in combatting the tragic    effects of alcoholism among the Native American population;    [Footnote 4] 494 U.S. at 907.   [Footnote 5] 494 U.S. at 911.   [Footnote 6] 494 U.S. at 911-l2.   [Footnote 7] 494 U.S. at 911-18 for precise citations of the enumerated  paragraphs.                            8       (10) Oregon's assertion that granting a religious exemption    for the use of peyote would open the floodgates to claims for    the religious use of controlled substances by other religious de-    nominations is not an issue because the Supreme Court and    lower courts over the years have consistently rejected similar    arguments in past free exercise cases, having held that the re-    ligious use of peyote by American Indians is the sole cir-    cumstance warranting claims for a religious exemption for any    controlled substance; and      (11)granting a religious exemption solely for the sac-    ramental use of peyote by American Indians presents no equal    protection problems.    Notwithstanding the above-referenced record in Smith, Justice O'Connor  felt Oregon had a compelling interest to prohibit the religious use of  peyote, even though Oregon had never evinced a concrete interest in  enforcing its drug laws against religious users of peyote--including Al  Smith, the plaintiff in the Smith case.  The committee recognizes that  traditional Indian religions, including the peyote religion, are highly unique in nature and are little understood by the courts and other government officials.  Given this backdrop, the Committee believes that the traditional religious use of the peyote sacrament by Indians requires statutory protection.  H.R. 4230 responds to the Supreme Court's invitation in Smith to accommodate this ancient religious practice through the political process.   Absent Federal legislation, the question of whether a given State has a  compelling interest to prohibit the religious use of peyote by Indians is  one that would necessarily be determined by the courts on a State-by-State basis.  The Committee recognizes that such determination could require numerous State supreme court decisions and a corresponding number of U.S. Supreme Court opinions--with varying results possible, as well as numerous lower State and Federal court decisions.  Such piecemeal judicial resolution to this issue is not likely to produce uniform, just or equal results, and would be unduly burdensome, costly and time consuming.  The Committee recognizes that uniform and equal protection of Indians without regard to State or reservation of residence, or tribal affiliation, can only be accomplished by Congress through comprehensive legislation.                     CONSTITUTIONALITY    Since the creation of the United States, the treaty relationship between Indian tribes and the United States government has engendered a long-standing political relationship under the Constitution.  This relationship includes a Federal trust responsibility for Indian tribes which has resulted in hundreds of separate Federal statutes dealing with all aspects of Indian life, including health, education, religion, economic development, children, employment, language and culture, gaming, and a host of other subject matter areas.  An entire title of the United States Code (25 U.S.C.) is devoted exclusively to Indian legislation.   Because Indians and Indian tribes occupy a sui generis legal status in  Federal law under the U.S. Constitution and enjoy a special political  relationship with the United States Government, separate                             9  Indian legislation has consistently been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court  under the legal principles set forth in Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535,  551-55 (1974).  At the urging of the U.S. Department of Justice, the long-standing rationale for special Indian treatment by the Federal Government was recently applied by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the religious use of peyote in Peyote Way Church of God v. Thornburgh, 922 F.2d 1210 (5th Cir. 1991).  Finding that the Native American Church (NAC) members were also members of federally recognized tribes, the Fifth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the DEA's protective regulation against an equal protection challenge:       We hold that the federal NAC exemption allowing tribal    Native Americans to continue their centuries-old tradition    of peyote use is rationally related to the legitimate govern-    mental objective of preserving Native American culture.    Such preservation is fundamental to the Federal Govern-    ment's trust relationship with tribal Native Americans.    Under Morton, [non-Indians] are not similarly situated    to--NAC [members] for purposes of cultural preservation    and thus, the Federal Government may exempt NAC mem-    bers from statutes prohibiting possession of peyote without    extending the exemption to [non-Indians]. [Footnote 8]    The Fifth Circuit also ruled that the DEA exemption for NAC members did  not violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment:       The unique guardian-ward relationship between the    Federal Government and Native American Indian tribes    precludes the degree of separation of church and state or-    dinarily required by the First Amendment.  The Federal    Government cannot at once fulfill its constitutional role as    protector of tribal Native Americans and apply conven-    tional separatist understandings of the establishment    clause to that relationship.      * * * Thus, we hold that the Federal NAC exemption    represents the Government's protection of the culture of    quasi-sovereign Native American tribes and as such, does    not represent an establishment of religion in contravention    of the First Amendment. [Footnote 9]    Based on the special relationship between the United States and Federally recognized tribes, and on Peyote Way Church of God, the U.S. Department of Justice testified that Congress has the requisite authority to enact H.R. 4230, and that it is constitutionally sound.  Accordingly, the Committee is confident that the granting of a statutory religious exemption for the sacramental use of peyote solely by American Indians presents no equal protection or establishment clause problems, and therefore stands on a solid constitutional footing.

While the committee is  unaware of any such problems in the past, it intends to accommodate  prospective concerns articulated principally by the Department of  Transportation and Department of Defense.   An official of the Native American Church testified at the June 10, 1994 hearing of the Native American Affairs Subcommittee that the effects of peyote do not persist more than 6 hours.  The Committee recognizes the  medical literature and related studies indicate that mescaline, the  psychoactive component of peyote, may persist in the brain for up to 9 to  10 hours, [Footnote 10] and that the physiological effects of peyote can  last up to 12 hours. [Footnote 11]  The committee therefore deems a period of 6 to 24 hours to be "reasonable" as to authorized time limitations regarding the use or ingestion of peyote, pursuant to regulations the departments or agencies may promulgate under H.R. 4230.  The committee further believes that, where an agency proposes a time limitation exceeding 24 hours, it should be prepared to show such limitation meets the balancing test set forth in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  The Committee is confident that the bill and the 6 to 24 hour range for time limitations will adequately and amply meet the needs of affected departments, and will not adversely impact the ability of U.S. military personnel, law enforcement officers or persons directly involved in positions related to public safety to maintain good order, discipline, security and safety.   The Committee does not intend the act to impose requirements that would  exacerbate the difficult and complex challenges of operating the Nation's  prisons and jails in a safe and secure manner.  Accordingly, the Committee does not intend the Act to require prison officials to either prescribe or proscribe the religious use of peyote by Indian inmates.  Rather, the Committee expects that these matters will be addressed under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, and that the courts will continue the tradition of giving due deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail administrators in establishing necessary rules and procedures to maintain good order, security and discipline.                 SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS                    SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE     Section 1 provides that the Act may be cited as the "American Indian  Religious Freedom Act Amendments of 1994".     [Footnote 10] See e.g., Oakley and Ksir, "Drugs, Society and Human  Behavior," Times Mirror/Mosby, St. Louis, 1990, pp. 309-311.   [Footnote 11] See e.g., Dorrance, Janiger, and Teplitz, "Effect of Peyote on Human Chromosomes--Cyto-genetic Study of the Huichol Indians of Northern Mexico," "Journal of the American Medical Association," Vol. 234, No. 3, October 20, 1975, pp. 299-302.                              11     SECTION 2. TRADITIONAL INDIAN RELIGIOUS USE OF THE PEYOTE                        SACRAMENT     Section 2 amends the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1975 by  adding a new "Section 3" as follows:       Subsection (a) provides the findings of the Congress.   Subsection (b)(1) provides that the use, possession or transportation of peyote by an Indian for ceremonial purposes is lawful and is not to be  prohibited by the United States or any State Government.  It further  provides that no Indian is to be penalized or discriminated against on the basis of the use, possession or transportation of peyote and benefits under public assistance programs are not to be denied.       Subsection (b)(2) provides that this section does not prohibit     the regulation and registration by the Drug Enforcement Ad-     ministration of persons who cultivate, harvest or distribute pe-     yote under this Act.       Subsection (b)(3) provides that this section is not to impact     a Texas law governing the growing and distribution of peyote.       Subsection (b)(4) provides that departments or agencies are     not prohibited from promulgating regulations establishing rea-     sonable time limitations on the use or ingestion of peyote prior     to the performance of official duties by certain personnel.  This     subsection also provides that affected departments or agencies     are not prohibited from establishing reasonable limitations on     the transportation of peyote on military bases or overseas.  The     regulations are to be adopted only alter consultation with rep-     resentatives of traditional Indian religions for which the sac-     ramental use of peyote is integral.       Subsection (c) provides for definitions for terms used in this     section.                    LEGISLATIVE HISTORY     H.R. 4230 was introduced by Representatives Richardson on April 14, 1994.  The Subcommittee on Native American Affairs held a hearing on H.R. 4230 on June 10, 1994.  The Subcommittee considered and unanimously passed a substitute amendment to H.R. 4230, which was reported to the Committee on Natural Resources.  On July 27, 1994, the Committee on Natural Resources considered H.R. 4230 and ordered it to be reported to the House with an amendment.                COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS     The Committee on Natural Resources, by voice vote, approved the bill with amendments and recommends its enactment by the House.     CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED     In compliance with clause 3 of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of  Representatives, changes in existing law made by the bill, as reported, are shown as follows (existing law proposed to be omitted is enclosed in black brackets, new matter is printed in italics, existing law in which no change is proposed is shown in roman):                                   12         SECTION 3 OF THE ACT OF AUGUST 11, 1978   (POPULARLY KNOWN AS THE AMERICAN INDIAN RELIGIOUS                     FREEDOM ACT)   SEC. 3. (a) The Congress finds and declares that--      (1) for many Indian people, the traditional ceremonial    use of the peyote cactus as a religious sacrament has for cen-    turies been integral to a way of life, and significant in    perpetuating Indian tribes and cultures;      (2) since 1965, this ceremonial use of peyote by Indians    has been protected by Federal regulation;      (3) while at least 28 States have enacted laws which    are similar to, or are in conformance with, the Federal regula-    tion which protects the ceremonial use of peyote by Indian    religious practitioners, 22 States have not done so, and this    lack of uniformity has created hardship for Indian people who    participate in such religious ceremonies;      (4) the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case    of Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), held    that the First Amendment does not protect Indian practitioners    who use peyote in Indian religious ceremonies, and also raised    uncertainty whether this religious practice would be protected    under the compelling State interest standard; and       (5) the lack of adequate and clear legal protection for    the religious use of peyote by Indians may serve to stigmatize    and marginalize Indian tribes and cultures, and increase the    risk that they will be exposed to discriminatory treatment.   (b)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the use, possession,  or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide traditional  ceremonial purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited by the United States or any State.  No Indian shall be penalized or discriminated against on the basis of such use, possession or transportation, including, but not limited to, denial of otherwise applicable benefits under public assistance programs.   (2) This section does not prohibit such reasonable regulation and  registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration of those persons who  cultivate, harvest, or distribute peyote as may be consistent with the  purposes of this Act.   (3) This section does not prohibit application of the provisions of  section 481.111(a) of Vernon's Texas Health and Safety Code Annotated, in  effect on the date of enactment of this section, insofar as those  provisions pertain to the cultivation, harvest, and distribution of peyote.   (4) Nothing in this section shall prohibit any Federal department or  agency, in carrying out its statutory responsibilities and functions, from promulgating regulations establishing reasonable limitations on the use or ingestion of peyote prior to or during the performance of duties by sworn law enforcement officers or personnel directly involved in public transportation or any other safety-sensitive positions where the  performance of such duties may be adversely affected by such use or  ingestion.  Such regulations shall be adopted only after consultation with representatives of traditional Indian religions for which the sacramental use of peyote is integral to their practice.  Any regulation promulgated pursuant to this section shall be subject to the balancing test set forth in section 3 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103-141; 42 U.S.C. 2OOObb-1).   (c) For purposes of this section--      (1) the term 'Indian' means a member of an Indian tribe;      (2) the term 'Indian tribe' means any tribe, band, nation,    pueblo, or other organized group or community of Indians,    including any Alaska Native village (as defined in, or estab-    lished pursuant to, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act    (43 U.S.C. l601 et seq.)), which is recognized as eligible for    the special programs and services provide by the United States    to Indians because of their status as Indians;      (3) the term 'Indian religion' means any religion--           (A) which is practiced by Indians; and           (B) the origin and interpretation of which is from        within a traditional Indian culture or community; and      (4) the term 'State' means any State of the United States    and any political subdivision thereof.   (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed as abrogating, diminishing, or otherwise affecting--      (1) the inherent rights of any Indian tribe;      (2) the rights, express or implicit, of any Indian tribe   which exist under treaties, Executive orders, and laws of the   United States;      (3) the inherent right of Indians to practice their religions;   and      (4) the right of Indians to practice their religions under   any Federal or State law.                   OVERSIGHT STATEMENT     The Committee on Natural Resources will have continuing responsibility  for oversight of the implementation of H.R. 4230 after enactment.  No  reports or recommendations were received pursuant to rule X, clause 2 of  the rules of the House of Representatives.                   INFLATIONARY IMPACT STATEMENT     Enactment of H.R. 4230 will have no inflationary impact.                  COST AND BUDGET ACT COMPLIANCE     The cost and budgetary analysis of H.R. 4230, as evaluated by the  Congressional Budget Office is set forth below:                              14                                      U.S. CONGRESS,                       CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE,                             Washington, DC, August 3, 1994. Hon. GEORGE MILLER, Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.   DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed H.R.  4230, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments of 1994, as  ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 27,  1994.  We estimate the implementation of the bill would have no effect on  the Federal budget or on the budgets of State or local governments.   Enactment of H.R. 4230 would not affect direct spending or receipts.   Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply to this bill.   H.R. 4230 would amend the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978  by adding a new section that would permit the use, possession, or  transportation of peyote by Indians for sacramental purposes.  However, the bill would not prohibit the Drug Enforcement Administration from regulating peyote cultivation or distribution, nor would it prohibit Federal agencies from regulating peyote use by certain types of Federal personnel prior to performing their official duties.   If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be pleased to  provide them.  The CBO staff contact is Rachel A. Robertson.     Sincerely,                                        JAMES T. BLUM,                                 (For Robert D. Reischauer).                         U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,                  DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION,                             Washington, DC, August 3, 1994. Mr. TADD JOHNSON, Chief Counsel, Subcommittee on Native American Affairs, House of   Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. JOHNSON: It is my understanding that H.R. 4230, "American Indian  Religious Freedom Act of 1994", is nearing floor consideration in the  House.  You will recall that while the Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA) was unable to have a witness at your hearing regarding this matter on June 10, 1994, that we did submit a statement for the record.  That  statement succinctly puts forth the history of DEA's regulation of peyote and the exemption for its use in traditional Native American ceremonies.  DEA has encountered no problems with the use of peyote in these traditional ceremonies nor has diversion of peyote been a problem.   DEA has had a long and cooperative association with the Native American  Church, working with them since the early 1970's to assure that our mutual concerns relating to peyote are met.  We have worked with its  representatives to assure that the bill language effectively addresses  these matters.  DEA supports the passage of H.R. 4230 as it was reported by the Committee on Natural Resources with the amendments that address public safety concerns.                              15     If I can provide you with any other information pertaining to DEA'a  experience regarding peyote, please let me know.     Sincerely,                                  DAVID A. MELOCIK,                                  DEA, Congressional Affairs.   STATEMENT OF GENE R. HAISLIP, DEPUTY ASSISTANT ADMINIS-   TRATOR, OFFICE OF DIVERSION CONTROL, DRUG ENFORCEMENT   ADMINISTRATION   Chairman Richardson and Members of the Subcommittee:   The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) appreciates the opportunity to comment regarding H.R. 4230 "American Indian Religious Freedom Act of  1994."  This bill seeks to statutorily provide for the traditional use of  peyote by Indians for religious purposes.   Almost 25 years ago when Congress began hearings pertaining to the  Controlled Substances Act (CSA) they decided that the traditional, historic use of peyote by members of the Native American Church (NAC) as a sacrament in traditional religious ceremonies warranted a specific exemption.  Congress determined, to be consistent with past Federal practice, this exemption should be specified in regulation rather in law.  Consequently, an exception was created for the NAC to use peyote for religious purposes.  Although the NAC is not defined in the subject regulations, the members of this church are required to be Native American.   The regulation has worked very well for both DEA and the NAC with only  minor difficulties from time to time concerning the natural supply of the  drug and the difficulties obtaining peyote outside of the area where it  grows locally.  In fact, our experience over the years in enforcing this  regulation has revealed no particular problems of abuse of this substance  by the NAC or its members.  Unfortunately there will always be individuals who seek to circumvent the regulations for their own purposes and on occasion, DEA has dealt with groups who have attempted to expand the exemption to authorize the use of peyote or other controlled substances in what they claimed to be religious ceremonies.   On occasion, peyote, who primary active ingredient is mescaline, a  hallucinogen similar to LSD, has been found in the illicit traffic.  It has not been reported by DEA, State or local enforcement agencies to be  anything other than a sporadic problem.  Despite the fact that the  regulation allows for the legal use of the drug and the registration of  legitimate distributors, DEA at this time is not aware of the diversion of the drug to any illicit market.   Although we at DEA feel that the regulation that has been in place for  almost 25 years has worked well, we would prefer a statutory exemption over an administrative exemption.  We have reviewed H.R. 4230 and could support the bill if amended to: (1) restrict the use, possession, or transportation of peyote to bona fide traditional ceremonial purposes only; and (2) to make clarifying amendments to address public safety concerns.   DEA and the NAC have maintained a close working relationship to allow the use of peyote for religious ceremony without diversion or abuse.  DEA  believes the passage of this legislation will serve to                              16   strengthen the uniform application throughout all of the states without  reprisal to NAC members of this religious exception.  Mr. Chairman, this  concludes my statement.  I will be pleased to answer any questions that you may have.                              0 WT01-B19-22IA087-000631-B004-142http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/RELIGION/flores.html 206.61.184.43 19970122073749 text/html 12075HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:37:29 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:38:31 GMTContent-length: 11859                    THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT                  FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS                        SAN ANTONIO DIVISION  P.F. FLORES, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN ANTONIO                                               SA-94-CA-0421 v. THE CITY OF BOERNE       BEFORE THE COURT, in the above-captioned cause of action, is    the special issue raised by Defendant, the City of Boerne, in    which Defendant challenges the constitutionality of the recently    passed Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. � 2000bb    [herinafter RFRA].                                BACKGROUND        The United States Congress passed RFRA in early November of    1993 and it was signed by President Clinton on November l6, 1993.        RFRA sets out in pertinent part:        SEC. 3. FREE EXECISE OF RELIGION PROTECTED.           (a) IN GENERAL, -- Government shall not substantially       burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden       results from a rule of general applicability, except as       provided in subsection (b).             (b) EXCEPTION. -- Government may substantially burden       a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that       application of the burden to the person -                  (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental            interest; and                  (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering            that compelling governmental interest.        (emphasis supplied).        Such an Act under normal circumstances would be readily    enforceable by this Court; however, it has come to the Court's    attention that thes Act seeks to overturn an interpretation of    the United States Constitution by the Supreme Court.  Indeed, in    the Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purposes, the    Congress specifically sought to create a heightened burden of    proof standard from that held in Employment Division v. Smith,    494 U.S. 872 (1990).  The Findings state in pertinent part:        (1) the framers of the Constitution, recognizing free      exercise of religion as an unalienable right, secured      its protection in the First Amendment to the      Constitution . . .        (4) in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872       (1990) the Supreme Court virtually eliminated the      requirement that the government justify burdens on      religious exercise imposed by laws neutral toward      religion . . .        The purposes of this Act are -           (1) to restore the compelling interest test      as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963)      and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972) and to      guarantee its application in all cases where the free      exercise of religion is substantially burdened . . . .        On February 2, 1995, the Court was made aware of Defendant's    special issue during a pretrial hearing and agreed to 1) Certify    the Question pursuant to 28 U.S.C. � 2403(a) to the Attorney    General of the United States, and 2) for both parties to submit    briefs addressing the constitutionality of RFRA.  On March 3,    1995, Defendant submitted its brief.  On March 6, 1995, Plaintiff    submitted its reply brief and the Solicitor General agreed to    intervene on behalf of the United States of America, likewise    submitting a reply brief.                                ANALYSIS        According to the holding of Marbury v. Madison, "[i]t is    emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to    say what the law is."  1 Cranch. 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803).     Subsequent Supreme Court cases have echoed this fact:        Deciding whether a matter has in any measure been      committed by the Constitution to another branch of      government, or whether the action of that branch      exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is      itself a delicate exercise in constitutional      interpretation, and is a responsibility of this      Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.   Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 211 (1962).  In United States v.    Nixon, the Court stated:        Notwithstanding the deference each branch must      accord the others, the 'judicial power of the      United States' vested in the federal courts by      Article III, � 1, of the Constitution can no more      be shared with the Executive Branch than the Chief      Executive, for example, can share with the      judiciary the veto power, or the Congress share      with the Judiciary the power to override a      Presidential veto.  Any other conclusion would be      contrary to the basic concept of separation of      powers and the checks and balances that flow from      the scheme of a tripartite government.  The      Federalist, No. 47, p. 313 (S. Mirrell ed. 1938).      We therefore reaffirm that it is the province and      duty of this Court 'to say what the law is . .       . .'"   418 U.S. 683, 704-05 (1974).        In this instance, Congress specifically sought to overturn    Supreme Court precedent as found in Employment Division v. Smith    through the passage of RFRA.  The Supreme Court in Smith found    the heightened standard applied in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S.    298 (1963), to be limited over the years to cases within the    unemployment compensation field.  Id. at 884.  The Smith court    added, "[e]ven if we were inclined to breathe into Sherbet some    life beyond the unemployment compensation field, we would not    apply it to require exemptions from a generally applicable law."     Id.  The Court is cognizant of Congress' Authority under Section    5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, yet it is convinced of Congress'    violation of the doctrine of Separation of Powers by intruding on    the power and duty of the judiciary.        The Court is cautious in its opinion of RFRA's    unconstitutionality as there has been insufficient case law, to    date, construing it.  See Belgard v. State of Hawaii, No. 93-   00961 (D. Haw. Feb. 3, 1995) (holding that RFRA constitutional    pursuant to Congress' enforcement power under Section 5 of the    Fourteenth Amendment). [Footnote 1]  Nevertheless, Smith remains    the law in this area for this Court to follow pursuant to the    doctrine of stare decisis.  The doctrine of stare decisis is not    a universal, inexorable command, especially in cases involving    the interpretation of the United States Constitution.  Planned    Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2861 (1992)    (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  "Nonetheless, the doctrine of stare    decisis, while perhaps never entirely persuasive on a    constitutional question, is a doctine that demands respect in a    society governed by the rule of law."  City of Akron v. Akron    Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416, 419-20 (1983).        [Footnote 1] This Court seriously questions the District of  Hawaii's interpretation of RFRA's legitimacy through Section 5 of  the Fourteenth Amendment.  RFRA only mentions the First Amendment  as the empowering provision to change the burden of proof  standard to compelling interest.  "Typically, the Court looks to  the language of an Act or its legislative history for guidance on  which power Congress understood itself to be invoking, and for  factual support of its legal determination as to whether the  power was invoked properly.  As applied to federal law, Congress  simply did not enter into such an inquiry regarding RFRA."  Marci  A. Hamilton, The Religious Freedom Restoration Act: Letting the  Fox into the Henhouse Under Cover of Section 5 of the Fourteenth  Amendment, 16 Cardoso L. Rev. 357, 366 (1994).  Furthermore,  because the First Amendment is not an enumerated power of  Congress, but merely a limitation, Katzenbach v. Morgan and its  progeny are inapplicable.  The First Amendment to the  Constitution does not empower Congress to regulate all federal  law in order to achieve religious liberty, unless it is done  pursuant to an enumerated power.  Id. at 363.                               CONCLUSION        After reviewing the briefs on file and the law applicable to    this area, the Court is of the opinion RFRA is in violation of    the United States Constitution and Supreme Court precedent by    unconstitutionally changing the burden of proof as established    under Employment Division v. Smith.  Accordingly, the Court is of    the opinion that this order holding RFRA to be unconstitutional    "involves a controlling question of law as to which there is    substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an    immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the    ultimate termination of litigation . . . ."  28 U.S.C. � 1292(b).     Furthermore, the Court asks that expedited consideration of this    appeal be had pursuant to F.R.A.P. Rule 5(a).        IT IS ORDERED the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993    is unconstitutional.        IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that an Interlocutory Appeal to the    Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals be had pursuant to 28 U.S.C. �    1292(b).

A jury found Thomas F. Brown guilty of one count ofmanufacturing marijuana and one count of manufacturing peyote, inviolation of 21 U.S.C. � 841(a)(l), and found Brown used hisforty-acre tract of land to facilitate the manufacturing process,thus subjecting the property to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. � 853;the district court1 sentenced Brown to 121 months imprisonment.Brown challenges his conviction and sentence, and we affirm.     In January 1994 Brown helped establish Our Church, and hedeeded one of his forty acres of property to the church.  Thecovenants of deed provided that Our Church would produce medicinalherbs and plants "possessed of the properties of spiritualenlightenment" and would distribute such herbs to the sick.  Brown_____________________     1The Honorable H. Franklin Waters, Chief Judge, United StatesDistrict Court for the Western District cf Arkansas. informed law enforcement officials and the media that Our Churchmembers intended to grow and distribute marijuana on the property;Our Church members had a public marijuana planting ceremony.  InAugust 1994 law enforcement officials seized 435 marijuana plantsand a bucket containing 3 peyote plants which had formed 5 buds.     Following Brown's indictment, the government filed a motion inlimine to exclude from the trial any evidence or referencesrelating, inter alia, to Brown's contention that his religiousbeliefs provided him with a legal right to grow or distributemarijuana and peyote, and that the FirstAmendment and theReligious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C.� 2000bb - 2000bb-4, provided him with a legal defense to thecharges.  At a one-day hearing on the motion in limine, Brown andother Our Church members or participants testified about the rolemarijuana played in their spiritual quest, how their interest insupplying marijuana to the sick was part of their religious tenets,and that church policy allowed distribution to anyone who wanted tojoin the spiritual quest, including children with parentalpermission.     The district court assumed for the purposes of the hearing andtrial that Brown was engaged in the exercise of a religion, andthat the grand jury indictment was a burden on his free exercise ofthat religion.  The court concluded, however, that the law clearlyestablished that the government had a compelling interest inregulating marijuana and other drugs, and that the government hadtailored the interest as narrowly as it could to prevent the kindsof dangers Congress believed existed.  Thus, the district courtconcluded, as a matter of law, that the RFRA was not available toBrown as a defense.  The court granted the government's motion inlimine, and barred admission at trial of all evidence covered inthe government's motion.     After Brown's first two appointed attorneys were allowed to                             -2- withdraw because of disagreements with Brown over hisrepresentation, the district court gave Brown the choice ofproceeding pro se with standby counsel or utilizing the fullassistance of counsel who would present his defense.  Brown choseto proceed pro se rather than have counsel direct the course of therepresentation.     Following a two-day criminal trial, the jury returned a guiltyverdict on all three counts.  The district court sentenced Brown to121 months imprisonment, four years supervised release, and $17,500in fines.  Brown moved for a new trial, arguing only that he wasdenied the assistance of counsel, which the district court denied.     On appeal Brown argues (1) the district court erred inrestricting him from advancing any of his defenses at trial, (2)the government lacked power under the Commerce Clause to prohibitgrowing and using marijuana, (3) the court improperly denied him areduction for acceptance of responsibility at sentencing underU.S.S.G. � 3E1.l, and (4) the court denied him assistance ofcounsel.     It is well established that religious conduct does not enjoythe absolute constitutional protection afforded freedom ofreligious belief. See United States v. Greene, 892 F.2d 453, 456(6th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 935 (1990).  Under theRFRA, the "[g]overnment may substantially burden a person'sexercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application ofthe burden to the person--(l) is in furtherance of a compellinggovernmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means offurthering that compelling governmental interest."  42 U.S.C.� 2000bb-l(b).  See also United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 256-59(1982) (First Amendment challenge; standard for determining if lawinterferes with religious conduct)                              -3-      We have recognized that the government has a compelling stateinterest in controlling the use of marijuana.  See United States v.Fogarty, 692 F.2d 542, 547-48 (8th Cir. 1982) (classification ofmarijuana is rationally based and is matter for legislative, notjudicial, prerogative), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1040 (1983); seealso Greene, 892 F.2d at 455-56; United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d497, 512-13 (1st Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1004 (1985);United States v. Middleton, 690 F.2d 820, 822-24 (11th Cir. 1982),cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1051 (1983)     We agree with the district court that, based on Our Church'sbroad use, the government could not have tailored the restrictionto accommodate Our Church and still protected against the kinds ofmisuses it sought to prevent.  Cf. United States v. Merkt, 794 F.2d950, 956-57 (5th Cir. 1986) (national border control laws), cert.denied, 480 U.S. 946 (1987).  Thus, under the circumstances of thiscase, we conclude the district court correctly determined thatBrown could not prevail under the RFRA or the First Amendment.  SeeRush, 738 F.2d at 513 (rejected First Amendment defense as matterof law).  We also conclude the district court did not abuse itsdiscretion in disallowing Brown's other defenses.  See Fed. R.Evid. 402; United States v. Hollister, 746 F.2d 420, 422 (8th Cir.1984) (district court has broad discretion in determiningrelevance).     We need not consider Brown's Commerce Clause and sentencingarguments because they are raised for the first time on appeal.See Fritz v. United States, 995 F.2d 136, 137 (8th Cir. 1993),cert. denied, 114 5. Ct. 887 (1994) (absent plain error, we willnot consider issues raised for first time on appeal).     Finally, we note Brown does not have a constitutional right tohybrid representation, see MoKaskie v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 184(1984), which means he cannot demand the right to act as co-counsel.  See United States v. Swinney, 970 F.2d 494, 497 (8th                               -4- Cir.), cert. denied, 113 5. Ct. 632 (1992), and cert. denied, 113S. Ct. 1650 (1993).  The record is clear that, given the choice ofproceeding pro se with standby counsel or utilizing the fullassistance of counsel, Brown unequivocally chose to representhimself.  Thus, the district court committed no error.     Accordingly, Brown's conviction and sentence is affirmed.     A true copy.

The law is among the most far-reaching protections ofreligious activity ever passed by Congress and has been put to avariety of uses since its 1993 enactment -- by churches seekingexemptions from zoning requirements, by prisoners requesting they beallowed to wear certain clothes, by landlords wanting to avoidfair housing requirements if they deny apartments to unmarried couples. State and local officials say the law has colored theirdealings with religious believers of all faiths and incitedturmoil in prisons from nearby Lorton to the Far West. As evidenceof the legal strife it has created, they note that it already has generated morethan 200 lower court cases nationwide, about half involving prisoners. Called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the law wasenacted to counter a 1990 Supreme Court decision that allowedcertain infringements on religious beliefs and practices. By agreeing to take the new case, the justices will not onlyreenter the enduring battle between church and state, but couldproduce a landmark decision on Congress's powers to reverse the effectsof a high court ruling. While backers of the law say it protects America's diversereligious interests, opponents claim it infringes on theauthority of states and municipalities and forces them to beunnecessarily tolerant. "The [law] is a bold and unprecedented example of federalsocial policy engineering that commandeers the states . . . toaccommodate religion more than the Constitution requires,"Marci A. Hamilton, lawyer for the city of Boerne, Tex., said in apetition to the court. The city sought to stop a local Catholic church from enlargingits 1923 revival mission-style building in a historic district.The archbishop of San Antonio, P.F. Flores, successfullychallenged the denial, relying on the 1993 law to make his case. "The church was turning people away from Mass because thechurch building was too small," Douglas Laycock, lawyer forthe archbishop, said yesterday. The city's refusal to allow the expansion, he said,"infringed on people's right to practice their religion." When Congress passed the law it was responding to a 1990ruling that an individual's religious beliefs do not excuse himfrom complying with otherwise valid laws, so long as those lawsare being applied to all citizens in a neutral and general way. That case involved two Native Americans who were fired at aprivate Oregon rehabilitation center after they ingested peyote,a cactus that contains the hallucinogen mescaline, during areligious ceremony. The state denied the men unemploymentbenefits based on the fact they engaged in illegal drug use. The two men,asserting their religious rights had been violated, won in lowerstate courts, but the Supreme Court ruled against them. Writing for the five-justice majority, Justice Antonin Scaliarefused to use a test from earlier cases that required a state toprove it had a "compelling interest" in enforcing astatute that infringed on religious practices. That test put more of the burden on governments to defendregulations that interfere with religious beliefs. In the weeks and months following the decision, a diversecoalition of religious and civil liberties groups lobbiedCongress to reverse effects of the ruling, saying it would particularlyhurt smaller religions whose interests might not be understood by legislatures. "When a law begins to infringe on a church, no matter howincidentally, that is not consistent with religiousliberty," said Laycock, a University of Texas law professor involvedin pressing Congress to overturn the ruling in Employment Divisionv. Smith. In 1993, Congress overwhelmingly approved and PresidentClinton signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The central provision of the law attempts to write intostatute what the court refused to find in the Constitution. It says government may interfere with religious practices onlyif it can demonstrate the regulation or action in questionfurthers a "compelling governmental interest" and isthe least restrictive means of furthering that interest. In the case of City of Boerne v. Flores now before thejustices, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit rejectedclaims Congress had overstepped its authority when it passed thelaw. The appeals court said Congress correctly relied on Section 5of the Fourteenth Amendment, which says Congress "shall havepower to enforce, by appropriate legislation, theprovisions" of the amendment protecting against stateinfringement on individual rights. The appeals court also rejected the city of Boerne's argumentsCongress had breached state sovereignty and crossed the lineseparating church and state. In Boerne's appeal, supported by 16 states, the city stressedthere are limits to Congress's exercise of so-called Section 5powers and it is the court, not federal lawmakers, who arearbiters of the breadth of constitutional protections. Locally, the statute has spurred numerous lawsuits. In June, afederal district judge in Maryland ruled the law isunconstitutional in connection with the Archdiocese of Baltimore'sefforts to demolish an abandoned monastery in Cumberland thatcity officials wanted to preserve. The case is on appeal to the 4thCircuit. In another case, a federal judge in the District relied on thelaw to overrule the D.C. Zoning Board after the board refused toallow a Foggy Bottom church to run a soup kitchen that neighborshad protested. Prisoners also have used the law to claim they need specialaccommodations to fulfill religious traditions. Fears of suchlitigation allegedly led guards at the District's LortonCorrectional Complex to allow visitors posing as religious missionariesto meet unsupervised with prisoners. It was later revealed the visitorswere smuggling drugs into the prison. Oliver Thomas, special counsel to the National Council ofChurches and one of the leaders who pressed Congress to pass thelaw, said yesterday the Texas dispute was a good one for the high courtto take up. "It's not one of those cases involving some Satanworshiper in a federal prison," he said. "This is a smallcongregation that has so many people they can't fit in the sanctuary.It's about as pristine a case as you could come up with." The case is likely to be argued in January and decided byJuly. Separately yesterday, the justices without comment rejected anappeal by pathologist Jack Kevorkian of a lower court ruling thatbars him from helping terminally ill patients commit suicide. Earlier this month the court announced it would use two othercases to decide whether mentally competent, terminally illpatients may seek help from their doctors in hastening death. The court yesterday also agreed to rule on whether states maytax the income of hospitals run by employee welfare benefit plansand whether a Florida state Senate district was unlawfully drawn alongracial lines to favor blacks.

I don't have specific info on where it appeared originally. Dave West --------------------------------------- Irish have high hopes for cannabis, fuel of the future BY AUDREY MAGEE, IRELAND CORRESPONDENT CANNABIS will light up thousands of Irish homes by replacing Irish peat as a vital fuel to generate electricity. A fast-growing strain is said to be a perfect new crop for European farmers. Scientists in Carlow, southwest of Dublin, have been growing cannabis in a secret area for the past four years, testing its properties as an energy source to burn in power stations. James Burke, who has grown three acres under licence from the Department of Justice, said that the plant flourished in Irish conditions, growing up to a height of 14ft. It is a strain developed in France for agricultural use. Called Cannabis sativa L, also known as hemp, it is essentially the same plant smoked by drug users, but modern science has removed the narcotic element. [I wish we could stop spreading this baloney--dpw] "There is no possibility of everyone getting stoned from the fumes of a power station because the cannabis has no chemical constituent," said Dr. Burke, who works at Teagasc, the agriculture and food development authority part-funded by the Government. "Despite the name, it bears no resemblance to the other plant. You would have to smoke five or six acres of the stuff to get a high." The plant has a slightly minty smell. Stringy fibres inside the stem burn as well as wood and yield similar energy levels, but the cannabis is easier and faster to grow than wood and dries out more quickly. A typical growing season lasts six months, from April to September. The fibres can also be used to make fine paper, canvas shoes or car bumpers. Ireland intends to be the first country to use it to generate electricity. The Government is holding an international competition to find the best design for a biomass power plant, which would burn cannabis, waste paper and chicken droppings. The plant could be in operation by 1999, generating electricity for more than 30,000 homes 1 per cent of Ireland's total energy needs. Dr. Burke said that Cannabis sativa would be a perfect alternative crop for farmers curtailed from producing more food for the European Union. At 3190 an acre, it is 350 cheaper to produce than wheat or barley. Ireland's planned use of cannabis is a far cry from the staple fuel of bog peat which has warmed Irish houses for generations. But the bog is running out. There are 1.2 million hectares of bog in Ireland, 8 per cent of them owned by Bord na Mona, the national peat cultivator. Peat accounts for 12 per cent of the fuel used to generate electricity, fourth to coal, gas and oil. Bord na Mona says it has sufficient resources for another 30 years, after which its contribution to the national grid would dwindle. Humans have been using hemp to make ropes and baskets for at least 6,000 years. The plant is widely grown in India and throughout Eastern Europe. Its main use is as a source of fibre used for twine, rope and string, and for coarse sacking and canvas. The plant, an annual grown from seed, can grow up to a height of 16ft. In dense cultivation it usually reaches between 7ft and 10ft. The seeds are a source of oil used to make paints, varnishes, soaps and, more commonly, birdseed. The narcotic chemicals are usually found in the leaves and blossoms.WT01-B19-28IA087-000631-B010-72http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/HEMP/CROP/crop.html 206.61.184.43 19970122075058 text/html 1075HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:50:48 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:20:10 GMTContent-length: 861 Hemp as a crop for Missouri farmers Hemp as a crop for Missouri farmers Hemp as a crop for Missouri farmers (1991) Carl E.

Henry Clay was one of thelargest hemp producers in America .America, Russia, Hemp, and Napoleon,"  Alfred Crosby, 1965, reveals howhemp was one of the main causes of the War of 1812 when Napoleon formed analliance with the czar of Russia which cut off Great Britain's access toRussian hemp.  At that time nearly all the marine hemp used in the worldcame from Russia.Pharmacological Reviews,  Vol.23, No. 4, 1971, "Chemistry of Marihuana," Coy Waller.  One of the first studies that clearly shows that hemp-typemarihuana grown for fiber is very low in THC, the psychoactive componentthat gets people high.  The drug-type marihuana is very high in THC.  Alsothe precursor agent Cannabidiol, CBD, which is not psychoactive, is veryhigh in fiber-type hemp but very low in drug-type.  This is important asCBD is known to block the effects of THC.  This makes the hemp-type doublyuseless for drug effects.Economic Botany,  29:  April-June, 1975, pp. 153-163.  "SeasonalFluctuations in Cannabinoid Content of Kansas Marijuana,"  R.P. Latta, andB.J. Eaton.  Wild  'marijuana' growing in Riley County Kansas was found tobe very low in THC content.  The leaves and flowering tops averaged from0.01-0.49% THC with a mean of 0.14% THC.  CBD which blocks the psychoactiveeffects of THC was as high as 1.7% (Average marijuana seized by lawenforcement agencies is  about 3-3.5% THC.)

These researchers for the Canadian Department of Agriculture tested over350 varieties of Cannabis in Ottawa, Ontario.  They determined that therewere two basic types of Cannabis based on genetic characteristics:  adrug-type which originates in hot climates such as India and is high in THCbut low in CBD and a fiber-type hemp which originates in temperate climatesand is low in THC but high in CBD and is used industrially for fiber andfood.  This awareness of the separateness of the two types has vastagronomic potential.  It means fiber hemp can be grown without the drugeffect of 'marijuana.'Compte Rendu Academie Agriculture de France,  "Apercu de la Production deChanvre en France,"  Fournier G., Paris M.R., Paris R.R.,  Vol. 62, 1976, pp.  1262-1270.

Beyond the Soybean What is Hemp? Hemp is Cannabis Sativa, but a different strain than Marijuana. Hemp has been cultivated for thousands of years in temperate climates, Marijuana in tropical climates. Although once thought to be different plants, they are now considered different strains of the same plant. Hemp produces very little T.H.C. (the drug that produces the "high"), Marijuana produces much more. Hemp fiber has been used for 9,000 years, first in China. Its fiber is used for rope, canvas, clothing, and paper. It is considered the best raw material for these basic commodities, easy to work with and strong. (in fact, the word "canvas" is derived from "cannabis.") When America's founding fathers planned liberation from England they knew that an independent suppy of fiber for paper, ropes, ship sails, and clothing was critical. Therefore they grew Hemp with great enthusiasm. Even the Declaration of Independence was written on Hemp paper, and the first U.S. flags were made of Hemp. Yes, Hemp is as American as Apple Pie, Betsy Ross, and the American Flag! Hemp can also be used to make paint, lumber, charcoal, lubricants, batting, plastics, fuel, and cooking oil. In fact, Henry Ford once made a car that used Hemp to make body panels and upholstery. Hemp was a significant part of the U.S. and world agriculture and industry, until beingcaught in the rising tide of manufactured sentiment against its cousin, Marijuana, in 1937. Hemp can be grown all over North America, and grows especially well where tobacco is now planted. (in our country's early years Kentucky consistently had the tallest Hemp plants.) Hemp roots help control erosion, it has few pests and is very hardy. Paper from hemp requires no dioxinto bleach it (unlike wood paper). "Hemp for Victory" was a World War II campaign to get U.S. farmers to grow Hemp for use in the war effort. The U.S. Department of Agriculture even made an instructional film for farmers growing Hemp. Today, domestic cultivation of Hemp would improve our economy and environment by reducing our need for petroleum, trees, and imported textiles. Hemp Seeds are high in the essential fatty acids Omega-3 Linolenic Acid and Omega-6 Linoleic Acid, and Super Omega-6 Linoleic Acid, in "Nature's perfect balance" (according to Dr. Udo Erasmus). They also contain 23% complete protein, and 35% fiber. Hemp Seeds make superior bird seed and have been imported foryears by seed companies (of course, the seeds must first be sterilized by exposure to 160 F degrees steam for 5 minutes in order to be legal). The seeds contain no T.H.C. What are Hemp Foods? Foods made from Hemp are usually snacks that contain whole Hemp Seeds. However, Sharon's Finest of Santa Rosa California, is using the Hemp Seeds in the same way they have used soybeans for 14 years. The firm produces HempRella (TM) cheese alternative containing 5% milled Hemp Seeds (similar to their TofuRella® cheese alternative) and Hempeh (TM) Burger, which is a soybean-and-rice tempeh burger that contains 10% whole Hemp Seeds. The future of Hemp Foods lies in using Hemp Seeds to make an emulsion (analogous to soymilk from the soybean) which can then be used to make milk, yogurt, ice cream, tofu, cheese, meat alternatives, and the like. Unfortunately, sterilizing them makes Hemp Seeds much harder to work with and reduces nutritional value somewhat. Page 1 of 2 If it's so good then why is Hemp illegal? In 1937 Congress passed the "Marijuana Tax Act" without so much as a roll call vote. The Virginia Law Review called the hearings on the matter a "near comic example of dereliction of legislative responsibility." It noted that no primary empirical evidence was presented about the drug ... [only] hearsay and emotional pleas", and that the law "was tied neither to scientific study nor law enforcement need." The prestigious law journal concluded that Congress was "hoodwinked." But why? Powerful timber and chemical interests had good reason to curtail Hemp, their most formidable competitor. Working with a California newspaper publisher who had lost 22,000 acres of timber land to Marijuana-smoking Mexican Revolutionaries, the fix was in. Fabricated and exaggerated stories were published about the "killer" weed Marijuana, and public sentimentturned. It was then easy to get Congress to ban Cannabis, including both Marijuana, and its innocent cousin Hemp, with nary a whimper from the public (bird seed and paint makers were exempted from the law). Aiding from within the federal bureaucracy was the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, in imminent danger of having its budget slashed. Its director was able to seize thethreat of this new drug menace to expand its budget and importance. The dirty deed was done, and not coincidentally soon thereafter Du Pont Chemical Co. introduced new chemicals to replace Hemp in industry, including Nylon. In 1970 Marijuana was made a Schedule I Controlled Substance with "no medical use" whatsoever, unavailable even for legitimate medical use. In June 1994 President Clinton signed an Executive Order promoting "strategic commodities," including Hemp. This Order makes official the federal government's interest in making viable domestic production of certain commodities that are imported, so that in the event of war or shipping interruptions we won't be caught short of products made from thosecommodities. The inclusion of Hemp in the Order proves the potential Hemp has for industry. Today, there is proof Marijuana is very useful in treating a variety of medical conditions, and Hemp fiber and seeds can be used widely and profitably as well. So why are very ill, terminal patients arrested for using medically-indicated Marijuana? And why is it still illegal to use Hemp Seeds if they aren't sterilized, even though viable seeds have no danger of abuse?

Definition Industrial hemp means those parts of the Cannabis sativaplant which contain less than 1.00% tetrahydrocannabinols (THC).THC is the psychoactive chemical found in Cannabis sativa.Industrial hemp is not to be confused with marijuana. Marijuanacomes from the flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant and containsmore than 1.00% THC.1 Industrial hemp has no psychoactiveproperties. Industrial hemp can be grown as a profitable, high-qualityfiber crop without producing marijuana. Registered seed varietiesthat produce hemp containing less than 0.3% THC even in theflowers are available throughout Europe.2 Farmers in the EuropeanCommunity have been growing hemp for over 20 years without anyproblems related to marijuana.3 II. Hemp Production in Other Countries Industrial hemp is grown as a profitable fiber crop in manycountries.4 Industrial hemp crops have been subsidized in theEuropean Community since before 1988.5 In 1993, England began toproduce hemp for fiber.6 In 1994, Canada harvested its firstcrop of industrial hemp after more than 50 years of prohibition.7The re-emerging world hemp industry is growing steadily, andfarmers are excited and enthusiastic about the potential of hempcrops. III. Hemp Production in the United States Hemp has been valued throughout this country's history as animportant raw material. Until the late 1800s, almost all of ourcloth was made from hemp, and virtually all of our paper was madefrom hemp rags.8 From 1631 to the early 1800s, hemp was such avalued commodity that it was considered legal tender (money).9Regions of Kentucky and Wisconsin were among the largest hempproducers.10 Hemp production seemed destined to increase dramatically inthe 1930s, when an invention called the decorticator begangetting wide attention.11 The decorticator strips the hemp fiberfrom the stalk. This had been the most labor-intensive andexpensive part of producing hemp.12 The decorticator was to hempwhat the cotton gin was to cotton. The invention prompted a 1937Popular Mechanics magazine to call hemp the "New Billion DollarCrop"13 and Mechanical Engineering magazine to call it "The MostDesirable Crop That Can Be Grown."14 However, the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act dealt a fatal blow tothe promising hemp fiber industry. The Act established aprohibitive tax on hemp manufacturers and distributors as well ason hemp transactions.15 It was modeled after a similar tax thatwas enacted to prohibit machine guns. The transfer tax of$1.00/ounce effectively ended all hemp production in the UnitedStates by making commerce in hemp prohibitively expensive. Restrictions on hemp production were eased briefly in theUnited States during World War II when Japan invaded thePhilippines, cutting off the supply of abaca (Manila hemp).16The U.S. Navy desperately needed a domestic supply of hemp toprovide the lines and rigging for its fleet. The U.S. Departmentof Agriculture encouraged farmers to produce hemp for the wareffort by distributing a film called "Hemp for Victory!".17 After World War II, the hemp industry declined as thefederal government again began to restrict hemp production.18Farmers continued to produce hemp on a limited scale until the1950s.19 However, legislation eventually came to treatindustrial hemp crops as marijuana (drug) crops, and hemp fiberproduction was no longer promoted. Currently, hemp production is treated as a felony in theUnited States because it is assumed that all hemp crops willproduce marijuana. With the advent of industrial hemp and low-THCseed varieties, this is no longer true. Hemp can now be grown asa profitable fiber crop in the United States with absolutely nodanger of increasing marijuana use. IV. Raw Materials and Products from Hemp Hemp consists of three principal raw materials: fiber,seeds, and hurds. Hemp is principally grown for the bast fiberit produces from its stalk. However, the seeds and hurds arealso important economically. Fiber: The hemp stalk is composed of 20% fiber.20 Hemp is thestrongest natural fiber in the world.21 It is valued for itsstrength and durability when used for textiles, cordage, andpaper. Textiles: The fiber can be made into any type of cloth, from the finest linen to the coarsest canvas.22 The word canvas comes from the Arabic word for hemp.23 Cloth made from hemp fiber is stronger, warmer, more durable, more absorbent, and softer than cotton.24 Cordage: Hemp rope has been valued throughout history for its superior strength and resistance to deterioration in salt or fresh water.25 Paper: Paper made from hemp is known as the "archivist's perfect paper" because it lasts much longer than tree pulp paper and does not harden, crack, yellow, or crumble with age.26 Hemp fiber can be used to make every grade of paper.27 Hurds: The hemp stalk is composed of 80% hurds.28 The hurds are thewoody inner portion of the hemp stalk that are separated from thehemp fiber.29 The hurds are 50% - 77% cellulose,30 which makesthem ideal for use in paper and plastic products. Paper: One acre of hemp hurds can make as much pulp for paper as four acres of trees.31 Hemp paper can be whitened without producing dioxins and lasts much longer than paper made from trees.32 Particle Board: Hemp hurds can be pressed and injected with phenolic resin to make a particle board that is resistant to fire and water.33 The board also makes a good insulation and thermal barrier.34 Plastic: Plastics were first made from plant cellulose (i.e., cellophane, celluloid).35 The hemp hurd is one of the richest sources of plant cellulose,36 a building block of modern industry. Plastics made from hemp instead of petroleum would be biodegradable.37 Animal Bedding: The hurds make an excellent animal bedding because they absorb more liquid and compost faster than wood shavings.38 Seed: The hemp seed is composed of two raw materials: the seed oiland the seed cake. Seed Oil: The hemp seed is composed of 30% oil.39 Food: Hemp seed oil contains over 70% cholesterol-fighting essential fatty acids, the highest of any seed oil.40 Fuel: Hemp seed oil can be chemically combined easily with 15% methanol to provide a premium diesel fuel substitute.41 This hemp bio-diesel fuel burns 70% cleaner than petroleum diesel in soot and particulate pollution.42 Paints and varnishes: Hemp seed oil dries quickly and leaves a thin elastic film.43 Lubricant: Hemp seed oil makes an ideal all-purpose lubricant.44 Seed Cake: The seed cake is the solid part of the seeds thatremains after the oil is expelled. Food: Hemp seed cake makes a nutritional, high-protein supplement to wheat flour. It contains 25% protein.45 Whole Seed: The whole hemp seed contains 20% high-qualitydigestible complete protein.46 Food: The hemp seed can be eaten as a nutritious snack, like sunflower seeds. Bird Feed: Birds like hemp seed because of its nourishing, oily content.47 V. Economics of Hemp Production A hemp crop could be sold for at least $860 per acre. Since a hemp crop produces three different raw materials each year, the total value of hemp far exceeds other crops grown for a single material. The chart below compares yields of hemp and comparable crops. Since there are currently no domestic hemp crops being sold in the United States, the prices for comparable crops were used to estimate the prices for domestic hemp fiber, hurds, and seed. Hemp fiber is compared to cotton for textile production. Hemp hurds are compared to wood chip prices and Douglas fir yield for paper production. Hemp seed is compared to soybeans for oil seed production. Production costs were not factored into this estimate, although hemp would be considerably less expensive to produce than cotton (see Section VI -- Hemp Cultivation).

VI. Hemp Cultivation Hemp is easy to grow.50 Hemp is an annual herbaceous crop that grows from 5 to 16 feet tall in a season of four months.51 It will grow in all 50 states.52 It is a good rotation crop.53 Hemp has long roots that penetrate and break the soil to leave it in perfect condition for the next crop.54 Production costs for hemp would be considerably lower than cotton's. Herbicides are not needed because fiber hemp is sown thickly and chokes out competing weeds.55 Pesticide use is limited because hemp has few insect enemies.56 VII. Current Hemp Market in the United States Hundreds of entrepreneurs are now selling imported hemp products. However, they are stifled by high prices and uncertain availability since all of the hemp is imported from overseas. Demand for hemp products in the U.S. is enormous. Hemp clothing and accessories have become a fashion trend.57 Tree- free hemp paper is also in demand.58 The market has a potential of as much as $15 to $30 billion a year.59 VIII. Potential for New Jobs Hemp production in Colorado would create new farming opportunities and make Colorado farmers competitive in the global market against countries that already grow hemp for fiber. It would also create thousands of processing and manufacturing jobs in such industries as textiles, plastics, pulp paper, energy, timber, construction, and food. The retail market for tree-free paper and building materials, for biodegradable plastics, for soft and durable natural clothing, and for other hemp products has huge potential. IX. Benefits of Hemp Production Hemp will be a profitable crop for farmers because of the volume of hemp each crop produces, the number of different products that can be made from hemp, and the demand for hemp products. Not only is hemp profitable, but it is a desirable crop to grow for other reasons. Hemp is a renewable and sustainable resource. It will help shift our economy away from dwindling non-renewable petroleum resources and help preserve our forest resources. Hemp is the strongest natural fiber.60 It has an extremely high cellulose content.61 It is biodegradable.62 It requires no herbicides to grow.63 It can be used to make paper, cloth, rope, particle board, plastic, paint, varnishes, linoleum, dynamite, fuel, food, and cardboard. It will create new jobs and make Colorado competitive with other countries. It is the fiber of the 1990s. Copyright 1994 by The Boulder Hemp Initiative Project.

July 7, 1996, Page 1B. Des Moines Sunday Register Post Office Box 957 Des Moines, Iowa 50304 FAX: 515-286-2504 letters@dmreg.com Non-Smokable Kind Revival of hemp industry at hand? Some say the weed, once produced widely in Iowa as a contribution to the WWII effort, could be a valuable crop here again. By GEORGE ANTHAN The Register's Washington Bureau Chief Washington, D.C. -- Iowans were startled in the mid-1960s when newspaper headlines proclaimed that cannabis sativa, better known as marijuana, was growing on the Statehouse grounds. Actually, it shouldn't have been a surprise -- and it most likely wasn't a plot by counterculture forces to embarrass the state. It was simply that cannabis, also better known for centuries as hemp, had been produced widely in Iowa as a patriotic (and profitable) contribution to the World War II effort. It was part of a program to provide vital rope and sheeting for the Navy. And the seeds of this hardy weed simply had stayed around, even after hemp production was prohibited, popping up in ditches, at the edges of fields -- and on the Statehouse grounds. Now, some farmers and agricultural researchers are trying to re-establish the hemp industry in the United States, contending it can be highly profitable. Iowa a Garden Spot The move to resurrect hemp output is centered in Colorado, Missouri and Kentucky, but agricultural experts agree that Iowa represents ideal growing conditions for cannabis. In fact, delegates to this year's national convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation voted overwhelmingly in favor of research into revival of an industrial hemp industry in the United States. The United States currently imports a small amount of raw hemp from the Philippines, Britain and China for processing into a variety of products. Hemp advocates say many more finished hemp-containing products are imported -- products that could be produced here. Industrial hemp, its proponents contend, doesn't offer the euphoric impact of marijuana because it contains less than 1 percent of the chemical THC, which produces the effects. There have been periodic reports since World War II of attempts to harvest wild-growing hemp in Iowa and to convert it to smokable material. But self-described "experts" say it's highly inferior, if not downright repellent, as a drug. Paper, Canvas, Cloth Cannabis fiber, which is separated from the plant's stem, is essential to the manufacture of certain kinds of cordage and also is used in making paper, canvas and a popular cloth for clothing. Oil from the plant is manufactured into caulking material, paint, plastics, varnish and soap. Hemp was a major crop in the southeastern United States until the mid-19th century, when cheaper imports began arriving. But it became a vital crop in the Midwest, especially in north-central Iowa, as World War II cut off overseas supplies. A 1943 report in The Des Moines Register notes: "Growing the weed as a crop looked a little silly to some farmers at first. Many were skeptical. They had known hemp only as marijuana, a harmful narcotic, a weed smoked by drug addicts." The report continued: "Government men told farmers the war had cut off imports of Manila hemp and sisal fiber" and that "farmers need not worry about growing a narcotic." By the end of the war, more than 4,000 Iowa farmers were growing hemp on tens of thousands of acres, with prices guaranteed by the government. Herbert Howell, a farm management specialist at Iowa State University from 1934 until 1973, said in addition to promoting hemp production, the government set up about a dozen hemp processing plants in Iowa during the war. A Surprise ISU economist Neil Harl, who grew up on an Iowa farm, said: "I was a kid then, but we viewed it as part of the war effort, and it was a surprise to many law-abiding Iowa citizens to learn it had another use." Bob Winter, a northeastern Colorado farmer and president of the Weld county Farm Bureau, is a leading advocate of an industrial hemp industry and contends the Justice Department's Drug Enforcement Administration is "brainwashing state legislators and local law enforcement officials into opposing the move. Winter said international trade treaties signed by the United States say that any hemp with less than three-tenths of 1 percent THC shall be considered industrial hemp, and not marijuana. "But current U.S. law does not differentiate between industrial hemp and marijuana," he said. "Thanks to these laws, the U.S. lags behind other world powers in hemp production and must import raw hemp pulp for manufacture here." Winter and the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project, which he helped organize, estimate that industrial hemp producers would reap a profit of more than $500 an acre, based on current prices. "Everybody agrees this is a good idea except the drug enforcement people," he said. Potential Reflected Dennis Stolte, a Farm Bureau official here, said the group's backing of industrial hemp "was a bit of a surprise to a lot of us. It shows the potential for hemp and reflects farmers' looking for alternative crops." Stolte said hemp "grows like a weed, with very little need for pesticides or cultivation. And its water needs are not very great." In a recent publication, the Farm Bureau says that many new varieties of the cannabis sativa plant available in Europe contain less than three tenths of 1 percent THC and that "European farmers have been growing hemp for over 20 years without any problems related to marijuana." But the DEA hasn't budged. Agency officials here said hemp is just another name for marijuana although federal law does exclude from the "marijuana" designation the stalks and fibers from hemp plants and products manufactured from these fibers.WT01-B19-33IA087-000631-B010-224http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/HEMP/fiber.html 206.61.184.43 19970122075225 text/html 4487HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:52:16 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:26:09 GMTContent-length: 4272  *       WHAT IS THE LONGEST AND STRONGEST NATURAL FIBER?       * *                       YOU MAKE THE CALL                      * ******************************************************************* This material was re-printed in the True Hemp Journal Vol 6#1  **  If you would like to subscribe to the worlds FIRST TOTALLY    ** INDUSTRIAL HEMP Magazine please contact The Institute for Hemp **        at instforhemp@delphi.com or call 612-222-2628          ******************************************************************* DIMENSIONS OF FIBERS AND CELLS OF VEGETABLE FIBERS: 1 	                   ULTIMATE                   FIBER LENGTH 2,mm       FIBER STRANDSFIBER               MIN   MAX   AVG    RANGE, cm   WIDTH, mm1.

MC NEIL,             Defendant.                                No. 1KE-93-947 CR                     MEMORANDUM OF DECISION        On September 4, 1992, Officer Peratrovich of the KlawockPolice Department sighted what he believed to be a small amount ofmarijuana within defendant's residence.  He saw this through a glassdoor at a distance of six feet or so.  He applied for a searchwarrant to return and seize this material "alleging a violation ofpossession."  (Tr. p. 2).  He estimated the amount to beapproximately "a gram" and stated it was accompanied by rollingpapers and a pipe.  (Tr. p. 4).  Service of the warrant resulted inthe seizure of this material (.21 gram) which later proved to be,in fact, marijuana.1        More than seven months later - on April 27, 1993 - defendantwas charged by complaint with a violation of AS 11.71.060(a)(1),Misconduct Involving a Controlled Substance in the Sixth Degree,____________________     1  Also located and seized during the search was a selection ofparaphernalia and a small amount of cocaine.                                1 alleging the possession of marijuana.  He was subsequently indictedJuly 9, 1993 for the same offense, stated as Count II of thatdocument.        Defendant has moved to suppress evidence taken under thewarrant on the grounds that there was insufficient probably causefor the issue of the warrant; the search exceeded the scope of thewarrant; and, finally, that AS 11.71.060(a)(1) violates article I,Section 22 of the State Constitution (the right to privacy) inasmuchas it criminalizes the personal possession of marijuana by adultsfor use in one's home.  Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494 (Alaska 1975).2        The attack on probable cause falls short.  The observationof this material at six feet, in conjunction with "rolling papers"and a pipe - both indicative of smoking activity - consitutes abasis for reasonable belief that the officer has seen marijuana.No special training would be required for most third graders to drawthis inference from the officer's testimony before the magistrate.        Likewise, defendant gets no relief from his argument thatthe officers' search warrant exceeded that authorized.  The magistrateannotated the warrant itself "Visible Rm (room) from sliding glassdoor only".  A common sense reading allows a search of that room -not only some portions of it.  All the evidence seized came fromthat room although the officers did a "sweep" of the rest of the____________________     2  Should Ravin continue to be good law the search warrantitself would be invalid as it was issued solely to aid theinvestigation of an act not constituting a violation of law.                                2 home to ascertain the presence or lack of occupants - a prudent andallowable intrusion beyond the scope of the warrant.        This leaves the thornier issue - the criminality ofpossession by adults of marijuana in the home for personal use.Defendant is an adult (d.o.b. March 14, 1960), the residence was hishome (Tr. p. 8), and the amount and circumstances certainly suggestonly personal use.        In 1978, the Supreme Court unanimously held that Article I,Section 22 of the Alaska Constitution - the right to privacy -protected the possession of marijuana by adults at home for personaluse.  Ravin v. State, 537 P.2d 494, 511 (Alaska 1975).  While notfinding a constitutional right to possess or use marijuana, theCourt found that "no adequate justification for the state'sintrusion into the citizen's right to privacy" existed or had beenshown.        The legislature attempted to accommodate this decision inTitle 17 and later AS 11.71.060 and .070 by limiting criminalpenalties for private, in-home possession by adults to amounts offour ounces or more.  In 1990 an initiative passed which isreflected in current AS 11.71.060(a)(1) - criminalizing possessionof any amount of marijuana anywhere, by anyone.  The legislature hassince taken no action on this issue.        The initiative is authorized in Article XI, Section 1 of the                                3 Alasks Constitution.3             The people may propose and enact             laws by the initiative, and approve             or reject acts of the legislature by             the referendum.        "The right of initiative and referendum, sometimes referredto as direct legislation, should be liberally construed to permitexercise of that right."  Thomas v. Bailey, 595 P.2d 1, 3 (Alaska1979).  Liberal construction seems to mean that defects in formshould be treated leniently.  However, courst will routinely strikethese enactments for trespass into prohibited substantive areas.See Citizens Coalition v. McAlpine, 610 P.2d 162, 168 (Alaska 1991).        As the court stated in McAlpine, "We must never lose sightof another important right of the people implicated in all cases ofconstitutional construction, namely the right to have theconstitution upheld as the people ratified it.  See, Thomas, 595P.2d at 3-4.  We must interpret all constitutional provisions -grants of power and restrictions on power alike - as broadly as thepeople intended them to be interpreted."  p. 168.        In State v. Lewis, 559 P.2d 630 (Alaska 1977), the Courtheld that the Alaska Constitution can only be amended in two ways.Article XIII, Sections 1 and 4 set these forth - either a two thirdsaffirmative vote of both legislative houses followed by approval bya majority of voters or a constitutional convention.  In Lewis this____________________     3  There are some limitations on the power in Article XI,Section 7 but they do not concern this issue.                                4 resulted in the invalidation of a proposition adopted by popularvote - a proposition that conflicted with the constitution asinterpreted by the Court.  In other words, the voters cannot changethe constitution simply by carrying the polls on a given day.  Theinitiative is designed as a means for the people to enactlegislation.  "Nevertheless the subject of the initiative mustconstitute such legislation as the legislative body to which it isdirected has the power to enact."  Municipality of Anchorage v.Frohme, 568 P.2d 3, 8 (Alaska 1977); Farnell v. Hesley, 431 P.2d 650(Cal. 1967) "The power to legislate by initiative and referendum is,however, subject to the same substantive constitutional limitationsas those applicable to the legislature itself."  SutherlandStatutory Construction 4th Ed., Section 4.09; Op. of the AttorneyGeneral 1959 #36, p. 2.        Ravin was founded in the Supreme Court's interpretation ofthe Alaska Constitution.  The legislature -  nor for that matter thepeople through the initiative - cannot "fix" what it disliked in aninterpretation of that document by legislation.  The only way to"fix" the Constitution is by the amendment process or a newconvention.  The initiative was inadequate to overrule Ravin andthat case remains the law.        There is another avenue for the State to follow.  Should theState make a clearly convincing showing that the ruling in Ravin wasin error or no longer sound due to changed conditions and that moregood than harm would result from a departure from precedent the                                5 Supreme Court would reverse itself.  State v. Dunlop, 721 P.2d 604,610 (Alaska 1986).  Ravin was decided during a period of seriousdebate about the harmful effects of marijuana use.  Science marcheson.  Perhaps there is now in existence sufficient evidence in thescientific community to persuade that Court that the State does havean adequate justification to intrude on individual privacy in themanner sought by AS 11.71.060(a)(1).  If this evidence exists itdoes not appear in this record - the State presented no evidence,or even argument on this point.  Accordingly, with no basis tooverrule or even qualify the Ravin decision, it must be applied.The evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant is suppressed andCount II of the Indictment is dismissed.4        Dated at Ketchikan, Alaska, this 29th day of October, 1993.

Thompson                            Superior Court Judge____________________     4  This might well have been a case in which the "good faith"exception to the warrant requirement would have saved Count I ofthe Indictment, should that principle ever be adopted in Alaska.Everyone - the officer and the magistrate - seems to have followedthe "rules" as they appeared to them to be.                                6WT01-B19-44IA087-000632-B011-204http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/WAR/conrad.html 206.61.184.43 19970122085830 text/html 10729HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 08:58:25 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:40:55 GMTContent-length: 10513 Date: Fri, 12 May 1995From: ConradBACH@aol.comTo: carlolsen@dsmnet.comSubject: Draft of treaty proposal Greetings! This document is to be presented and read at the June 24 HR '95 program and later pursued in whatever forum is most expeditious.  There are several key differences between what Mikki visualized and what I wrote, let alone what you think.  For example, Mikki thinks we should label the drug war a failure, and I think we should proclaim a conclusive victory.  We both think it should be shorter, but she wants to add more details on past and ongoing human rights abuses for emotional impact, along with excerpts from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Bill of Rights, etc., and I think it should be more general. We're now ready for your input. HR '95: Drug War Peace Treaty (First Draft May 12, 1995) Preamble:  We, the people, did not choose the rhetoric of warfare as an element of drug policy.  We did not declare war on our government, nor do we physically attack its institutions.  We do not wish to become combatants or casualties in the ever-escalating police actions of our own government.  Yet, for decades, ordinary citizens have been subject to the unprovoked violence and suffered cruel and unusual punishments in this politically motivated and one-sided Drug War.  Having borne more injustice than our patriotic forebears ever would have endured, we now call for a truce in the drug war to engage our government in negotiating a peace treaty, as follows:  Whereas the determination whether or not to consume any substance ormedication is a very personal decision reflecting free choice and individual preferences of lifestyle and social pastime;  Whereas the legitimate power of any just government is derived from a mutual respect of the government's laws by its people, and of the people's rights by their government; and Whereas the existing bureaucracy has made no effort to resolve this matter in a humane and negotiated manner, but has unilaterally pursued a military/police option with little discussion and no regard for its harm to families, individuals and human rights;  Therefore, on behalf of the American people, we declare this Drug War is ended.  We agree to eliminate the black market in drugs and the government agrees to abide by the following terms of agreement:  Article 1:  As a token of good faith, there shall be an immediate truce and release of all non-violent and otherwise (aside from drug charges) law abiding citizens held as Drug War prisoners by either side.  All pending non-violent drug charges shall be dropped.  Article 2:  The sovereignty of both citizen and state being the basis ofdomestic law, the United States shall withdraw from and repudiate the Single Convention Treaty on Narcotic Drugs and any other international agreement or treaty which limits its ability to settle our domestic drug dispute.  Article 3:  Medicinal use of any substance is the private decision of the patient with the guidance of a health care provider and should be as free as possible from government interference.  No patient shall be prosecuted nor any physician penalized for use of mutually agreeable medications.  Article 4:  Cultural distinctions being a natural and inherently enriching aspect of civilization, choice of intoxicants or mood altering drugs is a human right, as long as they are consumed in a safe and responsible manner.  Traditional drug crops shall be allowed in all communities and areas where they have been historically produced and used.  Article 5:  Consistency and fairness being the foundations of justice, persons involved with drugs retain all their inalienable, human and constitutional rights without exception.  Government agents who engage in illegal activities and entrapment or provoke the breaking of laws shall be held fully accountable and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  Article 6:  The role of law enforcement being to protect the rights,freedoms, properties and personal safety of the people, no consensual drug activity undertaken by two or more adults shall be considered a crime unless a charge of damages is filed by an affected private party.  Personal use of drugs is a private matter and exempt from government oversight.  Article 7:  Protection of public safety being a valid concern of government, being under the influence of a substance shall not be a valid legal defense, and every individual shall be held fully responsible for their own actions.  Performance and coordination tests, not forensics, shall be applied to determine impairment in the investigation of reckless or negligent operation of a motor vehicle.  Article 8:  The private sector being the most capable and effective response mechanism to supply and demand, government involvement in the manufacture and distribution of drugs shall be regulatory rather than direct.  Such regulation may be held analogous to the wine model.  Commerce in drugs shall be subject to the same legal and ethical standards as any other business.  Article 9.  The elimination of the black market in illegal drugs being a primary purpose of this agreement, persons already engaging in the marketing of illicit drugs shall be given the opportunity to legitimize their operations without penalties for prior illegal activities.  Testimony of satisfied customers shall be presented in support of such application.  Article 10:  The health and welfare of the people being a rightful concern of government, the following harm reduction measures shall be implemented:  1.

Padavich P.O. Box 79 Plano, Iowa 52581 Carl Olsen Post Office Box 4091 Des Moines, Iowa 50333 Dear Carl, I'm writing you to tell you about being arrested in Appanoose County Iowa near Centerville. On February 19th 1993 I was arrested on a county road near my home by Appanoose County Sheriff's deputies, Centerville Police Department and Iowa Division of Narcotics agents for "Prohibited Acts". I was operating my father's 1985 Ford Escort station wagon in a legal manner when I was stopped and arrested. Police Officer Mike Seay informed me he and Chief Deputy Gary D. Anderson had obtained 3 search warrants. One warrant for my residence, one warrant for my parents' residence and one warrant for a farmhouse that my father owns. I was searched and sent to jail. I remained in jail until May 3rd 1993. It came to be known that officers Anderson and Seay had committed perjury on the search warrant application. It also came to be known that Jerry Nelson, Michael C. Seay, Gary D. Anderson, and their informant Jeff Shondel, had engaged in a plan to "frame me". Jeff Shondel, an alleged informant was said by Anderson and Seay to have "set-up" a situation in which Jeff Shondel would sell 3 kilograms of cocaine to an individual named Vincent Portela, who Shondel claims to have met at my father's farmhouse at rural Plano Iowa on February 12th 1993. Quoting from the affidavit to obtain a search warrant, Shondel allegedly stated the following: Vincent Portela offered to purchase cocaine from Jeff Shondel for $60,000. Shondel described Vincent Portela as having a medium build, slender, and "with a large scar from his ear to his chin and a deformed upper jaw." Officer Seay alleges he showed a picture of Vincent Portela to Shondel and Shondel said that was the person he met with on February 12th 1993. On February 19th 1993, three search warrants were issued in reliance on Mr. Seay's and Anderson's allegations that Shondel had arranged a "controlled delivery". Seay and Anderson also alleged that Shondel had "smoked" marijuana with Chris Padavich on February 16th 1993 at my father's farmhouse in rural Plano Iowa. On February 19th 1993 at 6:15 p.m. Officer Seay and Anderson went to the farmhouse owned by my father and executed a search warrant and allege to have found 4 1/2 pounds of marijuana. On March 21st 1993 Officer Anderson aquired an ex-parte order from Wallace Carter, Appanoose County Magistrate, to seize one 1987 Lincoln Towncar, one 1982 Lincoln Towncar, and 34 cows that were located on the farm. April 2nd 1993 the above property was sold at public auction. The Iowa Department of Revenue assessed a penalty of $20,360 against me for 2019 grams of marijuana. The was done to collect the Drug Tax Stamp that Iowa law allows. The Drug Tax Stamp is collected on "allegations" in the state of Iowa. If a person is accused, then the Department of Revenue can collect the tax. The amount of tax is computed by taking 2019 grams of marijuana multiplied by $5 a gram. The law then calls for "double penalties" which makes it $10 a gram. On May 21st 1993 in Appanoose County District Court I filed a motion to suppress the 4 1/2 pounds of marijuana. The District Court Judge James P. Reilly heard the motion to suppress. Michael C. Seay, Gary D. Anderson, Jerry Nelson of the Iowa Division of Narcotics Enforcement, and Jeff Shondel, testified at the hearing for the state. On direct examination by my attorney, Jeff Shondel testified that "he did not know Vincent Portela". Shondel also testified that he did not remember describing Portela as having a scar from his ear to his chin and a deformed jaw. Shondel testified that Jerry Nelson on February 19th 1993 had given Shondel $10,000 and provided Shondel with 61 pounds 6 ounces of cocaine. Jerry Nelson testified that there was no sale of cocaine on February 19th 1993. Officer Seay testified that in fact Vincent Portela was in prison in New York and could not have been at the residence as Shondel and Seay had said. Mr. Seay claims he did not lie or know Shondel was lying when he had prepared the affidavit. Mr. Seay claims that Shondel met "a look alike" to Vincent Portela, another individual that has a scar from his ear to his chin and a deformed upper jaw. To date Mr. Seay has not produced anyone who looks like Vincent Portela. The search warrant relied on in this case was an "anticipatory" search warrant. The warrant was issued on Mr. Seay's and Shondel's representations that Shondel would sell 3 kilograms of cocaine on 2/19/93. There was no one at the house when Shondel arrived there, no sale, no money, no Portela. The judge, James P. Reilly, ruled that a controlled set-up is legal even if the drugs are not delivered to the property if Shondel said he had smoked marijuana there. The testimony at the motion hearing clearly establish that the "controlled set-up" was "a mere pretext to an unjustifiable search." The fact that I was arrested on the roadside for "Prohibited Acts" demonstrates that the controlled delivery that did not occur was the basis for the search warrants. The reason being, that I was not arrested for "smoking pot", but for cocaine that the law enforcement agents had provided to a convicted felon named Jeff Shondel. At the time of my arrest, Officer Seay advised me that he was going to search. Therefore, the police were not aware of the contents of the residences. On December 3rd 1993 I was found guilty of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver and Iowa Drug Tax Stamp. On January 14th 1994 I was sentenced to two 5 year sentences to run consecutively and fined $5,000 on each count plus 30% surcharge. I was sent to prison until January 22nd 1994 when my father posted $20,000 appeal bond. The case is now on appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court. On May 15th 1995 a hearing was held at the capitol in front of 5 justices of the Iowa Supreme Court. In the hearing, the Iowa Assitant Attorney General, Bridget Chambers, agreed that Shondel had lied and the Mr. Seay and Anderson had known that Shondel was lying. Justice Louis Lavaroto said, "Does the state agree that Shondel's credibility was totally shattered at the motion hearing?" Miss Chambers' response, "Yes". It is now apparent that there was perjury and that the police engaged in a scheme to "frame me". I'm currently awaiting a decision in the case. The issue remaining is whether the police can obtain 3 search warrants for 3 properties on a known liar's allegation that he had smoked marijuana at one of the residences. The Iowa Supreme Court on April 26th 1995 in State v. Gillespie, an appeal from Polk County of a cocaine distribution case, ruled that Iowa Code chapter 808 does not allow "anticipatory warrants". That is the reason the state claims that "smoking marijuana" is sufficient to uphold the 3 warrants. It should be noted that Shondel when asked could not even describe the interior of the residence he claims to have been in on the dates Shondel claims to have been there. Mr. Seay and Anderson in the affidavit for search warrant claim that they had "confirmed" Shondel's allegations. At the suppression hearing, Mr. Seay claims that he was at the Law Center in Centerville, 11 miles away, and that neither he nor any other officer observed any activity at any of the three residences. It was also discoverd that Jeff Shondel was a convicted felon. He was a convicted thief. Also Shondel was facing 20 years in federal prison for possession the cocaine that law enforcement used to "set-up" the search. In the attachments to the search warrants, Mr. Seay claimed that "Shondel had no motivation to falsify information". At the motion hearing, Seay claimed he did not know Shondel was a felon or that Shondel was facing prison time. It's obvious that the police here are corrupt. Obviously, Judge James Reilly condones illegal acts by the police. I feel Ihave a duty to reveal these criminals to the public. If the Iowa Supreme Court upholds the search warrants, I plan to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court the search and the Iowa Drug Tax Stamp. If anyone has any input about my letter, please have them write to me. My address is Chris Padavich, P.O. Box 79, Plano, Iowa 52581. Thanks.

How manyof these people received such long sentences are absurd stories, buteven if they were all caught with large amounts of marijuana theirsentences are still outrageous considering the average length of timesomeone does for murder is about eight years.  It is bad enough thatwe are in prison, but it 4s even worse and enough to break someone'sheart when we are put in here with men that death will be their onlyrelease from here.  Many of these people have exhausted their appealsand the only thing that gets them through another day is the hopethat legalization activists give them.Sincerely,Paul Westmoreland Dear Carl,     I want to thank you for the help that you gave us with gettingthe marijuana plant weight change in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.The change will get a total of 45 years cut off of the sentences ofsome of the people in these pictures and with some changes in the Mandatory Minimum sentencing laws the plant weight change will help get even more time cut from some of these people's sentences.     I also want to encourage all marijuana POWs to become active,even if it is just writing one letter a month to somebody.  Thatone letter helps!  I also want to tell all federal POWs not to wastetheir time in prison by spending some time in the law library researchingtheir case.  Of course a lawyer is going to try to make you think thathe/she did as good of a job as they could, but if you will researchyour case you might find out that they didn't.  Don't think that everything the U.S. Attorney said is the truth, if you check you might find out they lied about many things.  I started of with a 151 month sentence three years ago, after finding out the U.S. Attorney lied about my criminal history (I told my lawyer I thought they had one charge wrong, but even my lawyer lied to me and said he checked that charge andU.S. Attorney had it right) I will be able to get my sentence reducedto 63 months.  In 1993 the U.S. Sentencing Commission changed the waythat it weighed LSD and I thought that the amount of weight chargedfor marijuana plants was just as absurd as the way they had been weighingLSD, so I started writing people asking them to get the marijuana plantweight changed.  It took two years to get the change, but now I mightbe going home as soon as November of this year.  I am not sayingthat everybody will get the same results, but you never know untilyou try!Sincerely,Paul Westmoreland MAY 13, 1995 TALLADEGA FEDERAL CORRECTION INSTITUTION NONVIOLENT MARIJUANA OFFENDERS L - RPICTURE 1          Theron Godwin                  20 Years          Randy Haggard                  14 Years          Robert Jonas                   LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE          Benny Buice                    10 Years, 10 Months L - RPicture 2          Ronnie Hatchett                30 Years          Michael Lawrence               8 Years, 1 Month          Steve Tucker                   10 Years, 1 Month          Stephen Becker                 30 Years L - RPicture 3          Fred Cundiff                   LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE          Scott Hames                    26 Years          Gary Tucker                    16 Years, 8 Months          Sam Hester                     21 Years, 10 Months L - RPicture 4          Ralph Carnes (76 years old)    8 Years, 4 Months          Mike Cutkomp                   25 Years          James Fuller (70 years old)    12 Years          Paul Westmoreland              12 Years, 7 Months L - RPicture 5          Bobby Steed                    17 Years, 6 Months          Tim Latham                     21 Years, 10 Months          Pedro Reynaga                  7 Years, 2 Months TOTAL LENGTH OF TIME                     290 Years, 11 Months(NOT INCLUDING THE TWOWITH LIFE SENTENCES)THE AVERAGE SENTENCE IS OVER             17 Years ALL FEDERAL INMATES MUST SERVE 85% OF THEIR SENTENCE Please send your comments regarding this page to: carlolsen@dsmnet.com Carl E.

TOM BROWNDEFENDANT - APPELLANT BRIEF OF THE APPELLANT ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS, FAYETTEVILLE DIVISIONBEFORE JUDGE FRANKLIN WATERSDISTRICT COURT CASE # 94-50030-01 Rev. Tom Brown, Pro Per04808-010P.O. Box 4000Springfield, Missouri 65801STATEMENT OF INTRODUCTION     The Defendent / Appellant, Rev. Tom Brown Pro Per, seeks to introduce this appeal by casting the eye of the Court on some issues that should be kept in mind as the Court considers the case at hand.  This case is only one in a long series of battles of the vaunted War on Drugs.  As in any war, looking back over the past thirty years, we can see lots of casualties.  The question is, how many more bodies will be heaped on the Alter of National Paranoia ?  A wise man once said that those who refuse to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.  Perhaps the Court could look at another war we waged on ourselves, another war bred in ignorance and fed on lies and corruption.     In Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. at page 700, Justice Taney announces the decision of the Court saying:        "The question before us, is whether the class of persons   described in the plea of abatement compose a portion of this   people and are constituent members of this sovereignty.  We   think they are not, and that they are not included under the   word citizen in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none   of the rights and priveleges which that instrument provides   for and secures to citizens of the United States.  On the con-   trary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate and   inferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dom-   inant race, and whether emancipated or not, yet remained sub-   ject to their authority, and had no rights or priveleges but   such as those who held power and the government might grant   them.        It is not the providence of the Court to decide upon the   justice or injustice, the policy or the impolicy of these laws.   The decision of that question belonged to the political or   law making power; to those who formed the sovereignty and   framed the Constitution.        The language of the Declaration of independence is equa-   lly conclusive.  It proceeds to say; 'We hold these truths to   be self evident; that all men are created equal; that they are   endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that   among them is life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness;   that to secure these rights, governments are instituted, deri-   ving their just powers from the consent of the governed.'...        The general words above quoted would seem to embrace the   whole human family, and if they were used in a similar instru-   ment at this day, would so be understood.  But it is too clear   for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended   to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed   and adopted this declaration; . . ."     The Court will see these words again in the decisions which have refused to recognize the religous use of plants.  Not all courts have refused to recognize over 5,000 years of recorded human history, but the words of those who have are redolent with the scent of the Dred Scott decision, and the bodies of those who perished in the attempt to make up for the cowardice of the Dred Scott court.  Time after time those courts strain to justify the denial of rights which no man can claim did not exist and were not exercised among the peoples who wrote the Declaration and the Constitution.  And as Justice McLean's dissent shows below, despicable and vile acts perpetrated by men who happen to occupy positions of power are not unprecedented.  There was no Truth to the assertion that "no one thought of disputing" the issue of slavery at the time of the revolution.  There was no Truth to the statement that "they formed no part of the people who framed and adopted this Declaration."  In fact:        "Crispus Attucks, a Negro, was the first man killed by   the British in the Boston Massacre.  The five thousand Negro   soldiers who fought in the revolution . . .  Three quarters of   the Rhode Island Regiment passing in review at Yorktown in   1781 were Negroes. (Afro-American Encyclopedia, 1974)But this truth was known in 1856 as we see in Justice McLean's dissent:        "In the Convention, it was proposed by a committee of   eleven to limit the importation of slaves to the year 1800,   when Mr. Pickney moved to extend the time to the year 1808.   This motion carried . . .  In Opposition to the motion, Mr.   Madison said; 'Twenty years will produce all the mischief   that can be apprehended from the liberty to import slaves;   so long a term will be more dishonerable to the American   character than to say nothing about it in the Constitution'   Madison Papers.        But we know as a historical fact that James Madison, that   great and good man, a leading member in the Federal Convention,   was solicitous to guard the language of that instrument so as   not to convey the idea there could be property in Man."     So the lies and deceit of the Taney majority went on to result in a war of unprecedented proportion on this soil.  More died in it than in WWI, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam combined.  And we paid a hard price for that clever though despicable interpretation of History and precedent.  The question is posed here, what price will this Court chose to be paid.  The Rev. Brown comes to this Court as a Man of Honor, with empty hands and outstretched arms.  Rev. Brown comes before this Court as the result of an act of conscience, inspired by the Holy Spirit of God.  The Court is refered to the words of James Michner, in his book Covenent.  As we listen, a young African is asking an old adviser as to the choice of weapons he should carry;        "How do I protect myself ?"        "Integrity is a good shield.  He paused.  Did I ever come   armed to your fathers krall ?  Couldn't he have killed me in a   moment if he wished?  Why didn't he?  Because he knew that if he   killed a Man of Honor, he'd soon have on his hands, men with   none.  And then the whole thing falls apart. (pg. 91)     Later in the book, another character is remembering her brother who became a spy and sold the secrets of the government.        "When she tried to decipher how he had been seduced into   committing his mortal sin - the betrayal of his nation and his   peers - she began to think of the role words play in life.  Our   family was keen on word games.  Wexton and I played them const-   antly.  I think I first came to suspect him when he cheated one   day.  Altered the meaning of a word in order to win.  At Cambridge   he altered the meanings of great words and ended a traitor.   Back in Salisbury, walking within the shadow of the Cathedral,   she thought: Integrity in words protects integrity in life.   If a word is corrupted, everything that stems from it will be   evil."     And so it is that we have evil in our own time, and in our own place. A creeping, seductive evil that knows every nook and cranny of the administrative, legislative and judicial branch of government.  And it is born in a series of little lies, lies told, lies repeated, and lies which become the bricks of the foundation of our life.  And the question is, will this Court end the lies.     There are already over ten million marijuana felons in our nation.  We outnumber all the judges, prosecutors, police, drug bureaucrats, and military by about two to one.  How much longer will thirty perceent of our population be treated as a "subordinate and inferior class of beings . . . (who) had no rights or priveleges but such as those who held power and the government might grant them."  How much longer will we be expected to suffer in peace while the abuses of our rights continue unabated?  How much longer will the courts decide questions of the burdening of religous establishment and exercise one way for the Roman Catholic Church, and another for Our Church ?  Is it too soon to address the question, is the issue not ripe enough ?  You can dam the river, but you can't stop the rain.  Please, for God's sake and our own, stop the lies and live in the truth !WT01-B19-49IA087-000632-B011-398http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/WAR/sense.html 206.61.184.43 19970122090010 text/html 5267HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 09:00:04 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:42:43 GMTContent-length: 5052 A common-sense judge Inflexible sentencing guidelines add to federal prison crowding The Justice Department reports that the number of men and women behind bars increased by 83,294 last year, the second-biggest yearly increase in history, bringing the number of state and federal prisoners to just over 1 million - a new record. Counting the number of people on probation or parole, more than 5 million Americans are under some form of court supervision. That figure has tripled since 1980. If American prisons were stockholder-owned companies, they would be the darlings of Wall Street. Unfortunately, taxpayers are footing the bill, and they are getting precious little for their investment. While overall crime rates may be declining, Americans do not feel safer and violent offenders seem increasingly beastly. The role of prisons must get more thoughtful consideration. Certainly, violent criminals must be confined, but the cold reality is the nation can't afford to continue putting so many people behind bars. The problem is particularly acute in the federal system, where new sentencing rules have increased the median prison time by 60 percent between 1986 and 1992. And, thanks to the "war on drugs, 60 percent of federal prisoners in 1993 were convicted of drtig-related crimes - up from 25 percent a decade earlier. The combination of aggressive federal drug prosecutions and new sentencing rules is causing federal prisons to fill up with offenders serving sentences of 30 years or more for relatively minor drug offenses. And the situation has some federal judges near revolt. Senior Circuit Judge Myron H. Bright of Fargo, N.D., is one. Bright, a federal judge for nearly three decades, sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, which includes Iowa. He's had it with the federal sentencing system. In a recent case involving two Iowa men sentenced to roughly 29 years each in a drug-sales conspiracy, Bright filed a separate opinion declaring war on the federal sentencing rules, which factor in such things as prior records, the use of weapons, the amount of drugs seized, etc., to produce a sentence by a mathematical formula created by a federal sentencing commission. Neither Larry Edward Hiveley, 48, nor Ansil Ezra Henry, 44, had serious prior records; indeed, they were deemed worthy of release on their word they would show up for trial. But, based on the amount of drugs seized and the presence of weapons in Hiveley's home, the sentencing formula dictated a 21-year sentence for Hively and 19 1/2 years for Henry. Bright concedes they deserve prison, but "I doubt that any reasonable judge would have sentenced these offenders to more than 10 years' incarceration, and most probably to less, given their limited criminal history." By the time these two former Iowa farm boys are released, Bright noted, they will be candidates for the geriatric ward, and taxpayers will have spent close to a half-million dollars to imprison them for a decade longer than necessary. "But that is only an infinitesimal portion of the financial burden imposed by excessive sentences" in the federal system, Bright said. He calculates that the unnecessary imprisonment of minor drug offenders costs tax payers nearly $359 million a year, adding up to billions over time. And it's not just the wasted resources, but wasted lives, too. "As an appellate judge, I have seen Draconian sentences meted out in drug cases where an offender has had no contact with any drugs but may only be a minor functionary in a drug conspiracy where heavy amounts of drugs could be involved." He cited a case where the offender merely "provided glassware usable to manufacture amphetamines"and was sentenced to serve 30 years. "These unwise sentencing policies which put men and women in prison for years not only ruin lives of prisoners and often their family members, but also drain the American taxpayers of funds which can be measured in billions of dollars," Bright wrote. "In these times, the government, Congress and the president see the need to make drastic cuts in the federal budget.... This is the time to call a halt to the unnecessary and expensive cost of putting people in prison for a long time based on the mistaken notion that such an effort will win 'The War on Drugs.' If it is a war, society seems not to be winning, but losing." Bright cited a survey showing that 86 percent of federal judges want the sentencing rules changed. And he said he intends to append his protest statement to every drug case where he believes it applies. "The public needs to know that unnecessary, harsh and unreasonable drug sentences serve to waste billions of dollars without doing much good for society. We have an unreasonable system." May his words be heard.

'Scores' of sex-oriented items are also found in the van driven by police veteran James Trimble.  By MICHAEL McNARNEY Register Staff Writer       James R. Trimble, Urbandale police officer and school liaison officer for the Urbandale district, was arrested early Monday for allegedly possessing methamphetamine with the intent to deliver.      Also found were "scores" of sex-oriented pictures and letters.  No charges relating to those had been filed by Monday night.      Trimble, an 18-year Urbandale police veteran, will likely be suspended until the investigation is completed, Urbandale Police Chief David Hamlin said.      Trimble, 43 was pulled over by Des Moines police about 4 a.m. in the 600 block of Clark Street.  In a police report, Officer Steven Kees said, "There was a substantial amount of what appeared to be meth in the van.      Besides Trimble, of 501 Second St., West Des Moines, a woman with him in the van was also aressted: Lorrie K. Breiholz, 34, of 433 S.E. Phillip St., No. 106, in Des Moines.  Both were charged with possession of narcotics with the intent to deliver them.  Wife Is Arrested, Too      Trimble's wife was arrested six hours after he was when police raided their home.  Robin Lynn Trimble, 41, was charged with possession of narcotics.  A police report of the search alleged she was in possession of marijuana.      Trimble's mother, Beverly, let police search her home at 7213 Palm Drive in Urbandale.  They found nothing.  Police said the van Trimble was driving, which belongs to his mother, was circling a neighborhood north of downtown when Breiholz was seen by police not wearing a seat belt.  They said when Trimble pulled over, he made movements toward the center of the van "as if he was trying to hide or reach for something."      Trimble got out of the van and walked toward officers, and he did not get back in the van as ordered.  The police report said he was "extremely nervous."      While Trimble was detained in a police car, he told Kees that he was an Urbandale police officer.  Officers found a substance in the van, and a field test indicated that it was methamphetamine.  Des Moines police also called Hamlin, Urbandale's chief, to tell him what happened.      In a telephone interview Monday night, Hamlin said he was shocked when he got the news.      "He had a good work record, a good reputation with the department," Hamlin said.  "I found it rather stunning to hear about it."      Hamlin said he had not consulted with the city attorney, but he said he intends to suspend Trimble pending further investigation.  "At that time, I'll determine his long-term status," he said.      Hamlin said Trimble had been the school liaison officer for five years.      "I had no idea," Superintendent Tom Davis said of the news Monday.  He referred questions to school attorney Jeff Krausman.      Krausman said officials could not comment because Trimble is employed jointly by the school district and the city.      Trimble was active in D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), an anti-drug education program.  "We don't just teach kids what drugs look like," Trimble said in a 1992 interview.  "We teach life skills needed to say no to drugs, alcohol and tobacco.      Trimble was being held at the Des Moines City Jail Monday night.  Bond was set at $19,500.WT01-B19-51IA087-000632-B011-449http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/WAR/trimble1.html 206.61.184.43 19970122090030 text/html 4891HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 09:00:24 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:42:37 GMTContent-length: 4676 DARE cop busted for meth #2 The Des Moines Register, Wednesday, January 3, 1996, 1A  'I feel we have to be more careful of who we put in charge of your kids.' -- Brad Van Horn, parent  Shock, anger follow arrest of policman  Urbadale youths looked up to James Trimble, who encouraged them to lead responsible, drug-free lives.  By STEPHANIE ARMOUR Register Staff Writer       Urbandale, Ia. -- For years. Angie Van Horn believed her basketball coach was dedicated to keeping kids off drugs.      Now the 15-year-old doesn't know what to believe.      Early Tnesday morning, her parents told her that James R. Trimble -- an Urbandale police officer and long-time coach -- had been arrested.  The liaison officer with the Urbandale school district is charged with trafficking in marijuana and methamphetamine.      Police also say Trimble -- found with a sexual device insented in his body -- was driving around with scores of sex-oriented videotapes and pictures, including photos of himself.  A Des Moines woman was arrested with him.      "I looked up to him as a teachcr," Angie said of Trimble, who had been the ninth-grade girls' basketball coach.  "He would tell us not to do drugs and what they can do to you,  I'm kind of angry, because he was teaching me not to do that kind of stuff."      Angie's not alone.  Parents, students and co-workers who know Trimble expressed anger and shock at news of the arrest.      Trimble. an 18-year veteran of the Urbandale force, coached ninth-grade girls' basketball and volleyball.  He also was an officer with the district's Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program.  "A Hollow Spot"      Family members also said they were stunned.      "I just have a big hollow spot," said his mother, Beverly Trimble.  "I'm too upset.  Until I have a chance to talk to my son, I have no comment.  If you would let this subject drop, it would give the family some peace."      Starting today, the Urbandale district will launch a "crisis plan" -- holding group meetings and visits with counselors to discuss Trimble's arrest.      In light of some of the sexual material found with Trimble, administrators said they will probably talk with students to see if anyone felt uncomfortable with, or was threatened by, the officer.      Trimble has been suspended by the police department and the school district.      As a D.A.R.E. officer, he was one of several police members who would talk to young people about staying off drugs.  The 17-week program is aimed at fifth-graders.      He was described as a somewhat tempermental basketball coach who would cheer at football games and sit in on drug-abuse panels.  His daughter is a student in the Urbandale school district.  "People Are In Shock"      "A lot of people are in shock," said Urbandale Police Chief David Hamlin.  "He had a good background and devoted the last five years to working with young people.  It makes it more difficult to understand."      But some parents said they don't understand why Trimble was working with kids in the first place.      "We're very surprised and upset at the school system," said Brad Van Horn, Angie's father.  "I feel we have to be more careful of who we put in charge of your kids.  It stands to reason you can trust a police officer."      Some said they were troubled by the sexual smorgasbord discovered with Trimble.      He had "all kinds of sexually explicit" material, said Des Moines police Sgt. Bill Judkins.  Police said Trimble had a sexual device connected to a battery pack inserted in his body.      School officials described Trimble as "very actcve" in student activities, although not at the elementaty level.      "We are shocked and saddened by this," said Len Cockman, an Urbandale school spokesman.      But some said there should be few surprises when it comes to methamphetamine.      "Quite frankly, I can tell you we've been involved in investigating every race, every nationality, almost every occupatIon you can think of," said Des Moines police Lt. Russell Underwood.  "Now there's a police officer, which is devastating."  SCHOOL ROLES  Urbandale officer James Trimble was involved in:  * Coaching ninth-grade girls' basketball and volleyball in the Urbandale school district.  * Drug Abuse Resistance Education, or D.A.R.E., as a school liaison officer.  * Quest, a program at Urbandale Middle School that aims to build character and values.WT01-B19-52IA087-000632-B012-6http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/WAR/trimble2.html 206.61.184.43 19970122090039 text/html 4268HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 09:00:33 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:42:34 GMTContent-length: 4053 DARE cop busted for meth #3 The Des Moines Register, Wednesday, January 3, 1996, 1A  Trimble's wife accuses him of domestic abuse after dispute  He is ordered to stay away from his spouse after allegedly threatening to kill her and himself in a dispute hours before his arrest.  By TOM ALEX Register Staff Writer       An Urbandale police officer arrested on drug trafficking charges is also facing a charge of domestic abuse.      James R. Trimble threatened to kill his wife and then commit suicide early New Year's Day, according to a no-contact order issued Tuesday in Polk County District Court.  The order was issued after police said Trimble's wife turned up at the West Des Moines police station, saying she had been the victim of domestic abuse.      Under the order, Trimble must stay away from his wife, Robin Lynn, until Jan. 24.      The incident is said to have occured two hour's into 1996 and about two hours before James Trimble was arrested by Des Moines police.      Trimble, 43, an 18-year veteran of the Urbandale department who has been active in the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program (D.A.R.E.), was arrested early Monday.  Police said they found a little over 7 ounces of methamphetamine -- $20,000 worth -- in the van he was driving.      He was charged with two counts of possession of narcotics with intent to deliver and with a tax stamp violation.      Authorities said he also had sexually explicit videotapes and pictures when Des Moines police pulled him over in the 600 block of Clark Street.  He has been suspended from his work with the department and the school.      A Des Moines woman with Trimble also was arrested: Lorrie Breiholz, 34, of 433 Philip St. was charged with possession of narcotics with the intent to deliver.  Police said Trimble apparently picked her up at Seventh Street and College Avenue earlier in the morning.      Police said they did not show a prior arrest record for Breiholz and did not say how she came to be in the car.      Police raided the Trimble home at 50l Second St., West Des Moines, hours after the arrests.  Robin Lynn, Trimble's wife, was charged with possession of narcotics after a "dime size" amount of marijuana was found, police said.  She was later released.      According to the report filed by Trimble's wife, he allegedly grabbed her by the arms during an argument and left a bruise the size of a quarter on her upper right arm.      Meanwhile, Urbandale Police Chief David Hamlin said officers were checking to see whether any confiscated drugs held for court cases were missing from evidence lockers.      Hamlin said that Trimble, who until Monday headed the five-officer drug prevention unit, has been entrusted in the past with the task of destroying illegal narcotics by burning them.      As with any pollee officer on the department, Trimble was hired only after an extensive background check, Hamlin said.      "Regardless of the procedures you set up, if an officer wants to be crooked there's a way to do it," Hamlin said.      At a news conferenee Tuesday, Des Moines police Sgt. William Judkins described the arrest as traumatic.      "I feel badly for the image of the police department," Judkins said.      No charges were filed in connection with the "large amount" of sexually oriented photographs and videos police said they found on Trimble.  Judkins, noting that Trimble has been a school liaison officer in Urbandale, made a point of saying none of the pictures or videos included anyone of school age.      Following an initial appearance Tuesday in Polk County District Court, Trimble was released from the Polk County Jail under the county's pretrial release program.  He is scheduled to appear in court on the two drug counts on Feb. 6.

Harvey Roderick T. Harvey Saline Co. Detention Ctr. Harrisburg, IL 62946  Jan. 21, '96  Dear Mr. Olsen,      Thank you again for your concern, guidance, and for always answering my letters so promptly.  I appreciate the fall News Letter (is there a new one?), and all the other pertinent literature you have sent me; it is very informative, interesting and enlightening.  I am heeding your advice and trying to focus my mind away from suicide by becoming actively involved in the reform movement.      After you posted my letter on the Internet last November, I received three letters right away and was very excited about it.  Unfortunately, that was the end of it, except for one very faithful correspondent from San Mateo, CA, a Dr. Tom J. O'Connell.  And, of course, one very negative letter from David R. McSporen of Columbia, MO, -- just to keep things balanced.  I shouldn't complain, but damn, after almost six months of diligently trying, I have not been able to establish any kind of social correspondence network whatsoever.  I am "starving" for some personal, semi-intellectual, like-minded correspondence, and this kind of "hunger strike" I do not wish to be on.  I believe a lot of my despondency is born of a profound loneliness.      Excuse me, Carl, I digressed.  The reason I am writing to you concerns my jury trial which is scheduled very soon, Feb. 5, a week from this Monday, in Benton, IL, near Southern Illinois Univ. in Carbondale.  I have a favor to ask, but time is so short I don't know whether it is even within the realm of possibility.      You are probably quite aware of the reputation of Public Defenders (Pretenders), so I'll refrain from belittling mine any further.  However, it is do disconcerting to know that my case is very defensible, but only if I could afford a good attorney who would excert some genuine effort, and then, no doubt, I could be acquitted.  My P.D. initially excited me with a lot of talk of intentions of things he would do to prepare a competent defense.  Unfortunately, he hasn't followed through at all.  During his most recent visit I was informing him of the falsehoods being presented by the DEA regarding the quantity, quality, and value of said 148 marijuana (their spelling) plants.  I, sadly, am not going to be able to testify because of those pending charges in Kentucky, but he said that if I could find a knowledgeable person to act as an expert witness, he has the capability to pay expenses for that person to come testify at my trial, including being flown in from out of state.      You are the first person I thought of with the connections, and I'm hoping you will put me in touch with someone.  (By the way, I have never had any response from the Fam. Council on D.A., do you suppose there could be a willing expert witness amongst their group?)      I'll give you a condensed version of the situation and the false claims to be refuted.  Facts:       148 plants, immature, the male (hemp) just beginning to flower.  50% or more will be male, discarded, no value.  The remaining at this point have very minute THC%, very low potency level, even mature leaves have virtually no street value.       I had been hospitalized for 7 weeks after a truck ran into me on my 10 speed bike.  I checked myself out and went to the woods on crutches, and was apprehended within hours, but was never observed around any plots of marijuana.  The prosecution is suggesting I was going to harvest then, sell it for millions, or hundreds of thousands of dollars, and leave the country.  Actually, there was 2 - 3 pounds of green leaf, worth maybe $50 to $100 on the street, but nobody really wants it.      The DEA is trying to make this look like a big, high-profile drug manufacturing operation, because they invested so much time in surveillance (6 weeks), so much manpower and equipment (23 field agents, 2 planes, cameras, radios, vehicles, overtime payrolls, etc.), and all they wound up with was one crippled camper and enough marijuana for the personal use of a small family, or a couple of average smoking adults.      In the indictment, I'm charged with 148 sinsemilla plants, -- that is really stretching the truth.  The feds now calculate 100 grams per plant, which makes this 33 lbs.  An experienced gardner, botonist, anyone knowledgeable (our expert witness) can show how preposterous that is to the jury.  After the males are culled, the 74 (half) remaining plants out in the forest are attacked by insects, animals and diseases, lack of water and insufficient sun, and bing inundated with a myriad of wild plants, vines and weeds leave only 30 - 40 harvestable plants.      The federal gov't. supplies for medicinal purposes 10 cigarettes a day, that's a quarter ounce (7 grams).  50 pot plants (100 g. per plant) supplies a half ounce a day, for one seasonal year; enough medical doses for two people.  Evidently this marijuana was being grown for personal use; not enough to sell, much less a big drug operation.      We'll ask the judge to allow the jury to find me guilty on lesser charges.  If he'll do this, I believe justice will prevail.      Carl, I apologize for running this out so long, I meant to be much more concise and clear.      And now it's about five o'clock in the morning and I'm trying to finish this before the mail goes out in about an hour.      My attorney suggested a reputable person without any felony convictions, of course.  Otherwise, I really don't know what kind of qualifications an expert witness should have, except whatever would impress the jury and not easily be discredited by the prosecution.  (Professor?)      I can be contacted via this message number (S.C.D.C. 618-252-8661 - jail) at the jail, altho' I would have to return the call collect.  My P.D.'s name and address:      Phillip J. Kavanaugh      750 Missouri Ave., Rm. 110      East St. Louis, IL 62202      Ph.# 618-482-9050      I would have asked you sooner if I'd have known.  I sure would appreciate any assistance you can give.  I do believe it will make a significant difference in the verdict and the sentencing range.  There is a possibility that my court date will be set back anywhere from one day to several weeks, that is a very common occurance around here.  So any recommendations or suggestions are welcome, and I also have more input disproving false gov't. claims.  Thank you.

The Des Moines Register, Wednesday, February 21, 1996, 9A Essay/Comment Iowa View/Karol Crosbie Who will protect children from legalizeddrugs? What are the chances that wecan keep legal cocaine from fifth-graders? The date is 2001. The place is a fifth-grade health-scienceclass. The use of heroin, marijuana and cocaine is now legal foradults. The teacher begins her lesson: "Today we will talk about what it feels like to be highon cocaine. If you sniff or smoke, or shoot, your whole bodychanges. Your heart beats faster. You feel hot - hotter thanyou've ever felt with your worst fever. "But most important is how you feel inside your head.Your mind seems to work better. You can give a speech better,argue better, tell a joke better. Your thoughts come faster; youcan remember more things; your memories are sharper. You don'tfeel discouraged like you usually do. You feel relaxed, and likeyou're floating above everything. You feel powerful - and youfeel like talking about your power. You can do anything. You aresure you are the best, the smartest, the fastest. "A lot of people can be high on cocaine without anyoneelse knowing. But sometimes the brain's chemistry is so mixed upthat it plunges you into a kind of nightmare - called a cocainepsychosis. You are terrified. You believe your friends are goingto hurt you. You hear voices. You feel things - roaches crawlingon your face. "A high will last about 30 minutes. When it is over youwill remember it. You can't forget it. It was wonderful. You wantit again. You are depressed until you have it again. It doesn'tmatter that the inside of your nose has open sores from sniffing.It doesn't matter that your best friend died from cocalne becauseher heart beat too fast and then just quit. You want theexperience again. "So you've got to say 'no' to this drug. Believe me.Just say 'no.'" What are the chances that our imaginary students will say no?At this point we can replace fiction with facts. The facts arethat kids are much more likely to say "yes" to legaldrugs and "no" to illegal drugs. Our current legal drug- alcohol - will cause the intoxication of close to 40 percent ofhigh-school seniors as often as every two weeks. Illegal drugsare used by 25 percent of seniors. Despite problems with prohibition, the fact is that whenalcohol was against the law, usage declined to a third or fourthof its former level. And it is no coincidence that incidence ofcirrhosis of the liver fell by half. Laws and sanctions do havean effect on human behavior. In the decade before Prohibitionwent into effect in 1920, alcohol consumption in the UnitedStates averaged 2.6 gallons per person per year. It fell to O.173gallons during the Prohibition decade, doubled to 1.5 gallons inthe decade after repeal and is back to 2.6 gallons. If cocaine were legal, how avallable and affordable would itbe to a fifth-grader? A gram of cocaine sells for about $80 to$100. Its cost of pruduction is less than $3. What's the leastthe government could charge, including tax? The cost would haveto be low enough to make bootlegging unprofitable. If not, wewouldn't have solved the crime problem, which is what brought usto legalization in the first place. Let's say the government setsthe price at $20 per gram. There are about 50 "hits" of cocaine in a gram, soat $20 per gram a school-child can get a hit for only 40 cents. What are the chances that we can keep legal cocaine fromfifth-graders? We need only look at our failure at keepingalcohol from children for an answer. According to Dr. David I. McDonald, who was the drug-abusepolicy advisor to former President Reagan, if legalization pushedthe number of drug addicts to only half the number of today'salcoholics, 100,000 people every year will die. Dr. RobertDuPont, former director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse,placed the estimate much higher. If one considers thedebilitating effects of cocaine, the carcinogenic effects ofmarijuana and the AIDS potential of injecting legalized heroin,the number of deaths could go as high as 500,000 a year. Is a society that requires seat belts, infant car seats andimmunizations for children actually considering legalizing a drugthat can kill our unborn, our children, our teens, our adults andour aged? I can think of no bigger gamble. KAROL CROSBIE iscommunications coordinator at Children and Families of Iowa inDes Moines.

Thank you to Karol Crosbie ("Who Will Protect Children from Legalized Drugs?" Feb. 21) for putting into words the thoughts I have every time I read an article or opinion piece proposing the legalization of marijuana, cocaine, heroine or other currently illegal drugs.     Crosbie is right - legalizing these drugs will reduce their cost and make them more available to young people.  Legalization of these drugs for adult use would in all likelihood increase their use among adults (there are people who refrain from illegal activities because they view themselves as law-abiding persons).     Increased public use of drugs by adults will make drug use an "adult" thing to do (I can see the TV sitcoms rushing to rewrite the story lines now) and being "grown up" is an enticement for many young people who use cigarettes and alcohol today.     Let's not take a chance on what legalization of drugs will do to our children and society.                                  -- Ann Burns,                     315 S. Niagara, Maquoketa.     Karol Crosbie's comparison of liquor consumption during Prohibition was more opinion than fact.  How did she arrive at 0.173 gallons during Prohibition?  Dandelion and other wines and beer were brewed in many homes that bought the same products in stores before Prohibition.  No person can have any reliable statistic on what was used.  No one who did not live at that time can have any idea of what it was like.  People drank canned heat, lemon extract, anything that contained alcohol.  Bootleggers flourished in every town, and they sure didn't refrain from selling to minors.                         -- John Verbrugge Jr.,                                     Swea City.      Karol Crosbie asks "who will protect children from illegal drugs?"  The answer is so simple, I am sure that you will wonder why you had not thought of it before: I will protect my children and you will protect your children.     It is not the government's responsibility to protect your children; it is your responsibility.  So teach your children well.  Teach them to think.  Teach them to learn, teach them to act responsibly and to accept the responsibility for their actions.  Teach them to respect the rights of all living things.     With a good education and solid ethical foundation, our children will protect themselves from harmful drugs, as well as from overly zealous legislators.                             -- Alan J. Palmer,               2801 N.W. Polk City Dr., Ankeny.     One of the problems in drug-policy discussions is that we lump all illegal drugs together as if they all posed the same potential for abuse.  Another problem is that we are only given two choices: (1) complete prohibition, or (2) complete legalization.      Since Karol Crosbie thinks (and I agree) that alcohol is such a problem for youth, perhaps we should take a look at some possible remedies.  Should we criminalize the possession of alcohol?  If not, then Crosbie's concerns about legalizing other substances seem hollow.     One possible solution would be to consider our laws regarding distribution of alcohol to minors.  The penalty for the first offense of providing alcohol to a minor is a $100 fine, a second offense is $250, a third is $500 and all subsequent offenses are a maximum $ 1,000.  Alcohol is possibly the most dangerous drug, and giving it to a minor won't even getyou any jail time.     This is in stark contrast to our treatment of illegal drugs.  Simple possession of marijuana can get you up to six months in a county jail and up to a $1,000 fine for the first offense.  Giving marijuana to a minor can get you locked up for up to 10 years and a fine of $10,000.     Maybe we need a new drug policy that includes all drugs and rates them according to their abuse potential.  Under such a system, all drugs might be legal for consenting adults.  However, it might be illegal to provide any drug to a minor with the penalties being consistent with the abuse potential of the drug in question.                              -- Carl E. Olsen,           recorder, Libertarian Party of Iowa,               1116 E. Seneca Ave., Des Moines.It doesn't mean you could buy 'coke' at Hy-Vee     Karol Crosbie ("Who Will Protect Children from Legalized Drugs?") totally misstates the issue.  The argument is not about legalizing drugs.  It is, "should they be decriminalized?"     Crosbie is the only person who, when discussing decriminalizing drugs, assumes that to do so will make them available at the neighborhood Hy-Vee, gas station or ATM.  I have yet to hear any responsible proponent of "decriminalizing" drugs suggest that they should be available to the general public.     By "decriminalizing" drugs, they are made available only to addicts who, if unable to obtain them from controlled state sources, instead would be stealing your stereo or mugging you to get the money to buy them.  That is exactly what is happening now.     There is a fear that by decriminalizing drugs, you might see an initial increase in use.  That is a possibility.  There probably are some people who might decide that when drugs are decriminalized it would be the perfect time to start mainlining heroin or snorting cocaine.     But, on second reflection, is this really likely?  What's to stop you, I or anyone from starting to use them right now?  Lack of availability?  The market system has made them too available.  And, there's even a helpful pusher to instruct you on how to get started and give you a generous discount until you're hooked.     The reason you don't use drugs is the same reason I don't.  And, It's not lack of availability.  We understand that drugs are very dangerous.  Spending your day in a drug-induced stupor isn't conducive to a good family life or career.     Education is certainly a very large part of the answer.  But to keep our children from using drugs basically means that we have to stop those who would push drugs at them from doing so.  Putting them in jail doesn't work.  There are too many replacements.  We accomplish this by taking the enormous profit out of selling drugs.  We put them out of business.     The police will be the first to tell you there is no way they can prevent illegal drugs from pouring into Des Moines or any other city given the enormous profits.  For every busted dealer there are many more willing to take his place.     So what's to do?  Decriminalization?  I'm not sure that's the complete answer.  There are some problems with that too.  But let's keep the debate to the point.  Decriminalizing doesn't mean that these drugs will be available at your local supermarket.     Those of you who are adamantly against even thinking about decriminalization must like the way things are today.  Rest assured that you're not the only ones who feel that way.  The pushers are with you on that issue.                     -- Robert J.

I wanted to let you know that you are not alone in your views, and as mcuh as I have read and studied ways to deal with the drug problem in America, and especially in Iowa, I have yet to come across a solution as workable as the one you suggest.     As you have probably already noticed, this letter is coming to you from a prison.  That's right, a prison.  I sincerely hope you are not put off by that, but I could certainly understand if you were.  Many people in this state are.  Society in general considers us scum, even though we are every bit as human as the next person.     I personally, was sent to prison on a drug-related charge stemming from a drug deal gone bad.  I have fought drug addiction most of my adult life, and more often than not, I have lost.  I am now 26, and trying to win this war.     I wanted to write to tell you that you, and people like you, through letters such as the one the Register printed (a fine liberal paper), not only serve to inform and enlighten the general public, but also the few drug-addicted offenders that take the time to read it, or, even worse, are able to understand it.     Through your efforts you serve a greater purpose that you may not even be aware of.  I applaud you for the time you took in drafting your letter, and in your attempt to sling the noose, if you will, of a problem that may not be solvable.     But looking back on my own shattered life, the pain I've caused, the damage I've done, I see in you a hope not only for myself, but for other young people who may destroy themselves such as I have.     William Faulkner once said that "it is any man's right to destroy himself, so long as he does it to and of himself."  I wonder ....     Anyhow, Mr. Olsen, I just wanted to thank you.  Since I couldn't do it in person, a letter was my best shot.  Thank you for the time you took in reading my letter, and I wish you the best of luck in the future.  Peace.     Sincerely,     Johnnie Clements     #807275     Iowa Medical & Classification Center     Box A     Oakdale, IA 52319WT01-B19-57IA087-000632-B012-169http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/WAR/johnnie2.html 206.61.184.43 19970122090127 text/html 7657HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 09:01:18 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:41:44 GMTContent-length: 7442 Johnnie Clements (March 15, 1996) 3-15-96Dear Mr. Olsen,     Good day, sir.  Thank-you for your letter.  I especially appreciate the information that you sent along.  I am finding a lot of my own thoughts in other people's words.  Simply amazing!  I had really no idea that the issue of marijuana legalization had such a diverse following.     I will tell you something of my case.  In Dec. of 1989, my brother, Dennis, was involved in the distribution of pot to another man, Bruce Kennedy, a resident and business owner of Des Moines.  They had been doing business for a number of years with no problems.  Towards the end of the year 1989, my brother and Kennedy had a falling out.  At the time he owed my brother $3,500.00 for pot that had already been delivered.  He refused to pay.  On the night of Dec. 7th, 1989, I walked into the business that Kennedy owns and demanded that he hand over the cash.  I was unarmed, but I was forcefull that he comply.  He did, and handed me $3,500.00 in $100.00 bills.  As I was leaving the scene, I heard sirens approaching, but I didn't connect them with my collection of owed money.  To make a long story short, Mr. Kennedy had called the police and told them that I had robbed them.  I couldn't believe it!  After the arrest, after the months in jail, after the appointment of a largely inept lawyer, a public defender, I was brought to trial.  The state refused to reduce the charge or offer me a plea bargain because I refused to implicate my "brother" in this "scheme," as they called it.  At trial Kennedy and another person whom I've never met, named Chris, testified that I walked in, forced them both to the ground, and robbed Kennedy at gun point, to give me all of the money they had.  They both claim I took $6,000.00 in cash from them.  They both state I wore a mask, but no gloves.  They both claim they had known me for several years.     At trial, the state produced no weapon, no fingerprints, no money, no shoe prints, nothing except the word of these two people.  And Chris, well, he wasn't even there that night.     Lie number 1) $6,000.00 dollars was taken.  Lie number 2) Chris was there.  Lie number 3) I had a gun.  Lie number 4) I wore a mask.  There are others, but really too many to write.  I found out at trial that the DMPD ident. team never even dusted for fingerprints!     So, it was only 24 hours from voire dire to verdict.  24 hours!  I would not implicate my brother, I really had no defense at all, and I was naive.  I was 19 yrs old and didn't know a thing about what was going on.  I was convicted of first-degree armed robbery.  Now a lot of people won't believe what I say simply because I am a convicted felon, but I know that there was a conspiracy between the D.A., Jamie Bowers, and these two witnesses, because another D.A. named Ramey (not sure of the spelling of his name) took me in his office, laughed at me, told me he was going to convict me anyways, because he talked to Kennedy and Chris and told them what to say.  He told me this to my face, but of course I have no proof that he did so.     Anyhow, I was sentenced to 25 yrs, and I did 5 yrs 8 mos, before I was placed on work-release.  Once there I encountered a number of problems.  I went to the work-release at 2020 Center, in Des Moines, and after just 45 days I was so stressed out and depressed from trying to get myself back into society that I started to get high.  My UA's were coming back dirty, so I went to work one night and didn't come back.  My work-release was revoked, and I was sent back to prison, where I am now.     A whole lot of things contributed to my coming back to prison.  For one, for 5 yrs & 8 mos in prison, my family has given up on me.  They refused to stick by me, and now we are estranged.     The people I encountered when I got out were all suspicious of me and untrusting.  It seemed everyone I met looked down on me.  It was really a drag.  I couldn't believe the way they treated me, like I was dirt.  The guy I got a job from ($5.50 hr) thought I was a slave and always called me names.  Scum, convict, etc. ...  I put up with it for awhile, but soon it just became too much.     On Dec. 8th, 1995, I picked up my last check from work, an ounce of bud, a 12 pack of beer, and got a motel room.  For 5 days I sat in that room, alone, but high.  I had no answer to my problems, and I was seriously considering suicide.  I probably would have gone through but the police arrested me.  What a way my life has went.  All because I collected some money for a pot deal.     But I push on, along, and yes, afraid.  Afraid at how I will make it when I get out the next time.  My counselor thinks it will be between 5 & 16 months.     My counselor, and I'm sure, the Parole Board, think that I am just another failure.  But I wonder if they realize just how difficult it was for me to leave prison.  I was this 19 yr old kid when I got locked up, they had me for almost 6 yrs, and then one day they come and tell me to get out, go back to society and make it for yourself.  It was rough having no family there to support me, but I still thought that I could manage.  But in the end, it was that lone man calling me a scum, without knowing who I really was or what I am really about, that finally pushed me to far.  I just felt like I didn't belong.     And all of this started because I collected money on a debt.  Kennedy lied about the amount of money so he could collect from the insurance more than twice (actually he shouldn't have been able to claim any) what he gave to me.  I suppose he made the best out of a bad situation, huh?     Anyhow, I just carry on now, a little wiser, but still angry at the system that has tried to destroy my youth.  I could be bitter I suppose, but I am better than that.  I see now that if I destroy myself.  I have not let the years turn me into a hardened, callous person.  In fact, I am quite compassionate, happy, full of life, and I will continue to be a force despite others who will try to bring me down.  I will succeed in my life, one way or another.     Mr. Olsen, once again I appreciate your letter.  I hope you will continue to write me, I can use all the friends I can get.  You may count me as one of your supporters, and if there is anything I can do for you, either now or in the future, please let me know.     As to your desire to print my letters, you may do so by all means.  You may also, you are more than welcome to I should say, use my name and address.  I would welcome anyone who wishes to write me.     I know that this has turned into a bit of a novel, so I will leave you now.  I hope to hear from you again soon, and I look forward to going over all of the material you sent me.  Take care.  Peace.     Sincerely Yours,     Johnnie Clements     #807275P.S.

The enclosed condenses the story & I am now poised to sue the feds in aunique approach of emergency petition for arbitrary, capricious &deliberately indifferent denial of medicine (i.e., marijuana) resulting incruel & unusual punishment (the avoidable infliction of blindness founded inthe fraudulent & deceitful practice of government bureaucracy).

Do you know of any/if legal talent is available through Illinois NORML? Also experiencing health difficulties with muscular sclerosis &sciaticata. My fear: these fuckers are killing me. No real health problems'til I got here. Is this the method they're using to carry out the U.S.Dept. of Justice policy of incapacitation & debilitation? of repeat potoffenders?

Harvey (April 2, 1996) Roderick T. HarveySaline County JailHarrisburg, IL 62946March 22, 1996Dear Carl,     It's been awhile since I wrote to you; in fact, it was in January.  At that time you made some copies of several of my writings (which didn't come out too good on your scanner and laser printer, but I thank you very much nonetheless), and you also contacted my P.D. attorney, recommending Ed Rosenthal for an expert witness.  I was so impressed with your concern and efforts on my behalf, and very enthusiastic about the prospect of Mr. Rosenthal being a part of my defense.  Unfortunately, the P.D. was not so eager to have an outspoken proponent of marijuana on the witness stand, and quite possibly he was right.  I say that now, after observing to tactics of the prosecutor - Christopher More.     Before I tell you about the latter, let me bring you up to date on other happenings.  A week after your very much appreciated undertaking to provide me with an expert witness, on February 6, the day before my jury selection and trial was to begin, I was very unexpectedly released from jail.  After I hurriedly got myself well away from the vicinity, I called the appointed lawyer to see what the heck was going on; after six months and six days being held prisoner with no bond, to be inexplicably set completely free with no stipulation whatsoever.  (?)  Wow!?     I was informed that it was just a mistake on the indictment, having to do with the dates of my alleged manufacturing of marijuana, a technicality that would be (probably/maybe) revamped and I could (would) then be re-indicted.  I was.  I turned myself in the 13th of February (a very foolish, stupid thing to do under the circumstances, in view of the fact that I'm a conscientious objector being warred against by an unscrupulous enemy who does take prisoners and holds them indefinitely), and even though I demonstrated good faith, they vehemently refused to give me any bond whatsoever (again).  What kind of a country (government) is this?  What about Article VIII of the Bill of Rights?  I didn't do anything to anybody, I'm just accused of "growing" a harmless, natural, God-given plant, way back in the woods.     Well, no longer just accused, - Wednesday (two days ago), March 20, 1996, I was found guilty by a jury (not of my peers), and scheduled to be sentenced June 20, 1996.  It took the jury five hours to decide.  It was very evident that if I had a competent lawyer I would have been acquitted.  I've already started preparing my own appeal, on various grounds, including inadequate representation.  By the way, the expert witness turned out to be a professor from So. Ill. U., but the prosecutor got him barred, after he had stated his education, employment and qualifications, because of Rule 16, the P.D. had neglected to inform the prosecution of this expert witness.  Incompetence?  (now I go to prison)     The P.D. told me the trial transcripts would cost me about $500, so I'll be unable to acquire them until after I'm sentenced, at which time, apparently, he can get me a copy.  Oh!, how I wish I had them now, to study, and to show some attorneys for legal advice.  the public pretender did such an obviously poor job of defending me.  OK, enough said.later -     Oh, one other thing you've probably heard before, the prosecutor made a big deal out of the fact that they found in some of my notes the acronym N.O.R.M.L., and the phone number with the last four digits W.E.E.D. (John Hartman).  All they had was circumstantial evidence against me, and so they were grasping at straws to connect me with marijuana and make me look guilty.March 31, -     Thank you again, Carl, for everything you've done for me.April 2, -     It's been two weeks now since I've been convicted, and I think I've finally got my head screwed back on about halfway right, I hope! (phew).  Sorry about not getting this letter finished and sent off to you, but I'm sure you understand.     Altho' these preceding pages may seem to indicate the contrary, I'm really coming along fine Carl.  My emotional well-being and mental outlook has improved immensely since that first letter you intercepted last year.  I can't thank you enough.  Admittedly, I've been in a slump, or a touch of writer's block here for a bit, but I'm out of it now and got the ol' pen scribblin' like mad.  I have to, I've got a pile of at least ten letters here I have to get answered.     Yes, I've very involved in the Reform Movement and the literature has been pouring in.  I'm getting quite a reputation here at the jail, I'm proud to say; albeit, I'm more that a little suspicious that my mail is being tampered with (more than what is legally permissible).  Can you suggest what recourse, or action I should take?  If any.     I received a fantastic letter from Paul Westmoreland last week, which really helped me to feel like a part of the solution, the movement.  I want to follow in his shoes (as it were), with him going as I'm coming.  How I wish I could accomplish as much as he has.  With his guidance and support, and others', I will.     I never would have thought it before, but now I really believe that I can help make a difference.  Even from behind bars, I'm going to make a difference.  I am astounded at how many great people and organizations there are working to restore our constitutional rights and freedom; i.e., the Drug Policy Foundation, F.A.M.M., M.P.P., Grassroots Party of Minnesota, Green Panthers!, VOCALs, TEACH, to name a few.  I'm excited to be part of it.  Unfortunately, I had to have my life virtually devastated before I woke up, stood up and got active.  I've been running away from the big war machine since the early '70s.  Well, I'm making my stand right here, right now; I'm ready to fight.  But I'll fight fair and honest.     Nobody could believe I turned myself in to the feds.  Not my friends, fellow prisoners, marshals, correction officers, the prosecution or task force agents; but I'm tired of running from the oppressors.  I think I can do more, in a constructive, positive way, from within prison than I would out there on the run as a fugitive.  We'll see.  (Paul's got me reading damn law books every day.)  Wry smile.     Thanks again Mr. Olsen.  I'll be in touch.     I see a little light,     RoderickP.S. If there's anything I can do for you, NORML, POWs & friends, please don't hesitate to ask; I'm anxious to do whatever I can.

Wastreated with laser surgery March 29th & am subject to further surgery offreezing the gland that produces fluid to the eye. I have declined the 2ndsurgery & requested treatment by marijuana. I expect the usual obdurategovernment/bureaucratic behavior & some form of reprisal for refusing thefreezing surgery. Perhaps this will generate a cognizable lawsuit for medicinalmarijuana, its scheduling & the deliberate indifference of the governmentbureaucrats towards medical therapeutic use of marijuana & the fact it hasto be far more cost effective than permanently damaging surgery & continuinguse of expensive eye drops (I am currently taking & only partiallyeffective) & are toxic to boot! Tom Brown (Arkansas, religious use) is encouraging this approach. What the marijuana movement really needs is a viable class action & thelegal horsepower to see it through. Ah, & honest government!! Meanwhile we'll see what develops in all the marijuana cases. From a national perspective, the war against marijuana seems to belosing steam as more & more states are eyeing its potential revenue/taxenhansing base & its many uses in industrial/commercial scale.

Judge Leo Oxberger sentenced Trimble to two years' probation, a $1,000 fine and 100 hours of community service.     "I'm convinced this is a one-time incident for you," the judge said.  The sentence angered prosecutors, who along with presentence investigators recommended up to 10 years in prison for the crime.     Trimble, 44, is required to spend his community-service time giving anti-drug speeches to students.  He conducted such talks as a police officer in Urbandale schools.Judge's Explanation     "I do not want you to think that I do not consider this a serious crime," Oxberger told Trimble.  "If this were a crime you committed in the course of your conduct as a police officer, I would view it differently.     "I do not believe that any official should be above the law.  On the other hand, I don't think that any officer or high-standing official should automatically be sentenced to prison....  You have rearranged your life and seem well on the way to rehabilitating yourself."     Jamie Bowers, an assistant Polk County attorney, pointed out that Trimble admitted taking drugs from an evidence locker at the Urbandale Police Department.     About 4 a.m. on New Year's Day, Trimble was arrested driving his mother's van in an inner-city Des Moines neighborhood.  Police say they found about 7 ounces - $20,000 worth - of methamphetamine, in addition to marijuana, LSD and cocaine.Videotapes and Pictures     Authorities said numerous sexually explicit videotapes and pictures were found in the van, including photos of Trimble.  He had a battery-operated sexual device inserted in his body when arrested, police said.     Riding in the van with Trimble was Lorrie Breiholz, 34, who was sentenced to probation and a deferred judgment in April for misdemeanor marijuana possession.     The 18-year veteran headed Urbandale's Drug Abuse Resistance Education program and acted as liaison officer between police and the suburb's schools.  He was fired shortly after his arrest.     The case raised questions whether Trimble should be treated like other first-time drug offenders -- almost all of whom receive probation – or as a law officer who shamed his profession.     Bowers and state investigators argued the latter.     "We recommended that he go to prison based upon the impact he had on the community and on the credibility of law enforcement," Bowers said.  "What the judge did depreciates the serious nature of the crime. ...  When you're a police officer, you're a police officer all the time, not just eight hours a day."     Trimble, sweat glistening on his face, said nothing during or after the sentencing in Polk County District Court.     "Jim Trimble lost his wife, his job, the respect of the community.  He is a pariah," said Trimble's attorney, Mark Pennington.  "I think he's been punished enough."     Trimble's wife, who accused him of threatening to kill her and commit suicide shortly before his arrest, has filed for divorce.  He is unemployed and lives in Urbandale with his mother.     He was charged with five drug crimes, but prosecutors agreed to let him plead guilty April 8 to one: possession with intent to deliver methamphetamine.     The crime is a Class C felony, a category that includes offenses such as vehicular homicide, involuntary manslaughter and third-degree sexual abuse.  It is part of the stiffest category of state drug crimes.     The sentence was not part of the plea bargain.No Criminal History     Pennington said it is important to note that Trimble had no prior criminal history and there was no evidence he bought or sold drugs.     Criminal history is key to determining sentencing: After Trimble was sentenced, Bowers said, three other people were sent to prison on the same charge -- but they all had prior records.     Pennington said Trimble's story will be valuable to schoolchildren.     "He has, in his own unique way, taught the kids the ultimate lesson: That drugs bring nothing but disaster," he said.  "He's a living example of the destructive power of drugs. "     But David Hamlin, the Urbandale police chief, said Trimble may have difficulty meeting his community-service requirement.     "I do have some question about how many schools are really going to be open to him talking to kids," Hamlin said.Mixed Feelings     Hamlin said he has mixed feelings about the sentence, considering the black eye Trimble gave the small department.     "He spent 18 years doing a lot of good work, but he created a lot of havoc in recent months," he said.  "I'm thankful the judicial aspect is over, although I'm sure we'll be answering for it for some time."     Authorities considered charging Trimble with theft but decided it would have been "overkill," given the five drug charges against him at the time, Hamlin said.     District Judge Ray Fenton accepted Trimble's guilty plea and would normally handle the sentencing as well.  But Fenton recused himself because he said he had known Trimble for many years.     Oxberger -- who fills in on the Polk County bench -- retired in 1994 as chief judge of the Iowa Court of Appeals.James Trimble stands for his sentencing Thursday.

Is our judicial system committed to expanding drug usage by sentencing James Trimble to probation despite his visible position in the drug discouragement (supposedly) process?  What a terrible example this sets for our young people.                                           - Murl 0. Black,                                 1199 Fifth St., Lohrville.     I've heard of diplomatic immunity, but I've never heard of police immunity.  You mean to tell me that what James Trimble did to the children of Urbandale by "not doing what he said" is not punishable by more than a $l,000 fine and 100 hours of community service?  Where will be do his community service - in the Urbandale schools?     This man could have been made an example of for the children he deceived.  Now he is an example of what it means "to get away with it."                                         - Lorraine Powell,                                   211 Seventh St., Nevada.     The next time any of us wonders why there is steady moral decay in our country, all we have to do is look back at Judge Leo Oxberger's decision in the case of ex-Urbandale Police Officer James Trimble.  This decision was a mockery of our system of justice.     Not only did Trimble break numerous laws, he broke the public trust.  He worked with kids in an anti-drug campaign.  Now he has to do 100 hours of community service, again telling kids the "evils" of drug use.     Judge Oxberger's decision further erodes the public trust.                                              - Ron Nesbit,                                  1816 79th St., Des Moines.     The sentencing of James Trimble was such a travesty of justice.     Judge Leo Oxberger said because Trimble was not on duty, he would sentence him as an average citizen.  Now, many "average" citizens are in prison for using illegal drugs, let alone being a police officer who stole drugs from the police department with the intent to use and sell (i.e. deal).     The sentence Trimble received was just this side of nothing.  The "average" law-abiding citizen works more than 100 hours in a two-week period making an honest living.  And, in this day and age, what is $1,000?     What complete hypocrisy serving 100 hours of community service by going into schools and telling students that drugs are wrong.  Wasn't that Trimble's job at the time of his arrest?  No thank you; I don't want this man in the same town as my children, let alone going back into the schools to tell them using drugs is "wrong."                                       - Cleoda M. Mikesch,                               2419 Tomlin Ln., Des Moines.     I was sickened and appalled over the sentencing of former Urbandale Police Officer James Trimble.     How can such a sentencing be justified?  Would he have received such a sentence had he been a poor white or minority represented by a public defender?  What message does this sentencing send to the public about the importance of public trust, the abuse of drugs and hypocrisy?     It is true, as stated by Judge Leo 0xberger, that the defendant has lost much.  But can you imagine the impact his crime had on the young people in Urbandale, the police department and the public's faith in the system as a whole?     The judge's reasoning is warped and amazing.  If the president of a bank stole $5 million from the bank because of his position and the trust of the bank customers, should he receive the same sentencing as a person who attempts to pass a check at the bank?  I think not.     It amazes me that members of the judiciary and other political persons want the citizens to believe that the system works the same for all people who are involved in it.  This is obviously not the case.     Frankly, I am getting sick and tired of it all!  We need more responsible judges.                                           - Lynne Harrell,                                      4206 S.E.

In federal courts, theUrbandale man could havereceived a long prison term.By Dan EggenRegister Staff Writer     Fired Urbandale police officer James Trimble was arrested with $20,000 in stolen methamphetamine � yet he got no jail or prison time at all.     He's lucky he didn't get hauled into federal court.     In Iowa's state courts, Trimble's sentence was common for his crime.  But in federal courts, Trimble could have received from five to 15 years imprisonment, with no parole whatsoever.     Authorities say that federal drug defendants - even first-timers - commonly get a decade or more of hard prison time, a marked difference from their state-prosecuted counterparts.     "I'd like to know how that's jusice?" cries Edith Davis of Des Moines, whose son-in-law is serving 11 years in a Minnesota federal prison for two methamphetamine charges.  "I'd like those judges to explain how that's justice to my grandchildren, who won't know their daddy until they're grown up. ...  If he wasn't a cop, that Trimble would've gotten a lot worse."     The 16-year police veteran was arrested early New Year's Day with about 7 ounces - or 196 grams - of methamphetamine, small amounts of other drugs, and sexually explicit materials, Des Moines police said.  Trimble admitted taking the drugs from the evidence room at the Urbandale Police Department where he worked as an anti-drug officer in the suburb's schools.     He was never charged with theft, but he pleaded guilty to possession with intent to deliver methamaphetamine, a felony.  Assistant Polk County Attorney Jamie Bowers asked for a 10-year prison sentence, arguing that Trimble abused his public trust as a police officer.     But Judge Leo Oxberger disagreed, giving Trimhle probation and ordering him to spend 100 hours of community service talking to students about his case.  "I'm convinced this is a one-time incident for you," the judge said.     "If that were one of my 19-year-old clients," said Paul Zoss, Iowa's federal public defender, "they'd be throwing the book at him over here."Overrun     Federal courts are overrun with drug cases as the government pursues its "War on Drugs."  In the Suthern District of Iowa, for example, federal drug indictments leaped 45 percent from 1994 to 1995.     The prison population has soared as a result.  Prisoners convicted of drug crimes have ballooned from 25 percent of the federal population in 1983 to about two-thirds now.     Key to the increase is a complicated system of mandatory sentences based on the offense the defendant's criminal history and the amount of drugs involved.  Not only are the sentences rigid, they are tough.     Zoss said that only the most menial drug possession cases - the kind rarely seen in federal court - call for probation, meaning that almost everyone goes to prison if convicted.Distorted?     The result, many complain, is distorted justice.  For example, while some teen-ager might be sent to federal prison for five years for a drug crime, a child molester convicted in state court may not serve any time at all.     "You can get swept into all of this and have very little to do with the kind of menacing activity you'd associate with such harsh punishment," argues Bob Rigg, a former public defender and associate law professor at Drake University.     "The federal system is like a big, sleeping dragon.  If you wake it up and it pays attention to you, it'll eat you."     There are no clear rules about what drug cases are handled by the federal system, but they generally involve large-scale and often violent drug dealers and their organizations.     Most complaints concern the treatment given to others - people with minor roles in the drug trade.More Than Enough     "How cases get here depends a little bit on who initiates the case and who refers it to us," said Al Overbaugh, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Des Moines.  "We have enough that we don't go looking for cases. ...  We have more than we can handle as it is."     Overbaugh pointed out that in its 1994 crime bill, Congress provided an escape hatch for minor drug criminals with no past record.  In those cases, judges may depart from mandatory minimum sentences, he said.     Davis argues that her son-in-law, Jerry Woolery Jr., was punished too severely for his crime.     Woolery, 25, had a criminal past and admitted to handling more than 100 grams of methamphetamine, Overbaugh said.      "I'm not saying this kid lived a charmed life or anything," Davis said of Woolery, who has three sons ages 13, 10 and 7.  "But this is just too much.     "Preferential treatment doesn't just hurt people like him," she said.  "It hurts society.  It tells us there's a certain type of people, like Trimble, who are above everyone else."WT01-B19-64IA087-000632-B012-371http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/WAR/trimble6.html 206.61.184.43 19970122090308 text/html 4741HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 09:03:00 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:42:21 GMTContent-length: 4526 Trimble sentence may seem unfair The Des Moines RegisterSaturday, June 1, 1996, Page 8A.letters@dmreg.comThe Register�s EditorialsAn unreasonable systemTrimble sentence may seem unfair,but rigid rules would be worse.     There are two systems of criminal justice in the United States: one at the federal level; one at the state.  The differences are striking.  You need only look at the case of James Trimble - the former Urbandale police officer and anti-drug counselor convicted of possessing illegal drugs - to see how different.     Trimble was arrested by Des Moines police five months ago carrying more than 190 grams of methamphetamine.  He pleaded guilty to possession with intent to sell, and prosecutors recommended a 10-year prison sentence.  Instead, Judge Leo Oxberger sentenced Trimble to two years' probation, a $1,000 fine and 100 hours of community service.     Critics outraged by Trimble's sentence would have been pleased, however, had he been convicted in federal court, where a similar offense would likely have resulted in a sentence of as many as 15 years in prison.  And that is the equivalent of a 30-year sentence in Iowa.  Whereas prisoners typically serve less than half their sentences in Iowa state prisons, there is no possibility of parole in the federal system.     Something obviously is out of kilter.  The question is whether it is the federal system, or the state.  In general, the Iowa system makes more sense, although specific cases - like Trimble's - may seem unfair.  Indeed, an example could have been made of Trimble.  He is not just another first-time offender; he was sworn to uphold the law and entrusted with the education of Urbandale schoolchildren.  Surely that makes him worthy of an exceptional punishment, if for no other reason than to send a message to the very people he was paid to counsel on the evils of drugs.     In a sense, though, James Trimble is a fitting example of that message: He has lost everything because of drugs.  Prison will not "reform" him.  He is not likely to repeat his offense.  His cell would be better occupied by a potential murderer.     These are the sorts of difficult issues judges must weigh.  The job cannot be reduced to a mathematical formula, although that is what the federal system attempts to do.  About 10 years ago, Congress created the U.S. Sentencing Commission to establish a set of "guidelines" for criminal penalties.  In drug cases, the guidelines take into account the amount of drugs seized, prior criminal records, violence involved, use of a gun, etc., to arrive at a sentence that must be served in full.  Federal judges are, with a few exceptions, unable to depart from the sentencing guidelines.     As a result, in the federal system drug offenders serve very long sentences.  It is not unusual to hear of cases of young men convicted of merely carrying drugs who will be near retirement age before their release from prison.  This policy, the result of macho anti-crime rhetoric in Congress, has had tragic consequences for individuals, and for the nation.     In a recent opinion, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Myron Bright of North Dakota cited a Federal Judicial Center study showing that by next year the federal prison population is expected to reach 110,000, two and a half times that of just a decade earlier, at an annual cost of well over $2 billion.  And 70 percent of this phenomenal growth has been due to federal drug cases.  "The public needs to know that unnecessary, harsh and unreasonable drug sentences serve to waste billions of dollars without doing much good for society," Bright wrote.  "We have an unreasonable system."     Bright is right; the federal sentencing guidelines are unreasonable.  It's possible to disagree with a judge's decision in an individual case - as some have with Judge Oxberger's sentence in the Trimble case - but on the whole the state system works.  As critical as Iowa's prison-crowding problem is, it would be magnified exponentially if Iowa judges were forced to send every drug dealer to prison for a decade or more and there were no chance for parole.WT01-B19-65IA087-000632-B012-391http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/WAR/trimble7.html 206.61.184.43 19970122090315 text/html 1881HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 09:03:10 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:42:18 GMTContent-length: 1666 State legislator wants change regarding judges The Des Moines RegisterSaturday, June 1, 1996, Page 3M.letters@dmreg.comState legislator wantschange regarding judges     Clive, Ia. - A state senator, upset with the sentencing of former Urbandale police officer James Trimble, suggested Friday that senior judges should not be allowed to decide such cases.     Sen. 0. Gene Maddox, R-Clive, complained in a newsletter that senior judges - who are retired but fill in on the bench when needed - are not answerable to the public.     "I believe we should change the law to add more accountability for senior judges and/or to limit their jurisdiction to non-criminal offenses," he wrote.  Maddox, a former mayor of Clive, sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee and is up for relection in the fa11.     Unlike their full-time colleagues, senior judges are not subjected to periodic voter approval.     The senior judge in the Trimble case, former Iowa Appeals Court judge Leo Oxberger, could not be reached for comment Friday.     Oxberger sentenced Trimble to probation and 100 hours of oommunity service after Trimble had been arrested with $20,000 worth of methamphetamine, which he admitted stealing from a police evidence locker.  Prosecutors had argued that Trimble should go to prison because he violated the public trust as an anti-drug officer in Urbandale schools.WT01-B19-66IA087-000632-B012-412http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/WAR/brown-02.html 206.61.184.43 19970122090323 text/html 14902HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 09:03:17 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:41:08 GMTContent-length: 14686 Brown, Tom - June 18, 1996 June 18, 1996                                     Rev.

On April 29, 1996 the Supreme Court of the United States refused to certify my petition for review of my conviction.  That means that as far as the court system in the United States, there is nothing wrong with my conviction and that no change will be made in the near future.  As you can imagine, when I learned this on May 3, 1996, I felt like I had been kicked in the stomach.  As much as I had tried to prepare myself for this eventuality, the reality of it almost beat me into the ground.  The fact that I had taken the position that the court system could be trusted to follow the Constitution and the Law, that the corruption of Judge Waters and his involvement with Don Tyson in smuggling cocaine into this country to finance Tyson Corporate expansion, Waters� corruption in covering up the CIA drug smuggling and assassination programs at the Mena, Arkansas airport would be uncovered and dealt with, and that the system just needed an honest opportunity to work on this, put me in the position to be deeply hurt and disappointed by the courts refusal to even review the case.     Now to the good news.  One of the best things about my experience here has been that the Truth of the holy teachings of a dozen cultures is real and available to those who seek it.  This Truth is that God is real, that we can reach out in our lives and bear incredible pain and sorrow - not through our own strength, but through the intercession of something beyond us, something that leads us to a higher understanding of life, a better way of knowing it.  Unfortunately, one must climb the mountain in order to see from the heights, and that climb is often uncomfortable and inconvenient.  But the view from the heights is not just of a pretty sunset.  From the heights I have seen vision and realized a plan of which we are a small but vital part.  Let me explain.     Each of you receiving this letter knows of the persecution of those of us who use herbs and plants to better know and understand God.  Each of you knows something of how those herbs and plants are also food for our body and medicine for our illness.  Each of you knows how much pain and suffering have been caused by the government�s refusal to obey the laws of God and man, and why and how they profit from their corruption.  Now I see more clearly than before how my life fits into war, and how to take the next steps in this particular battle.  Enclosed with this letter is a copy of a photo-item from the New York Times.  It is of a Catholic nun who was beaten, tortured and raped by Guatemalan military personal acting under advise of U.S. CIA operatives.  She is picketing the White House, trying to get the government to admit to and stop this despotic activity on the part of the CIA and military intelligence operatives.  Of course we know of Mena, Arkansas and how the drugs smuggled into Mena went to pay for these same murders and tortures.  Our Church is deeply involved in pulling down these rogue operations.  My place here is simply not comparable to this nun�s service to the poor of central america, and the torture it cost her.  We are however waging the same war, and with God's help we will prevail.  Every time I think of her, of Archbishop Romero murdered in his Church, the Jesuit Priests of the University in El Salvador murdered along with their housekeeper in their front yard, I realize how small a price I have to pay to place myself on the path of Truth along with them.  Please offer a special ceremony and prayers, each in your own tradition, in the memory of these martyrs and in hopes that our fight against this EVIL may change the balance enough to end it.     It is true that I have been beaten up pretty badly so far.  The corruption of the Federal Judge Waters in Fayetteville, Arkansas, has poisoned the possibility of defense to these charges, and his corruption is covered by Reagan/Bush appointees to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, and now by the Supreme Court itself.  All is not lost however.  I am now preparing a motion to the court to overturn my conviction due to a lack of Federal jurisdiction under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.  Congress has the power to regulate commerce between the states and between this nation and other countries.  Commerce within a state is under state control, and non-commercial activities are exempt entirely from Federal Controls.  I have been convicted of growing plants in violation of federal law.  I have not been accused of engaging in any commerce whatsoever, and Hemp is not an item of interstate or intrastate commerce at this time at all.  Therefore the Federal government lacks jurisdiction to enforce a prohibition law forbidding my growing of a plant.  In addition, The very first line of the Declaration of Independence invokes Natural Law, the law given to us by God as a part of our creation.  "When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them to another, and to assume, among the powers of the Earth, the separate and equal station to Which the laws of Nature and Nature's God entitle them. . ."  So here in the first official document of our nation, the document which explains why our forefathers had to murder the legal representatives of their King, in order to end his despotic reign over them, this document begins by invoking and declaring the Natural Law of God.  This is the same Natural Law that Judge Waters would not allow me to present to the jury.  This Natural Law is not written down, it is the law which God made the Universe to operate under.  For instance if you take a green plant into a dark room, it will die, because it needs the Sun in order to live.  This is not a law passed by a congress and written down, it applies everywhere in the Universe, and all God's creation is subject to it.  Sometimes a man has understood this law, and has written it down to teach others.  One place we find this is in the Bible in Genesis - the teachings of the beginning.  In Genesis, Chapter 1, Verse 29, God address Adam, the first man, and says, "Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of the Earth. . . and it shall be for your meat."  Today, of course, the Federal Government says it has the right to prohibit us from growing and using the plants God has given to us.  This was foretold in the first letter to Timothy written by St. Paul, Chapter 4, Verse 1, where Paul reports the only direct spirit teaching of all the epistles, saying, "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, and giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the TRUTH."  We of Our Church know of the TRUTH of the food, medicine, the spiritual MEAT that Hemp Flowers are, that the peyote cactus is, and we know of the documents that show that the government knows this TRUTH also.  And we know how the government, in the form of Judge Waters and Prosecutor Bill Cromwell, have conspired in secret meetings to stop us from showing a jury these same government documents.  But while they exercise POWER, it is not their right, just their opportunity.  They only have the right to exercise power within the confines of the Constitution and Federal Law.  They have the opportunity because they are presently government employees whose orders other agents are willing to follow and not question.  And we have stood up to them, we who have no power but the right of God and the recognition of the TRUTH we have forced them to flagrantly violate their own laws in order to defeat us.  This places us in a very strong position.  If we continue to persevere in this TRUTH, with our words and our lives, we will take the high ground, and our rule will be in Truth and not in their Lies.     I am asking each of you to do a few things for me in the next month or so.  Write to your local paper and point out how our own government was founded on natural law, the Law of God, how this present government is violating that law of God by prohibiting any of us from growing the plants God has given to us all as our birth right.  Point out that whenever a government has gone against the laws of God, it has fallen.  There are some questions that may be arguable, but possession of the plants God created when He created us and gave them to us with a contract written down in the Bible, is not arguable.  Then send a copy of that letter to each of your congresspersons.  Tell them how we have gone forward in a non-violent way, notifying all responsible parties of our each and every move, and of how the court of Judge Waters has perverted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and is denying us our right to exercise our religion.  Remind them that Thomas Jefferson himself warned us that it might be necessary to spill the blood of tyrants to protect the Constitution and our rights from an abusive government.  Plead with them to reconsider their position of attempting to prohibit us from growing any plant given to us by God - as a matter of moral principle.  Promise them that we will continue to attempt to inform them in a moral and non-violent manner.  Warn them that in light of Waco and Ruby Ridge, that obvious corruption like that of the plant prohibition laws and the drug smuggling at Mena by government agents, will act as a corrosive acid on the fabric of our nation and may end up burning those who try to wrap their corruption in the flag of our Nation.     Keep up your praying and gathering in the Sight of God.  We are right, on the facts and the law.  We will prevail against this corruption in time.  We must be willing to invest that time in the fight.  I am, and I call on you to commit that investment also.  In February of this year, in U.S. v. Bauer, 75 F.3d 1366 (available at your local law library), the Ninth Circuit overturned a conviction identical to mine.  The Supreme Court has refused to review my case, but I believe that they are reviewing Bauer, and that when they do I will be able to use it to overturn my own conviction.  If that happens all that I have lost will come back to me except the time I have spent in prison.  I may gain an equal amount of time to live just  because of the justice we will achieve and be able to live under.  I am now filing a lawsuit to get marijuana here for our Rastafarian Church.  More on that later.  Take care - - LOVEDear Carl,     Thanks for Greg Peck�s appeal brief.  It made for interesting reading.  It looks pretty good.  I thought it was weak on the RFRA'93 issue, that there is a lot to be demanded in the way of the Yoder and Sherbert decisions being the examples of correct adjudication - as I attempted to do in my Supreme Court brief.  You got that didn't you?  But, it's all there, and any reasonable man must agree that Greg gets a new trial or whatever and a decision on the merits of the issue and not some judge�s fantasy of what he wants the issue to be.  I just got the decisions on the three civil rights lawsuits against the county jail and the civil forfeiture of the Our Church of Antioch property.  They turned then all down.  The civil rights issues included the right to religious services in the jail in the same manner as the other churches got, access to religious texts and documents which included the DEA rescheduling petition and the DOT reports on marijuana and driving, access to a law library for a pro per indigent defendant, and overcrowding.  All the case law both in and out of the circuit including Supreme Court said I had the law library, the documents and the church services for sure.  The civil forfeiture issue was whether or not the State could deny a transfer of title to an unincorporated church, without consideration of the RFRA'93.  The court said no problem, the state could do anything it wanted, and the RFRA'93 wasn't worth shit.  Neither was any of the other Eighth Circuit precedent.  Needless to say they have not published these decisions even though they are cases of first impression in the Circuit and the Country for that matter.  So this is the way they bury the death squad victims, no public notice, no public notices!  You warned me about the unlikelyhood that the court would do justice in this case.  You are right.  Next time be sure to advise the sucker that the circuits don't give a shit about what they have previously decided in the same issues and that they just don't publish the case so no ones the wiser.  I am real mad about this, I had no expectation that they would fix the game this way, what a fool I am.  Now, how the fuck am I going to pull this one out of the hat.  Well I already know that I won't, in all the cases where I have gotten myself into this kind of fix, God took a hand, or at least some force beyond my control.  Now let's watch, I got a feeling this is going to turn around, but for the life of me I don't know how.  They got all the advantage and I got nothing they seem to care about.  I am filing for rehearing and will go to Supreme.  Will it do any good?  I am also working on the jurisdiction issue, and got some good stuff.  Will send it to you soon.  Take care and remember your prayers, boy I got nothing else.WT01-B19-67IA087-000632-B012-466http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/COMMON/factfict.html 206.61.184.43 19970122090351 text/html 38175HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 09:03:41 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:02:36 GMTContent-length: 37959 Constitution: Fact or Fiction Constitution: Fact or Fiction By: Dr. Gene Schroder The Story of our Nation's Descent from aConstitutional Republic through a Constitutional Dictatorship toan Unconstitutional Dictatorship.

Chapter One Our Constitution Has Been Suspended Since March 9, 1933, the United States has been in a state of declared NationalEmergency. -Senate Report 93-549 When in the course of human events, ordinary citizens havereason to fear their government, it's time to look seriously atcause and cure. Government officials are supposed to be instruments by whichwe, the people, govern ourselves. Under a constitutionalgovernment, the citizens are the ruling class. All other officesare subservient to the citizens. How did citizens become thesubjects of government and government officials become the rulingclass? Government Has Achieved Ability to Rule by Decree The US Constitution was basically the shackles placed on thefederal government by a sovereign people. The people possessedGod-given rights. These rights were only secured by theconstitution. All rights not specifically granted to thegovernment were reserved for the people. This country started out as a constitutional republic, thatis, a union of sovereign nation states. The federal governmentwas to be an agent of the states. As a safeguard, the constitution provides that during timesof rebellion or invasion, the president may assume all powers.These emergency powers should end after the crisis. PresidentLincoln assumed all powers during the Civil War. Since he wasdealing with a rebellion, we may say that he established aconstitutional dictatorship. Since then, however, the definition of"emergencies" requiring total control has beenstretched to include economic problems, social imbalances, andperceived threats to the US by a foreign country's actions onanother continent. When authoritarian control is exerted duringtimes other than rebellion or enemy invasion, it is anunconstitutional dictatorship. The federal government hasoverstepped the bounds placed on it by the constitution. Through the insidious, yet steady encroachment of"emergency powers," the government has now achieved theability to rule the people by statute or decree, without the voteor consent of the ruled. Through a maze of political maneuvers,the emergency powers granted to President Franklin D. Rooseveltin 1933 to deal with an economic depression have become part ofthe US Code as permanent everyday powers. America has continuedunder the "unconstitutional dictatorship" of war andemergency powers to this day, more than 60 years later. Emergency Rule Means Government Owns All Rights In reality, under this "unconstitutionaldictatorship," the roles have been reversed. We have norights except those the government grants us. Under ourconstitutional government, we the people had all rights exceptthose specifically granted to the government. We have lost our constitutional rights. How did it happen?What does it mean? What can we do about it? Increasingly, UScitizens are unwilling to be the pawns of arbitrary andcapricious decrees. We have both the right and duty to reclaimour country. The government today, with its inflated bureaucracy,political posturing, and ineffectual programs, would be alaughingstock if it weren't for the sinister side - arbitraryseizure of property without proven cause by many governmentagencies, federally mandated but unfunded programs that choke thestates' right to rule themselves, an unsound money system, and ade facto economic depression for the last 10 years. Add a growingseparation between "haves" and "have nots"and we have a powder keg on a short fuse. Government has grown so big, so unreachable, that theordinary citizen feels helpless to influence it. Government bythe people? Even those with clout and political savvy, such asstate governors, seem unable to sway D.C. Government acts like a tyrant gone rampant, wilfully imposingits policies on citizens, protecting its image, and covering upits mistakes. Fear sets in when we realize that the governmentcan play kickball with our lives - and there is no one to stopit. Today, with our constitutional rights effectively suspended,we are at the mercy of the giant. Hitler used Germany's emergency powers clause (Article 48) toperpetrate his atrocities. Granted, no US president has evenapproached Hitler's dictatorship, but he has the power to do so.The difference is the degree of benevolence with which the USgovernment has ruled and with which Hitler ruled. The US constitution provides for the president to be grantedemergency powers in times of war or enemy attack. The fatal flawin the constitution, however, is that once the president hasthese powers, he himself must give them up. Eleven presidents,both Democrat and Republican, have failed to reinstate theconstitution and give up these emergency powers. Today we see thepresident and entrenched bureaucracy passing rules through theexecutive branch's many agencies without challenge from the othertwo branches of government - the congress and the judiciary. We Have Been Under Emergency Rule for 61 Years Senate Report 93-549, written in 1973, said "Since March9, 1933, the United States has been in a state of declarednational emergency." It goes on to say: "A majority of the people of the United States havelived all their lives under emergency rule. For 40 years,freedoms and governmental procedures guaranteed by theconstitution have, in varying degrees, been abridged by lawsbrought into force by states of National emergency. In the UnitedStates, actions taken by government in times of great crisishave... in important ways shaped the present phenomenon of apermanent state of National emergency."... "These proclamations give force to 470 provisions offederal law. These hundreds of statutesdelegate to the Presidentextraordinary powers, ordinarily exercised by Congress, whichaffect the lives of American citizens in a host ofall-encompassing manners. This vast range of powers, takentogether, confer enough authority to rule this country withoutreference to normal constitutional process. "Under the powers delegated by these statutes, thePresident may: seize property, organize and control the means ofproduction; seize commodities; assign military forces abroad;institute martial law; seize and control all transportation andcommunication; regulate the operation of private enterprise;restrict travel; and, in a plethora of particular ways, controlthe lives of all American citizens." Today most of the people living in the US have not beentaught the constitution, have never enjoyed the constitutionalrights for which our forefathers fought a revolutionary war, andknow that something is terribly wrong with our government yethave no idea what to do about it. Knowledge is power. Once the American people understand whathas happened, they will demand just and reasonable action. It wassaid of the Revolutionary War against Great Britain in 1776 thatthe real revolution occurred in the hearts and minds of theAmerican people before a shot was fired. God grant that we mayhave a revolution in the hearts and minds of the American peoplewithout a shot being fired. Chapter Two What the Government Can Do When the Constitution is Suspended It is not the function of the government to keep the citizen from falling into error; it is the function of the citizen to keep the government from falling into error. -US Supreme Court Good People Get into Trouble You probably think that if you lead a straight life and obeythe rules, you aren't going to get into trouble, right? Wrong.Consider these examples: Diane, a soft-spoken school teacher, was called to serve onthe grand jury. She was asked to fill out a lengthy formdisclosing everything about herself, including how much money shemade, how much her house was worth, what kind of car she drove,etc. She would not answer the questions because she thought thiswas an invasion of privacy and she didn't see how it affected herright to serve on a jury. The judge had her arrested for contemptof court and jailed. Linda, a young mother, was getting ready to go to work onemorning when a Child Protective Service worker showed up on herdoorstep. She insisted on coming in, inspecting the house andfour-year-old Johnny, and looking for signs of child abuse. Lindashowed up at work in tears two hours later, but it wasn't over.She received a call at work asking both her and her husband tocome in for an interview. More grilling. Files were made on theparents. The young couple had to supply references, and the childprotective service worker called these people asking if they hadseen any signs of child abuse. The visits and interviewscontinued for six months. The reason for all this? Someone calledin a "tip." The agency refused to tell the young couplewho called, but it didn't take them long to figure out it was aformer friend who held a grudge. Janette and Bob were selling a house and buying another one.In the packet of forms for the closing was a report that a womanwith the same first and last names, but a different middle nameand a different social security number, had declared bankruptcysix years previously. Janette had to prove that she wasn't thatperson, including getting forms notarized, which required goingto three different bureaucracies. Janette's realtor told her thatsince November, 1993, buyers' names are run through a computer,which sometimes comes up with 25 or so similar names. The buyerhas to prove he is none of those people. Don got a notice in the mail from his bank that his accounthad been attached by the IRS. No notice, no warning, no reason,no appeal. Bob owned a piece of land some distance from his home.When he visited it, he found that it had been confiscated by thegovernment because they had found illegal drug activity on it. Hehad to prove he was not involved and had no knowledge of itbefore he could have his land back. Government Agents May Knock Down Our Doors A crippled old black man was in bed asleep one night when adrug squad burst in and sprayed him with bullets. They claimed hewas resisting arrest. The squad had a tip that a young man whosometimes visited the elderly gentleman was into drugs, but theyoung man didn't live there and in fact, wasn't there that night.The slain man's son, a well-known sports figure, demonstrated onTV how crippled his father was and how he would have had to gothrough a series of slow and painful maneuvers to even sit up onthe side of the bed. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms fiasco in Waco,Texas was played out on national TV. What isn't widely known isthat the original warrants were for a total of $400 for two gunssuspected of not having had the excise tax paid on them. Thisjustified attacking a private residence with a riot squad, layingsiege to the compound for two months at a cost of over a milliondollars a day to taxpayers, imprisoning and torturing men, womenand children for over two months without benefit of charges beingfiled or a trial being held, and in the end the deaths of 86people plus four ATF troopers. Incidentally, the survivors wereacquitted by a jury of charges of conspiracy to commit murder. Senseless Rules Waste Our Time A young couple wanted to pull their trailer from Virginia toTexas, but the trailer was unlicensed. He called his mom in Texasto buy him a trailer license. Mom called the licensing office inthe county in which the son lived and told them what she needed,inquired about their hours and explained that she was 60 milesaway. When she arrived, they refused to issue a license on thetrailer because she did not have proof that the car which wouldpull the trailer had insurance. Her explanations that the car wasin Virginia fell on deaf ears. So too did her question as to whythey didn't tell her that before she drove 120 miles round trip.She went back home and called the local county agency and theytold her just to bring in any proof of insurance on any car.Makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? Guilty Until We Prove Ourselves Innocent If you are found with more than $10,000 cash on your person,it can be confiscated. You must prove how you earned it and thatit is legally yours. If you deposit or withdraw $10,000 or more from your bankaccount, the bank is required by law to report it to the IRS. If you get in trouble with one agency, another agency ofteninvestigates you (usually the IRS). These are just a few everyday examples of real people andtheir small and large troubles with government agencies. Examples Are Common in Everyday Life These situations are so common that you can easily find otherexamples in the problems of your family and friends. Some Acts Are Inherently Wrong; Others Are Just Against the Rules We are not saying there should be no punishment for crimes.Some acts are inherently wrong - murder, rape, kidnapping, arson,etc. But some acts are "crimes" only because somelegislative body or bureaucrat has made a law that says it is.Another agency may even have a conflicting rule. These"crimes" change regularly depending on who is in power.Legal terminology makes the distinction between malum se - evilin itself, versus malum prohibitum - a crime because someone hasmade a law against it. The story of Daniel in the Bible illustrates this point.Daniel was accustomed to praying every day from his window. Theruler made it against the law for anyone to pray. Danielcontinued to do so. He was seized and thrown into the lion's denbecause he broke the law. In our case, our liberties have been taken from us and arebeing sold back to us in the form of licenses. A person doesn't stop knowing how to drive if he misplaceshis drivers license. A merchant doesn't lose his ability to run abusiness if he has no commercial license. A farmer doesn't stopbeing a steward of the land if he doesn't get a pesticideapplicator's license. Restricted Liberties Have Not Bought Safety Even though many of our liberties have been taken, the systemstill isn't working. The streets are not safe, drugs and violenceare rampant in schools, young couples can't make a living fortheir families, many elderly are starving and neglected, andmillions of Americans can't afford health care. Restrictedliberty did not buy us safety and well-being. What Can't the Government Do to Us? What can government agencies do to us if they suspect us ofnot following their arbitrary edicts that may change tomorrow?Anything they wish. They can and do: Rob our time and productivity with senseless rules paperwork. Invade our privacy. Take our money and property. Throw us in jail. Take our children from us. Ruin our reputation. Kill us. We Have No Recourse Do we have any recourse? Not really. Most people don't havethe time and money to fight. Our only hope is big media attentionand public outcry. Few have the ear of the media. We are alonewhen we are pitted against the various government agencies withtheir awesome and arbitrary power. Chapter Three Why the Revolutionary War Was Fought Since the close of the last war, the British Parliament, claiming the power of right to bind the people of America by statute in all cases whatsoever ... - Declaration of Rights, 1774 England Looked on Colonies as Property The colonists were in a new land fending for themselves. Theyeither learned self-reliance and responsibility or they didn'tsurvive. England gave them no help to speak of. To England, Americawas a group of trading companies whose purpose was to furtherGreat Britain's dominion over the world. King George regardedEngland as the owner of the colonies and the colonists, andexploited as he pleased. Colonies Had No Sound Money System The colonies had no official money. They were greatly hamperedin trade by the many different types of trade "coin."They used furs, tobacco, wampum (mussel shells made into beads),French louis, English guineas, German thalers, Dutch ducats,Spanish doubloons, and the Spanish milled dollar, or piece ofeight. England ignored the needs of the colonies and made no effortto provide gold or silver coin or small change currency. The Massachusetts Bay Company started minting coins in Bostonin 1652. Other colonies and individuals tried minting projectsbut generally failed. The new land still did not have a standardmoney. England Levies Taxes on Colonists to Finance War The British got into a war with Spain. They needed more andmore wealth to pay for it. They took more and more from thecolonies. The British levied taxes on tea and tobacco and stamps toraise money for the war. They made arbitrary rules and expectedthe colonists to obey. The rules could change at any time. The colonists began to complain of "taxation withoutrepresentation." England Uses Force The British tightened the rules. They put on shows of force.They attacked villagers, burned towns, and plundered the coastsand seas. The final blow was when the colonists learned largenumbers of foreign mercenaries were sailing toward the new worldin order to subdue the colonists. Colonists Declare Independence Representatives of the people met in Philadelphia in 1776 todecide what to do. After long and bitter debate and soulsearching, these men asked Thomas Jefferson to draft theDeclaration of Independence to tell the world why the colonistswere cutting their ties with Great Britain. Let's look at some excerpts. The second paragraph says: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all menare created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator withcertain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty,and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights,governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powersfrom the consent of the governed; that whenever any form ofgovernment becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right ofthe people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute newgovernment, laying its foundation on such principles, andorganizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem mostlikely to effect their safety and happiness..." It goes on to say this step is not taken lightly, that thecolonists have been very patient. Complaints Against King George It begins to set forth the complaints against King George.Several complaints deal with his refusal to make fair laws, tomake needed laws, to allow representation by the colonists, andhis dissolving bodies of representatives repeatedly when theydisagreed with him. Then we come to these complaints: "He has made judgesdependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, andthe amount and payment of their salaries. "He has erected a multitude of new offices, and senthither swarms of officers to harass our people, and to eat outtheir substance. "He has kept among us, in times of peace, standingarmies, without the consent of our legislatures. "He hasaffected to render the military independent of, and superior to,the civil power. "He has combined with others to subject us to ajurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged byour laws, giving his assent to their acts of pretendedlegislation. "For quartering large bodies of armed troops amongus:..." We have some of these situations today. The ending words: "And for the support of this declaration, with a firmreliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutuallypledge to each other our lives, our fortune, and our sacredhonor." With the signing came seven long years of bloodshedand destruction. Chapter Four Rights the Constitution Guaranteed Us The powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. - United States Constitution When the colonists declared themselves independent, they hadalready begun to think of themselves as a new people, asAmericans. After they defeated the British, they were determined neveragain to be the subjects of tyrants and despotism, either fromwithout or within. They began to hammer out the philosophy of the United States. First they formed into a loose confederation of states. Oneproblem was that the individual states could easily ignore theconfederation, and there was nothing to prevent one statedeclaring war on another, as was common in Europe. States Rights Versus Federal Supremacy Out of this grew a great debate between the Federalists andthe Anti Federalists. The Federalists felt that a stronger union was needed toensure domestic peace, represent the new country abroad, protectthe country, and strengthen the growing nation. The Anti Federalists feared a strong central government wouldput them back into a situation like the one they had fought tooverthrow for seven years. Eventually a consensus was reached. The Constitution of theUnited States was drafted. Its great purpose was to preservepeace on this continent and ensure liberty. Americans becamecitizens of both their states and the new nation. Because of thisdual citizenship, the American Constitution formed a federalrepublic. (It was a republic because not everyone could vote. Only freewhite males could vote. The country did not become a democracyuntil the constitution was amended to allow everyone the right tovote, including African-Americans, Indians, and women.) Comingout of oppression and despotism, the founding fathers tried tocraft a constitution that would ensure equality, opportunity andjustice for all, for all time. They spelled out the rights of the people and said that allrights not specifically given to the federal government or thestates were reserved for the people. Human Beings Have Inalienable Rights The Constitution clearly stated that all human beings havecertain inalienable rights just because they belong to the humanspecies. Among these inalienable human rights are the right tolife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Constitutionsought to form a government with the consent of the governed, onethat would ensure domestic tranquillity, a common nationaldefense, and promote the general welfare and secure the blessingsof liberty for everyone. Individual rights were reinforced with the "bill ofrights" (the first ten amendments), and other amendmentslater on. (The complete Constitution may be found in theAppendix.) Let`s look at the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Atthe same time, let's think about whether these <$irights;constitutional vs. reality>rightsare real for us today, or whether they exist on paper only. Article One - Freedom of Speech, Religion, Press Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment ofreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridgingthe freedom of speech, or of the press; or of the right of thepeople peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government fora redress of grievances. Article Two - Right to Bear Arms A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of afree state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shallnot be infringed. Article Three - No Soldiers Quartered in Peacetime No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house,without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war but in amanner to be prescribed by law. Article Four- No Unlawful Search and Seizure The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but uponprobable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, andparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the personsor things to be seized. Article Five - Grand Jury Indictment Required No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwiseinfamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grandjury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or inthe militia, when in actual service in time of war or publicdanger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense tobe twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelledin any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor bedeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process oflaw; nor shall <$iprivate property;not to be taken for public use>privateproperty be taken for public use, without just compensation. Article Six - Right to Speedy Trial In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the rightto a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the stateand district wherein the crime shall have been committed, whichdistrict shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to beinformed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to beconfronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsoryprocess for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have theassistance of counsel for his defense. Article Seven - Right to Trial by Jury In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shallexceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall bepreserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwisere-examined in any court of the United States, than according tothe rules of common law. Article Eight - No Excessive Bail or Punishment Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive finesimposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments be inflicted. Article Nine - People Retain Rights Not Assigned The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shallnot be construed to deny or disparage others retained by thepeople. Article Ten - All Other Rights Go to State or People The powers not delegated to the United States by theConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved tothe states respectively, or to the people. Other Rights Assured the People In addition, slavery was abolished by Article 13. Article 14made citizens of all persons born or naturalized in the UnitedStates and forbade any state to abridge the privileges andimmunities of citizenship. The15th Amendment said the right to vote shall not be deniedby the United States or any state on account of <$irace;and right to vote>race,color, or previous condition of servitude. The 24th outlawed poll taxes. The 19th Amendment gave womenthe right to vote. The 26th Amendment lowered the voting age to18. With this collection of amendments, the right to vote wasfinally given to all adults. Thus the founding fathers laid out our rights clearly andplainly in common language after much debate and soul-searching. Chapter Five What We Have Lost A majority of the people of the United States have lived all their lives under emergency rule. - Senate Report 93-549 We Have Lost Our Constitutional Rights Today we are presumed guilty until we prove ourselvesinnocent. Today we have Big Brother watching us, invading ourprivacy, gathering information and controlling our lives. We haveall but lost our right to keep and bear arms. We are not secure in our persons, houses, papers and effectsagainst unreasonable searches and seizures. We are subjected toelectronic snooping, wiretapping, and <$idrug raids>drug raiderskicking down our door at any time. Wrong door? Sorry. We are subject to confiscation of property and bank accountsat any time by various government agencies. We are subject to Child Protective Services invading ourhomes to make us prove we don't abuse our children. We are held to answer for "crimes" without benefitof charges being filed or a trial being held. The news is full of people being tried twice for the samecrime, in criminal court and in civil court, or on criminalcharges, then on federal charges. We do not enjoy speedy trials. Several years may lapse beforea case is tried. We are not allowed trial by jury in civil casesunless we file a petition and pay for it in advance. Most civilcases are not heard by juries. Bail and fines are excessive if the accused has no hopes ofmeeting them, and that is often the case. The amount of time andmoney it takes to appeal a government agency confiscation orruling is prohibitive to the common working man or woman. Crueland unusual punishment? The world saw what happened at Waco.Texas. This was cruel and unusual punishment without benefit ofcharges, trial or conviction. The Constitution says all legislative powers herein grantedshall be vested in the congress. Where does it mention theFederal Register, a device by which a proposed law can bepublished by a government agency or bureau-cracy, a certain timeallowed for public comment, and then the law cemented withoutregard for what the comment was? Hundreds of proposed rules andregulations are published here each week. Most people have neverheard of the Federal Register. The president can also make law by executive orders andproclamations. Congress was given the power to coin money and to regulatethe value thereof. So why does the Federal Reserve do this today? Congress was given the power to declare war. So why does thepresident order invasions without counsel of the congress? Congress was given the right to call forth the militia tosuppress insurrections and repel invasions. So why does thepresident declare martial law and use federal troops inside theUS? Why does the president maintain a standing army among us? The Constitution says "No capitation or other direct taxshall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumerationherein before directed to be taken." The amendmentestablishing the income tax was passed when few congressmen werepresent, and many say illegally. The Constitution says "The privilege of the writ ofhabeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless in cases of invasionor rebellion the public safety may require it." This meansthat a person should be brought before the court and charged withthe alleged crime. This clause means it is illegal to holdsomeone without charging them with a crime. "No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall bepassed." What do you call a retroactive income taxregulation? "No state shall make anything but gold and silver coin atender in payment of debts ..." So why was gold coin illegalfor many years? Why aren`t Federal Reserve bank notes backed bygold or silver? Under the duties of the judicial branch, Article Three, itsays "The trial of all crimes, except in cases ofimpeachment, shall be by jury;..." So why are we notautomatically given a trial by jury? The constitution says the people shall have the right to keepand bear arms. Now laws are being passed to abridge that right. Article Six says "The Constitution and the laws of theUnited States which shall be made in pursuance thereof ... shallbe the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every stateshall be bound thereby ...". So why can we not use theconstitution in court as defense against violation of our rights? The answer to all these questions is that the federalgovernment has used and abused the constitution's war andemergency powers clause so that for over 60 years ourconstitution has been suspended.

NATIONAL EMERGENCY: (as defined in Black's LawDictionary) A state of national crisis; a situation demandingimmediate and extraordinary national or federal action. Congresshas made little or no distinction between a "state ofnational emergenc y" and a "state of war". Brownv. Bernstein, D.C.Pa., 49 F.Supp. 728, 732. This report begins with a series of documents which arerepresentative (Exhibits 1 through 7), of the documents containedin this Report. We will be quoting from in many cases, reports,Senate and Congressional reports, hearings before NationalEmergency Committees, Presidential Papers, Statutes at Large, andthe United States Code. Exhibit 8 is taken from a book written by Swisher calledConstitutional Development. Let's read the first paragraph. Itsays: "We may well wonder in view of the precedents now established," said Charles E. Hughes, (Supreme Court Justice) in 1920, "whether constitutional government as heretofore maintained in this Republic could survive another great war even victoriously waged." How could that happen? Surely, if we go out and fight a warand win it, we'd have to end up stronger than the day we started,wouldn't we? Justice Hughes goes on to say: "The conflict known as the World War had ended as far as military hostilities were concerned, but was not yet officially terminated. Most of the war statutes were still in effect, many of the emergency organizations were still in operation." What is this man talking about when he speaks of "warstatutes in effect and emergency organizations still inoperation"? In 1933 (Exhibit 9), Congressman Beck, speaking from theCongressional Record, states: "I think of all the damnable heresies that have ever been suggested in connection with the Constitution, the doctrine of emergency is the worst. it means that when Congress declares an emergency, there is no Constitution. This means its death. It is the very doctrine that the German chancellor is invoking today in the dying hours of the parliamentary body of the German republic, namely, that because of an emergency, it should grant to the German chancellor absolute power to pass any law, even though the law contradicts the Constitution of the German republic. Chancellor Hitler is at least frank about it. We pay the Constitution lipservice, but the result is the same." Congressman Beck is saying that, of all the damnable heresiesthat ever existed, this doctrine of emergency has got to be theworst, because once Congress declares an emergency, there is noConstitution. He goes on to say: "But the Constitution of the United States, as a restraining influence in keeping the federal government within the carefully prescribed channels of power, is moribund, if not dead. We are witnessing its death-agonies, for when this bill becomes a law, if unhappily it becomes a law, there is no longer any workable Constitution to keep the Congress within the limits of its Constitutional powers." What bill is Congressman Beck talking about? In 1933,"the House passed the Farm Bill by a vote of more than threeto one." Again, we see the doctrine of emergency. Once anemergency is declared, there is no Constitution. The cause andeffect of the doctrine of emergency is the subject of thisReport. In 1973, in Senate Report 93-549 (Exhibit 10), the firstsentence reads: "Since March the 9th, 1933, the United States has been in a state of declared national emergency." Let's go back to Exhibit 9 just before this. What did thatsay? It says that if a national emergency is declared, there isno Constitution. Now, let us return to Exhibit 10. Since Marchthe 9th of 1933, the United States has been, in fact, in a stateof declared national emergency. Referring to the middle of this exhibit: "This vast range of powers, taken together, confer enough authority to rule the country without reference to normal constitutional processes. Under the powers delegated by these statutes, the President may: seize property; organize and control the means of production; seize commodities; assign military forces abroad; institute martial law; seize and control all transportation and communication; regulate the operation of private enterprise; restrict travel; and, in a plethora of particular ways, control the lives of all American citizens" and this situation has continued uninterrupted since Marchthe 9th of 1933. In the introduction to Senate Report 93-549 (Exhibit 11): "A majority of the people of the United States have lived all their lives under emergency rule." Remember, this report was produced in 1973. The introductiongoes on to say: "For 40 years, freedoms and governmental procedures guaranteed by the Constitution have, in varying degrees, been abridged by laws brought into force by states of national emergency." The introduction continues: "And, in the United States, actions taken by the government in times of great crisis have from, at least, the Civil War, in important ways shaped the present phenomenon of a permanent state of national emergency." How many people were taught that in school? How could itpossibly be that something which could suspend our Constitutionwould not be taught in school? Amazing, isn't it? Where does this (Exhibit 12) come from? Is it possible that,in our Constitution, there could be some section which couldcontemplate what these previous documents are referring to? InArticle 1, Section 9 of the Constitution of the United States ofAmerica, we find the following words: "The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion, the public Safety may require it." Habeas Corpus - the Great Writ of Liberty. This is the writwhich guarantees that the government cannot charge us and hold uswith any crime, unless they follow the procedure of due processof law. This writ also says, in effect, that the privilege of dueprocess of law cannot be suspended, and that the governmentcannot not operate its arbitrary prerogative power against We thePeople. But we see that the great Writ of Liberty can, in fact,under the Constitution, be suspended when an invasion or arebellion necessitates it. In the 5th Amendment to the Constitution (Exhibit 13), itsays: "No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger..." We reserved the charging power for ourselves, didn't we? Wedidn't give that power to the government. And we also said thatthe government would be powerless to charge one of the citizensor one of the peoples of the United States with a crime unlessWe, the People, through our grand jury, orders it to do sothrough an indictment or a presentment. And if We, the People,don't order it, the government cannot do it. If it tried to doit, we would simply follow the Writ of Habeas Corpus, and theywould have to release us, wouldn't they? They could not hold us. But let us recall that, in Exhibit 13, it says: "except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in times of War or public danger." We can see here that the framers of the Constitution werealready contemplating times when there would be conditions underwhich it might be necessary to suspend the guarantees of theConstitution. Also from Senate Report 93-549 (Exhibit 14), and rememberthat our congressmen wrote these reports and these documents andthey're talking about these emergency powers and they say: "They are quite careful and restrictive on the power, but the power to suspend is specifically contemplated by the Constitution in the Writ of Habeas Corpus." Now, this is well known. This is not a concept that was notknown to rulers for many, many years. The concepts ofconstitutional dictatorship went clear back to the RomanRepublic. And there, it was determined that, in times of direemergencies, yes, the constitution and the rights of the peoplecould be suspended, temporarily, until the crisis, whatever itsnature, could be resolved. But once it was done, the Constitution was to be returned toits peacetime position of authority. In France, the situationunder which the constitution could be suspended is called theState of Siege. In Great Britain, it's called the Defense of the RealmActs. In Germany, in which Hitler became a dictator, it wassimply called Article 48. In the United States, it is called theWar Powers. If that was, in fact, the case, and we are under a waremergency in this country, then there should be evidence of thatwar emergency in the current law that exists today. That means weshould be able to go to the federal code known as the USC orUnited States Code, and find that statute, that law, inexistence. And if we went to the library today and picked up acopy of 12 USC and went to Section 95(b) (Exhibit 15), we will find a law which states: "The actions, regulations, rules, licenses, orders and proclamations heretofore or hereafter taken, promulgated, made, or issued by the President of the United States or the Secretary of the Treasury since March the 4th, 1933, pursuant to the authority conferred by Subsection (b) of Section 5 of the Act of October 6th, 1917, as amended [12 USCS Sec. 95a], are hereby approved and confirmed. (Mar. 9, 1933, c. 1, Title I, Sec. 1, 48 Stat. 1.)". Now, what does this mean? It means that everything thePresident or the Secretary of the Treasury has done since Marchthe 4th of 1933, or anything that the President or the Secretaryof the Treasury is hereafter going to do, is automaticallyapproved and confirmed. Referring back to Exhibit 10, let usremember that, according to the Congressional Record of 1973, theUnited States has been in a state of national emergency since1933. Then we realize that 12 USC, Section 95(b) is current law. This is the law that exists over thisUnited States this moment. If that be the case, let us see if we can understand what isbeing said here. As every action, rule or law put into effect bythe President or the Secretary of the Treasury since March the4th of 1933 has or will be confirmed and approved, let usdetermine the significance of that date in history. What happenedon March the 4th of 1933? On March the 4th of 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt wasinaugurated as President of the United States. Referring to hisinaugural address, which was given at a time when the country wasin the throes of the Great Depression, we read (Exhibit 16): "I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require. These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption. But in the event that the Congress shall fall to take one of these two courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe." On March the 4th, 1933, at his inaugural, President Rooseveltwas saying that he was going to ask Congress for theextraordinary authority available to him under the War PowersAct. Let's see if he got it. On March the 5th, President Roosevelt asked for a special andextraordinary session of Congress in Proclamation 2038. He calledfor the special session of Congress to meet on March the 9th atnoon. And at that Congress, he presented a bill, an Act, toprovide for relief in the existing national emergency in bankingand for other purposes. In the enabling portion of that Act (Exhibit 17), it states: "Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Congress hereby declares that a serious emergency exists and that it is imperatively necessary speedily to put into effect remedies of uniform national application." What is the concept of the rule of necessity, referred to inthe enabling portion of the act as "imperatively necessaryspeedily"? The rule of necessity is a rule of law whichstates that necessity knows no law. A good example of the rule ofnecessity would be the concept of self-defense. The law says,"Thou shalt not kill". But also know that, if you arein dire danger, in danger of losing your life, then you have theabsolute right of self-defense. You have the right to kill toprotect your own life. That is the ultimate rule of necessity. Thus we see that the rule of necessity overrides all otherlaw, and, in fact, allows one to do that which would normally beagainst the law. So it is reasonable to assume that the wordingof the enabling portion of the Act of March 9, 1933, is anindication that what follows is something which will probably beagainst the law. It will probably be against the Constitution ofthe United States, or it would not require that the rule ofnecessity be invoked to enact it. In the Act of March 9, 1933 (Exhibit 17), it further statesin Title 1, Section 1: "The actions, regulations, rules, licenses, orders and proclamations heretofore or hereafter taken, promulgated, made, or issued by the President of the United States or the Secretary of the Treasury since March the 4th, 1933, pursuant to the authority conferred by subdivision (b) of Section 5 of the Act of October 6, 1917, as amended, are hereby approved and confirmed." Where have we read those words before? This is the exact same wording as is found (Exhibit 15) todayin Title12, USC 95 (b). The language in Title 12,USC 95 (b) is exactly the same as that found in the Act ofMarch 9, 1933, Chapter 1, Title 1, Section 48, Statute 1. The Actof March 9, 1933, is still in full force and effect today. We arestill under the Rule of Necessity. We are still in a declaredstate of national emergency, a state of emergency which hasexisted, uninterrupted, since 1933, or for over sixty years. As you may remember, the authority to do this is conferred bySubsection (b) of Section 5 of the Act of October 6, 1917, asamended. What was the authority which was used to declare andenact the emergency in this Act? If we look at the Act of October6, 1917 (Exhibit 18), we see that at the top right-hand part ofthe page, it states that this was: "An Act To define, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy, and for other purposes." By the year 1917, the United States was involved in World War1; at that point, it was recognized that there were probablyenemies of the United States, or allies of enemies of the UnitedStates, living within the continental borders of our nation in atime of war. Therefore, Congress passed this act which identified whocould be declared enemies of the United States, and, in this act,we gave the government total authority over those enemies to dowith as it saw fit. We also see, however, in Section 2,Subdivision (c) in the middle, and again at the bottom of thepage: "other than citizens of the United States." The act specifically excluded citizens of the United States,because we realized in 1917 that the citizens of the UnitedStates were not enemies. Thus, we were excluded from the warpowers over enemies in this act. Section 5 (b) of the same act (Exhibit 19), states: "That the President may investigate, regulate, or prohibit, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, by means of licenses or otherwise, any transactions in foreign exchange, export or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency, transfers of credit in any form (other than credits relating solely to transactions to be executed wholly within the United States)". Again, we see here that citizens, and the transactions ofcitizens made wholly within the United States, were specificallyexcluded from the war powers of this act. "We thePeople", were not enemies of our country; therefore, thegovernment did not have total authority over us as they weregiven over our enemies. It is important to draw attention again to the fact thatcitizens of the United States in October, 1917, were not calledenemies. Consequently the government, under the war powers ofthis act, did not have authority over us; we were still protectedby the Constitution. Granted, over enemies of this nation, thegovernment was empowered to do anything it deemed necessary, butnot over us. The distinction made between enemies of the UnitedStates and citizens of the United States will become cruciallater on. In Section 2 of the Act of March 9, 1933 (Exhibit 17), "Subdivision (b) of Section 5 of the Act of October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. L. 411), as amended, is hereby amended to read as follows;" So we see that they are now going to amend Section 5 (b). Nowlet's see how it reads after it's amended. The amended version ofSection 5 (b) reads (emphasis added): "During time of war or during any other period of national emergency declared by the President, the President may, through any agency that be may designate, or otherwise, investigate, regulate, or prohibit, under such rules and regulations as be may prescribe, by means of licenses or otherwise, any transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President and export, hoarding, melting, or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency, by any person within the United States or anyplace subject to the jurisdiction thereof". What just happened? At as far as commercial, monetary orbusiness transactions were concerned, the people of the UnitedStates were no longer differentiated from any other enemy of theUnited States. We had lost that crucial distinction. ComparingExhibit 17 with Exhibit 19, we can see that the phrase whichexcluded transactions executed wholly within the United Stateshas been removed from the amended version of Section 5 (b) of theAct of March 9, 1933, Section 2, and replaced with "by anyperson within the United States or anyplace subject to thejurisdiction thereof'. All monetary transactions, whetherdomestic or international in scope, were now placed at the whimof the President of the United States through the authority givento him by the Trading with the Enemy Act. To summarize this critical point: On October the 6th of 1917,at the beginning of America's involvement in World War 1,Congress passed a Trading with the Enemy Act empowering thegovernment to take control over any and all commercial, monetaryor business transactions conducted by enemies or allies ofenemies within our continental borders. That act also defined theterm "enemy" and excluded from that definition citizensof the United States. In Section 5 (b) of this act, we see that the President wasgiven unlimited authority to control the commercial transactionsof defined enemies, but we see that credits relating solely totransactions executed wholly within the United States wereexcluded from that controlling authority. As transactions whollydomestic in nature were excluded from authority, the governmenthad no extraordinary control over the daily business conducted bythe citizens of the United States, because we were certainly notenemies. Citizens of the United States were not enemies of theircountry in 1917, and the transactions conducted by citizenswithin this country were not considered to be enemy transactions.But in looking again at Section 2 of the Act of March 9, 1933,(Exhibit 17), we can see that the phrase excluding whollydomestic transactions has been removed from the amended versionand replaced with "by any person within the United States oranyplace subject to the jurisdiction thereof'. The people of the United States were now subject to the powerof the Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6,1917, as amended.For the purposes of all commercial, monetary, and, in effect, allbusiness transactions. "We the People", became the sameas the enemy, and were treated no differently. There was nolonger any distinction. It is important here to note that, in the Acts of October 6,1917 and March 9, 1933, it states: "during times of war orduring any other national emergency declared by thePresident...". So we now see that the war powers not onlyincluded a period of war, but also a period of "nationalemergency" as defined by the President of the United States.When either of these two situations occur, the President may,(Exhibit 17) "through any agency that he may designate, or otherwise, investigate, regulate or prohibit under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe by means of licenses or otherwise, any transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President and export, boarding, melting or earmarking of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency by any person within the United States or anyplace subject to the jurisdiction thereof." What can the President do now to the We, the People, underthis Section? He can do anything he wants to do. It's purely athis discretion, and he can use any agency or any license that hedesires to control it. This is called a constitutionaldictatorship. In Senate Document 93-549 (Exhibit 20), Congress declaredthat a serious emergency exists, at: "48 Stat. 1. The exclusion of domestic transactions, formerly found in the Act, was deleted from Sect. 5 (b) at this time." Our Congress wrote that in the year 1973. Now let's find out about the Trading with the Enemy Act ofOctober 6, 1917. Quoting from a Supreme Court decision (Exhibit21), Stoehr v. Wallace, 1921: "The Trading With the Enemy Act, originally and as amended, is strictly a war measure, and finds its sanction in the provision empowering Congress "to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water" Const. Art. 1, Sect. 8, c1. 11. P.241". Remember your Constitution? "Congress shall have thepower to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal andmake all rules concerning the captures on the land and the waterof the enemies," all rules. If that be the case, let us look at the memorandum of lawthat now covers trading with the enemy, the "Memorandum ofAmerican Cases and Recent English Cases on The Law of TradingWith the Enemy" (Exhibit 22), remembering that we are nowthe same as the enemy. In this memorandum, we read: "Every species of intercourse with the enemy is illegal. This prohibition is not limited to mere commercial intercourse." This is the case of The Rapid (1814). Additionally, "No contract is considered as valid between enemies, at least so far as to give them a remedy in the courts of either government, and they have, in the language of the civil law, no ability to sustain a persona standi in judicio". In other words, they have no personal lights at law in court.This is the case of The Julia (1813). In the next case, the case of The Sally (1814) (Exhibit 23),we read the words: "By the general law of prize, property engaged in an illegal intercourse with the enemy is deemed enemy property. It is of no consequence whether it belong to an ally or to a citizen; the illegal traffic stamps it with the hostile character, and attaches to it all the penal consequences of enemy ownership". Reading further in the memorandum, again from the case of TheRapid: "The law of prize is part of the law of nations. In it, a hostile character is attached to trade, independently of the character of the trader who pursues or directs it. Condemnation to the use of the captor is equally the fate of the property of the belligerent and of the property found engaged in anti-neutral trade. But a citizen or an ally may be engaged in a hostile trade, and thereby involve his property in the fate of those in whose cause he embarks". Again from the memorandum (Exhibit 24): "The produce of the soil of the hostile territory, as well as other property engaged in the commerce of the hostile power, as the source of its wealth and strength, are always regarded as legitimate prize, without regard to the domicile of the owner". From the case (Exhibit 25) of The William Bagaley(1866): "In general, during war, contracts with, or powers of attorney or agency from, the enemy executed after outbreak of war are illegal and void; contracts entered into with the enemy prior to the war are either suspended or are absolutely terminated; partnerships with an enemy are dissolved; powers of attorney from the enemy, with certain exceptions, lapse; payments to the enemy (except to agents in the United States appointed prior to the war and confirmed since the war) are illegal and void; all rights of an enemy to sue in the courts are suspended." From Senate Report No. 113 (Exhibit 26), in which we find AnAct to Define, Regulate, and Punish Trading with the Enemy, andFor Other Purposes, we read: "The trade or commerce regulated or prohibited is defined in Subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), page 4. This trade covers almost every imaginable transaction, and is forbidden and made unlawful except when allowed under the form of licenses issued by the Secretary of Commerce (p. 4, sec. 3, line 18). This authorization of trading under licenses constitutes the principal modification of the rule of international law forbidding trade between the citizens of belligerents, for the power to grant such licenses, and therefore exemption from the operation of law, is given by the bill." It says no trade can be conducted or no intercourse can beconducted without a license, because, by mere definition of theenemy, and under the prize law, all intercourse is illegal. That was the first case we looked at, Exhibit 22, wasn't it?So once we were declared enemies, all intercourse became illegalfor us. The only way we could now do business or any type oflegal intercourse was to obtain permission from our government bymeans of a license. We are certainly required to have a SocialSecurity Card, which is a license to work, and a Drivers License,which gives the government the ability to restrict travel; allbusiness in which we engage ourselves requires us to have alicense, does it not? Returning once again to the Memorandum of Law: (Exhibit 27) "But it is necessary always to bear in mind that a war cannot be carried on without hurting somebody, even, at times, our own citizens. The public good, however, must prevail over private gain. As we said in Bishop v. Jones (28 Texas, 294), there cannot be "a war for arms and a peace for commerce". One of the most important features of the bill is that which provides for the temporary taking over of the enemy property." This point of law is important to keep in mind, for itauthorizes the temporary takeover of enemy property. The questionis: Once the war terminates, the property must be returned,mustn't it? The property that is confiscated, and the belligerent nightof the government during the period of war, must be returned whenthe war terminates. Let us take the case of a ship in harbor; warbreaks out, and the Admiral says, "I'm seizing yourship." Can you stop him? No. But when the war is over,the Admiral must return your ship to you. This point is importantto bear in mind, for we will return to, and expand upon, it laterin the report. Reading from (Exhibit 28) Senate Document No. 43,"Contracts Payable in Gold" written in 1933: "The ultimate ownership of all property is in the State; individual so-called "ownership" is only by virtue of government, i. e., law, amounting to mere user; and use must be in accordance with law and subordinate to the necessities of the State." Who owns all the property? Who owns the property you call"yours"? Who has the authority to mortgage property?Let us continue with a Supreme Court decision, (Exhibit 29) UnitedStates v. Russell: "Private property, the Constitution provides, shall not be taken for public use without just compensation..." That is the peacetime clause, isn't it? Further (emphasisadded), "Extraordinary and unforeseen occasions arise, however, beyond all doubt, in cases of extreme necessity in time of war or of immediate and impending public danger, in which private property may be impressed into the public service, or may be seized or appropriated to public use, or may even be destroyed without the consent of the owner..." This quote, and indeed this case, provides a vividfrustration of the potential power of the government. Now, let us return to the period of time after March 4, 1933,and take a close look at what really occurred. On March 4, 1933,in his inaugural address, President Franklin Delano Rooseveltasked for the authority of the war powers, and called a specialsession of Congress for the purpose of having those powersconferred to him. On March the 2nd, 1933, however, we find that Herbert Hooverhad written a letter to the Federal Reserve Board of New York,asking them for recommendations for action based on the over-allsituation at the time. The Federal Reserve Board responded with aresolution (Exhibit 30) which they had adopted, an excerpt fromwhich follows: "Resolution Adopted By The Federal Reserve Board Of New York. Whereas, in the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the continued and increasing withdrawal of currency and gold from the banks of the country has now created a national emergency ..." In order to fully appreciate the significance of this lastquote, we must recall that, in 1913, The Federal Reserve Act waspassed, authorizing the creation of a central bank, the thoughtof which had already been noted in the Constitution. The basicidea of the central bank was, among other things, for it to actas a secure repository for the gold of the people. We, thePeople, would bring our gold to the huge, strong vaults of theFederal Reserve, and we would be issued a note which said, ineffect, that, at any time we desired, we could bring that noteback to the bank and be given back our gold which we haddeposited. Until 1933, that agreement, that contract between the FederalReserve and its depositors, was honored. Federal Reserve notes,prior to 1933, were indeed redeemable in gold. After 1933, thesituation changed drastically. In 1933, during the depths of theDepression, at the time when We, the People, were struggling tostay alive and keep our families fed, the bankers began to say:"People are coming in now, wanting their gold, wanting us tohonor this contract we have made with them to give them theirgold on demand, and this contractual obligation is creating anational emergency." How could that happen? Reading from the Public Papers ofHerbert Hoover (Exhibit 31): "Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, that, in this emergency, the Federal Reserve Board is hereby requested to urge the President of the United States to declare a bank holiday, Saturday, March 4, and Monday, March 6. In other words, President Roosevelt was urged to close downthe banking system and make it unavailable make it unavailablefor a short period of time. What was to happen during that periodof time? Reading again from the Federal Reserve Board resolution(Exhibit 31), we find a proposal for an executive order, to beworded as follows: "Whereas, it is provided in Section 5 (b) of the Act of October 6, 1917, as amended, that "the President may investigate, regulate, or prohibit, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, by means of licenses or otherwise, any transactions in foreign exchange and the export, hoarding, melting, or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency, *** " Now, in any normal usage of the American language, thestandard accepted meaning of a series of three asterisks after aquotation means that what follows also must be quoted exactly,doesn't it? If it's not, that's a fraudulent use of the Americanlanguage. At that point where that, *** " began, what didthe original Act of October 6, 1917, say? Referring back to Exhibit 19, we find that the remainder ofSection 5 (b) of the Act of October 6, 1917 says: "(other than credits relating solely to transactions to be executed wholly within the United States)." This portion of Section 5 (b) specifically prohibited thegovernment from taking control of We, the People's money andtransactions, didn't it? However, let us now read the remainder of Section 5 (b) ofthe Act of October 6, 1917, as amended on March 9, 1933 (Exhibit17): "by any person within the United States or any place subject to the Jurisdiction thereof." Comparing the original with the amended version of Section 5(b), we can see the full significance of the amended version,wherein the exclusion of domestic transactions from the powers ofthe Act was deleted, and "any person" became subject tothe extraordinary powers conferred by the act. Further, we cannow see that the usage of *** " was, in all to likelihood,meant be deliberately misleading, if not fraudulent in nature. Further, in the next section of the Federal Reserve Board'sproposal, we find that anyone violating any provision of this actwill be fined not more than $10,000.00, or imprisoned for notmore than ten years, or both. A severe enough penalty at anytime, but one made all the more harsh by the economic conditionsin which most Americans found themselves at the time. And wherewere these alterations and amendments to be found? Not from thegovernment itself, initially; no, they are first to be found in aproposal from the Federal Reserve Board of New York, a bankinginstitution. Let us recall the chronology of events: Herbert Hoover, inhis last days as President of the United States, asked for arecommendation from the Federal Reserve Board of New York, andthey responded with their proposals. We see that President Hooverdid not act on the recommendation, and believed the actions were"neither justified nor necessary" (Appendix, PublicPapers of Herbert Hoover, p. 1088) . Let us see what happened;remember on March 4, 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt wasinaugurated as President of the United States. On March 5, 1933,President Roosevelt called for an extraordinary session ofCongress to be held on March 9,1933, as can be seen in Exhibit32: "Whereas, public interests require that the Congress of the United States should be convened in extra session at twelve o'clock, noon, on the Ninth day of March, 1933, to receive such communication as may be made by the Executive." On the next day, March 6, 1933, President Roosevelt issuedProclamation 2039, which has been included in this report,starting at the bottom of Exhibit 32. In Exhibit 32, we find thefollowing: "Whereas there have been heavy and unwarranted withdrawals of gold and currency from our banking institutions for the purpose of hoarding" Right at the beginning, we have a problem. And the problemrests in the question of who should be the judge of whether ornot my gold, on deposit at the Federal Reserve, with which I havea contract which says, in effect, that I may withdraw my gold atmy discretion, is being withdrawn by me in an"unwarranted" manner. Remember, the people of theUnited States were in dire economic straits at this point. If Ihad gold at the Federal Reserve, I would consider withdrawing asmuch of my gold as I needed for my family and myself a"warranted" action. But the decision was not left up toWe, the People. It is also important to note that it is stated that the goldis being withdrawn for the purpose of "hoarding". Thesignificance of this phrase becomes clearer when we reachProclamation 2039, wherein the term "hoarding" isinserted into the amended version of Section 5(b). The term,"hoarding", was not to be found in the original versionof Section 5(b) of the Act of October 6, 1917. It was a termwhich was used by President Roosevelt to help support hiscontention that the United States was in the middle of a nationalemergency, and his assertion that the extraordinary powersconferred to him by the War Powers Act were needed to deal withthat emergency. Let us now go on to the middle of Proclamation 2039, at thetop of the next page, Exhibit 33. In reading from Exhibit 33, wefind the following: "Whereas, it is provided in Section 5 (b) of the Act of October 6, 1917, (40 Stat. L. 411) as amended, " that the President may investigate, regulate, or prohibit, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, by means of licenses or otherwise, any transaction in foreign exchange and the export, hoarding, melting, or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency * * * " exactly as was first proposed by the Federal Reserve Board ofNew York (Exhibit 31). If we return to 48 Statute 1 (Exhibit 17), Title 1, Section1, we find that the amended Section 5 (b) with its added phrase: "by any person within the United States or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof". Is this becoming clearer as to exactly what happened? OnMarch 5, 1933, President Roosevelt called for an extra session ofCongress, and on March 6, 1933, issued Proclamation 2039(Exhibits 32-33). On March 9th, Roosevelt issued Proclamation2040. We looked at Proclamation 2039 on Exhibits 32 and 33, andnow, on Exhibit 33 (a), let's see what Roosevelt is hiking aboutin Proclamation 2040: "Whereas, on March 6, 1933, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, by Proclamation declared the existence of a national emergency and proclaimed a bank holiday... " We see that Roosevelt declared a national emergency and abank holiday. Let's read on: "Whereas, under the Act of March 9, 1933, all Proclamations heretofore or hereafter issued by the President pursuant to the authority conferred by section 5 (b) of the Act of October 6, 1917, as amended, are approved and confirmed;" This section of the Proclamation clearly states that allproclamations heretofore or hereafter issued by the President areapproved and confirmed, citing the authority of Section 5 (b).The key words here being "all" and"approved". Further: "Whereas, said national emergency still continues, and it is necessary to take further measures extending beyond March 9, 1933, in order to accomplish such purposes" We again clearly see that there is more to come, evidenced bythe phrase, "further measures extending beyond March 9, 1933...". Could this be the beginning of a new deal? Possibly aone-sided deal. How long can this type of action continue? Let'sfind out. "Now, therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, in view of such continuing national emergency and by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 5 (b) of the Act of October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. L. 411) as amended by the Act of March 9, 1933, do hereby proclaim, order, direct and declare that all the terms and provisions of said Proclamation of March 6, 1933, and the regulations and orders issued thereunder are hereby continued in full force and effect until further proclamation by the President." We now understand that the Proclamation 2039, of March 6,1933 and Proclamation 2040 of March 9, 1933, will continue untilsuch time as another proclamation is made by "thePresident". Note that the term "the President" isnot specific to President Roosevelt; it is a generic term whichcan equally apply to any President from Roosevelt to the present,and beyond. So here we have President Roosevelt declaring a nationalemergency (we are now beginning to realize the full significanceof those words) and closing the national banks for two days, byExecutive Order. Further, he states that the Proclamationsbringing about these actions will continue "in full forceand effect" until such time as the President, and onlythe President, changes the situation. It is important to note the fact that these Proclamationswere made on March 6, 1933, three days before Congress was due toconvene its extra session. Yet references are made to such thingsas the amended Section 5 (b), which had not yet even beenconfirmed by Congress. President Roosevelt must have beensupremely confident of Congress' confirmation of his actions. Andindeed, we find that confidence was justified. For on March 9,1933, without individual Congressmen even having the opportunityto read for themselves the bill they were to confirm, Congressdid indeed approve the amendment of Section 5 (b) of the Act ofOctober 6, 1917. Referring to the Public Papers of Herbert Hoover (Exhibit34): "That those speculators and insiders were right was plain enough later on. This first contract of the 'moneychangers' with the New Deal netted those who removed their money from the country a profit of up to 60 percent when the dollar was debased." Where had our gold gone? Our gold had already been movedoffshore. The gold was not in the banks, and when We, the Peoplelined up at the door attempting to have our contracts honored,the deception was exposed. What happened then? The laws werechanged to prevent us from asking again, and the military wasbrought in to protect the Federal Reserve. We, the People, weredeclared to be, the same as public enemy and placed undermilitary authority. Going now to another section of 48 Statute 1 (Exhibit 35): "Whenever in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury, such action is necessary to protect the currency system of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury, in his discretion, may require any or all individuals, partnerships, associations and corporations to pay and deliver to the Treasurer of the United States any or all gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by such individuals, partnerships, associations and corporations." By this Statute, everyone was required to turn in their gold.Failure to do so would constitute a violation of this provision,such violation to be punishable by a fine of not more than$10,000.00 and imprisonment for not more than ten years. It was aseizure. Whose property may be seized without due process of lawunder the Trading With the Enemy Act? The enemy's. Whose gold wasseized? Ours - the gold of the people of the United States. From the Roosevelt Papers (Exhibit 36): "During this banking holiday it was at first believed that some form of scrip or emergency currency would be necessary for the conduct of ordinary business. We knew that it would be essential when the banks reopened to have an adequate supply of currency to meet all possible demands of depositors. Consideration was given by government officials and various government officials and various local agencies to the advisability of issuing clearinghouse certificates or some similar form of local emergency currency. On March 7, 1933, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a regulation authorizing clearing houses to issue demand certificates against sound assets of the banking institutions, but this authority was not to become effective until March 10th. In many cities, the printing of these certificates was actually begun, but after the passage of the Emergency Banking Relief Act of March 9, 1933 (48 Stat. 1), it became evident that they would not be needed, because the Act made possible the issue of the necessary amount of emergency currency in the form of Federal Reserve banknotes which could be based on any sound assets owned by banks." Roosevelt could now issue emergency currency under the Act ofMarch 9, 1933 and this currency was to be called Federal Reservebank notes. From Title 4 of the Act of March 9, 1933 (Exhibit37): "Upon the deposit with the Treasurer of the United States, (a) of any direct obligations of the United States or (b) of any notes, drafts, bills of exchange, or bankers' acceptances acquired under the provisions of this act, any Federal reserve bank making such deposit in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury shall be entitled to receive from the Comptroller of the currency circulating notes in blank, duly registered and countersigned." What is this saying? It says (emphasis added): "Upon thedeposit with the Treasurer of the United States, (a) of anydirect obligation of the United States ..." What is a directobligation of the United States? It's a treasury note, which isan obligation upon whom? Upon "We the People" toperform. It's a taxpayer obligation, isn't it? Title 4 goes on: "or (b) of my notes, drafts, bills ofexchange or bankers' acceptances..." What's a note? If yougo to the bank and sign a note on your home, that's a note, isn'tit? A note is a private obligation upon We, the People. And ifthe Federal Reserve Bank deposits either (a) public and/or (b)private obligation of We, the People, with the Treasury, theComptroller of the currency will issue this circulating noteendorsed in blank, duly registered and countersigned, anemergency currency based on the (a) public and/or (b) privateobligations of the people of the United States. In the Congressional Record of March 9, 1933 (Exhibit 38), wefind evidence that our congressmen didn't even have individualcopies of the bill to read, on which they were about to vote. Acopy of the bill was passed around for approximately 40 minutes. Congressman McFadden made the comment, "Mr. Speaker, I regret that the membership of the House has had no opportunity to consider or even read this bill. The first opportunity I had to know what this legislation is, was when it was read from the clerk's desk. It is an important banking bill. It is a dictatorship over finance in the United States. It is complete control over the banking system in the United States ... It is difficult under the circumstances to discuss this bill. The first section of the bill, as I grasped it, is practically the war powers that were given back in 1917." Congressman McFadden later says, "I would like to ask the chairman of the committee if this is a plan to change the holding of the security back of the Federal Reserve notes to the Treasury of the United States rather than the Federal Reserve agent." Keep in mind, here, that, prior to 1933, the Federal Reservebank held our gold as security, in return for Federal Reservegold notes which we could redeem at any time we wanted. Now,however, Congressman McFadden is asking if this proposed bill isa plan to change who's going to hold the security, from theFederal Reserve to the Treasury. Chairman Steagall's response to Congressman McFadden'squestion, again from the Congressional Record: "This provision is for the issuance of Federal Reserve bank notes; and not for Federal Reserve notes; and the security back of it is the obligations, notes, drafts, bills of exchange, bank acceptances, outlined in the section to which the gentleman has referred." We were backed by gold, and our gold was seized, wasn't it?We were penniless, and now our money would be secured, not bygold, but by notes and obligations on which We, the People, werethe collateral security. Congressman McFadden then questioned, "Then the new circulation is to be Federal Reserve bank notes and not Federal Reserve notes. Is that true?" Mr. Steagall replied, "Insofar as the provisions of this section are concerned, yes." Does that sound familiar? Next we hear from Congressman Britten, as noted in theCongressional Record (Exhibit 39): "From my observations of the bill as it was read to the House, it would appear that the amount of bank notes that might be issued by the Federal Reserve System is not limited. That will depend entirely upon the amount of collateral that is presented from time to time for exchange for bank notes. Is that not correct?" Who is the collateral? We are chattel, aren't we? We have norights. Our rights were suspended along with the Constitution. Webecame chattel property to the corporate government, ourtransactions and obligations the collateral for the issuance ofFederal Reserve bank notes. Congressman Patman, speaking from the Congressional Record(Exhibit 40): "The money will be worth l00 cents on the dollar because it is backed by the credit of the Nation. It will represent a mortgage on all the homes and other property of all the people in the Nation." It now is no wonder that credit became so available after theDepression. It was needed to back our monetary system. Our debts,our obligations, our homes, our jobs... we were now slaves forthe system. From Statutes at Large, in the Congressional Record (Exhibit41): "When required to do so by the Secretary of the Treasury, each Federal Reserve agent shall act as agent of the Treasurer of the United States or of the Comptroller of the currency, or both, for the performance of any functions which the Treasurer or the Comptroller may be called upon to perform in carrying out the provisions of this paragraph." The Federal Reserve was taken over by the Treasury. TheTreasury holds the assets. We are the collateral... ourselves andour property. To summarize briefly: On March 9, 1933 the American people inall their domestic, daily, and commercial transactions became thesame as the enemy. The President of the United States, throughlicenses or any other form, was given the power to regulate andcontrol the actions of enemies. He made We, the People, chattelproperty; he seized our gold, our property and our rights; and hesuspended the Constitution. And we know that current law, to thisday, says that all proclamations issued heretofore or hereafterby the President or the Secretary of the Treasury are approvedand confirmed by Congress. Pretty broad, sweeping approval to beautomatic, wouldn't you agree? On March 11, 1933, President Roosevelt, in his first radio"Fireside Chat" (Exhibit 42), makes the followingstatement: "The Secretary of the Treasury will issue licenses to banks which are members of the Federal Reserve system, whether national bank or state, located in each of the 12 Federal Reserve bank cities, to open Monday morning." It was by this action that the Treasury took over the bankingsystem. Black's Law Dictionary defines the Bank Holiday of 1933(Exhibit 42a) in the following words: "Presidential Proclamations No. 2039, issued March 6, 1933, and No. 2040, issued March 9, 1933, temporarily suspended banking transactions by member banks of the Federal Reserve System. Normal banking functions were resumed on March 13, subject to certain restrictions. The first proclamation, it was held, had no authority in law until the passage on March 9, 1933, of a ratifying act (12 U.S.C.A. Sect. 95b). Anthony v. Bank of Wiggins, 183 Miss. 883, 184 So. 626. The present law forbids member banks of the Federal Reserve System to transact banking business, except under regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, during an emergency proclaimed by the President. 12 U. S. C. A. Sect. 95" Take special note of the last sentence of this definition,especially the phrase, "present law". The factthat banks are under regulation of the Treasury today, isevidence that the state of emergency still exists, by virtue ofthe definition. Not that, at this point, we need any moreevidence to prove we are still in a declared state of nationalemergency. From the Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12, 1933 (Exhibit43): "To issue licenses permitting processors, associations of producers and others to engage in the handling, in the current of interstate or foreign commerce, of any agricultural commodity or product thereof." This is the seizure of the agricultural industry by means oflicensing authority. In the first hundred days of the reign of Franklin DelanoRoosevelt, similar seizures by licensing authority weresuccessfully completed by the government over a plethora of otherindustries, among them transportation, communications, publicutilities, securities, oil, labor, and all natural resources. Thefirst hundred days of FDR saw the nationalization of the UnitedStates, its people and its assets. What has Bill Clinton talkedabout during his campaign and early presidency? His first hundreddays. Now, we know that they took over all contracts, for we havealready read in Exhibit 22: "No contract is considered as valid as between enemies, at least so far as to give them a remedy in the courts of law of either government, and they have, in the language of civil law, no ability to sustain a persona standi in judicio." They have no personal nights at law. Therefore, we shouldexpect that we would see in the statutes a time when the contractbetween the, Federal Reserve and We, the People, in which theFederal Reserve had to give us our gold on demand, was made nulland void. Referring to House Joint Resolution 192 (June 5, 1933)(Exhibit 44): "That (a) every provision contained in or made with respect to any obligation which purports to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold or a particular- kind of coin or currency, or in an amount of money of the United States measured thereby is declared to be against public policy; and no such policy shall be contained in or made with respect to any obligation hereafter incurred." Indeed, our contract with the Federal Reserve was invalidatedat the end of Roosevelt's hundred days. We lost our night torequire our gold back from the bank in which we had deposited it. Returning once again to the Roosevelt Papers (Exhibit 45): "This conference of fifty farm leaders met on March 10, 1933. They agreed on recommendations for a bill, which were presented to me at the White House on March 11th by a committee of the conference, who requested me to call upon the Congress for the same broad powers to meet the emergency in agriculture as I had requested for solving the bank crisis." What was the "broad powers"? That was the WarPowers, wasn't it? And now we see the farm leaders askingPresident Roosevelt to use the same War Powers to take control ofthe agricultural industry. Well, needless to say, he did. Weshould wonder about all that took place at this conference, forit to result in the eventual acquiescence of farm leadership tothe governmental takeover of their livelihoods. Reading from the Agricultural Adjustment Act, May the 12th,Declaration of Emergency (Exhibit 46): "That the present acute economic emergency being in part the consequence of a severe and increasing disparity between the prices of agriculture and other commodities, which disparity bas largely destroyed the purchasing power of farmers for industrial products, has broken down the orderly exchange of commodities, and has seriously impaired the agricultural assets supporting the national credit structure, it is hereby declared that these conditions in the basic industry of agriculture have affected transactions in agricultural commodities with a national public interest, have burdened and obstructed the normal currents of commerce in such commodities and rendered imperative the immediate enactment of Title 1 of this act." Now here we see that he is saying that the agriculturalassets support the national credit structure. Did he take thetitles of all the land? Remember "Contracts payable ingold!" President Roosevelt needed the support, andagriculture was critical, because of all the millions of acres offarmland at that time, and the value of that farmland. Themortgage on that farmland was what supported the emergencycredit. So President Roosevelt had to do something to stabilizethe price of land and Federal Reserve Bank notes to create money,didn't he? So he impressed agriculture into the public interest.The farming industry was nationalized. Continuing with the Agricultural Adjustment Act, Declarationof Emergency (Exhibit 47): "It is hereby declared to the public policy of Congress ..." Referring now back to Prize Cases (1862) (2 Black, 674)(Exhibit 24): "But in defining the meaning of the term 'enemies' property,' we will be led into error if we refer to Fleta or Lord Coke for their definition of the word, 'enemy'. It is a technical phrase peculiar to prize courts, and depends upon principles of public policy as distinguished from the common law." Once the emergency is declared, the common law is abolished,the Constitution is abolished and we fall under the absolute willof Government, public policy. All the government needs to continue is to have publicopinion on their side. If public opinion can be kept, insufficient degree, on the side of the government, statutes, lawsand bills can continue to be passed. The Constitution has nomeaning. The Constitution is suspended. It has been for 60 years.We're not under law. Law has been abolished. We're under a system of public policy, (War Powers). So when you go into that courtroom with your Constitution andthe common law in your hand, what does that judge tell you? Hetells you that you have no persona standi in judicio. You have nopersonal standing at law. He tells you not to bother bringing theConstitution into his court, because it is not a Constitutionalcourt, but an executive tribunal operating under a totallydifferent jurisdiction. From Section 93-549 (Exhibit 48) (emphasis added): "Under this procedure we retain Government by law, special, temporary law, perhaps, but law nonetheless. The public may know the extent and the limitations of the powers that can be asserted, and the persons affected may be informed by the statute of their rights and their duties." If you have any rights, the only reason you have them isbecause they have been statutorily declared, and your duties wellspelled out, and if you violate the orders of those statutes, youwill be charged, not with a crime, but with an offense. Again from 93-549, from the words of Mr. Katzenbach (Exhibit49): "My recollection is that almost every executive order ever issued straddles on several grounds, but it almost always includes the Trading With the Enemy Act because the language of that act Is so broad, it would 'justify almost anything." Speaking on the subject of a challenge to the Act by thepeople, Justice Clark then says, "Most difficult from a standpoint of standing to sue. The Court, you might say, has enlarged the standing rule in favor of the litigant. But I don't think it has reached the point, presently, that would permit many such cases to be litigated to the merits." Senator Church then made the comment: "What you're saying, then, is that if Congress doesn't act to standardize, restrict, or eliminate the emergency powers, that no one else is very likely to get a standing in court to contest." No persona standi n judicio, - no personal standing inthe courts. Continuing with Senate Report 93-549 (Exhibit 50): "The interesting aspect of the legislation lies in the fact that it created a permanent agency designed to eradicate an emergency condition in the sphere of agriculture." These agencies, of which there are now thousands, and whichnow control every aspect of our lives, were ostensibly created astemporary agencies meant to last only as long as the nationalemergency. They have become, in fact, permanent agencies, as hasthe state of national emergency itself. As Franklin DelanoRoosevelt said: "We will never go back to the oldorder." That quote takes on a different meaning in light ofwhat we have seen so far. In Exhibit 51, Senate Report 93-549, we find a quote fromSenator Church: "If the President can create crimes by fiat and without congressional approval, our system is not much different from that of the Communists, which allegedly threatens our existence." We see on this same document, at the bottom right-hand sideof the page, as a Title, the words, "Enormous Scope of Powers... A Time Bomb". Remember, this is Congress' own document, from the year 1973. Most people might not look to agriculture to provide themwith this type of information. But let us look at Title III ofthe Agricultural Adjustment Act, which is also called theEmergency Farm Mortgage Act of 1933 (Exhibit 52): "Title III - Financing - And Exercising Power Conferred by Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution: To Coin Money And To Regulate the Value Thereof." From Section 43 of Exhibit 52: "Whenever the President finds upon investigation that the foreign commerce of the United States is adversely affected ... and an expansion of credit is necessary to secure by international agreement a stabilization at proper levels of the currencies of various governments, the President is authorized, in his discretion ... To direct the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into agreements with the several Federal Reserve banks..." Remember that in the Constitution it states that Congress hasthe authority to coin all money and regulate the value thereof.How can it be then that the Executive branch is issuing anemergency currency, and quoting the Constitution as its authorityto do so? Under Section 1 of the same Act (Exhibit 53) we find thefollowing: "To direct the Secretary of the treasury to cause to be issued in such amount or amounts as he may from time to time order, United States notes, as provided in the Act entitled "An Act to authorize the issue of United States notes and for the redemption of funding thereof and for funding the floating debt of the United States, approved February 25, 1862, and Acts supplementary thereto and amendatory thereof" What is the Act of February 25, 1862? It is the Greenback Actof President Abraham Lincoln. Let us remember that, when AbrahamLincoln was elected and inaugurated, he didn't even have aCongress for the first six weeks. He did not, however, call anextra session of Congress. He issued money, he declared war, hesuspended habeas corpus, it was an absolute Constitutionaldictatorship. There was not even a Congress in session for six weeks. When Lincoln's Congress came into session six weeks later,they entered the following statement into the Congressionalrecord: "The actions, rules, regulations, licenses,heretofore or hereafter taken, are hereby approved andconfirmed..." This is the exact language of March 9,1933 and Title 12, USC, Section 95(b), today. We now come to the question of how to terminate theseextraordinary powers granted under a declaration of nationalemergency. We have learned that, in order for the extraordinarypowers to be terminated, the national emergency itself must becanceled. Reading from the Agricultural Act, Section 13 (Exhibit54): "This title shall cease to be in effect whenever the President finds and proclaims that the national economic emergency in relation to agriculture has been ended." Whenever the President finds by proclamation that theproclamation issued on March 6, 1933 has terminated, it has toterminate through presidential proclamation just as it came intoeffect. Congress had already delegated all of that authority, andtherefore was in no position to take it back. In Senate Report 93-549, we find the following statement fromCongress (Exhibit 55): "Furthermore, it would be largely futile task unless we have the President's active collaboration. Having delegated this authority to the President in ways that permit him to determine how long it shall continue, simply through the device of keeping emergency declarations alive - we now find ourselves in a position where we cannot reclaim the power without the President's acquiescence. We are unable to terminate these declarations without the President's signature, so we need a large measure of Presidential cooperation". It appears that no president has been willing to give up thisextraordinary power, and, if they will not sign the terminationproclamation, the access to, and usage of, extraordinary powersdoes not terminate. At least, it has not terminated for over 60years. Now, that's no definite indication that a President from BillClinton on might not eventually sign the terminationproclamation, but 60 years of experience would lead one to doubtthat day will ever come by itself But the question now to ask isthis: How many times have We, the People, asked the President toterminate his access to extraordinary powers, or the situation onwhich it is based, the declared national emergency? Who has everdemanded that this be done? How many of us even knew that it hadbeen done? And, without the knowledge contained in this report,how long do you think the blindness of the American public tothis situation would have continued, and with it the abolishmentof the Constitution? But we're not quite as in the dark as wewere, are we? In Senate Report 93-549 (Exhibit 56), we find the followingstatement from Senator Church: "These powers, if exercised, would confer upon the President total authority to do anything he pleased." Elsewhere in Senate Report 93-549, Senator Church makes theremarkable statement (Exhibit 57): "Like a loaded gun laying around the house, the plethora of delegated authority and institutions to meet almost every kind of conceivable crisis stand ready for use for purposes other than their original intention ... Machiavelli, in his "Discourses of Livy," acknowledged that great power may have to be given to the Executive if the State is to survive, but warned of great dangers in doing so. He cautioned: Nor is it sufficient if this power be conferred upon good men; for men are frail, and easily corrupted, and then in a short time, he that is absolute may easily corrupt the people." Now, a quote from an exclusive reply (Exhibit 58) written May21, 1973, by the Attorney General of the United States regardingstudies undertaken by the Justice Department on the question ofthe termination of the standing national emergency: "As a consequence, a "national emergency" is now a practical necessity in order to carry out what has become the regular and normal method of governmental actions. What were intended by Congress as delegations of power to be used only in the most extreme situations, and for the most limited duration's, have become everyday powers, and a state of "emergency" has become a permanent condition." From United States v. Butler (Supreme Court, 1935) (Exhibit59): "A tax, in the general understanding and in the strict Constitutional sense, is an exaction for the support of government; the term does not connote the expropriation of money from one group to be expended for another, as a necessary means in a plan of regulation, such as the plan for regulating agricultural production set up in the Agricultural Adjustment Act." What is being said here is that a tax can only be an exactionfor the support of government, not for an expropriation from onegroup for the use of another. That would be socialism, wouldn'tit? Quoting further from United States v. Butler (Exhibit 60): "The regulation of farmer's activities under the statute, though in form subject to his own will, is in fact coercion through economic pressure; his right of choice is illusory. Even if a farmer's consent were purely voluntary, the Act would stand no better. At best it is a scheme for purchasing with federal funds submission to federal regulation of a subject reserved to the states." Speaking of contracts, those contracts are coercioncontracts. They are adhesion contracts made by a superior over aninferior. They are under the belligerent capacity of governmentover enemies. They are not valid contracts. Again from United States v. Butler (Exhibit 61): "If the novel view of the General Welfare Clause now advanced in support of the tax were accepted, this clause would not only enable Congress to supplant the states in the regulation of agriculture and all other industries as well, but would furnish the means whereby all of the other provisions of the Constitution, sedulously framed to define and limit the powers of the United States and preserve the powers of the states, could be broken down, the independence of the individual states obliterated, and the United States converted into a central government exercising uncontrolled police power throughout the union superseding all local control over local concerns." Please, read the above paragraph again. The understanding ofits meaning is vital. The United States Supreme Court ruled the New Deal, thenationalization, unconstitutional in the Agricultural AdjustmentAct and they turned it down flat. The Supreme Court declared itto be unconstitutional. They said, in effect, "You'returning the federal government into an uncontrolled police state,exercising uncontrolled police power." What did Roosevelt donext? He stacked the Supreme Court, didn't he? And in 1937, UnitedStates v. Butler was overturned. From the 65th Congress, 1st Session Doc. 87, under thesection entitled Constitutional Sources of Laws of War, Page 7,Clause II, we find (Exhibit 62): "The existence of war and the restoration of peace are to be determined by the political department of the government, and such determination is binding and conclusive upon the courts, and deprives the courts of the power of hearing proof and determining as a question of fact either that war exists or has ceased to exist." The courts will tell you that is a political question, forthey (the courts) do not have jurisdiction over the common law. The courts were deprived of the Constitution. They weredeprived of the common law. There are now courts of prize overthe enemies, and we have no persona standi in judicio. We have nopersonal standing under the law. Also from the 65th Congress,under the section entitled Constitutional Sources of Laws of War,we find (Exhibit 63): "When the sovereign authority shall choose to bring it into operation, the judicial department must give effect to its will. But until that will shall be expressed, no power of condemnation can exist in the court." From Senate Report 93-549 (Exhibit 64): "Just how effective a limitation on crisis action this makes of the court is hard to say. In light of the recent war, the court today would seem to be a fairly harmless observer of the emergency activities of the President and Congress. It is highly unlikely that the separation of powers and the 10th Amendment will be called upon again to hamstring the efforts of the government to deal resolutely with a serious national emergency." So much for our Constitutional system of checks and balances.And from that same Senate Report, in the section entitled,"Emergency Administration", a continuation of Exhibit64: "Organizationally, in dealing with the depression, it was Roosevelt's general policy to assign new, emergency functions to newly created agencies, rather than to already existing departments." Thus, thousands of "temporary" emergency agencies,are now sitting out there with emergency functions to rule us inall cases whatsoever. Finally, let us look briefly at the courts, specifically withregard to the question of "booty". The followingdefinition of the term, "prize" is to be found inBouvier's Law Dictionary (Exhibit 65): "Goods taken on land from a public enemy are called booty; and the distinction between a prize and booty consists in this, that the former is taken at sea and the latter on land." This significance of the distinction between these two termsis critical, a fact which will become quite clear shortly. Let us now remember that "Congress shall have thepower to make rules on all captures on the land and thewater." To reiterate, captures on the land are booty,and captures on the water are prize. Now, the Constitution says that Congress shall have the powerto provide and maintain a navy, even during peacetime. It alsosays that Congress shall have the power to raise and support anarmy, but no appropriations of money for that purpose shall befor greater than two years. Here we can see that an army is not apermanent standing body, because, in times of peace, armies wereheld by the sovereign states as militia. So the United States hada navy during peacetime, but no standing army; we had instead theindividual state militias. Consequently, the federal government had a standing prizecourt, due to the fact that it had a standing navy, whether intimes of peace or war. But in times of peace, there could be nofederal police power over the continental United States, becausethere was to be no army. From the report The Law of Civil Government in TerritorySubject to Military Occupation by Military Forces of the UnitedStates, published by order of the Secretary of War in 1902,under the heading entitled The Confiscation of Private Propertyof Enemies in War (Exhibit 66), comes the following quote: "4. Should the President desire to utilize the services of the Federal courts of the United States in promoting this purpose or military undertaking, since these courts derive their jurisdiction from Congress and do not constitute a part of the military establishment, they must secure from Congress the necessary action to confer such jurisdiction upon said courts." This means that, if the government is going to confiscateproperty within the continental United States on the land(booty), it must obtain statutory authority. In this same section (Exhibit 66), we find the followingwords: "5. The laws and usage's of war make a distinction between enemies' property captured on the sea and property captured on land. The jurisdiction of the courts of the United States over property captured at sea is held not to attach to property captured on land in the absence of Congressional action." There is no standing prize court over the land. Once war isdeclared, Congress must give jurisdiction to particular courtsover captures on the land by positive Congressional action. Tocontinue with (Exhibit 66): "The right of confiscation is a sovereign right. In times of peace, the exercise of this right is limited and controlled by the domestic Constitution and institutions of the government. In times of war, when the right is exercised against enemies' property as a war measure, such right becomes a belligerent right, and as such is not subject to the restrictions imposed by domestic institutions, but is regulated and controlled by the laws and usage's of war." So we see that our government can operate in two capacities:(a) in its sovereign peacetime capacity, with the limitationsplaced upon it by the Constitution and restrictions placed uponit by We, the People, or (b) in a wartime capacity, where it mayoperate in its belligerent capacity governed not by theConstitution, but only by the laws of war. In Section 17 of the Act of October 6, 1917, the Trading Withthe Enemy Act (Exhibit 67): "That the district courts of the United States are hereby given jurisdiction to make and enter all such rules as to notice and otherwise; and all such orders and decrees; and to issue such process as may be necessary and proper in the premises to enforce the provisions of this act." Here we have Congress conferring upon the district courts ofthe United States the booty jurisdiction, the jurisdiction overenemy property within the continental United States. And at thetime of the original, unamended, Trading with the Enemy Act, wewere indeed at war, a World war, and so booty jurisdiction overenemies' property in the courts was appropriate. At that time,remember, we were not yet declared the enemy. We were excludedfrom the provisions of the original act. In 1934 Congress passed an Act merging equity and lawabolishing common law. This Act, known as the Federal Rules ofCivil Procedures Act, was not to come into effect until 6 monthsafter the letter of transmittal from the Supreme Court toCongress. The Supreme Court refused transmittal and thetransmittal did not occur until Franklin D. Roosevelt stacked theSupreme Court in 1938 (Exhibits 67(a) and (b)). But on March the 9th of 1933, the American people weredeclared to be the public enemy under the amended version of theTrading With the Enemy Act. What jurisdiction were We, thePeople, then placed under? We were now the booty jurisdictiongiven to the district courts by Congress. It was no longer be necessary, or of any value at all, tobring the Constitution of the United States with us upon enteringa courtroom, for that court was no longer a court of common law,but a tribunal under wartime booty jurisdiction. Take a look atthe American flag in most American courtrooms. The gold fringearound our flag designates Admiralty jurisdiction. Executive Order No. 11677 issued by President Richard M.Nixon August 1, 1972 (Exhibit 68) states: "Continuing the Regulation of Exports; By virtue of the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including Section 5 (b) of the Act of October 6, 1917, as amended (12 U. S. C. 95a), and in view of the continued existence of the national emergencies..." Later, in the same Executive Order (Exhibit 69), we find thefollowing: "...under the authority vested in me as President of the United States by Section 5(b) of the Act of October 6, 1917, as amended (12 U. S. C. 95a)..." Section 5(b) certainly seems to be an one-sided support forPresidential authority, doesn't it? Surely the reason for thiscan be found by referring back to Exhibit 49, the words of Mr.Katzenbach in Senate Report 93-549: "My recollection is that almost every executive order ever issued straddles on several grounds, but it almost always includes the Trading With the Enemy Act because the language of that act is so broad, it would justify almost anything." The question here, and it should be a question of graveconcern to every American, is what type of acts can "almostanything" cover? What has been, and is being, done, by ourgovernment under the cloak of authority conferred by Section 5(b)? By now, I think we are beginning to know. Has the termination of the national emergency ever beenconsidered? In Public Law 94412, September 14, 1976 (Exhibit 70),we find that Congress had finally finished their exhaustive studyon the national emergencies, and the words of their findings werethat they would terminate the existing national emergencies. Weshould be able to heave a sigh of relief at this decision, forwith the termination of the national emergencies will come thecorresponding termination of extraordinary Presidential power,won't it? But yet we have learned two difficult lessons: that weare still in the national emergency, and that power, oncegrasped, is difficult to let go. And so now it should come as nosurprise when we read, in the last section of the Act, Section502 (Exhibit 71), the following words: "(a): The provisions of this act shall not apply to the following provisions of law, the powers and authorities conferred thereby and actions taken thereunder (1) Section 5(b) of the Act of October 6,1917, as amended (12 U. S. C. 95a; 50 U. S. C. App. 5b)" The bleak reality is, the situation has not changed at all. The alarming situation in which We, the People, findourselves today causes us to think back to a time over twohundred years ago in our nation's history when our forefatherswere also laboring under the burden of governmental usurpation ofindividual rights. Their response, written in 1774, two yearsbefore the signing of the Declaration of Independence, to theattempts of Great Britain to retain extraordinary powers it hadheld during a time of war became known as the "Declarationof Rights" (Exhibit 72). And in that document, we find thesewords: "Whereas, since the close of the last war, the British Parliament, claiming a power of right to bind the people of America, by statute, in all cases whatsoever, hath in some acts expressly imposed taxes on them. and in others, under various pretenses, but in fact for the purpose of raising a revenue, hath imposed rates and duties payable in these colonies established a board of commissioners, with unconstitutional powers, and extended the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty, not only for collecting the said duties, but for the trial of causes merely arising within the body of a county." We can see now that we have come full circle to the situationwhich existed in 1774, but with one crucial difference. In 1774,Americans were protesting against a colonial power which soughtto bind and control its colony by wartime powers in a time ofpeace. In 1994, it is our own government which has sought,successfully to date, to bind its own people by the same subtle,insidious method. Article 3, Section 3, of our Constitution states: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court." Is the Act of March 9, 1933, treason? That would be for thecommon law courts to decide. At this point in our nation'shistory, the point is moot, for common law, and indeed theConstitution itself, do not operate or exist at present. Whethergovernmental acts of theft of the nation's money, the citizens'property, and American liberty as an ideal and a reality whichhave occurred since 1933 is treason against the people of theUnited States, as the term is defined by the Constitution of theUnited States cannot even be determined or argued in the legalsense until the Constitution itself is reestablished. For ourpart, however, we firmly believe that, "by their fruits yeshall know them", and on that authority we rest our case. CONCLUSION As you have just witnessed, the UnitedStates of America continues to exist in a governmentally ordainedstate of national emergency. Under such a state of emergency, ourConstitution has been set aside, ostensibly for the public good,until the emergency is canceled. But, as experience painfully shows, it has not been to thepublic's good that our government has used its unrestrictedpower, unhampered by the Constitution's restraining force. Thegovernmental edicts and actions over the past six decades haveled us to the desperate state in which we find ourselves today.Besieged on every side, corroding from within, frightened and indespair, we as a nation are being torn asunder. There is, a national emergency today, one of life and deathproportions, but it is not the emergency used by our governmentto continue its abuse of power. It is this very abuse, thisunbridled rape of the American spirit, that is the crux of theemergency we are in today. But this true emergency cannot becured by setting aside the Constitution; no, it can only becontrolled by returning to the laws of God and Country which havebeen stolen from us by those in whom we placed our trust toprotect the national interest. We are a nation whose government is based upon those immortalwords, "a government of the people, by the people, for thepeople". One has only to walk down the highways and bywaysof this great land to know all too well that this is not agovernment of the people or for the people. Actions speak louderthan words, and the actions taken over the past decades haveresulted in an unparalleled decline of American economic andpolitical power, and a weakening of American values and spirit. This is not a crisis in which the taking up of arms is theanswer. No, this is a situation in which we firmly believe thatthe pen will be mightier than the sword. That a state ofemergency exists cannot be disputed. That the emergency is onewhich should concern every American alive cannot be denied. Thatwe must stand together, laying aside our individual differences,to fight the common foe, is of vital importance, for the time toact is now. But this is not a battle of swords, but of knowledge,for only when the deception is exposed to the light of day canthe healing process begin. Truth stands tall in the light of day, and it is the truth webring to you today. Let it be known and understood that it is ourintention to make this information available to every concernedAmerican who desires to know the true State of the Union. This isan undertaking of immense proportions, but we have dedicatedourselves to bringing this information to the light of day, andwith the help of "We, the People", we will besuccessful in our efforts. Every American who is thankful for the opportunity to callthemselves American must also accept the responsibility thatcomes with that title. We the People have not only a right, but aresponsibility to each other and to those who have gone before usto learn what our government is doing, and to judge whetheractions taken benefit the people who will bear the costs. We havebeen in the dark long enough, content to rest on our past gloriesand let the government take its course. In a way, we have beenlike children, trusting in our parents to act in our bestinterest. But as we have too frequently seen in the nightly news,not all parents have their children's best interest at heart. The time has come for us to take off our blinders and acceptreality, for the time of national reckoning has arrived. Themajority of our elected and appointed officials are no moreresponsible for the current state of affairs than are we. Thestrings are being manipulated at far higher levels than thepositions most officials occupy. They are working with littleknowledge or authority, trying to control problems far biggerthan even they realize. Their programs and actions may seek tocure the symptoms, but the time has now come to attack thedisease. They are no more guilty than we are, nor will they beany more protected when the nation collapses on us all. If we blame them for this national emergency, we must alsotruly blame ourselves, for it is "We the People" towhom this nation was given and whose duty it was to keep awatchful eye on those who direct the sails of the ship of state.We have, however, fallen asleep, and while we were dreaming theAmerican dream, a band of pirates stole the Constitution and putour people into slavery. And since that terrible day when our Constitution was castaside, not one President or Congress, nor one Supreme Courtjustice has been able or willing to return it to its rightfulowners. Given the current state of the union, there is no reasonto expect this situation to change unless we ourselves cause itto be so. Let us put the childish emotions of pity and self-deceptionaway, stand up, stand together and fight back. Now is the time tostop dreaming, and start the long work before us. Now is the timeto turn back to the principles and ideals on which this nationwas founded, the strong foundation from which our nationalidentity springs. When does tolerance become anarchy? When does protectionbecome slavery? When is enough enough? Now is when - here andnow. Now is the time to return to the laws set forth by God, andthrow off these chains of ignorance and bondage which grip ournation to the point of death. Let us return to the source, thestandard of excellence set for us long ago. Our message toCongress and all elected and appointed officials must be,"Let my people go!", for we are all laboring under asystem which will eventually crush us, regardless of ourreligion, our sex, or the color of our skin. We must let those at all levels of governmental authorityknow that we have learned of the deception which lies at the coreof our national malaise. We must tell them in no uncertain termsthat we will tolerate this great lie no longer, and we must putthem on notice that we expect them to resign if they have not thecourage and the resolve to help this nation in its hour of need. We have been fools long enough. No matter how long after thedate you read this report, start each and every week without failto give a copy of this information to at least one person youknow. We also ask you to write a letter to Congress telling themto "Let our People go", or you can use the form letteryou will find enclosed in the report. We must let our elected officials know that we expect them asservants of the people to help us reestablish law and order andrestore our national pride. They must, repeal proclamation 2039,2040, and Title 12 USC 95(a) and 95(b), thereby canceling theNational Emergency, and reestablish the Constitution of thisnation. Now is the time for excellence of action. We demand it andwill accept nothing less. This is our country, to protect anddefend, no matter the cost. To do nothing out of fear or apathyis exactly what those in power are hoping for, for it isignorance and apathy that the darkness likes best. We must not bea party to the darkness enveloping our nation any longer. We mustcome into the light, and give our every drop of blood, sweat andtears to bring our nation back with us. We must acknowledge that if we do nothing, if we are notwilling to act now and act boldly, without fear but with faithand a firm resolve, our freedom to act, at all may soon be takenaway altogether. New bills, new laws are being presented dallywhich will effectively serve to tighten the chains of bondagealready encircling this nation. My friends, we are not going into slavery, we are alreadythere. Make no mistake those in power are already tightening thechains, but they are doing so slowly, quietly and with greatcaution, for fear of awakening the slumbering lion which is thevoice of the American people. There is yet still time for us toslip loose the chains which bind us, and for us to bring aboutthe restoration of this nation. If we act, if we make our concerns known and shout out ourrefusal to accept the future which has been planned for us bythose who hold no allegiance to this great land of ours, we canyet demand and see come to pass the day when the state ofemergency is canceled and the Constitution is restored to herrightful place as the watchdog of those for whom absolute powercorrupts absolutely. If we repent of our ignorance and ourapathy, and return to the God-given laws on which this nation wasfounded, we may yet be free. We will continue to hold meetings and offer this informationuntil everyone in America has had an opportunity to hear it andwe have set our nation free. We will not tolerate less. We areAmericans and that means far more than most of us realize. If it first it seems you are working alone, do not give up,for as this information spreads across the land to the greatcities and small towns, you will find yourself in excellentcompany. You already are as only one, for behind you stand allthe heroes of our history who fought and died to keep this nationfree. Again, we must stress that we are not asking you to pick upguns; in fact, we implore you not to, no matter how angry thenews of this deception has made you. Turn your anger into asteely resolve, a fierce determination not to give up until thebattle has been won. We are not asking you for lots of money;that's their game, the "almighty dollar". It is thesubstitution of wealth and possessions for integrity and honorthat helped get us into this true state of emergency in which wefind ourselves now. We are not asking you for more time than youcan give, although we do ask you to give what time you can to getthis information out. What we ask from you is your commitment to stand with thosearound you to help us restore this nation to her rightful placein history, both that written and that yet to be told. AbrahamLincoln once said, "We the People are the rightful mastersof both Congress and the Courts - not to overthrow theConstitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert theConstitution". We must stand together now in this, ournational hour of need. As the United States Supreme Court oncesaid, "It is not the function of our government to keep thecitizen from falling into error; it is the function of thecitizen to keep the government from falling into error". Each individual, their attitudes and actions, forges theirown special link in the great chain of history. Now is the timeto add to that precious inheritance of honor and duty which haskept America alive because the choices we make and the actions wetake today are a part of history as well as our future. The vision for America has not died; the "land of thefree and the home of the brave" still exists. There is stilltime to turn the tide for this great land, but we must jointogether to make it happen. We have a debt of honor to the pastand the future, a call to glory to rescue out homeland from thehands of those who would see her fall. We cannot, we must notfail.

III.	Whether the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration erred procedurally by refusing to accept the petition and ruling on its merit, simultaneously. STATUTES AND REGULATIONS 	The pertinent statues and regulations are set forth in an addendum bound with this brief. JURISDICTION 	The final order of the Drug Enforcement Administration was issued on October 23, 1992.  My Petition for Review was received by this Court on November 12, 1992, and assigned Docket No. 92-8041.  My Petition for Review was subsequently filed in forma pauperis by this Court on February 8, 1993, and reassigned Docket No. 93-1109 [App., p. 17].  This Court has jurisdiction of this petition for review of a final order of the Drug Enforcement Administration pursuant to 21 U.S.C. � 877. STATEMENT OF THE CASE 	1.	THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT. 	In 1970 Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), a comprehensive statute designed to rationalize federal control of dangerous drugs.  The Act contains five categories of controlled substances, designated as Schedules I through V and defined in terms of dangers and benefits.  21 U.S.C. � 812(b)(1)-(5).  The control mechanisms imposed on manufacture, acquisition, and distribution of substances listed under the Act vary according to the schedule in which the substance is contained.  Substances in Schedules I & II are subject to the most severe restrictions, and substances in Schedule V are subject to the least severe restrictions.  In drafting the CSA Congress placed marijuana in Schedule I, one of the two classifications that provides for the most severe restrictions. 	Recognizing that the results of continuous research might cast doubt on the wisdom of initial classification assignments, Congress created a procedure by which changes in scheduling could be effected.  Pursuant to Section 201(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. � 811(a), the Attorney General "may, by rule," add a substance to a schedule, transfer it between schedules, or remove it from the schedules.  A reclassification rule promulgated under this section must be made on the record after opportunity for hearing, in accordance with the rulemaking procedures prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. ch. 5, subch. II.  Section 201(a) further provides that rescheduling proceedings may be initiated by the Attorney General on his [or her] own motion, at the request of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), or, as in the present case, on petition of any interested party. 	Section 501(a) of the CSA, 21 U.S.C. � 871(a), authorizes the Attorney General to "delegate any of his functions under this subchapter to any officer or employee of the Department of Justice."  The functions vested in the Attorney General by the CSA have been delegated to the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) pursuant to 28 C.F.R. �� 0.100(b) & 0.132(d) (1992). 	DEA's Acting Administrator must share his [or her] decision-making function under the Act with the Secretary of HHS.  Section 201(b), 21 U.S.C. � 811(b), provides that, prior to commencement of reclassification rulemaking proceedings, the Attorney General must "request from the Secretary a scientific and medical evaluation, and his [or her] recommendations, as to whether such drug or other substance should be so controlled or removed as a controlled substance."  The evaluation prepared by the Secretary must address the scientific and medical factors enumerated in Section 201(c), 21 U.S.C. � 811(c); these factors relate to the effects of the drug and its abuse potential.  Pursuant to Section 201(b), the Secretary's recommendations "shall be binding on the Attorney General as to such scientific and medical matters, and if the Secretary recommends that a drug or other substance not be controlled, the Attorney General shall not control the drug or other substance." 	Section 201(d) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. � 811(d), contains a limited exception to the referral procedures detailed in Section 201(b)-(c).  Subsection (d)(1) provides: 	If control is required by United States obligations under international treaties, conventions, or protocols in effect on October 27, 1970, the Attorney General shall issue an order controlling such drug under the schedule he [or she] deems most appropriate to carry out such obligations, without regard to the findings required by subsection (a) of this section or section 812(b) of this title and without regard to the procedures prescribed by sections (a) and (b) of this section. 	2.	THE SINGLE CONVENTION ON NARCOTIC DRUGS. 	In 1948, in order to simplify existing treaties and international administrative machinery, members of the United Nations undertook codification of a single convention on international narcotics control.  In 1961, after three preliminary drafts, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, 18 U.S.T. 1407 (1967), 520 U.N.T.S. 204 (1964), was opened for signature.  The United States ratified the Single Convention in 1967 -- three years prior to enactment of the CSA. 	Like the CSA, the Single Convention establishes several classifications or "schedules" of substances, to which varying regimes of control attach.  Schedule I of the Single Convention contains substances considered to carry a relatively high abuse liability; included in this category are heroin, methadone, opium, coca leaf, and cocaine.  Schedule II and III contain those substances regarded as less susceptible to abuse.  Finally, Schedule IV of the Single Convention -- unlike CSA schedule IV -- embraces certain Schedule I substances, such as heroin, the abuse liability of which is not offset by substantial therapeutic advantages.  Marijuana (cannabis) is listed in Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention, however, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) is not listed in the schedules of the Single Convention. 	3.	THE CONVENTION ON PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES. 	In 1978 Congress enacted the Psychotropic Substances Act (PSA), Pub. L. 95-633, Nov. 10, 1978, 92 Stat. 2768, to coincide with the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, signed at Vienna, Austria on February 21, 1971 [The Convention entered into force in respect to the United States on July 15, 1980], 1019 U.N.T.S. 175 (1976), Treaty No. 14,596.  Section 101 of the PSA, 21 U.S.C. � 801a, provides, in part: 	The United States has joined with other countries in executing an international treaty, entitled the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and signed at Vienna, Austria, on February 21, 1971, which is designed to establish suitable controls over the manufacture, distribution, transfer, and use of certain psychotropic substances. 	The Convention on Psychotropic Substances contains four categories of controlled substances, designated as Schedules I through IV and defined in terms of dangers and benefits.  The international control mechanisms imposed on manufacture, acquisition, and distribution of substances listed under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances vary according to the schedule in which the substance is contained.  Substances in Schedule I are subject to the most severe restrictions, and substances in Schedule IV are subject to the least severe restrictions. 	In drafting the Convention on Psychotropic Substances the parties placed tetrahydrocannabinols in Schedule I, the classification that provides for the most severe restrictions.  However, "At its 1,045th meeting, on April 29, 1991, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, in accordance with article 2, paragraphs 5 and 6, of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, decided, by a vote of 33 in favor and 5 against, with no abstentions, that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (also referred to as delta-9-THC) and its stereochemical variants should be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of that Convention."  Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 1991, Supplement No. 4 (E/1991/24, Supp. No. 4), pp. 23 and 98 [App., p. 10].  The five States voting against the decision were Colombia, Ivory Coast, Egypt, France and Pakistan.  Id. 	4.	HISTORY OF THIS CASE. 	There are currently two other petitions for review, seeking to have marijuana moved from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA, now pending before this Court.  Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 92-1168, and Drug Policy Foundation v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 92-1179.  The Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT) and the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) allege that marijuana has accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, 21 U.S.C. � 812(b)(2)(B), and seek rescheduling on that basis.  They are seeking review of a final order of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued on March 26, 1992, finding that marijuana does not have accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.  57 Fed. Reg. 10,499. 	The scheduling of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. � 812, as well as under international obligations, has been under consideration by this Court on several prior occasions.  NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974); NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977); and, ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  The issue is still pending before this Court in ACT v. DEA, No. 92-1168, and DPF v. DEA, No. 92-1179. 	ACT and DPF inherited their case from NORML which filed a petition to have marijuana removed from the CSA with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) on May 18, 1972.  The BNDD refused to accept the petition for filing, and this Court had to order the DEA to respond.  NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  Upon remand the DEA held that international treaty obligations required it to place marijuana in Schedule I of the CSA.  This Court then remanded the petition back to the DEA again, holding that marijuana can be placed in either Schedule I or Schedule II of the CSA without violating international treaty obligations, and requiring the DEA to hold hearings to determine in which of the two schedules, Schedule I or Schedule II, marijuana properly belongs.  NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735, 757 (D.C. Cir. 1977). 	In the final order for which ACT and DPF seek review, the Administrator listed five criteria for determining accepted medical use, and found that marijuana failed to satisfy all five criteria.  The Administrator said, "First, marijuana's chemistry is neither fully known, nor reproducible."  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,507.  The Administrator went on to explain why marijuana failed to satisfy the remaining four criteria, but these four will not be repeated here, because failure to satisfy the first criterion would almost certainly mean failure to satisfy the remaining four. 	After reading the Administrator's final ruling of March 26, 1992, I sent a letter to the Administrator on July 21, 1992, asking why coca and opium poppy plants are scheduled in Schedule II of the CSA, since both of these plants are subject to the same variances in chemistry as the marijuana plant (neither are reproducible in standardized dosages) [App., p. 1]. 	On August 17, 1992, the Administrator replied by stating that "these plant materials [coca and opium poppy] have historically been recognized as the source for a variety of accepted and useful medications."  Letter from the Administrator, dated August 17, 1992 [App., p. 5].  The Administrator also stated that "the petition to reschedule marijuana did not involve the scheduling of any medically useful compound to be extracted from the plant material."  Id. 	Interpreting the Administrator's statements regarding scheduling of coca and opium poppy plants and scheduling of a medically useful compound extracted from marijuana as general rules, I then filed my own Petition to Reschedule Marijuana based on the fact that in 1986 dronabinol, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the principle psychoactive substance in the marijuana plant, was rescheduled to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act, and, therefore, marijuana must be moved into the same schedule as dronabinol [App., p. 2].  See Final Order of the Drug Enforcement Administration, May 13, 1986, 51 Fed. Reg. 17,476 (placing dronabinol in Schedule II). 	My petition was filed on September 11, 1992, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. � 811 and 21 C.F.R. � 1307.03, in the form prescribed by 21 C.F.R. � 1308.44(b). 	 The Administrator responded to my petition by stating, "In a final rule published on May 13, 1986, then Administrator John C. Lawn placed a very specific substance, synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules, in Schedule II.  Administrator Lawn's action did not involve the rescheduling of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol itself, nor did it include any form of dronabinol other than the synthetic."  Final rule of the Administrator, October 23, 1992 [App., p. 7]. 	The Administrator stated further, "Since I am not accepting your petition on the grounds that dronabinol is a wholly synthetic substance, not obtained from marijuana, it is unnecessary for me to consider the broader question of whether the rescheduling of marijuana would be appropriate if accepted medications were indeed obtained from that source."

Delta-9-THC is only one substance, not two.  In  1986, Health and Human Services (HHS) recognized that synthetic  delta-9-THC is the same as its naturally occurring twin.  The DEA  must accept this scientific and medical findings of HHS.  	The DEA is trying to do something with delta-9-THC that it  doesn't do with any other drug, placing the synthetic drug in a  different schedule than its naturally occurring twin.  The DEA is  not authorized to make such distinctions.  The DEA must defer to  HHS for scientific and medical findings.  	Neither can the DEA rely on FDA marketing approval of   Marinol, synthetic dronabinol "in sesame oil and encapsulated in  soft gelatin capsules," as a reason for keeping all other forms  of delta-9-THC in Schedule I.  Sesame oil and gelatin capsules  are simply foods, which are not subject to control under the CSA.   It is delta-9-THC which is in Schedule II, not just the FDA  approved product Marinol.  	In 1986, when marijuana became the source of an accepted and  useful medication, delta-9-THC, it should have been transferred  into the same schedule of the CSA, Schedule II, as the other  plants, coca and opium, which are the sources of the accepted and  useful medications cocaine and morphine.  ARGUMENT  	1.	SYNTHETIC AND NATURAL DELTA-9-THC ARE THE SAME.  	The Administrator's decision that synthetic delta-9-THC in  sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules, but not  delta-9-THC itself, has been rescheduled, and that delta-9-THC is  not obtained from marijuana, is beyond the scope of the DEA's  authority.  	This Court must review the DEA's decision to schedule delta- 9-THC simultaneously in two different schedules in light of the  guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court in Chevron U.S.A., Inc.  v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104  S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).  In Chevron, the Court  explained that a reviewing court must employ a two-step analysis  that focuses initially on the intentions of Congress:  First, always, is the question whether Congress had directly  spoken to the precise question at issue.  If the intent of  Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court,  as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously  expressed intent of Congress.  Id. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781 (emphasis supplied).  In the  absence of congressional intent, however, the court must proceed  to a second inquiry:  If ... the court determines Congress has not directly addressed  the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose  its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the  absence of an administrative interpretation.  Rather, if the  statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific  issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer  is based on a permissible construction of the statute.  Id. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82 (footnote omitted; emphasis  supplied).  	In enacting the CSA, "Members of the House repeatedly stated  that the Department of Justice should make judgments based on law  enforcement considerations, while HEW should have the final say  with respect to medical and scientific determinations."  NORML v.  DEA, 559 F.2d at 746.  The Department of Justice "may not  schedule a substance under the CSA without first obtaining the  recommendation of the FDA, through its parent agency, HHS, 21  U.S.C. � 811(b), and providing an 'opportunity for a hearing  pursuant to rulemaking procedures prescribed by [the  Administrative Procedures Act].' 21 U.S.C. � 811(a)."  Grinspoon  v. DEA, 828 F.2d 881, 890 (1st Cir. 1987).  "This request is  filed with the Commissioner of FDA, who has the responsibility  for coordination of activities within [HHS]."  NORML v. DEA, 559  F.2d at 749 n.59.  	As this Court stated in 1977:  	Our interpretation of Section 201(d) ensures proper  allocation of decisionmaking responsibility between the Attorney  General and the Secretary of HEW, in accordance with their  respective spheres of expertise.  Section 201(d) directs the  Attorney General, as an initial matter, to make a legal judgment  as to controls necessitated by international commitments.  He  then establishes a minimum schedule or level of control below  which placement of the substance may not fall.  Determination of  a minimum schedule ensures that the Secretary's recommendation,  which ordinarily would be binding as to medical and scientific  findings, does not cause a substance to be scheduled in violation  of treaty obligations.  However, once that minimum schedule is  established by the Attorney General, the decision whether to  impose controls more restrictive than required by treaty  implicates the same medical and scientific considerations as do  scheduling decisions regarding those few substances not  controlled by treaty.  The Secretary of HEW is manifestly more  competent to make these nonlegal evaluations and recommendations.  NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d at 747.  	Although the FDA has approved a New Drug Application (NDA)  for Marinol, synthetic delta-9-THC in sesame oil and encapsulated  in soft gelatin capsules, this does not qualify as a  recommendation to the DEA for purposes of scheduling.  FDA has  never recommended that delta-9-THC remain in Schedule I while  Marinol is in Schedule II, nor has it said that synthetic delta- 9-THC is better than delta-9-THC itself.  [App., p. 15]  	This is not the first time the DEA has tried to follow  verbatim text of FDA marketing approval for a New Drug  Application (NDA) in making a scheduling determination.  As this  Court stated in 1991:  The First Circuit in Grinspoon v. Drug Enforcement  Administration, 828 F.2d 881, 891-92 (1st Cir. 1987), upon which  petitioners rely, had held that earlier criteria the  Administrator had employed to define "currently accepted medical  use" were contrary to the statute because they were a carbon copy  of those used by the FDA in licensing new drugs.  The present  criteria, it is argued, duplicate a number of those original  criteria.  But the criteria challenged in Grinspoon included  several elements, such as the availability of patent information  or FDA-required labeling, which were necessary only to market the  drug in interstate commerce.  These criteria are clearly relevant  to the FDA's mission, but not the DEA's, see Grinspoon, 828 F.2d  at 887.  The First Circuit never suggested the DEA Administrator  was foreclosed from incorporating and relying on those standards  employed by the FDA that are relevant to the pharmaceutical  qualities of the drug.  The court merely held that while FDA  approval is sufficient to establish the existence of an accepted  medical use, the converse in not true -- that absent FDA  approval, commonly accepted medical use cannot be proven.  Id. at  890.  Nor can we conceive of a reason the Administrator should be  barred from employing notions developed by a sister agency  insofar as those notions serve the missions of both agencies.  ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d at 939-40.    	In 1987, the First Circuit said,   [W]e find no necessary linkage between failure to obtain FDA  interstate marketing approval and a determination that the  substance in question is unsafe and has no medical use.  Indeed,  the FDCA does not even mention the term 'medical use.'  In short,  it is plainly possible that a substance may fail to obtain  interstate marketing approval even if it has an accepted medical  use.    Grinspoon, 828 F.2d at  887.  "Thus, it is possible that a  substance may have both an accepted medical use and safety for  use under medical supervision, even though no one has deemed it  necessary to seek approval for interstate marketing."  Id.  	A synthetic drug is the same as its naturally occurring  twin, by definition.  Under this Court's order of June 4, 1982,  in NORML v. DEA, No. 79-1660, the Department of Health and Human  Services (DHHS) was required to submit reports on the status of  its recommendations for the scheduling of THC and marijuana  plants.  In reference to the DEA's rescheduling order of May 13,  1986 (51 Fed. Reg. 17,476) the DHHS stated that, "Dronabinol is  structurally the same as THC."  [App., p. 8]  	The Administrator says that marijuana is not the source of  an accepted and useful medication, but there is considerable  evidence to the contrary.  In his final order on NORML's  petition, the Administrator adopted in their entirety the  findings of the former Administrator.  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,507.   The former Administrator, in his final order on NORML's petition,   stated, "There is no difference in the pharmacological effect  between the THC isolated from cannabis and the synthetically  produced THC which is now marketed in the United States."  54  Fed. Reg. at 53,774.  As this Court noted in 1991, "The First  Circuit never suggested the DEA Administrator was foreclosed from  incorporating and relying on those standards employed by the FDA  that are relevant to the pharmaceutical qualities of the drug."   ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d at 939.  The former Administrator, in  agreement with HHS, recognized that the pharmaceutical qualities  of synthetic delta-9-THC are the same as those of delta-9-THC  itself.   	In his final order on NORML's petition, the Administrator  stated, "There are scientific studies showing pure THC (Delta-9- Tetrahydrocannabinol), one of the many chemicals found in  marijuana, has some effect in controlling nausea and vomiting.   Pure THC is pharmaceutically made in clean capsule form, called  Marinol, and is available for use by the medical community.  More  information on Marinol can be found in the 'Physicians' Desk  Reference,' available in most libraries."  57 Fed. Reg. at  10,500.  The 1993 Physician's Desk Reference describes Marinol as  follows: "Dronabinol, commonly known as delta-9-THC, is one of  the major active substances in marijuana."  Id. at p. 2076.  	Synthetic delta-9-THC is an exact duplicate of its naturally  occurring twin, delta-9-THC.  "Following the isolation and  characterization of delta-9-THC as the major active component of  marijuana by Mechoulam and colleagues, a technique for producing  synthetic material was developed."

Chem. Soc. 93:217-224;  1971)  (Petrzilka, T.; Haefliger, W.; Sikemeier, C. Synthesis of  hashish components. Part 4. Helv. Chim. Acta 52:1102-1134; 1969).  	In a letter dated July 13, 1993, the FDA states that, "A  synthetic drug ... is identical in all respects to the product  isolated from a plant source.  Such a product can be marketed  under the same name....  A synthetic drug would be in the same  schedule as its naturally occurring twin."  Letter from the FDA,  July 13, 1993 [App., p. 16].  	Clearly, delta-9-THC itself was approved for medical use by  the FDA when it approved Marinol.  "[T]he [DEA] does not have the  authority to impose Schedule I controls on a drug which has been  approved by the [FDA] for medical use."  Grinspoon, 828 F.2d at  890 (citing, 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 540, 543).  	When the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations  moved delta-9-THC from Schedule I to Schedule II of the  Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it made no distinction  between synthetic delta-9-THC and delta-9-THC itself.  	In 1986, then Administrator John C. Lawn improperly took  upon himself the authority to define synthetic delta-9-THC and  delta-9-THC itself as two separate substances under the CSA.  	In the course of rescheduling synthetic dronabinol to  Schedule II of the CSA, the original proposal submitted by the  DEA defined it as "the principle psychoactive substance in  Cannabis sativa L., marijuana," 50 Fed. Reg. 42,185 (October 18,  1985) (proposed rule), but this definition was changed to "the  synthetic equivalent of the isomer of delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is the principle psychoactive  substance in Cannabis sativa L., marijuana" in the final rule, 51  Fed. Reg. 17,476 (May 13, 1986) (final rule).  Whether this  change was accidental or intentional is hard to discern, but it  clearly exceeded the Administrator's authority.  	Although it is true that "[a]ppellate courts have neither  the expertise nor the resources to evaluate complex scientific  claims," this is not a complex scientific claim.  Grinspoon, 828  F.2d at 896 (citing, Thompson Medical Co. v. FTC, 791 F.2d 189,  196 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).  A synthetic drug must be the same as the  naturally occurring twin before it can receive FDA marketing  approval for distribution in interstate commerce.  As a matter of  law, delta-9-THC itself was rescheduled to Schedule II of the CSA  at the same time as synthetic delta-9-THC, and this Court should  so find.  	2.	MARIJUANA IS IN SAME SCHEDULE AS DELTA-9-THC.  	As this Court noted in 1991, "As is apparent, one salient  concept distinguishing the two schedules is whether a drug has  'no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United  States.'"  ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d at 938.  "However, placement in  Schedule I does not appear to flow inevitably from lack of  currently accepted medical use."  NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d at 748.   "The legislative history of the CSA indicates that medical use is  but one factor to be considered, and by no means the most  important one."  Id.  	Moreover, DEA's own scheduling practices support the  conclusion that substances lacking medical usefulness need not  always be placed in Schedule I.  At the hearing before ALJ Parker  DEA's Chief Counsel, Donald Miller, testified that several  substances listed in CSA Schedule II, including poppy straw, have  no currently accepted medical use.  Tr. at 473-474, 488.  He  further acknowledged that marihuana could be rescheduled to  Schedule II without a currently accepted medical use.  Tr. at  487-488.  Neither party offered any contrary evidence.    Id.  	The explanation given by the Administrator for the placement  of coca and opium poppy plants in Schedule II is that coca and  opium poppy plants have been "recognized as the source for a  variety of accepted and useful medications."  Petition, Exhibit  A.  According to this explanation, marijuana should be  transferred to Schedule II, because it has now become the source  of an accepted and useful medication, after its initial placement  in Schedule I of the CSA in 1970.  	In the final order under review in this case, the  Administrator stated that, "Since I am not accepting your  petition on the grounds that dronabinol is a wholly synthetic  substance, not obtained from marijuana, it is unnecessary for me  to consider the broader question of whether the rescheduling of  marijuana would be appropriate if accepted medications were  indeed obtained from that source."  Final Order, October 23,  1992.  	Again, the standard of review is that of Chevron, 467 U.S.  837.  It is apparent from reading the CSA that Congress intended  to include coca and opium poppy plants in Schedule II because  useful medications were being derived from these plant sources  when the CSA was created in 1970.  The apparent distinction that  Congress made between marijuana and coca and opium poppy plants  when the schedules were created in 1970 was that coca and opium  poppy plants were the sources of useful and accepted medications,  while marijuana was not.  The Administrator has provided his  interpretation of the statute by stating "Congress was very much  aware that these plant materials [coca and opium poppy] have  historically been recognized as the source for a variety of  accepted and useful medications."  Petition, Exhibit A.  	The Administrator's interpretation reinforces what is  apparent from the face of the statute, that plants which are the  source of accepted and useful medications cannot be placed in a  schedule higher than Schedule II.  For example, peyote, a plant  which contains the Schedule I drug mescaline, is also in Schedule  I, while opium poppy, a plant which contains the Schedule II drug  morphine, is in Schedule II.  	To quote the Administrator, "Those who insist marijuana has  medical uses would serve society better by promoting or  sponsoring more legitimate scientific research, rather than  throwing their time, money and rhetoric into lobbying, public  relations campaigns and perennial litigation."  57 Fed. Reg. at  10,503.  Since marijuana belongs in Schedule II of the CSA, the  DEA should not even be involved in the debate on marijuana's  medical use.  Congress intended the FDA to handle this debate.   Scientific research will be promoted by treating marijuana  exactly the same as coca and opium poppy plants, the DEA will be  removed from the debate on marijuana's medical use, clearing the  way for the FDA to take over, and needless perennial litigation  will cease.  	Since accessibility for research purposes is exactly the  same under either Schedule I or Schedule II, there is no reason  for the DEA not to move marijuana into Schedule II, since DEA's  only legitimate concern under the CSA is drug diversion.   "Congress was particularly concerned with the diversion of drugs  from legitimate channels to illegitimate channels."  United  States v. Moore, 423 U.S. 122, 135 (1972).  	3.	THE PETITION MUST BE ACCEPTED BEFORE IT IS DENIED.  	Another question presented is whether the Administrator  followed proper procedure in refusing to accept the petition by  denying the petition on its merits.  Pursuant to 21 C.F.R. �  1308.44(c):  	Within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of a  petition, the Administrator shall notify the petitioner of his  acceptance or nonacceptance of the petition, and if not accepted,  the reason therefor.  The Administrator need not accept a  petition for filing if any of the requirements prescribed in  paragraph (b) of this section is lacking or is not set forth so  as to be readily understood.  If the petitioner desires, he may  amend the petition to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of  this section.  If accepted for filing, a petition may be denied  by the Administrator within a reasonable period of time  thereafter if he finds the grounds upon which the petitioner  relies are not sufficient to justify the initiation of  proceedings.  The Administrator's streamlined procedure in this case appears to  be in conflict with DEA regulations.  This Court dealt with a  similar procedural question in 1974:   [T]he rejection of a filing is a "peremptory" response "which  classically is used not to dispose of a matter on the merits but  rather as a technique for calling on the filing party to put its  papers in proper form and order.  Its use is not limited to  defects of form.  It may be used by an agency where the filing is  so patently a nullity as a matter of substantive law, that  administrative efficiency and justice are furthered by obviating  any docket at the threshold rather than opening a futile docket."   146 U.S.App.D.C. at 299, 450 F.2d at 1346.  NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d at 659 n.10.  My petition was not  such a patent nullity, as matter of law, to justify either  refusal to accept the petition for filing, or denial of the  petition on its merits.  I was denied the opportunity to present  additional evidence to support my petition, and I am objecting to  this streamlined approach.  CONCLUSION    	Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request this Court to  rule that: (1) as a matter of law, delta-9-THC itself is in  Schedule II of the CSA; (2) as a matter of law, marijuana is in  Schedule II of the CSA; and (3) such other or further relief be  granted as this Court may deem necessary under the circumstances.

STATUTES AND REGULATIONS     The pertinent statues and regulations are set forth in an addendum bound with this brief.                          JURISDICTION     The final order of the Drug Enforcement Administration was issued on May 16, 1994 [App., p. 17].  I received the final order by mail on May 19, 1994.  My Petition for Review, with attached Motion to Proceed in Forma Pauperis, was filed by this Court on June 17, 1994, and assigned Docket No. 94-8015.  My Motion to Proceed in Forma Pauperis was subsequently denied, and my Petition for Review was refiled by this Court on September 16,                               - 1 - 1994, and reassigned Docket No. 94-1605.  This Court has jurisdiction of this petition for review of a final order of the Drug Enforcement Administration pursuant to 21 U.S.C. � 877.                      STATEMENT OF THE CASE     1.   THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.     In 1970 Congress enacted the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), a comprehensive statute designed to rationalize federal control of dangerous drugs.  The Act contains five categories of controlled substances, designated as Schedules I through V and defined in terms of dangers and benefits.  21 U.S.C. � 812(b)(1)-(5).  The control mechanisms imposed on manufacture, acquisition, and distribution of substances listed under the Act vary according to the schedule in which the substance is contained.  Substances in Schedules I & II are subject to the most severe restrictions, and substances in Schedule V are subject to the least severe restrictions.  In drafting the CSA Congress placed marijuana in Schedule I, one of two classifications that provide for the most severe restrictions (the other is Schedule II).     Recognizing that the results of continuous research might cast doubt on the wisdom of initial classification assignments, Congress created a procedure by which changes in scheduling could be effected.  Pursuant to Section 201(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. � 811(a), the Attorney General "may, by rule," add a substance to a schedule, transfer it between schedules, or remove it from the schedules.  A reclassification rule promulgated under this section must be made on the record after opportunity for hearing,                               - 2 - in accordance with the rulemaking procedures prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. ch. 5, subch. II.  Section 201(a) further provides that rescheduling proceedings may be initiated by the Attorney General on his [or her] own motion, at the request of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), or, as in the present case, on petition of any interested party.     Section 501(a) of the CSA, 21 U.S.C. � 871(a), authorizes the Attorney General to "delegate any of his functions under this subchapter to any officer or employee of the Department of Justice."  The functions vested in the Attorney General by the CSA have been delegated to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) pursuant to 28 C.F.R. �� 0.100(b) & 0.132(d).     DEA's Acting Administrator must share his [or her] decision-making function under the Act with the Secretary of HHS.  Section 201(b), 21 U.S.C. � 811(b), provides that, prior to commencement of reclassification rulemaking proceedings, the Attorney General must "request from the Secretary a scientific and medical evaluation, and his [or her] recommendations, as to whether such drug or other substance should be so controlled or removed as a controlled substance."  The evaluation prepared by the Secretary must address the scientific and medical factors enumerated in Section 201(c), 21 U.S.C. � 811(c); these factors relate to the effects of the drug and its abuse potential.  Pursuant to Section 201(b), the Secretary's recommendations "shall be binding on the Attorney General as to such scientific and medical matters, and if the Secretary recommends that a drug or other substance not be                               - 3 - controlled, the Attorney General shall not control the drug or other substance."     Section 201(d) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. � 811(d), contains a limited exception to the referral procedures detailed in Section 201(b)-(c).  Subsection (d)(1) provides:          If control is required by United States obligations      under international treaties, conventions, or protocols in      effect on October 27, 1970, the Attorney General shall issue      an order controlling such drug under the schedule he [or      she] deems most appropriate to carry out such obligations,      without regard to the findings required by subsection (a) of      this section or section 812(b) of this title and without      regard to the procedures prescribed by sections (a) and (b)      of this section.     2.   THE SINGLE CONVENTION ON NARCOTIC DRUGS.     In 1948, in order to simplify existing treaties and international administrative machinery, members of the United Nations undertook codification of a single convention on international narcotics control.  In 1961, after three preliminary drafts, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, 18 U.S.T. 1407 (1967), 520 U.N.T.S. 204 (1964), was opened for signature.  The United States ratified the Single Convention in 1967 -- three years prior to enactment of the CSA.     Like the CSA, the Single Convention establishes several classifications or "schedules" of substances, to which varying regimes of control attach.  Schedule I of the Single Convention contains substances considered to carry a relatively high abuse liability; included in this category are heroin, methadone, opium, coca leaf, and cocaine.  Schedule II and III contain those                               - 4 - substances regarded as less susceptible to abuse.  Finally, Schedule IV of the Single Convention -- unlike CSA schedule IV -- embraces certain Schedule I substances, such as heroin, the abuse liability of which is not offset by substantial therapeutic advantages.  Marijuana (cannabis) is listed in Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention.  However, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) is not listed in the schedules of the Single Convention.     3.   THE CONVENTION ON PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES.     In 1978 Congress enacted the Psychotropic Substances Act (PSA), Pub. L. 95-633, Nov. 10, 1978, 92 Stat. 2768, to coincide with the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, signed at Vienna, Austria on February 21, 1971 [The Convention entered into force in respect to the United States on July 15, 1980], 1019 U.N.T.S. 175 (1976), Treaty No. 14,596.  Section 101 of the PSA, 21 U.S.C. � 801a, provides, in part:          The United States has joined with other countries in      executing an international treaty, entitled the Convention      on Psychotropic Substances and signed at Vienna, Austria, on      February 21, 1971, which is designed to establish suitable      controls over the manufacture, distribution, transfer, and      use of certain psychotropic substances.     The Convention on Psychotropic Substances contains four categories of controlled substances, designated as Schedules I through IV and defined in terms of dangers and benefits.  The international control mechanisms imposed on manufacture, acquisition, and distribution of substances listed under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances vary according to the                               - 5 - schedule in which the substance is contained.  Substances in Schedule I are subject to the most severe restrictions, and substances in Schedule IV are subject to the least severe restrictions.     In drafting the Convention on Psychotropic Substances the parties placed tetrahydrocannabinols in Schedule I, the classification that provides for the most severe restrictions.       However, "At its 1,045th meeting, on April 29, 1991, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, in accordance with article 2, paragraphs 5 and 6, of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, decided, by a vote of 33 in favor and 5 against, with no abstentions, that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (also referred to as delta-9-THC) and its stereochemical variants should be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of that Convention."  Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 1991, Supplement No. 4 (E/1991/24, Supp. No. 4), pp. 23 and 98 [App., p. 10].  The five States voting against the decision were Colombia, Ivory Coast, Egypt, France and Pakistan.  Id.     4.   HISTORY OF THIS CASE.     The scheduling of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. � 812, as well as under international obligations, has been considered by this Court on several prior occasions.  NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974); NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977); ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. Cir. 1991); and ACT v. DEA, 15 F.3d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1994).                             - 6 - All of these cases originated from one petition filed with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) on May 18, 1972.  NORML filed the petition seeking to have marijuana removed from the CSA.  The BNDD refused to accept the petition for filing, and this Court then ordered the DEA to accept the petition and respond.  NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  Upon remand the DEA held that international treaty obligations required it to place marijuana in Schedule I of the CSA.  This Court then remanded the petition back to the DEA again, holding that marijuana can be placed in either Schedule I or Schedule II of the CSA without violating international treaty obligations, and requiring the DEA to hold hearings to determine in which of the two schedules, Schedule I or Schedule II, marijuana properly belonged.  NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735, 757 (D.C. Cir. 1977).     As the issue became more narrowly focused, the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT) became the lead petitioner in the case.  The ACT, and the other parties seeking rescheduling, advanced the argument that marijuana has accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, 21 U.S.C. � 812(b)(2)(B), and sought rescheduling solely on that basis.  The DEA administrator again denied the petition, listing several criteria for determining accepted medical use which marijuana failed to meet, and this Court then remanded the case for clarification of the DEA administrator's final order.  ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  The DEA administrator clarified and affirmed his prior ruling in a subsequent final order, issued on March 26,                               - 7 - 1992, finding that marijuana does not have accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.  57 Fed. Reg. 10,499.  The ACT sought review of the March 26, 1992, final order, and this Court affirmed the final order of the DEA.  ACT v. DEA, 15 F.3d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1994).     In ACT v. DEA, 15 F.3d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1994), the Administrator listed five criteria for determining accepted medical use, and found that marijuana failed to satisfy all five criteria.  The Administrator said, "First, marijuana's chemistry is neither fully known, nor reproducible."  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,507.  The Administrator's findings that marijuana failed to satisfy the remaining four criteria are due to the failure to satisfy the first criterion, which would necessarily dictate failure to satisfy the remaining four.     After reading the Administrator's final ruling of March 26, 1992, 57 Fed. Reg. 10,499, I sent a letter to the Administrator on July 21, 1992 [App., p. 1], asking why coca and opium poppy plants are scheduled in Schedule II of the CSA, since both of these plants are subject to the same variances in chemistry as the marijuana plant and neither are reproducible in standardized dosages.     On August 17, 1992, the Administrator replied [App., p. 5] by stating that "these plant materials [coca and opium poppy] have historically been recognized as the source for a variety of accepted and useful medications."  The Administrator also stated that "the petition to reschedule marijuana did not involve the                               - 8 - scheduling of any medically useful compound to be extracted from the plant material."     Interpreting the Administrator's statements regarding the scheduling of coca and opium poppy plants as general rules of statutory construction, I then filed my own Petition to Reschedule Marijuana [App., p. 2] based on the fact dronabinol, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the principle psychoactive substance in the marijuana plant, was rescheduled to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act in 1986, and, therefore, because marijuana is the source of dronabinol, it must be moved into the same schedule as dronabinol.  See Final Order of the Drug Enforcement Administration, May 13, 1986, 51 Fed. Reg. 17,476 (placing dronabinol in Schedule II).     My petition was filed on September 11, 1992, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. � 811 and 21 C.F.R. � 1307.03, in the form prescribed by 21 C.F.R. � 1308.44(b).      In his final order of May 16, 1994, the Deputy Administrator responded to my petition [App., p. 23] by stating, "Only the pharmaceutical product was transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II, i.e., 'dronabinol (synthetic) in sesame oil and encapulated in a soft gelatin capsule in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug product.'  No rescheduling action was taken with regard to (-) delta-9-trans-THC, i.e., dronabinol, which remains in Schedule I of the CSA."     The Deputy Administrator further stated [App., p. 24], "Under the CSA, the regulation of chemicals and the plant material are distinct from each other.  The classification of                               - 9 - delta-9-THC has no bearing on the classification of marijuana.  Under the CSA, a proposed change in the schedule of either a tetrahydrocannabinol or the plant marijuana requires the Attorney General to proceed independently."  Id.                       SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT     By definition, a synthetic drug is the same as its natural occurring twin.  Dronabinol is only one substance, not two.  Synthesizing, adding sesame oil and encapsulating in soft gelatin capsules, while having significance to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing purposes, does not make dronabinol into another drug for scheduling purposes.  In 1986, Health and Human Services (HHS) recognized that synthetic delta-9-THC is the same as its naturally occurring twin [App., p. 8].  The DEA must accept the scientific and medical findings of HHS.     The DEA is trying to do something with delta-9-THC that it doesn't do with any other drug, placing the synthetic drug in a different schedule than its naturally occurring twin.  The DEA is not authorized to make such distinctions.  The DEA must defer to HHS for scientific and medical findings regarding the structure of a drug.     The DEA cannot rely on FDA marketing approval of  Marinol� (synthetic dronabinol "in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules"), as a reason for keeping the dronabinol found in the marijuana plant in Schedule I.  Sesame oil and gelatin capsules are simply foods, which are not subject to control under                              - 10 - Click here for part 2WT01-B19-74IA087-000632-B042-16http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/DEA/BRIEF2/brief2-2.html 206.61.184.43 19970122072158 text/html 20929HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:21:50 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:09:28 GMTContent-length: 20713 Petitioner's Brief - Part 2 - 9/18/95 the CSA.  It is dronabinol which is in Schedule II, not just the FDA approved product Marinol�.     In 1986, when marijuana became the source of an accepted and useful medication, dronabinol, it should have been transferred into the same schedule of the CSA, Schedule II, as the other plants, coca and opium, which are the sources of the accepted and useful Schedule II medications cocaine and morphine.  It would be illogical for the DEA to place a plant in a higher schedule than the drug which caused it to be scheduled in the first place, especially when there is no difference between Schedule I and Schedule II with regard to enforcement of the drug laws (the DEA's only valid concern).                            ARGUMENT     1.   SYNTHETIC AND NATURAL DELTA-9-THC ARE THE SAME.     The Administrator's decision that synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules, but not dronabinol itself, has been rescheduled, and that dronabinol is not obtained from marijuana, is beyond the scope of the DEA's authority.  This distinction is strictly a function of the Food and Drug Administration, and only with regard to the marketing of a drug, not its scheduling.     In enacting the CSA, "Members of the House repeatedly stated that the Department of Justice should make judgments based on law enforcement considerations, while HEW should have the final say with respect to medical and scientific determinations."  NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d at 746.  The Department of Justice "may not                              - 11 - schedule a substance under the CSA without first obtaining the recommendation of the FDA, through its parent agency, HHS, 21 U.S.C. � 811(b), and providing an 'opportunity for a hearing pursuant to rulemaking procedures prescribed by [the Administrative Procedures Act].' 21 U.S.C. � 811(a)."  Grinspoon v. DEA, 828 F.2d 881, 890 (1st Cir. 1987).  "This request is filed with the Commissioner of FDA, who has the responsibility for coordination of activities within [HHS]."  NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d at 749 n.59.     As this Court stated in 1977:          Our interpretation of Section 201(d) ensures proper      allocation of decisionmaking responsibility between the      Attorney General and the Secretary of HEW, in accordance      with their respective spheres of expertise.  Section 201(d)      directs the Attorney General, as an initial matter, to make      a legal judgment as to controls necessitated by      international commitments.  He then establishes a minimum      schedule or level of control below which placement of the      substance may not fall.  Determination of a minimum schedule      ensures that the Secretary's recommendation, which      ordinarily would be binding as to medical and scientific      findings, does not cause a substance to be scheduled in      violation of treaty obligations.  However, once that minimum      schedule is established by the Attorney General, the      decision whether to impose controls more restrictive than      required by treaty implicates the same medical and      scientific considerations as do scheduling decisions      regarding those few substances not controlled by treaty.       The Secretary of HEW is manifestly more competent to make      these nonlegal evaluations and recommendations.NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d at 747.     Although the FDA has approved a New Drug Application (NDA) for Marinol� (synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules), this does not qualify as a recommendation, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. � 811(b), to keep the                              - 12 - dronabinol found in the marijuana plant in Schedule I.  FDA did not recommended that the dronabinol found in marijuana remain in Schedule I when Marinol� was placed in Schedule II, nor did it say that synthetic dronabinol was superior to the dronabinol found in marijuana.  [App., p. 15]     This is not the first time the DEA has tried to follow verbatim text of FDA marketing approval for a New Drug Application (NDA) in making a scheduling determination.  As this Court stated in 1991:     The First Circuit in Grinspoon v. Drug Enforcement      Administration, 828 F.2d 881, 891-92 (1st Cir. 1987), upon      which petitioners rely, had held that earlier criteria the      Administrator had employed to define "currently accepted      medical use" were contrary to the statute because they were      a carbon copy of those used by the FDA in licensing new      drugs.  The present criteria, it is argued, duplicate a      number of those original criteria.  But the criteria      challenged in Grinspoon included several elements, such as      the availability of patent information or FDA-required      labeling, which were necessary only to market the drug in      interstate commerce.  These criteria are clearly relevant to      the FDA's mission, but not the DEA's, see Grinspoon, 828      F.2d at 887.  The First Circuit never suggested the DEA      Administrator was foreclosed from incorporating and relying      on those standards employed by the FDA that are relevant to      the pharmaceutical qualities of the drug.  The court merely      held that while FDA approval is sufficient to establish the      existence of an accepted medical use, the converse is not      true -- that absent FDA approval, commonly accepted medical      use cannot be proven.  Id. at 890.  Nor can we conceive of a      reason the Administrator should be barred from employing      notions developed by a sister agency insofar as those      notions serve the missions of both agencies.ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d at 939-40.       In 1987, the First Circuit said,      [W]e find no necessary linkage between failure to obtain FDA      interstate marketing approval and a determination that the      substance in question is unsafe and has no medical use.       Indeed, the FDCA does not even mention the term 'medical                              - 13 - use.'  In short, it is plainly possible that a substance may      fail to obtain interstate marketing approval even if it has      an accepted medical use.  Grinspoon, 828 F.2d at  887.  "Thus, it is possible that a substance may have both an accepted medical use and safety for use under medical supervision, even though no one has deemed it necessary to seek approval for interstate marketing."  Id.     By definition, a synthetic drug is the same as its naturally occurring twin.  Under this Court's order of June 4, 1982, in NORML v. DEA, No. 79-1660, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was required to submit reports on the status of its recommendations for the scheduling of THC and marijuana plants.  In reference to the DEA's rescheduling order of May 13, 1986 (51 Fed. Reg. 17,476) the DHHS stated that, "Dronabinol is structurally the same as THC."  [App., p. 8]     In his final order on NORML's petition, the Administrator adopted in their entirety the findings of the former Administrator.  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,507.  The former Administrator, in his final order on NORML's petition,  stated, "There is no difference in the pharmacological effect between the THC isolated from cannabis and the synthetically produced THC which is now marketed in the United States."  54 Fed. Reg. at 53,774.  As this Court noted in 1991, "The First Circuit never suggested the DEA Administrator was foreclosed from incorporating and relying on those standards employed by the FDA that are relevant to the pharmaceutical qualities of the drug."  ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d at 939.  The former Administrator, in agreement with HHS, recognized that the pharmaceutical qualities of                              - 14 - synthetic dronabinol are the same as those of the dronabinol found in marijuana.     In his final order of March 26, 1992, the Administrator stated, "There are scientific studies showing pure THC (Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol), one of the many chemicals found in marijuana, has some effect in controlling nausea and vomiting.  Pure THC is pharmaceutically made in clean capsule form, called Marinol, and is available for use by the medical community.  More information on Marinol can be found in the 'Physicians' Desk Reference,' available in most libraries."  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,500.  The 1993 Physician's Desk Reference describes Marinol as follows: "Dronabinol, commonly known as delta-9-THC, is one of the major active substances in marijuana."  Id. at p. 2076.  The Physician's Desk Reference makes no distinction between synthetic dronabinol and the dronabinol found in marijuana.     In a letter dated July 13, 1993, the FDA states that, "A synthetic drug ... is identical in all respects to the product isolated from a plant source.  Such a product can be marketed under the same name....  A synthetic drug would be in the same schedule as its naturally occurring twin."  Letter from the FDA, July 13, 1993 [App., p. 16].     Clearly, the dronabinol found in marijuana was approved for medical use by the FDA when it approved Marinol�.  "[T]he [DEA] does not have the authority to impose Schedule I controls on a drug which has been approved by the [FDA] for medical use."  Grinspoon, 828 F.2d at 890 (citing, 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 540, 543).                             - 15 - When the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations moved delta-9-THC from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it made no distinction between synthetic delta-9-THC and delta-9-THC found in marijuana.     In 1986, then Administrator John C. Lawn improperly took upon himself the authority to define synthetic dronabinol and dronabinol found in marijuana as two separate and distinct substances under the CSA.  51 Fed Reg. 17476 (1986).     In the course of rescheduling synthetic dronabinol to Schedule II of the CSA, the original proposal submitted by the DEA defined it as "the principle psychoactive substance in Cannabis sativa L., marijuana," 50 Fed. Reg. 42,185 (October 18, 1985) (proposed rule), but this definition was changed to "the synthetic equivalent of the isomer of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is the principle psychoactive substance in Cannabis sativa L., marijuana" in the final rule, 51 Fed. Reg. 17,476 (May 13, 1986) (final rule).  Whether this change was accidental or intentional is hard to discern, but it clearly exceeded the Administrator's authority.     Although it is true that "[a]ppellate courts have neither the expertise nor the resources to evaluate complex scientific claims," this is not a complex scientific claim.  Grinspoon, 828 F.2d at 896 (citing, Thompson Medical Co. v. FTC, 791 F.2d 189, 196 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).  A synthetic drug must first be the same as its naturally occurring twin before it can receive FDA marketing approval for distribution in interstate commerce.  As a matter of law, the dronabinol found in marijuana was rescheduled                              - 16 - to Schedule II of the CSA at the same time as synthetic dronabinol.     2.   MARIJUANA IS IN THE SAME SCHEDULE AS DELTA-9-THC.     As this Court noted in 1991, "As is apparent, one salient concept distinguishing the two schedules is whether a drug has 'no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.'"  ACT v. DEA, 930 F.2d at 938.  It is important to note that medical use is not the only salient concept.  As this Court noted in 1977, "However, placement in Schedule I does not appear to flow inevitably from lack of currently accepted medical use."  NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d at 748.  "The legislative history of the CSA indicates that medical use is but one factor to be considered, and by no means the most important one."  Id.          Moreover, DEA's own scheduling practices support the      conclusion that substances lacking medical usefulness need      not always be placed in Schedule I.  At the hearing before      ALJ Parker DEA's Chief Counsel, Donald Miller, testified      that several substances listed in CSA Schedule II, including      poppy straw, have no currently accepted medical use.  Tr. at      473-474, 488.  He further acknowledged that marihuana could      be rescheduled to Schedule II without a currently accepted      medical use.  Tr. at 487-488.  Neither party offered any      contrary evidence.  Id.     This Court must review the DEA's final order not to transfer marijuana to Schedule II in light of the guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).  In Chevron, the Court explained that a reviewing                              - 17 - court must employ a two-step analysis that focuses initially on the intentions of Congress:     First, always, is the question whether Congress had directly      spoken to the precise question at issue.  If the intent of      Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the      court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the      unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.Id. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781 (emphasis supplied).  In the absence of congressional intent, however, the court must proceed to a second inquiry:     If ... the court determines Congress has not directly      addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not      simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would      be necessary in the absence of an administrative      interpretation.  Rather, if the statute is silent or      ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question      for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a      permissible construction of the statute.Id. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82 (footnote omitted; emphasis supplied).     In this matter, the agency has interpreted the construction of the statute at issue.  The explanation given by the Administrator for the placement of coca and opium poppy plants in Schedule II is that Congress recognized coca and opium poppy plants "as the source for a variety of accepted and useful medications."  [App., p. 5].  According to this explanation, marijuana should have been transferred to Schedule II when it became the source of an accepted and useful medication.  The U.S. Congress provided a mechanism for transferring marijuana to Schedule II (or lower), after its initial placement of marijuana in Schedule I of the CSA in 1970, and the DEA's interpretation of the statute is reasonable.                             - 18 - It is apparent from reading the CSA that Congress intended to include coca and opium poppy plants in Schedule II because useful medications were being derived from these plant sources when the CSA was created in 1970.  The apparent distinction that Congress made between marijuana and coca and opium poppy plants, when the schedules were created in 1970, was that coca and opium poppy plants were the sources of useful and accepted medications, while marijuana was not.  The Administrator has provided his interpretation of the statute by stating "Congress was very much aware that these plant materials [coca and opium poppy] have historically been recognized as the source for a variety of accepted and useful medications."  [App., p. 5].     The Administrator's interpretation reinforces what is apparent from the face of the statute, that plants which are the source of accepted and useful medications are placed in the same schedule as the drugs themselves.  For example, peyote, a plant which contains the Schedule I drug mescaline, is also in Schedule I, while opium poppy, a plant which contains the Schedule II drug morphine, is in Schedule II.     Since control for enforcement purposes is exactly the same under either Schedule I or Schedule II, there is no reason for the DEA not to move marijuana into Schedule II, since DEA's only legitimate concern under the CSA is drug diversion.  "Congress was particularly concerned with the diversion of drugs from legitimate channels to illegitimate channels."  United States v. Moore, 423 U.S. 122, 135 (1972).                             - 19 - In his final ruling of May 16, 1994, the DEA Deputy Administrator said, "Whether or not marijuana is a source of delta-9-THC is irrelevant to the status of marijuana under the CSA."  Final Order, p. 4 [App., p. 20].  In 1975, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit gave detailed consideration to this question in the case of United States v. Walton, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  The court said, "Looking at the history of this latter law [the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937], we find that the definition of marijuana was intended to include those parts of marijuana which contain THC and to exclude those parts which do not."  Id. 514 F.2d at 203.  "The legislative history is absolutely clear that Congress meant to outlaw all plants popularly known as marijuana to the extent those plants possessed THC."  Id. 514 F.2d at 203-204.  Although the Deputy Administrator said, "The classification of delta-9-THC has no bearing on the classification of marijuana," [Final Order of May 16, 1994, p. 8; App., p. 24], this Court has already ruled otherwise.                              CONCLUSION       Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request this Court to rule that: (1) as a matter of law, the dronabinol found in marijuana is in Schedule II of the CSA; (2) as a matter of law, marijuana is in Schedule II of the CSA; and (3) such other or further relief be granted as this Court may deem necessary under the circumstances.                              - 20 - Respectfully submitted,                              __________________________________                              Carl Eric Olsen, pro se                              Post Office Box 4091                              Des Moines, Iowa 50333                              (515) 262-6957                     CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE     I hereby certify that two copies of the foregoing Petitioner's Brief were mailed to Harry J.

Congress also sought the advice ofthe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare ("HEW") beforemaking a scheduling determination for marihuana.7  Afterconsidering this information, Congress placed marihuana inSchedule I so that the drug would be subject to the CSA's "moststringent controls."

There are     some who not only advocate its legalization but would     encourage its use; at the other extreme there are some     States which have established the death penalty for     distribution of marihuana to minors.H. Rep. No. 1444, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 12, reprinted in 1970U.S.C.C.A.N. 4566, 4577.     7    The Assistant Secretary for Health and scientificAffairs wrote to Chairman Harley 0. Staggers that:     Some question has been raised whether the use of the     plant itself produces "severe psychological or physical     dependence" as required by a schedule I or even     schedule II criterion.  Since there is still a     considerable void in our knowledge of the plant and     effects of the active drug contained in it, our     recommendation is that marihuana be retained within     schedule I at least until the completion of certain     studies now underway to resolve this issue.  If those     studies make it appropriate for the Attorney General to     change the placement of marihuana to a different     schedule, he may do so in accordance with the authority     provided under section 201 of the bill.Letter from Dr. Roger 0. Egeberg, Assistant Secretary for Healthand Scientific Affairs, Dep't of HEW, to Hon. Harley 0. Staggers,Chairman, House Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce,reprinted in id. at 61, reprinted in 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4629.                                11 at 4579.     Since the passage of the CSA, numerous individuals haveattempted to challenge the decision of Congress to placemarihuana in Schedule I as being irrational or unconstitutional.These challenges have been uniformly rejected by the federalcourts.  See, e.g., United States v. Greene, 892 F.2d 453, 455-456 (6th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 935 (1990); UnitedStates v. Fogarty, 692 F.2d 542, 547 (8th Cir. 1982), cert.denied, 460 U.S. 1040 (1983); United States v. Middleton, 690F.2d 820, 823 (11th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1051(1983); National Org. for the Reform of Mariiuana Laws v. Bell,488 F. Supp. 123, 139-141 (D.D.C. 1980) (three judge court).     In rejecting constitutional challenges to the initialclassification of marihuana, courts frequently have pointed outthat 21 U.S.C. 811(a) provides the Attorney General with theauthority to reclassify marihuana if scientific information laterdemonstrates that Schedule I is not the appropriate schedule.See, e.g., Greene, 892 F.2d at 456; Fogarty, 692 F.2d at 548;Middleton, 690 F.2d at 823; National Org. for the Reform ofMariiuana Laws, 488 F. Supp. at 141.  DEA, on behalf of theAttorney General, recently conducted lengthy proceedings pursuantto 811(a) and found that marihuana should not be moved fromSchedule I because the plant has no currently accepted medicaluse and because it is not safe for use, even under medicalsupervision.  These decisions were approved by this court.  Seefootnote 2, supra.                                12 III. DEA PROPERLY FOUND THAT THE PETITION WAS NOT SUFFICIENT     TO JUSTIFY ADDITIONAL RESCHEDULING PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE THE     PETITION WAS PREMISED ON THE INCORRECT BELIEF THAT A     SCHEDULE I DRUG MUST BE RESCHEDULED IF IT IS THE SOURCE OF     AN ACCEPTED AND USEFUL MEDICATION.     In seeking to reschedule marihuana from Schedule I toSchedule II, the petitioner made a rather creative argument basedupon several flawed premises.  DEA properly detected the flaws inthe petitioner's logic and found that the petition raised nocredible issue that would justify additional proceedings toreschedule marihuana.     A.   THE PETITIONER'S ARGUMENT     The petitioner's argument was based entirely upon hisconstruction of language contained in then-Administrator Bonner'sresponse to an earlier letter sent by the petitioner.  Inresponse to the petitioner's query about why marihuana plants arein Schedule I while coca leaves and opium plants are in ScheduleII, the Administrator stated that:     In placing coca leaves and opium plant material in     Schedule II, Congress was very much aware that these     plant materials have historically been recognized as     the source for a variety of accepted and useful     medications.A. 5.  The petitioner then seized upon the Administrator'slanguage as "general rules of statutory construction."  Pet. Br.9.  Using the newly created rules of statutory construction ashis springboard, the petitioner took an additional logical leapby inferring that if marihuana were found to be a "source for anaccepted and useful medication," it must be moved from Schedule Ito Schedule II.  A. 3-4.                                13      Having created a new theory of statutory construction, thepetitioner proceeded to apply it with apparently successfulresults.  He noted that a synthetic equivalent of the principalpsychoactive ingredient in marihuana recently had been moved fromSchedule I to Schedule II.  Since marihuana was the source ofthis "accepted and useful medication," the petitioner concludedthat marihuana "must now be moved from Schedule I to Schedule IIof the CSA."  A. 4.     B.   THE CSA DOES NOT MANDATE THAT A SCHEDULE I          DRUG MUST BE RESCHEDULED IF IT IS THE SOURCE          OF AN ACCEPTED AND USEFUL MEDICATION BUT          REQUIRES DEA TO MAKE INDIVIDUAL FINDINGS          ABOUT A PARTICULAR DRUG PRIOR TO RESCHEDULING          IT.     The premise of the petitioner's argument is that if aSchedule I controlled substance is the source of an accepted anduseful medication, the Schedule I substance must be placed intothe schedule that contains the accepted and usef ul medication.This premise is in direct conflict with the language of the CSA.     As discussed previously, Congress itself decided to placemarihuana in Schedule I.  See National Org. for the Reform ofMariiuana Laws, 488 F. Supp. at 141.  Although marihuana may berescheduled:     [t]he clear meaning of section 812(c) is that Congress     intended marijuana to remain in Schedule I until such     time as it might be reclassified by the Attorney     General on the basis of more complete scientific     information about the drug.  In such a reclassification     hearing, the statutory criteria would be the guides to     determining the most appropriate schedule for     marijuana.Id.  Thus, under the CSA, marihuana plants should remain in                                14 Schedule I unless and until more complete information indicatesthat placement in a different schedule is more appropriate.     The CSA's language concerning the rescheduling of acontrolled substance does not suggest that a substance should berescheduled merely because it is the source for an accepted anduseful medication.  The CSA states that in order to transfer acontrolled substance from one schedule to another, the AttorneyGeneral must make "with respect to such druct or other substancethe findings prescribed by" 21 U.S.C. 812(b) "for the schedule inwhich such drug is to be placed." 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1)(B)(emphasis added).  Under 812(b), "a drug or other substance maynot be placed in any schedule unless the findings required forsuch schedule are made with respect to such drug or othersubstance."  21 U.S.C. 812(b) (emphasis added).  Thus, contraryto the petitioner's representations, the plain language of theCSA states that in order for DEA to reschedule marihuana plantsfrom Schedule I to Schedule II, DEA must make the appropriatefindings with respect to marihuana plants.8     The CSA states that DEA cannot move a drug from Schedule Ito Schedule II unless it finds, inter alia, that the "drug orother substance" to be rescheduled has a currently accepted____________________     8Thus, the Deputy Administrator was correct in stating that"[w]hether or not marijuana is a source of delta-9-THC isirrelevant to the status of marijuana under the CSA."  A. 20.Despite the petitioner's assertions, this statement is notinconsistent with United States v. Walton, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C.Cir. 1975).  The statement simply indicates that each drug isevaluated under 21 U.S.C. 812(b) based upon an independentassessment of its features, not based upon other possible uses ofthe chemicals contained within the drug.                                15 medical use.9  21 U.S.C. 812(b)(2)(B).  The CSA's language doesnot state or imply that this criterion can be satisfied by asubstance that is the source of a drug with a currently acceptedmedical use.  Additionally, the petitioner has produced noauthority to indicate that any controlled substance beingconsidered for rescheduling ever has been found to have acurrently accepted medical use merely because it was the sourceof an "accepted and useful medication."10  Thus, marihuana____________________     9    There are some instances in which courts have suggestedthat the statutory criteria in 21 U.S.C. 812 are not mandatory,but are factors to be used in a balancing process.  See, e.g.,Fogarty, 692 F.2d at 548 ("the three statutory criteria forSchedule I classification set out in S 812(b)(1) - high potentialfor abuse, no medically accepted use, and no safe use even undermedical supervision - should not be read as being eithercumulative or exclusive"); National Org. for the Reform ofMariiuana Laws, 559 F.2d at 748 ("placement in Schedule I doesnot appear to flow inevitably from lack of a currently acceptedmedical use"); National Org. for the Reform of Mariiuana Laws,488 F. Supp. at 140 ("statutory criteria of section 812(b)(1) areguides in determining the schedule to which a drug belongs, butare not dispositive").  Although the meaning of these dicta issomewhat unclear, DEA has interpreted the CSA to require that acontrolled substance placed by Congress in Schedule I may not berescheduled into Schedule II unless it has a currently acceptedmedical use.  See 54 Fed. Reg. at 53,773; 57 Fed. Reg. at 10,499.Nothing in this court's recent marihuana rescheduling casessuggests that DEA's interpretation is incorrect.  See Alliancefor Cannabis Therapeutics, 15 F.3d at 1133; Alliance for CannabisTherapeutics, 930 F.2d at 938-940.  If there is a tension betweensome language in older cases and DEA's interpretation of the CSA,DEA's reasonable interpretation of the CSA is entitled todeference under Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-845.     10   In fact, there is authority to the contrary.  In 1993,the DEA proposed to reschedule the levo isomer ofalphacetylmethadol while leaving all other isomers ofalphacetylmethadol in Schedule I because the levo isomer had beenapproved by the FDA for treatment of narcotic addiction.  See 58Fed. Reg. 25,790 (1993).  Levo-alphacetylmethadol wassubsequently placed in Schedule II.  See 21 C.F.R.1308.12(c)(11).  Despite the petitioner's "rules of statutoryconstruction," alphacetylmethadol (the source of this accepted                                16 plants themselves must have a "currently accepted medical use" inorder to satisfy the rescheduling criterion in 21 U.S.C.812(b)(2)(B).  Because the petitioner's request raised no doubtsabout DEA's recent findings that marihuana plants have nocurrently accepted medical use, DEA acted properly when itdeclined to initiate proceedings to reschedule marihuanaplants.11     The petitioner's novel theory that a source of an acceptedand useful medication must be moved out of Schedule I is rootedin a misinterpretation of the then-Administrator's letter.Although the letter attempted to explain why Congress may havechosen to place coca leaves and opium plants in Schedule II,nothing in the letter states or even suggests that Congress, theAttorney General, DEA or the courts have adopted a general ruleof statutory construction that whenever a plant is the source ofan accepted and useful medication, it must be rescheduled.Further, nothing in the letter suggests that its text wasintended to serve as some type of binding administrativeinterpretation of the CSA.  The letter was simply an informalresponse to a citizen's question about DEA's recent refusal to____________________and useful medication) remains in Schedule I.  See 21 C.F.R.1308.11(b)(4).     11   Even if the statutory language were not clear, DEA'sinterpretation of the CSA certainly would be permissible.  Thepetitioner can point to nothing in the statute, the legislativehistory or elsewhere that would suggest that the interpretationis not reasonable.  Accordingly, even if the CSA is ambiguous,this court should affirm DEA's interpretation.  See Chevron, 467U.S. at 843-844.                                17 reschedule marihuana.  Such an informal unpublished letter thatdoes not even purport to be a final agency action cannot have abinding effect on DEA.  See Independent Ins, Agents of Am., Inc.v. Ludwig, 997 F.2d 958, 962 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (finding that sixunpublished letters of Comptroller of the Currency provided noreliable evidence of Comptroller policy); USAA Fed. Sav. Bank v.McLaughlin, 849 F.2d 1505, 1508-1509 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (findingthat informal unpublished letter in response to individualsspecific inquiry did not constitute definitive statement ofDepartment of Labor policy).     Although there may be some arguable inconsistency betweenthe scheduling of marihuana plants and the scheduling of cocaleaves and opium plant material, such would not be irrational orcontrary to the CSA.  Congress placed all of these substances intheir CSA schedules.  These scheduling decisions have been upheldas rational and constitutional.  See, e.g., United States v.Whitley, 734 F.2d 1129, 1141 (6th Cir. 1984) (not irrational orunreasonable for Congress to classify cocaine as narcoticsubstance under Schedule II of CSA even though cocaine is non-narcotic central nervous system stimulant); National Org. for theReform of Mariluana Laws, 488 F. Supp. at 140 (even if marihuanadoes not fall within literal reading of Schedule I,classification in Schedule I is rational and furthers regulatorypurposes of Congress).  DEA and the courts have conducted reviewsof the scheduling decision and have determined that marihuanashould remain in Schedule I. See Alliance for Cannabis                                18 Therapeutics, 15 F.3d at 1137.  Since the petitioner presented nonew medical, scientific or other information to suggest thatcircumstances have changed since DEA's last review, DEA actedproperly when it refused to conduct additional hearings inresponse to the petitioner's request to move marihuana fromSchedule I to Schedule II.IV.  THE ADMINISTRATOR PROPERLY DENIED THE PETITION BECAUSE     IT RELIED ON THE INCORRECT ASSUMPTION THAT DRONABINOL     HAS BEEN MOVED TO SCHEDULE II WHEN IN FACT ONLY A     SINGLE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT HAS BEEN MOVED TO     SCHEDULE II.     In addition to relying on a mistaken interpretation of theCSA, the petitioner also appeared to rely incorrectly upon thepremise that all forms of dronabinol have been rescheduled fromSchedule I to Schedule II.  DEA did not promulgate such asweeping rule.  Rather, DEA has merely rescheduled one particularpharmaceutical product that has been approved by the FDA.     In May of 1985, the FDA approved a new drug application forMarinol Capsules, which was submitted by Unimed Incorporated.Marinol Capsules contain specified quantities of syntheticdronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in round soft gelatincapsules.  See 50 Fed. Reg. 42,186 (1985).  DEA then issued anotice of proposed rulemaking seeking to move this pharmaceuticalproduct (and no other Schedule I substance) to Schedule II.  Id.After following appropriate rulemaking procedures, on May 13,1986, the Administrator issued a rule:     to transfer U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)     approved drug products that consist of synthetic     dronabinol in sesame oil encapsulated in soft gelatin     capsules from Schedule I into Schedule II of the                                19      Controlled Substances Act (CSA).  Dronabinol is the     synthetic equivalent of the isomer of delta-9-     tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) which is the principal     psychoactive substance in Cannabis sativa L.,     marijuana.  This action is based on a finding that U.S.     Food and Drug Administration approved drug products     which contain dronabinol fit the statutory criteria for     inclusion in Schedule II of the CSA. . . .  This rule     does not affect the Schedule I status of any other     substance, mixture or preparation which is currently     included in 21-CFR 1308-11(d)(21),     Tetrahydrocannabinols.51 Fed. Reg. 17,476 (1986) (emphasis added).     This rule clearly indicates that only a very specificsubstance ("Marinol") was moved from Schedule I to Schedule II.See 21 C.F.R. 1308.12(f)(1).  DEA did not transfer any otherdronabinol products to Schedule II nor did it transfer alltetrahydrocannabinols or all cannabis products to Schedule II.See 51 Fed. Reg. at 17,476 ("Dronabinol and all mixtures,compounds and preparations thereof, except dronabinol in sesameoil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules in a FDA approvedproduct, remain in Schedule I").  Thus, marihuana plants andtetrahydrocannabinols remain listed in Schedule I.  See 21 C.F.R.1308.11(d)(18) and 1308.11(d)(26).12     In rejecting the petitioner's request in this case, DEA'sfinal order correctly explained that dronabinol remains inSchedule I of the CSA and that only Marinol was placed inSchedule II in 1986.  A. 23.  Faced with this explanation and the____________________     12   Unlike Marinol, marijuana plants contain varyingquantities of over 400 chemicals, including THC, that cannot bereproduced in standardized dosages.  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,507.Additionally, no currently approved medicine is administered bysmoking.  Id. at 10,499.                                20 clear language of DEA's final rule of 1986, the petitioner haschanged his argument.  He now claims that dronabinol should havebeen placed in Schedule II when the pharmaceutical productMarinol was rescheduled in 1986.  Thus, for the first time onappeal, the petitioner appears to be challenging the propriety ofthe DEA rule that rescheduled Marinol from Schedule I to ScheduleII.13  See 51 Fed. Reg. at 17,476.     The petitioner did not seek this relief below.  Nothing inhis petition to DEA suggested that he was challenging thevalidity of the rescheduling of Marinol.  Similarly, nothing inthe petition suggested that he was petitioning DEA to rescheduledronabinol or some other substance to Schedule II.  The petitiononly asked DEA to reschedule marihuana.  See A. 2-4.  To theextent that petitioner seeks relief that he did not request inthe proceedings before DEA or challenges the validity of a rulehe did not previously challenge, he should be precluded fromraising these issues for the first time on appeal because he hasfailed to exhaust his administrative remedies.  See Cutler v.Hayes, 818 F.2d 879, 890-891 (D.C. Cir. 1987); Randolph-Sheppard____________________     13   Contrary to the petitioner's assertions, DEA's actionsin rescheduling Marinol were not in conflict with the holding ofGrinspoon v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 828 F.2d 881, 891-892 (lstCir. 1987).  In Grinspoon, the court specifically found that FDAapproval was sufficient to establish an accepted medical use forrescheduling determinations under the CSA.  Id. at 890.  Thus,DEA properly initiated rescheduling proceedings for Marinol afterit received FDA approval.  See 50 Fed. Reg. at 42,186.  Althoughthe Grinspoon court found that the lack of FDA approval did notpreclude a finding of accepted medical use, DEA was not facedwith such a case; the 1985 petition only sought to rescheduleMarinol, a substance that had been approved by the FDA.                                21 Vendors of America v. Weinberger, 795 F.2d 90, 104-105 (D.C. Cir.1986).  The court should require the petitioner to exhaust hisadministrative remedies on these additional issues because (1) itis necessary to discourage this prolific petitioner fromfrequently and deliberately flouting the administrative processby raising new issues for the first time on appeal; (2) DEAshould have the first opportunity to consider these issues andapply its technical expertise in order to protect its autonomyfrom judicial intrusion; (3) the record before this court onthese issues is incomplete because the issues were not discussedin the administrative proceeding; and (4) judicial economy willbe enhanced if the administrative proceedings obviate the needfor judicial involvement.  See Fertilizer Institute v. UnitedStates Envtl. Protection Agency, 935 F.2d 1303, 1312-1313 (D.C.Cir. 1991); Cutler, 818 F.2d at 890-891.     The petitioner is free to bring a separate challenge to thevalidity of the rulemaking that rescheduled Marinol or topetition DEA to reschedule dronabinol or some other substance.However, no purpose would be served by remanding the instant caseto address either challenge.  Even assuming arguendo that thepetitioner could prevail on either challenge, he could notachieve the ultimate relief he sought in this proceeding --rescheduling of marihuana plants -- because the language of theCSA clearly indicates that the scheduling of other substances hasno bearing on the proper scheduling of marihuana plants.                                22                             CONCLUSION     For the foregoing reasons, this court should affirm DEA'sfinal order denying the petitioner's request.

The forbidden cure Foryears marijuana has been taboo, denounced as a street evil. But chronically ill patients are rediscovering cannabis, and looking to the Legislature for help. By Jeff Inman Allen Helmers is fighting for his life. He's scheduled to go to court on Nov. 20 for violating hisparole. Cops found nearly a half-pound of marijuana in his one-roomapartment in Waterloo. He's been convicted of possessiononce before. "If I go to prison, I just hope to God I find the strengthto survive," Helmers says. Helmers isn't out to get high. He needs it to live. The victim of a drunk driving accident, Helmers broke his back insix places. In order to make him mobile, his vertebrae werefused. The accident also acted as a catalyst. He has fibermalisia, a disease that slowly eats the soft tissue of thebody. With his immune system lowered, the disease kickedinto overdrive and hasn't quit since. He is in chronicpain. Doctors pumped him full of pills, hoping to find the rightcombination of chemicals to make it go away. It didn'twork. Helmers jokes that he has "a five gallon bucketof empty prescriptions" that did more damage thangood. Then someone suggested marijuana. "I've tried almost every kind of pill out there," thefortyish Helmers says. "I just left the hospitalyesterday with a bleeding stomach because of the side effects. But the courts seem to think there's some sort of magic pill outthere that will cure everything. The pills just make mesicker. Marijuana is the only thing that works." For years marijuana has been a taboo drug in the eyes of thelaw. Since it was outlawed by the Marijuana Tax Act in1937, cannabis has been denounced as everything from "wackytabacky" to one of the most evil drugs on the street --rarely as a remedy for what ails you. In recent years, however, the medical world has beenrediscovering marijuana, studying the plant for medicinalapplications. Once prescribed as a quick fix for a migraineor as a muscle relaxant, marijuana is now being used to ease thepain of AIDS and cancer patients. Lester Grinspoon, aprofessor at Harvard Medical School, has been studying the plantsince 1967. He says marijuana helps with everything fromrare diseases to PMS, and has the potential to aid thousands ofpeople. "Marijuana is a remarkably safe, non-toxic medicine, that,if it becomes available, will be inexpensive and unbelievablyversatile," Grinspoon says. There are over 45 symptomsit works for, everything from nausea to muscle spasms." Yet marijuana won't be sold over the counter any time soon. It's the forbidden cure. Few are allowed access. Listed as a Schedule I drug by the Controlled Substances Act,it's considered highly dangerous, inviting abuse, with little orno medical value. Patients must prove they have a medical necessityto use the drug, which often translates into drawn out courtbattles. Only eight people in the United States receive marijuanalegally. George McMahon is one of them. He hasNailpattla Syndrome, which causes everything from pain and spasmsto nausea. Doctors said he'd be dead by now. Oncethey gave him six hours to live. He climbed into his car,lit up a joint and had his wife drive him home. Now holedup at his house in Bode, Iowa, McMahon gets a half pound ofmarijuana from the government every month, smoking up to 10joints a day. "It doesn't work the same way when you have to use it,"McMahon says. "When you smoke a joint in anticipationof getting high, you do. I don't get the euphoricpart. I get to forget about my pain. All thesegenerals and cops keep coming out and saying that there's noevidence that this works, but then why am I in thisprogram. I'm evidence. There's people out there likeme who need this." Patients may now have a chance to get marijuana legally. California and Arizona recently passed initiatives allowingdoctors to prescribe marijuana to those who need it. Ratherthan denying patients the drug and forcing them to buy itillegally off the street, both Arizona's Proposition 200 andCalifornia's Proposition 215 put control of the drug in the handsof the government, regulating potency and dosage. But that's only two states. McMahon wants to see cannabislegalized across the board, especially at home. Since Iowadoesn't have propositions on the ballot, he has to work forlegislative reform. He, along with co-founder Carl Olsen,started Iowan's for Medical Marijuana. Their intent: pushthe legislature into action, with Helmers as the point man. It won't be easy. Legislators are weary of legalizingsomething that carries so much political baggage. "I'm not convinced this is something the medical communitywants," says Rep. Jeff Lamberti (R-Ankeny). "Idon't see them saying this is something they need, and some aresaying it does more harm than good." Rep. Robert Brunkhorst (R-Waverly) agrees: "I don't favorit. I think there are alternative drugs out there that arebetter suited than marijuana." But some legislators are more sympathetic. Republican Sen.Gene Maddox of Clive, while by no means endorsing marijuana use,hasn't closed the door. "I'd be open to it on a restricted basis. But I have alot of questions that need answered before I can make up mymind." For now Helmers is caught in the crossfire. Until thedebate is over or he proves he has a medical necessity, he'llcontinue to smoke illegally. It's the only way the painwill go away. "Every day I decide whether I should kill myself or not,whether the pain is too much," Helmers says. "It's bad enough being ill without having to deal with anuncompassionate government trying to throw you in jail forrelieving the pain. People shouldn't have to hide or feelthey are a criminal in order to feel better." "It's aquestion of whether or not we want to throw people in jail for something they think relieves their pain. They've tried everything else. Marijuana is all that'sleft."

Should cancer victims be deniedtreatment with a drug that is easily purchased on the street? Voters in Arizona and California think the drug -- marijuana --should be available by prescription. Arizona would add heroin tothe prescription list. But U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno warnsthat use of such drugs still violates federal law, and that thelaw will still be enforced. The federal law is indefensible. Pharmacies are full of drugs from the "controlledsubstances" list that can cause addiction and, if misused,threaten the health of users. But they are essential in treatingintractable pain. Outlawing use of certain drugs for any purposesimply because they are favorites on the illegal market means weare letting street criminals dictate our drug policy, whileforcing some who suffer desperate illnesses to pay the price. Arizona and California have shown an enlightenment that the restof the nation should emulate.

But for one of our state senators -- Elaine Szymoniak -- to legitimize such an obvious attempt to legalize drugs is simply outrageous. In the Register article, Szymoniak is quoted as saying marijuana "does help some people." She added that the only reason she is not introducing a bill to legalize dope for medical use is that there is virtually no support among her colleagues for such legislation. No wonder. The American Medical Association, the American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies and the American Cancer Society have all rejected marijuana for medical use. Other, safer painkilling medicines exist that do not contain a dependence-causing euphoria. Symoniak apparently doesn't believe such testimony is convincing. -- Curt Smith 4131 College Ave., Des MoinesWT01-B19-80IA087-000627-B025-31http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/MEDICAL/IOWA/grassley.html 206.61.184.43 19970122054519 text/html 15483HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:45:03 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:53:46 GMTContent-length: 15267 Grassley, Charles, U.S. Senator - October 30, 1996 October 30, 1996 Mr. Carl E. Olsen Post Office Box 4091 Des Moines, Iowa 50333 Dear Mr. Olsen: Thank you for your further correspondenceon the status of illegal drugs in America. I appreciateyour opinions, but I have not been pursuaded to change my stanceon the legalization of illicit drugs. Drugs are illegalbecause they are dangerous. Drugs are not dangerous becausethey are illegal. In your most recent letter, you present thefollowing arguments: There is no hope for winning the battle againstillegal drug use, drug use is a medical problem and should betreated as such, illegal drugs are less harmful than alcohol andtobacco and therefore should be legalized, and if drugs werelegalized, then the price of illegal drugs would drop as well asthe crime associated with illegal drugs. Enclosed you will find a copy of a floor statement that I made on the 23 of January to address these,as well as other arguments made by those who favorlegalization. I believe you will find all of your concernsaddressed there. I would like to update certain points withadditional information that has been released since thisstatement was made. On April 25, 1996, the Center onAddiction and Substance Abuse released a study that confirmedwhat many had all ready suspected. Marijuana users are 79times as likely as those who do not use marijuana to go on to harderdrugs. This is an alarming statistic, and the first timethat anyone has proven the statistical link between marijuana andother drugs. To compare, the first studies that raisedalarms about the dangers of smoking indicated that those whosmoked were nine to ten times more likely to develop lung cancerthan those who did not. And those who drank alcohol werethree to four times as likely to develop cirrhosis of the liveras those who did not. You have also contacted me in support ofthe use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. I would liketo mention some additional information for you to consider. Let me say at the outset that I am opposedto the use of marijuana for medical purposes. There havebeen over 12,000 published scientific studies of marijuana, noneof which have shown smoking marijuana to be a safe or effectivemedicine for the treatment of any condition. The mostrecent comprehensive study was ordered by the U.S. Public HealthService and completed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)in March of 1992. The report concluded that marijuana hasnever been shown to be safe or effective as a medicine, and thatthere are better and safer drugs for all of the conditions thatwere considered. Let me share with you some further historyof this issue. Before 1906, when the Pure Food and DrugAct was passed, placing regulations on the sale and manufactureof medicine, the prevailing attitude was one of "let the buyerbeware." Before this, many medicines were touted as thecure-all for a wide variety of ailments. These unlabeledand uncontrolled medicines, sometimes pushed by unscrupulousdoctors, often did more harm than good. Often, these snakeoil medicines contained addictive substances, such as cocaine,marijuana, or morphine, turning their unwitting customer into anaddict who would then clamor for more because it made him"feel better." In an effort to protect the public from thepotentially harmful effects of such "medicines," thePure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was passed. These laws werewritten to ensure that no substance is marketed as medicinaluntil it has been proven to be both safe and effective. In addition,all ingredients must be listed on the label. In 1938, theFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act established the Food and DrugAdministration and gave the FDA the authority and responsibilityto require that manufacturers prove their products' safety. The role of the FDA was expanded in 1962 to include both thesafety and efficacy of products under their jurisdiction. It is important to note that marijuana has never been shownscientifically to be a safe or effective medicine for thetreatment of any condition. In order for a drug to be approved as amedicine, it must meet several strict requirements to ensuresafety standards. The process for approval begins with astudy of a drug's chemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology. Becausemarijuana is not a stable substance, especially when it issmoked, the varying, complex mixture of chemicals is extremelydifficult to study. Many of the chemical combinations areknown to be harmful, while other components have yet to bestudied. New chemical components are still beingdiscovered. Some of the known chemical combinations includehydrogen cyanide, ammonia, carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde,acetone, phenol, cresol, naphthalene, and other well-knowncarcinogens such as benzpyrene, benzanthracene, benzene, andnitrosamine. These carcinogens have been found to be thecancer causing agents in tobacco smoke, and are present in higher concentrationsin marijuana smoke than tobacco smoke. Next, the chemical reactions that occurwhen a drug is taken must be known and reproducible for the FDAto consider approving a drug. Dosages must be measurable to ahigh degree of accuracy. This is necessary to determine what,if any, interactions may occur if the drug being tested is takenin combination with other medicines, as well as the effects ofhigher or lower dosage rates. I know that there is a lot ofanecdotal information around indicating that marijuana helps somepeople, but this is not generally true. And we need to becareful when we make decisions about drugs and the claims somepeople make for them. So where do the claims that marijuana isbeneficial for persons suffering from glaucoma, AIDS, MultipleSclerosis, and other ailments come from? Just as there is apowerful tobacco lobby, there is a well-financed andwell-organized marijuana legalization lobby. Many of thesame claims and tactics that were used in tobacco advertizingcampaigns are now being used for marijuana legalization. Groups such as the National Organization for the Reform of MarijuanaLaws (NORML) have stated that the issue of medicinal uses formarijuana will be used in an attempt to give marijuana a goodname. Similar tactics were used by the tobacco industrybefore the Federal Trade Commission halted the practice in1955. 'Camel' cigarettes were advertized as an aid fordigestion and said to prevent fatigue. 'Kool' brandcigarettes claimed to prevent the common cold. Similar tothe way that the tobacco industry works to undermine the effortsof the FDA, NORML supports initiatives at both state and federallevels to circumvent current consumer protection laws, such asthe guidelines for establishing marijuana as a legal drug. Just as the tobacco industry has denied that tobacco is addictiveand causes cancer, the marijuana legalization movement denies theharmful effects of marijuana. Still, many ill people claim that usingmarijuana has made their illnesses easier. Butscience does not support these claims. TheNational Eye Institute has reported that the intraocularpressure-lowering action of marijuana is not effective enough toprevent optic nerve damage caused by glaucoma. As of June,1994, there are 24 agents, all approved by the Food and DrugAdministration, that are incorporated into a variety of medicinesto be used for glaucoma treatment. There are also surgical optionsavailable. Studies performed in the early l970s showed thatmarijuana, when smoked, did lower the intraocular pressure inpeople with normal pressure and in those with glaucoma. However, follow-up studies, conducted over a ten year period,(1978 - 1988) by the National Eye Institute showed that althoughmarijuana -- or more specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol(THC) -- did lower intraocular pressure when administered, none ofthe studies showed that marijuana, or any of its components,could safely and effectively lower intraocular pressure enough toprevent optic nerve damage. In addition, these studiesshowed that marijuana had a number of undesirable and potentiallyharmful side effects, such as elevated blood pressure, dry eye,euphoria, as well as a greater risk for respiratory systemdamage. These are in addition to the psychological sideeffects. According to a fact sheet released by theDepartment of Health and Human Services, entitled NationalEye Institute Fact Sheet on the Therapeutic Use of Marijuana forGlaucoma, "The availability of a wide varietyof alternative treatments that do not have marijuana'spsychoactive and other specific side effects argues against theuse of marijuana for treating glaucoma. Marijuana offers noadvantage over currently available glaucoma drugs and indeed maybe less effective than these agents." Marijuana supporters have also endorsed itsuse for AIDS patients with wasting syndrome. This syndromeis characterized by severely debilitating anorexia and weight loss,and is of particular concern because it can exacerbate theprimary illness and is associated with a poor prognosis. Marijuana is said to be beneficial because it increases thepatient's appetite and decreases nausea that sometimes occurs asa result of other medications. However, according toresearchers, marijuana smoking also causes a number of problems,causing more harm than good. Marijuana has alsobeen shown to suppress the body's natural immune system, which isespecially dangerous to persons with the HIV virus or AIDS. Smokers have about half the life expectancy of non-smokers, and havean increased incidence of pneumonia when compared to non-marijuanasmokers. Drug absorption from marijuana smoking isdependent upon deep inhalation of marijuana smoke, an impracticalsuggestion for non-smoking patients or those with limited lungcapacity because of illness (such as pneumonia). Also,there currently is a synthetic form of THC, called"Marinol" available as an anti-nausea agent forpatients who have failed to respond to other drugs. Unlikemarijuana, Marinol has met and passed all of the testing andregulations that the FDA requires. The medical use ofMarinol is highly restricted because of the potential sideeffects. Fortunately, newer, better anti-emetic medicationshave been developed and are now available. Because of a placebo effect, a patient maybelieve a drug is helpful when it is not. Anecdotalevidence may point to a drug having medicinal value, but thisneeds to be followed up with scientific studies. Because of marijuana'saddictive and mind-altering effects, a placebo effect can bemagnified. Users are likely to exaggerate thebenefits. For example, there have been numerous reportsfrom patients that have claimed that marijuana has causeimprovement in multiple sclerosis. However, a controlled,scientific study by Dr. H. S. Greenberg, reported in ClinicalPharmacology & Therapy (Vol. 55:324-328, 1994)showed that smoking marijuana actually made the symptoms ofmultiple sclerosis worse. In addition, many reports of marijuana'sbeneficial effects are based not on science but on anecdotes from individualswho claim results for themselves. While these individualsmay feel they have benefited, we cannot base public policydecisions on important issues on anecdotal information. Unfortunately, many in the press and elsewhere do not look beyondsuch information. The best available science, however,clearly and overwhelmingly demonstrates the contrary. I hear from many thoughtful persons, suchas yourself, who urge me to consider supporting marijuana formedical use. I have looked at the copious research that hasbeen done on this issue and urge you to do so as well. Fora further discussion on the therapeutic uses of marijuana, thereare a number of reports that examine the available scientificinformation. "Health Aspects of Cannabis," writtenby Leo E. Hollister and published in PharmacologicalReviews (Vol. 38, No. 1:1986) is an excellentstarting point. Numerous other studies have also beenpublished in The New England Journal of Medicine, TheLancet, and other reputable medical journals as well asthose available from NIH and the FDA. In closing, I want to relay to you mystrong feelings about representative government. Fordemocracy to function, there has to be two-way communicationbetween Americans and their elected representatives. Bysharing your views with me, Iowans play a vital role in this process. Hearing from you enables me to be a better U.S. Senator, and Ivery much appreciate the time you took to inform me of yourconcerns. Thanks again for keeping in touch. Sincerely, Charles E.

Box 4091 Des Moines, Iowa 50333 Dear Carl: Thank you for writing to support the Medical MarijuanaRescheduling Bill (H.R. 2618) as well as for the information yousent me. I welcome this opportunity to respond. You may be interested to learn that Representative Frank ofMassachusetts introduced H.R. 2618 on November 10, 1995. Marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug whichmeans that it has a high potential for abuse and is not permittedfor medical use. H.R. 2618 would reschedule marijuana as aSchedule II drug and allow doctors to prescribe marijuana formedical purposes such as treating glaucoma. The bill wouldalso establish the Office for the Supply of InternationallyControlled Drugs which would regulate and supervise theproduction of marijuana for medicinal purposes. H.R. 2618was referred to the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Healthand Environment and the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee onCrime. No further action has been taken on the bill at thistime. I understand that marijuana does have some medical uses. However, as you may know, the National Household Survey on DrugAbuse has reported the number of adolescents aged 12-17 usingmarijuana and other drugs has increased from 5.3% in 1992 to19.9% in 1995. I am concerned that legalizing drugs formedical purposes could increase the supply of marijuana availableto drug abusers and cause a further lapse in the progress thathas been made so far in fighting the war on drugs. While we may not completely agree on this issue, please do nothesitate to contact me in the future if you have questions orconcerns you would like to express. Again, thanks forwriting.

Recently, Dr. Donald Abrams, of the University of California, San Francisco, sought permission to conduct a privately financed pilot study comparing three potencies of inhaled marijuana (high, medium, and low) with oral delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (dronabinol) capsules. Dr. Abrams' study was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Investigational New Drug No. 43,542), the University of California, San Francisco, institutional review board, the California Research Advisory Panel, and the scientific advisory committee of the San Francisco Community Consortium. The Drug Enforcement Administration first refused to allow Dr. Abrams to import marijuana from The Netherlands, and then the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which controls the domestic supply of marijuana for clinical research, rejected Dr. Abrams' request in April 1995. This is very wrong. Other researchers will now be discouraged from attempting to secure approval for further research. The application processes are long and complicated. Furthermore, the denial by NIDA has prompted researchers and patients to appeal to the California voters through the initiative process. Petitioners this year gathered approximately twice the number of needed signatures to get a medical marijuana initiative on the ballot in November. The California medical marijuana initiative will allow patients to grow their own marijuana. Polls indicate the initiative will pass. The intitiative solves the problem for state law enforcement agencies, but does not address federal scheduling of marijuana. Possession of marijuana would still remain a federal crime, although most likely unenforced. I would appreciate any pressure you can apply on NIDA to simplify its requirements for granting approval for supplying marijuana for legitimate research. This would help to eliminate the necessity of patients trying to find marijuana on their own without legal sanction from the federal government. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Carl E.

GOD BLESS YOU! I suffer form cronic migrains an anvage of 150 hours / week for the last 16 years, that is until I read information in a small artical you wrote or provided last year about use of THC for migrain headaches. The last 9 months has been a DRASTIC improvement...8-). I have been on 12 diffrent medications for the headaches from Midrin, Cataflam, Butralbital APAP to Codine and Morpine. And Tropol XL for heart rate durring headaches. But now The THC ( smoked ), I only use Midrin for the heavy attacks and Tropor because the canabis does increase my heart rate. The Marijuana allows me to preform daily activity including, work! and Mountian Bike raceing. I owe you my life... No shit. I was at the end of my rope. I could not stand it. I woke up crying everyday, mad I did not die in my sleep. Afraid to wake up a face another day in hell. Once more, THANK YOU!!! Would it be out of the question to recieve information on migrains and Marijuana? You can e-mail me a file at rgregg@clubmet.metrobbs.com.

If a seriously illpatient has a legitimate medical necessity, that patient should be certifiedand be exempted from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa. The IowaLegislature should amend current state law by immunizing certified medicalmarijuana users from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa and call uponthe federal government to amend existing federal statutes. Iowa recognizes the defense of "medical necessity" to prosecution for thepossession of marijuana in the state of Iowa. State of Iowa v. Jan Pleas,No. 22690, Pottawattamie District Court (June 16, 1994). Iowa lawrecognizes the therapeutic value of marijuana. Iowa Code � 124.206(7)(a). Between 1976 and 1991, the federal government supplied marijuana topatients for medical purposes. In 1991, the federal government decided tostop supplying marijuana to new applicants. Only two Iowans are currentlyallowed to use marijuana legally, because of federal law prohibiting the useof marijuana. Other Iowans who were approved to receive marijuana werenever supplied. It is not fair that all Iowans are not treated alike, some having arbitraryrights that others do not have.

I am glad that you  took the time to share your thoughts with me.      As a doctor, I understand the terrible suffering experienced by victims of diseases such as AIDS  and cancer.  Many patients find it difficult that their loss of appetite results in significant weight loss,  often threatening their health.      Earlier this year, Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts introduced legislation to permit the  therapeutic use of marijuana for certain patients.  Under current law, marijuana is considered a Class  I drug and cannot be prescribed for any medical condition.  There are, however, several prescription  drugs that use the same active ingredient as is found in marijuana.  I will be sure to keep your support  for Congressman Frank�s legislation in mind if it comes before the House for consideration.      Thank you again for your letter.  I hope to hear from you again on other issues of mutual concern.      Sincerely,     Greg Ganske, M.D.     Member of Congress     1108 Longworth House Office Bldg.

First, I want to thank you forall of your assistance with the medicinal marijuana project SenatorSzymoniak assigned to me as part of my internship. Your knowledge andsupport opened my eyes to an interesting dilemma in the United States -- apolitically incorrect substance is not available to patients regardless ofthe drug's safety and efficiency.I do not support the illegal use of drugs nor do I believe marijuanashould be legalized. However, patients should not suffer unnecessarilybecause of powerful lobbying groups and influenced politicians. I applaudyour efforts to help those who could truly benefit from medicinalmarijuana, and I would enjoy updates on the status of your politicalbattle. As I will be attending law school at the University of Iowabeginning this Fall, I will probably have very little spare time.Nevertheless, I would like to continue our correspondence as I believe itwould be mutually beneficial.One last bit of information. I am originally from California and when Iwas visiting some relatives in May, I read that the California StateSenate passed some type of bill that would allow for the medicinal use ofmarijuana, you may want to check into it father.

ROBERTSLaurensChairpersonLLOYD JESSEN, R.Ph., J.D.West Des MoinesExecutive Secretary/DirectorMarch 10, 1995Senator Elaine SzymoniakThe Iowa SenateStatehouseL O C A LDear Senator Szymoniak:I am again writing in response to your letter dated February 23, 1995, concerning the medicinal use of marijuana.  Board members and staff have conducted an extensive review of the medical literature pertaining to medical marijuana, including American, British, and Australian sources.  Our search included all of the references listed at the end of this letter.  The Board believes that the pertinent medical literature supports its opposition to marijuana for therapeutic purposes and offers the following information for your review:1.     "...[T]he essence of arguments on both sides revolves around how much research is enough...despite published studies, very little still is known about the extent of marijuana's physiological and psychoactive effects."12.     Janet D. Lapey, M.D., the executive director of Concerned Citizens for Drug Prevention, Inc., is one of medicinal marijuana's most vocal opponents.  Dr. Lapey has stated that "crude marijuana contains some 400 chemicals, many unidentified, that, when smoked, combust into more than 2,000 chemicals, including carcinogens and toxins such as benzene and toluene.1  Cannabis has also been described by C. H. Ashton as "a prime example of a pharmacologically 'dirty' drug.  It contains many active substances with multiple effects and several (unknown) mechanisms of action."21 Senator Elaine Szymoniak            Page 2                 March 10, 19953.     Dr. Lapey has also stated that the National Institutes of Health reports that "new drugs, including the serotonin receptor antagonist ondansetron hydrochloride (Zofran...), surpass THC's therapeutic value in calming cancer patients' chemotherapy-induced nausea.  For HIV wasting syndrome, she points to the availability of dronabinol, noting the  potential dangers of immunocompromised patients smoking a carcinogen-containing substance."14.     Christine Hartel, Ph.D., the associate director for neuroscience in the Division of Clinical Research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), reinforces Dr. Lapey's remarks.  Dr. Hartel has stated "that after 20 years of research that produced synthetic THC in dronabinol capsules, 'the doctors and researchers at the NIH do not see [inhaled] marijuana as having much promise'."15.     One recent article published In The Western Journal of Medicine has stated the following: "Marijuana smoke contains carcinogens and more tar than tobacco smoke, and the psychoactive effects of marijuana ingestion have been implicated as a risk factor for injuries...daily marijuana smoking appears to be associated with respiratory conditions  even among persons who never smoked tobacco."2  The study also found "increased risks of injury-related and other (nonrespiratory, noninjury) outpatient visits among marijuana smokers, suggesting that marijuana use may have many adverse health effects" (emphasis added).2  The authors concluded that "[D]aily marijuana smoking, even in the absence of  tobacco, appeared to be associated with an elevated risk of health care use for various health problems."26.     Donald P. Tashkin, M.D., a professor of medicine at the University of California School of Medicine in Los Angeles, has stated that "[s]everal lines of evidence suggest that marijuana smoking is also associated with an increased risk for the development of respiratory tract malignancy."37.     Although the use of cannabis for medical purposes has been legalized in Canberra, Australia, it remains highly controversial.  The Australian federal health minister, the Australian Medical Association, and the Australian federal police are all pressuring lawmakers to repeal the new law.  The Australian Federal Attorney General has called on the members who passed the law to "move quickly to repeal the amendments and repair the damage done to the territory's reputation for responsible law making."48.     Richard H. Schwartz, M.D., of the Fairfax Hospital for Children in Falls Church, Virginia, has stated that "support of the use of marijuana for medical purposes is  scientifically unfounded.  There is no evidence that marijuana is superior to ondansetron (Zofran), dexamethasone, or synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (Marinol) as an antiemetic in patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Nor is there scientific evidence to support the use of marijuana for AIDS-associated anorexia, depression, epilepsy, narrow-angle glaucoma, or spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.  As a crude drug, moreover, marijuana has been shown to produce undesirable mental changes, disturbances in coordination, giddiness, and hypotension in at least 25 percent of novice users..."6 Senator Elaine Szymoniak            Page 3                 March 10, 19959.     Doris H. Milman, M.D., of the Children's Medical Center of Brooklyn (New York) has stated that "[m]arijuana cannot be characterized as 'a remarkably safe substance.'  Its  active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol, may have some therapeutic value as an antiemetic  but has not been generally accepted thus far, because there are other, more useful, such drugs and because its other applications are far from established."610.    An Australian article published in 1992 concluded that "the results of standard in-vitro and in-vivo toxicological tests performed in the 1970s on animal preparations to which marijuana extracts were administered have proved to be good predictors of the long-term pathophysiological manifestations observed 20 years later in chronic marijuana smokers.  These manifestations also confirm anecdotal accounts reported throughout history of the damaging effects of cannabis."711.    Amanda Caswell, another Australian author, has warned that "smoking is not an ideal method of drug delivery and chronic marijuana smoking has been associated with bronchitis and asthma."812.    Several authorities have criticized the survey of oncologists conducted by Richard E. Doblin and Mark A. R. Kleiman.  In their survey, Doblin and Kleiman stated the  following: "Of the respondents who expressed an opinion, a majority (54%) thought marijuana should be available by prescription."12  In response, Richard H. Schwartz, M.D., has stated the following: "I calculate that this 'majority' can be no more than 15% to 20% of the original sample and is probably much less."9  Sandra S. Bennett of the Oregon Federation of Parents for Drug Free Youth stated the following in a letter to the editors of the Annals of Internal Medicine: "     I want...to point out that, although the authors [Doblin and  Kleiman] stated their association with the John F. Kennedy School of  Government of Harvard University, they failed to mention that Mr. Doblin  is the founder and president of the Multidisciplinary Association for  Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), referred to as the 'People's Psychedelic  Pharmaceutical Company' in their newsletter head.  The organization has  advocated research on humans with the street drug Ecstasy and the gradual  medicalization and legalization of psychedelics.     In MAPS newsletters dated Summer 1990 and August 1991, Doblin outlines a plan to use different forums, including Annals and the press, to lend credibility to the campaign to legalize marijuana use and to bolster a suit against the Drug Enforcement Administration.  I believe that the authors' bias and hidden agenda should be made known to your  readers.913.    Stuart M. Levitz, M.D., of the Boston University School of Medicine, has warned that "[p]atients should be aware that this practice [of smoking marijuana] may involve unforeseen risks.  Studies have shown that most illegally obtained marijuana is contaminated with Aspergillus species...Aspergillus spores easily pass through Senator Elaine Szymoniak            Page 4                 March 10, 1995contaminated marijuana that is smoked...in immunocompromised patients, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis may ensue.1114.    Rayford Kytle, the spokesperson for the United States Public Health Service, reports that scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have concluded that existing medical evidence does not support continuation of the policy that has allowed a small number of cancer, glaucoma, and AIDS patients to smoke marijuana legally.  "NIH  scientists believe that there are better and safer treatments than smoked marijuana for controlling chemotherapy-induced nausea, relieving eye pressure caused by Glaucoma, and stimulating the appetites of patients with HIV-wasting syndrome," Kytle has said.1015.    J. Thomas Ungerleider, M.D., of the UCLA Center for the Health Sciences, Department of Psychiatry, has stated the following:      A special problem that arises when cannabis or THC is researched is the positive and negative bias about the drug that the subject or patient brings to the study.  Since it is believed that marijuana effects are readily identified, then even in a blind study certain patients might detect it, attribute magical powers to the drug, and overreport its beneficial impact.  In the large cancer chemotherapy study recently completed at UCLA, it was found that 75% of the patients were unable to distinguish when they received THC and when they received Compazine.     One thing is clear:  Marijuana is neither the wonder drug that some people have assumed it is, nor the embodiment of evil that others assume.  If it finally gains some position in the medical armamentarium, it will likely be a modest one, providing symptomatic rather than curative relief.1416.    The possible adverse effects of cannabis on health include the following: impaired immunity; chromosomal damage; psychopathology (including acute panic reaction, toxic delerium, acute paranoid states, psychoses, flashbacks, violence, amotivational syndrome, residual psychomotor impairment, and brain damage); tolerance and dependence, lung problems; cardiovascular problems; eye problems; and effects on driving an automobile.1517.    Harry S. Greenberg, M.D., and others recently studied the effects of smoking  marijuana on patients with multiple sclerosis.  "The hypothesis of this study was that marijuana smoking would relieve the spasticity of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) sufficiently to allow better postural control and thus produce a therapeutic benefit...Marijuana smoking worsened the dynamic posturography of both the patients and the control subjects.  Therefore the hypothesis that initiated this research was not confirmed" (emphasis added).1618.    According to a study on the management of cancer pain in adults published in the American Journal of Hospital Pharmacy in 1994, cannabinoids are not recommended for the treatment of cancer pain due to adverse effects such as dysphoria, drowsiness, hypotension, and bradycardia.17 Senator Elaine Szymoniak            Page 5                 March 10, 199519.    "Despite initial hopes...the therapeutic use of cannabinoids remains limited."2120.    Robert E. Peterson, director of Michigan's Office of Drug Control Policy, has stated that "there's no...support from the medical community when it comes to lifting the medicinal marijuana ban."1  He and other opponents also say that medicalized marijuana is a smoke screen.  "The only reason we're having the medical debate is because [advocates] want it legalized for recreational use."121.    Lester Grinspoon, M.D., a leading advocate of marijuana's medicinal value, admits  that a meaningful marijuana compassionate use program would require "an army of bureaucrats..."1In summary, the Board wishes to emphasize the following:     �    The survey of oncologists conducted by Richard E. Doblin and Mark A. R. Kleiman in 1990 has been questioned and criticized by medical practitioners and others.  The findings of the survey may in inaccurate and flawed.  As a result, we do not believe that the survey should be relied upon.     �    In regard to research, good data is lacking to prove the therapeutic effectiveness of smoking marijuana.  While the Board does not oppose research, we believe that it will be difficult for any researcher to obtain unbiased data.     �    Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is a very weak excuse for justifying marijuana use.  New drugs, such as ondansetron hydrochloride (Zofran), work very well to control nausea and vomiting in cancer patients.     �    Allowing AIDS or cancer patients who are already immunocompromised to inhale marijuana smoke only exposes them to additional health risks (bacterial infection, lung cancer, etc.).     �    The purity and consistency of the marijuana product is a significant factor.  The dose of active ingredient administered from inhalation by smoking cannot be controlled.     �    The offices of the Iowa Board of Pharmacy Examiners are clerical offices.  The Board has no resources or laboratory facilities available to it which would allow bench research or scientific extrapolation of marijuana products to test for purity or quality.  The statement in your letter of February 23, 1995, that "any marijuana received [by the board]...shall be made free of impurities and analyzed for potency by the board" is not possible due to the limitations of the Board's current facilities and level of funding. Senator Elaine Szymoniak            Page 6                 March 10, 1995     Thank you for understanding the cautious attitude of the Board in regard to this issue.  When regulating the practice of pharmacy, the Board always strives to take whatever action is necessary to adequately promote, preserve, and protect the public health, safety, and welfare.Sincerely yours,Lloyd K.

Lack of opposition in prior years proved that we weren't being taken seriously. In 1993, our proposal to provide marijuana to patients from supplies confiscated by state law enforcement sailed through the Iowa Senate by a vote of 50-0 in favor. The Iowa Medical Society sent its lobbyist to the hearing on our proposed medical marijuana resolution. The Iowa Medical Society opposed the use of marijuana for medical purposes, and was able to persuade the several members of the committee to reject the resolution by a vote of 7-2. In the Iowa House, the chairman of the House Committee on Human Resources responded to our request for a hearing by stating that medical marijuana is not needed because other drugs are available. The chairman did not respond to our request to identify those drugs, nor to our rebuttal to his argument, in particular, salient quotes from the ruling of Drug Enforcement Administration chief administrative law judge Francis L. Young, finding that most or all of the conventional drugs used for major afflictions are toxic and life-threatening, while marijuana is one of the safest therapeutic substances known to man. In the criminal justice arena, legislation was been introduced to repeal Iowa's marijuana decriminalization laws. Legislation under consideration would have increased the penalty for simple possession of marijuana from a six-month jail term to one year and increase the penalty for a second conviction for simple possession of marijuana (within a six-year period) from a six-month jail term to a two-year prison sentence (as well as increasing the fine from $1,000 to $5,000 for the second offense). Fortunately, this legislation failed to make it out of committee. This year's effort toward repealing decrim follows closely on the heels of Iowa's marijuana drug tax stamp law which was enacted in 1990, and Iowa's motor vehicle license suspension or revocation for marijuana possession law which was enacted in 1993. We had hoped to enlist the support of the Iowa Civil Liberties Union (ICLU), whose parent body, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is officially on the record as opposing drug prohibition, but letters to the ICLU regarding medical marijuana legislation were all unanswered.

The Court, havingreviewed the pleadings, heard the oral arguents of the parties,and examined the case law provided, makes the followingfindings:    Defendant claims, in her Notice of Affirmative Defense ofMedical Necessity, that the marijuana found in her residenceduring a police search was medically necessary to stabilize theinterocular pressure in her left eye, which has glaucoma.Defendant further claims that there was a specific threat ofimmediate harm, that Defendant did not bring about thecircumstances necessitating the illegal act, that no alternativedrug was effective in minimizing the effects of glaucoma, andthat the harm avoided was greater than the harm caused.Plaintiff argues that the affirmative defense of medicalnecessity is not a recognized criminal defense in the State ofIowa, and so should be stricken.    The Court finds that the necessity defense, by which thedefendant much choose the lesser of two evils, is a recognizeddefense in the state of Iowa.  In State v. Walton, the IowaSupreme Court stated that the necessity defense is availableonly in emergency situations where the threatened harm isimmediate and the threatened disaster imminent.  311 N.W.2d 113,115 (Iowa 1981).  Additionally, no alternative option must existby which the defendant could avoid both evils.  Id.    Defendant is entitled to attempt to establish the defense ofnecessity.  If the trial judge finds that Defendant hasestablished the required elements of the necessity defense inthe State of Iowa, the judge may then instruct the defense ofnecessity.  The Court declines to rule that the defense ofmedical necessity does not exist in the State of Iowa.

Allen Helmers, 48, had been scheduled to be in Black Hawk County District Court Monday. His attorney, Tom Frerichs of Waterloo, said a new date has not been set. It is the second time the hearing has been pushed back. Helmers has said he believes marijuana is the safest way to relieve pain caused by fibromyalgia syndrome, a disease that attacks the body's soft tissue. The cause is unknown and there is no cure. Helmers has already been sentenced to two five-year suspended prison sentences and $1,800 in fines stemming from a police search of his home that uncovered about three ounces of marijuana. He was also placed on two to five years of supervised probation, including periodic urine tests. Because he has continued using marijuana, the probation could be revoked and a prison term could be imposed.

CARROLL For the Courier WATERLOOSupporters of legislation to allow some medical patients to smoke marijuana rallied at the state Capitol Sunday, calling on lawmakers to "end this insanity" of sending suffering people to prison. Carl Olsen, director of Iowans for Medical Marijuana also urged the crowd of about 60 to support Allen Helmers of Waterloo, who faces a possible prison term for his use of pot to relieve the pain he suffers as a result of fibromyalgia, a disease that attacks soft tissues. "In any war we have to take care of the sick and wounded first," Olsen said of attempts at the national and state level to decriminalize the use of marijuana. Also at the Capitol were George McMahon of Bode, and Barbara Douglass of Lakeside, two of eight people in the United States legally allowed to smoke marijuana for medical purposes under a federal progam that has been cut back over the last few years. "Let's stop this insanity," McMahon said. "Let's stop them from saying we're a bunch of criminals." He likened the situation to persecution of the ailing and infirm in Nazi Germany. "God put this (marijuana) right here for us," said Douglass. "Let us have what's already here." McMahon, 46, suffers from congential nailpatella syndrome, which causes abnormalities in the skeletal system and numerous organs throughout the body. Douglass, 40, has multiple sclerosis Olsen called for stepped-up efforts to convince state lawmakers of the benefits of marijuana in medicine, specifically to relieve pain and nausea. "The more of those people who hear from you the more likely it is that we'll get something done," Olsen said. He added, however, that chances for passage of measures to legalize some medical marijuana uses appear slim in the upcoming legislative session. Olsen said such a move would have bipartisan support, but not nearly enough. He also noted that the more demonstrated public support there is for medical uses of marijuana, the more likely a judge would show leniency in individual cases. "modern society doesn't recognize this as a medicine," Olsen said. "For thousands of years we used nothing but plants for medicine, and now all of a sudden we are so wise that all we need are chemicals that come from the industrial companies." Helmers, 48, who has a probation-revocation hearing Oct. 28 because he continues to smoke marijuana, told the rally that current restrictions "force patients into the black market to relieve their pain." "I have talked and cried with many people who have told me of the agonies they have been through watching their loved ones waste away ... when marijuana that could have helped was illegal," Helmers said. "When compassion and common sense are in confict with the law, then the law is wrong." Besides the soft-tissue disease, Helmers said he continues to suffer from back and other injuries he received in several traffic accidents dating back to 198O. He said more conventional medications do not relieve the pain. Olsen cited state senators Elaine Syzmoniak, D-Des Moines, and Jim Lind, R-Waterloo, as being among supporters of allowing marijuana to be used by some medical patients. But neither were at the rally, and Symoniak in an interview later Sunday, said that although marijuana probably does help some people," she has no intention of sponsoring legislation to allow for its use as a prescription drug. "I don't believe in introducing bills that are not going to go any place," Szymioniak said. "There is very little support for that." Lind said he supports such legislation as long as the treatment is under a doctor's supervision and in cases where other medications do not help. As for chances of passage, Lind said: "When you're on the side of what's right and you have tenacity, things will pass."

I, too, am a fibromyalgia sufferer and have otherpainful medical conditions in addition, for which there are no cure. There are a lot of us out here. The fibromyalgia in itselfis devastating, and there are no clear answers for us. Thepain is always there to some degree. Sometimes it is moremanageable than other times. I think legislation should be enacted to enable physicians toprescribe whatever it takes to help people rid themselves ofconstant pain, even if only for a little while, a respite youmight say. Fibromyalgia is not a terminal disease, but itfeels like it. I've often wondered if perhaps people likeme are making the Dr. Kevorkians of the world more popular. A person can handle only so much pain. Mr. Helmers, I'm sure, has all he can do dealing with the pain,and I think it's ridiculous that our laws have allowed him to bearrested for something that's helping him "live." I empathize with him, and I support him. Let's not be soparanoid about drugs that we will not allow our physicians to prescribesomething to alleviate the pain and suffering. Wake up, legislators.

I was a business owner and had steady employmentuntil this took over my life. My life no long belongs tome. Fibromyalgia (FMS) controls me with overall constant pain, totalexhaustion and fatigue. I never get a rested night'ssleep. No rested sleep results in many other side effectsincluding mental confusion. I must be careful not tooverdue any activity or I suffer the consequences greatly. I have tried all the popular medications prescribed from severaldifferent specialists with no avail. Not only do themedications I have tried not work, but they also can have somesevere side effects which just compound already a bad situationto the impossible. FMS is an invisible disease. I look healthy. No onesees my suffering which affects my muscle, ligaments andtendons. But, taking into account the benefits that areattained by using marijuana for medical reasons, I feel that thisshould be prescribed by physicians to alleviate the discomfortand pain caused by many diseases. I fully understand marijuana for recreational use beingillegal. I'm against alcohol for the same reason. Butto let people suffer is inhumane. Those who are of the sameopinion and want to help further the cause and have marijuanaapproved as a legal drug to be used for medical purposes only,should contact the statewide group of Iowans for MedicalMarijuana.

Researchershaven’t been able to find a cause or cure. Thegovernment needs to grant more money for research. Icurrently take several pills a day which are not helping the painand suffering. I don’t like taking all this medicationwith varying side effects. The results of all thesemedications can be life threatening. I struggle with the griefover the loss of physical and mental abilities that I used totake for granted. I am very frustrated with the limitationsthis syndrome causes in my life. I am never free of pain. Many doctors need to be thoroughly educated on the reality ofwhat fibromyalgia is. It is founded that the medical use ofmarijuana has been very effective in relieving discomfort andpain for many who suffer from other illnesses also (cancer, AIDS,epilepsy, etc.). Our medical communities need to be wellinformed so they can understand the need we have for a substance thatcan alleviate pain for so many and possibly give them back somequality of life. Laws must be passed to enable our medicalcommunity to have the right to prescribe any drug or substancethat will open a new avenue of relief for those who suffer fromchronic pain. The use of marijuana would indeed have a significant reduction inthe amount of non-beneficial prescription drugs with harmful sideeffects. Marijuana cannot be any worse that the medications weare prescribed. Why is it not available to the medicalcommunity? JOLEEN COX P.O.

Allen Helmers, 48, had been scheduled to be in Black Hawk County District Court Monday afternoon for a hearing that could have ended with him being sent to prison. The hearing, however, was delayed and is now rescheduled for Oct. 28. Helmers has said his doctor believes marijuana is the only thing that can effectively relieve pain caused by fibromyalgia syndrome, a disease that attacks the body�s soft tissue. The cause is unknown and there is no cure. Previously, Helmers was sentenced to two five-year suspended prison sentences and $1,800 in fines stemming from a police search of his home that uncovered about three ounces of marijuana he was using to ease the pain from his condition. Helmers was placed on two to five years of supervised probation, including periodic urine tests. Because he continued using marijuana, the probation could be revoked and a prison term could be imposed. There are only eight people in the United States allowed to smoke marijuana legally for medical reasons. All were given permission under a federal program that was shut down by the Bush administration in 1992.

Helmers, Allen Douglass PIN #483567994 To the Iowa District Court: This letter is a plea for mercy and leniency. Allen Helmersdoes not deserve to go to prison. He is a medical patientwith a legitimate need for medical marijuana. I haveattached a letter from his doctor which clearly shows thatmarijuana is a medical necessity for Allen Helmers. The matter of marijuana as a medical necessity is one which hasbeen previously considered by a sister court, the PottawattamieCounty District Court, in the case of State of Iowav. Jan Rene Pleas,No. 22690, June 16, 1994. I have attached a copy of thatdecision. I ask that this court take judicial notice of the Pleasdecision. The elements of the medical necessity defense were clearly laidout by the First District Court of Appeal of Florida, in Jenks v. State, 582 So.2d 676 (Fla.App. 1 Dist. 1991), affirmedby the Florida Supreme Court at 589 So.2d 292(Fla. 1991): 1. That the defendant did not intentionally bring about thecircumstances which precipitated the unlawful act; 2. That the defendant could not accomplish the same objectiveusing a less offensive alternative available to the defendant;and 3. That the evil sought to be avoided was more heinous thanthe unlawful act perpetrated to avoid it. Id. 582 So.2d at 679(citing, U.S. v. Randall,104 Daily Wash.L.Rep. 2249 (Super.Ct.D.C. Nov. 24, 1976) and State v.Musikka, 14 F.L.W. 1 (Fla. 17th Cir.Ct. Dec.28, 1988)). Both Randall and Musikka presently receive marijuanafrom the federal government for the treatment of glaucoma. It is clear from the attached letter from Allen Helmers' doctor that he easilysatifies the elements of the medical necessity defense. Althougha probation revocation hearing is not a criminal trial, it wouldbe absurd to think that a valid defense in a criminal trial wouldnot be equally valid in a probation revocation hearing, and Iplead with the court to so find in this case. As the administrative law judge said in The Matter of MarijuanaRescheduling, DEA Docket No. 86-22, Sept. 6, 1988, at pages 58and 59, comparing marijuana to convention medications,"Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safesttherapeutically active substances known to man." AllenHelmers should not be forced to take toxic poisonous chemicalsfor the rest of his life, when a natural healing herb isavailable and legal according to the defense of medicalnecessity. If this court would like a copy of the administrative lawjudge's ruling in DEADocket No. 86-22, please let me know and I will provide one forthe court at no cost to the state. I was one of the partiesto that administrative action. Thank you very much for considering this matter. Sincerely, Carl E.

Allen Helmers DAN NIERLING / Courier Photo Editor Allen Helmers of Waterloo faces a prison sentence because hecontinues to smoke marijuana for medicinal purposes Statewiderally planned for marijuana user's plight. By LARRY BALLARD Courier Assistant City Editor WATERLOO AllenHelmers sits rigidly on cement steps that lead to the front porchof his weathered, white duplex on the city's east side. Just above his head, a pair ofskinny cats lounge behind the screened windows, eyes closed, earstwitching to pick up even the smallest sound from the street. Helmers adjusts his black readingglasses and shifts his weight uncomfortably. It's a littleafter 1 p.m., and he's hurting. "I can't sit like this verylong," he says. "Pretty soon, I have to reclineor lay down or it starts killing me." Before he reclines, Helmers, 48,will fill a small pipe with marijuana and inhale deeply. His doctor says it's the only thing that effectively relieves thethrobbing pain of fibromyalgia syndrome, which attacks the body'ssoft tissue. Neither cause nor cure is known. Seconds after his fourth"hit" of the day, the pain in Helmers' back and legswill begin to subside, and he can think about something else. Like spending as much as 10 yearsin prison. "If they send me into thesystem, I'll be one hell of an expensive prisoner," hesays. You know, disabled people have rights, too." Helmers survived a semi roll-overin 1983 that left him with a broken back. In 1994, he washit by an uninsured drunken driver while riding his motorcycle,resulting in an ugly mass of purplish zipper scars crisscrossinghis lower left leg, where the flesh has been stretchedhaphazardly over repaired bones. See MARIJUANA,page 2 MARIJUANA Man faces prison term for using medicinal marijuana Continued from page 1 Butsix months before the second accident, on a cold February night,police burst into Helmers' house with a search warrant. Hesays they were looking for powdered methamphetamine, havingtraced the drug to a man who rented the other half of the duplex. But the search yielded the 90 grams(about three ounces) of marijuana Helmers had on hand to keep thepain at bay. "I knew better than to havethat much at once," he says. "Anything less than44 grams would have been a misdemeanor." Helmers stash cost him twofive-year prison sentences and $1,800 in fines and courtcosts. The prison terms were suspended, and he was placedon two to five years of supervised probation, which includesperiodic urine tests. "I didn't lie; I told them the(tests) would be dirty," he says. "I wasn't goingto stop smoking; I couldn't." His doctor, W.H. Verduyn ofWaterloo, says Helmers' pain does "not seem to respond tothe usual medical management." According to Helmers, more potentprescribed pain relievers have not only failed, hut causedeverything from stomach ulcers to impotence and memory loss. "Marijuana gives me the bestrelief from the pain and muscle spasms without the debilitatingside effects of the other drugs," he says. It even allows him the mobility tomow lawns for elderly friends and give horseback rides toneighbor kids. Dr Verduyn, of Physical &Rehabilitation Associates of NE Iowa Inc., says he knows manypatients who use marijuana to reduce chronic pain, with the onlyside effect being "a significant reduction of the other painmedications." "It has been known in themedical field, particularly in the area of rehabilitation, thatchronic neurogenic pain responds well to the medicinal use ofmarijuana," he says. Across the country, the same casehas been made for people suffering with AIDS, cancer, glaucoma,epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and other maladies. But there are only eight people inthe United States who can legally smoke marijuana for medicalreasons. All were given permission - and are supplied thedrug - under a federal program that was shut down by the Bushadministration in 1992, two years before Helmers took a friend's7-year-old son "for a little ride on the motorcycle." It was 3:30 p.m., in the 1900 blockof Independence Avenue. The woman driving the car thatstruck them was determined to be legally drunk. "The bones came spraying outof my leg, and I busted the bottom two vertebrae that stillhaven't healed," Helmers remembers. "The littlekid landed on my lap, he got a couple of stitches. "We had an angel withus." Helmers is hoping the angel will bein the Black Hawk County Courthouse Sept. 16. That's whenhe goes before a judge at a probation revocation hearing. An unfavorable decision will send him to prison. But even if he's lucky, andprobation is continued, he won't stop smoking pot. "In good conscience, if needbe I will do my time, but I don't and can't feel like a criminalbecause I use a substance that enables me to at least functionpart-time," he says. Not surprisingly, Helmers' plighthas come to the attention of Iowans for Medical Marijuana, andhis story has been posted on the Internet. A lawyer inPhiladelphia has reportedly offered his services. Thestatewide group has invited Helmers to a rally at the stateCapitol on Oct. 6. If he's not in jail. "I will battle the best I can,but I know if I'm locked up and deprived of my medicine, I'll godownhill fast," Helmers says. "I can only hopethat my suffering might somehow help someone else down the road. "I'm turning it over to theLord."

Ihave since broken a total of three more vertabrea and my lower legin 14 places when struck from behind by an uninsured drunk driverin August of 1994 while on my motorcycle. I have beenoperated on 16 times to save my left foot which left my leg overan inch shorter which agravates the broken vertabrea in my lowerback, two of which are not healed and will probably requiresurgery. I have tried every remedy the doctors couldgive me to find little or no relief and unbearable side effects, memoryloss, impotence, stomach bleeding and ulcerations, and othertroubling symptoms, and I've found that marijuana gives me thebest relief from the pain and muscle spasms without thedebilitating side effects of the other drugs. It evenallows me to do some part time work at lawn mowing which Icouldn't do without it. In February 1994 the Tri-County Task Forceinvaded my homw with a warrant for green stuff, white powder,drug records, and any assets resulting from drug trade. Igave them the 90 grams of pot I had and was hand-cuffed. They proceeded to ransack my house and badger me all the time, refusingme a call to a lawyer. I was accused of being a major methdealer according to their reliable informant, although after twohours of searching my one-bedroom apartment, they could find notrace of anything to do with powder. I told them, and Ihave maintained since, that I use pot for medical reasons and Idon't abuse it and I don't deal it. I was put on probation for 2 to 5 yearsintensive, suspended two 5 year sentences and given $1800 in penaltiesto pay to the court. With the pain I must endure I have not beenable to stay away from pot, I need the relief. It has putme in trouble with Court Services and I am now being violated andgoing back to court to hear my fate in a few weeks. I neverlied to my probation officer and admitted without urinalysis thatI would be dirty and tried to give him the best information Icould find on my medical conditions so he might be able tounderstand what I live through every day. Fibromyalgia hasthe same level of pain and is as disabling as RheumatoidArthritis. I have found a doctor who says marijuana is the best and safest thing Ican take for this problem because when you get into the paindrugs for chronic disorders you have to face the toxicityproblem, the pain killers themselves will end up killing me. So in good conscience if it need be I willdo my time, but I don't and I can't feel like I'm a criminalbecause I use a substance that enables me to at least functionpart time. The drunken driver who ran me down wasgiven 7 days in jail and 18 months probation. Tell me wherethe justice is? I don't see it. I will remember herdeed with every step I ever take because of the pain she left mewith. I will battle my afflictions the best I canas I have, but I know being locked up and deprived of themedicine I need I know I will go down hill fast. I can onlyhope my suffering might somehow help someone else down the road. If anyone has any advise or help feel freeto contact me. Help is direly needed as being laid up thislong has drained me financially and emotionally and my time is runningout. I leave it in God's hands now. Thank you. Allen D.

In August 1994 he was hit by a drunk driver when he was on hismotorcycle and had a fracture of his left lower leg. He has significantcomplaints of pain which do not seem to respond to the usualmedical management. He has been seen in the Chronic PainProgram. Mr. Helmers reports to me that he gets relief whenhe smokes marijuana. It has been known in the medical field,particularly in the area of rehabilitation, that chronicneurogenic pain responds well to the medicinal use ofmarijuana. The amount of marijuana is low and the effect issignificant causing much less side effects than the standard pain medications. We have utilized a number of routine andnot so routine medications to manage his pain, none of which hasbeen successful. Although marijuana is not legally approvedfor use in pain treatment, I know that many chronic pain patientsutilize it without problems just to manage their pain with a significantreduction of the other pain medications.

The resolution, sponsored by the VNA Council of District Presidents, the Ethics Committee and the Committee on Preserving the Rights of HIV-Infected Persons, received overwhelming support from the organization's Delegate Assembly during VNA's October meeting. Noting nurses "have an ethical obligation to be advocates for health care" the VNA said it will support "all reasonable efforts to end federal policies which prohibit or unnecessarily restrict marijuana's legal availability for legitimate medical uses." Mary Lynn Mathre, RN, MSN, a nurse at the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, called the VNA resolution, "An important decision which places nurses squarely on the side of seriously ill Americans who could benefit from legal, medically supervised access to marijuana." Marijuana has medical value in the treatment of several life- and sense-threatening diseases, including cancer, glaucoma and AIDS. Federal law, however, still prohibits marijuana's prescriptive medical use. Only eight Americans have legal access to medical marijuana. The Virginia Nurses Association is the first major nursing organization to endorse marijuana's prescriptive medical use. The powerful California Medical Association has also called for pot-by-prescription. "People with cancer and AIDS should receive marijuana in a medically appropriate fashion," said Nurse Mathre. "We believe nursing organizations all over America will follow the Virginia Nurses Association lead and begin to address this problem."

Last November, politicians in the Australian Capital Territory voted to allow doctors to determine when marijuana is medically appropriate. The decision enraged the Australian Federal Police and intensive lobbying efforts began to reverse the legislative action. In a scene that has become all too familiar, legislators caved-in to the demands of the police, reversed their earlier action, and voted to block doctors from legally prescribing marijuana. Despite this political confusion the med-pot debate has rapidly spread to other Australian states. According to numerous press accounts, Australian physicians, backed by AIDS and cancer groups, are supporting political moves to end the medical prohibition of marijuana. Similar political actions are being planned in New South Wales and West Australia. "Most Australians think doctors and patients -- not bureaucrats and vice cops -- should decide when marijuana is medically needed," said Robert Randall, president of the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT). Randall called reversal of the Australian Capital Territory action, "A shocking, even frightening display of overt police interference in the political process, and in the practice of medicine." Australian efforts to end the medical prohibition of marijuana are part of a rapidly expanding global debate over the inexpensive plant's therapeutic importance. Among recent global developments: In February 1994, the British Medical Association reported 70% of physicians in the United Kingdom think marijuana should be legally available by prescription. The powerful California Medical Association has endorsed marijuana's prescriptive medical use in the treatment of life- and sense-threatening diseases including AIDS, cancer and glaucoma. Dutch authorities have recognized that social coffee shops are not an adequate response to the AIDS crisis. As a result, Holland is working to establish legal means so Dutch physicians can prescribe marijuana to desperately ill patients. U.S. courts in several states have already ruled marijuana can be a drug of "medical necessity" in the treatment of AIDS, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis. Thirty-five U.S. states have voted to end the prohibition of medical marijuana. U.S. drug police, however, have strongly resisted political efforts to expand marijuana's medical availability. A 1991 Harvard survey of U.S. cancer specialists found 44% of American oncologists privately advise patients to break the law to obtain medically needed marijuana. "There is a growing global awareness of marijuana's tremendous medical importance," Randall said. "In Australia we are witnessing the first political efforts beyond the United States to replace Reefer Madness with a more sane and humane system of physician-mediated medical access to marijuana."

In a November 15, 1994, petition to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, the FAS pointed out that whole cannabis is already in clinical use by patients suffering a variety of illnesses, including AIDS and epilepsy. The Federation, in a one-sentence petition, said: "based on much evidence from patients and doctors alike on the superior effectiveness and safety of whole cannabis ... we hereby petition the Executive Branch and the Congress to facilitate and expedite the research necessary to determine whether this substance should be licensed for medical use by seriously ill persons." In releasing the petition, the Federation noted that it did not have a policy on whether the law should be changed with regard to non-medical uses of marijuana. It said it simply wanted to ensure that the research necessary to determine whether marijuana should be legally available for extremely ill persons was completed promptly.

California In Santa Cruz, despite the passage of Measure A in 1993, police seized the marijuana plants of 33 year-old quadriplegic Scott Hager. Measure A recognizes marijuana's medical value and prohibits local authorities from prosecuting those with a medical need for the plant. Local police seized four plants from Hager in September. No charges werebrought but Hager, fed-up with policeman acting as doctors, has decided to go on the offensive. He has filed suit in local court challenging the constitutionality of the State's medical prohibition. Two other Californians have faced harassment by local police. Sister Somayah Kambui of Los Angeles was the victim of a mistaken police raid in June. The soft-spoken woman suffers from sickle cell anemia and argues marijuana helps ease the pain of that disease. Police mistakenly raider her home when they actually possessed a warrant for a downstairs apartment. They seized one six inch seedling. Initially charged with a felony, charges were later reduced to a misdemeanor and then dropped. Barbara Sweeney has twice watched the police raid her home and remove her medicine. The 40 year-old AIDS patient lives in Marin County where the Board of Supervisors has endorsed medical access to marijuana. In July 1994, the police seized 12 plants from Sweeney. No charges were brought because them was no warrant. Maryland In Charles County, Maryland, 43 year-old Jerome Mensch was not so fortunate. Like Sweeney, Mensch suffers from AIDS. In November 1994, local police searched his dairy farm with a warrant and found enough marijuana for about ten cigarettes. Mensch, who cooperated completely with the police, then led the officials to four plants that were growing on the property. Trial is expected in 1995. What to do? If you are arrested for marijuana possession and you have a medical need for the drug there is the possibility that you can claim the defense of medical necessity. This defense is not easy. It is highly specific to the individual charged. There are two basic points: 1) you must have a medical condition responsive to marijuana-based therapies and 2) the condition must be beyond the reach of conventional, legally available medications. In other words, it isn't enough to simply choose to use marijuana. You must demonstrate that marijuana has significant advantages over conventional medications. The Alliance recommends that those with a medical need for marijuana take the necessary steps to create a strong record of medical use. Inform your doctor and ask that he or she make a note in your medical records. Prepare a statement of how marijuana is helpful, when you began using it, why it is better than other medications, etc. Have that statement notarized and keep a copy with your important documents. You may want to ask your doctor to put a copy of this statement in your file. These steps will begin to create a record of your need for medical access to marijuana. You may also want to keep a log documenting how your condition changes when you are unable to obtain supplies of marijuana. Until compassion and common sense prevail it will be necessary for those with a medical need for marijuana to take steps such as those outlined above. It may be a little extra work but it could save you a jail term in the future.

Louisiana originally enacted legislation in May 1978 which called for a state program of legal access for victims of cancer and glaucoma. In July 1991 this law was amended to included victims of paralysis. In Maine, the legislature first enacted a bill in August 1979 which was similar to that of New Mexico. In 1992, the Maine legislature enacted a bill which allowed for cultivation of a small amount of marijuana for medical purposes. This bill was vetoed by the govemor and the legislature failed to override the veto. It has been reported to the Alliance that Alaska passed legislation in the early 1980s recognizing marijuana's medical value. ACT is unable to provide further details on this legislation.

U.S. v. Randall In 1976, a Washington, D.C. man afflicted by glaucoma employed the little-used Common Law doctrine of necessity to defend himself against criminal charges of marijuana cultivation. On November 24, 1976, federal Judge James Washington ruled Randall's use of marijuana constituted a "medical necessity." In part, Judge Washington ruled: While blindness was shown by competent medical testimony to be the otherwise inevitable result of defendant's disease, no adverse effects from the smoking of marijuana have been demonstrated.... Medical evidence suggests that the medical prohibition is not well-founded.65 Judge Washington dismissed criminal charges against Randall. Concurrent with this judicial determination, federal agencies responding to a May, 1976 petition filed by Randall, began providing this patient with licit, FDA-approved access to government supplies of medical marijuana. Randall was the first American to receive marijuana for the treatment of a medical disorder. Randall v. U.S. In 1978, federal agencies, disquieted by Randall's outspoken opposition to the medical prohibition, sought to silence him by disupting his legal access to marijuana.66 In response, Randall, represented pro bono publico by the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson, brought suit against FDA, DEA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health, Education & Welfare. Twenty-four hours after the suit was filed, federal agencies requested an out-of-court settlement. The resulting settlement provided Randall with prescriptive access to marijuana through a federal pharmacy located near his home. The settlement in Randall v. U.S. became the legal basis for FDA's Compassionate IND program. Initially, this program was limited to patients afflicted by marijuana-responsive disorders and some orphan drugs. In the mid-1980's however, the Compassionate IND concept was expanded to include HIV-positive people seeking legal access to drugs which had not yet received final FDA marketing approval. ____________________ 65 U.S. v. Randall, D.C. Superior Court, D.C. Crim. No. 65923-75, "Crimina1 Law & Procedure: Medical Necessity," The Daily Washington Law Reporter, Vol. 104, No. 250, (December, 28, 1976), p. 2253. 66 President Carter's drug advisor, Peter Bourne went so far as to threaten Randall. In a June 6, 1977 letter Bourne told Randall, "Publicity in this case has forced consideration of tightenig up the dispensing of your supplies." Direct Testimony of Robert Randa11, Marijuana, Medicine & the Law, Vol I, p. 36 at 104. In the Matter of Craig Reichart In response to pleas from the parents of a young man afflicted with terminal cancer, Imperial County Superior Court Judge Don Work issued three orders to facilitate the legal availability of marijuana to treat the symptoms of nausea, vomiting and weight loss. Judge Work ordered the sheriff of Imperial Court to provide the young man's physician with contraband supplies of marijuana; immunized the physician from criminal liability for possessing the marijuana and for dispensing it to the patient; immunized the patient from criminal liability for possessing the marijuana provided to him by his treating physician. State of Washington v. Diana A man afflicted by multiple sclerosis (MS) was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. At trial, Sam Diana argued his use of marijuana was a "medical necessity". The court refused to hear medical evidence and convicted Diana. The Washington Court of Appeals overturned the verdict and returned the case to the lower court for retrial. The Appeals Court ruled that "medical necessity" was a valid defense and instructed the lower court to consider evidence of Diana's medical need.67 On retrial Diana presented testimony from numerous medical experts, his treating physicians, his family and other multiple sclerosis patients who endorsed marijuana's medical value in relieving severe muscle spasms. The Court concluded that Diana was "not guilty by reason of medical necessity." State of Florida v. Musikka A middle-aged woman afflicted with glaucoma was arrested for growing six marijuana plants. At trial, Musikka, who had already lost sight in one eye as a result of failed surgical interventions, argued her use of marijuana was a "medical necessity." Musikka's treating physician, a noted ophthalmic researcher at Miami's famous Bascom-Palmer Eye Institute testified that "if marijuana were legal I would have prescribed it for Elvy Musikka's medical use in the treatment of glaucoma." He further testified that, without marijuana, Musikka would go blind. The Court, after hearing from other medical experts, concluded Musikka's use of marijuana was protected by the Common Law defense of "medical necessity" and found Ms. Musikka not guilty. In reaching this verdict, Judge Mark E. Pollin wrote: This is an intolerable, untenable legal situation. Unless legislators and regulators heed these urgent human needs and rapidly move to correct the anomaly arising from the absolute prohibition of marijuana which forces law abiding citizens into the streets - and criminality - to meet their legitimate medical needs, cases of this type will become increasingly common in coming years. There is a pressing need for a more compassionate, humane law which clearly discriminates between the criminal conduct of those who socially abuse chemicals and the legitimate medical needs of seriously ill patients whose welfare and very lives may depend on the prudent therapeutic use of those very same chemical substances.68 ____________________ 67 Washington v. Diana, Superior Court, Spokane Washington, March 4, 1981. 68 Florida v. Musikka, 17th Judicial Circuit, Broward County Florida, Case No. 68 4395 CFA 10, The Florida Law Weekly, 14 FL W 1 (January 27, 1989). U.S. v. Burton Mr. Burton, a glaucoma patient, argued his use of marijuana was a "medical necessity." Testimony was received from Burton's personal physician, an ophthalmic physician who had researched marijuana's use in glaucoma therapy, from his uncle who was blinded by glaucoma, and from relatives and others who testified to Burton's good character and work habits. The jury refused to convict Burton on the felony charge of marijuana cultivation with intent to distribute, but found him guilty of simple, misdemeanor possession. A Reagan-appointed federal judge, however, sentenced Burton, a Vietnam veteran with no prior criminal record, to serve one year in federal prison. Federal drug agencies seized Burton's home, truck and farmland. After serving his criminal sentence, Burton and his wife fled the United States. The couple now live in Holland, where Burton can legally obtain the marijuana he medically requires. State of Minnesota v. Gordon Hanson A man suffering from epilepsy was arrested for growing marijuana. At trial he argued his use of marijuana was "medically necessary" to control debilitating seizures. Research neurologists from New York and Washington, D.C. testified that Hanson's use of marijuana was medically appropriate. The local court dismissed this medical testimony and found Hanson guilty. On appeal, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that "medical necessity" could not be used as a defense against criminalization for marijuana cultivation. The ruling drew sharp editorial criticism from many local newspapers. Hanson served nearly one year in prison. During that time he had numerous gran mal and petite mal seizures. State of Florida v. Kenneth & Barbra Jenks Kenny Jenks, a hemophilic, and his wife, Barbra, were arrested in March, 1990 for growing two marijuana plants. They were charged with three felony counts. At trial, however, the young couple revealed they both were infected by the deadly AIDS virus, and argued that their use of marijuana was "medically necessary" to control the nausea, vomiting and rapid weight loss caused by advanced HIV-infection. The local court refused to heed medical testimony from their treating physician and other experts and they were convicted on all three felony charges. In April, 1991, the Florida Court of Appeals reversed the lower court, overturned the young couple's criminal conviction and ruled their use of marijuana was a "medical necessity" in the treatment of AIDS. In October, 1991 the Florida Supreme Court upheld the Appeals Court's verdict and ordered the prosecutor to file no further appeals in the landmark case. State of Idaho v. Hastings A woman afflicted by crippling arthritis was arrested for growing a few marijuana plants. At trial she argued her use of marijuana was "medically necessary" to control the debilitating pain caused by her arthritis. Her treating physician, other patients afflicted by chronic pain and muscle spasm, testified in her defense. The local court refused to consider the medical evidence, but withheld judgement. On appeal the Idaho Supreme Court ruled the defendant did have the right to "introduce evidence relating to the common law defense of necessity". The Court ordered the lower court to consider all evidence of Ms. Hasting's medical needs. At this juncture the prosecutor dropped all criminal charges against Ms. Hastings.

Access totheraputic CANNABIS is already endorsed by numerous professionalhealth care organizations. The American Nurses Association, The UnitedStates member of the International Council of Nurse, has informedthe Virginia Nurses Association that a position paper submittedby the Virginia Nurses Association titled "Theraputic Use ofCannabis" has been favorably reviewed by the ANA's Congressof Nursing Practice. The theraputic CANNABIS resolution which wasfollowed by a position paper were initiated by Mary Lynn MathreRN, MSN, Carn the senoir nurse consultant for addictionstreatment services at the University of Virginia's Medical Centerin Charlottesville. "The position paper on theraputic CANABIS"was submitted to the ANA from a patient advocacy position, whichis a primary function of the nursing profession. Once made awareof the theraputic potential of CANNABIS and it's relative safety,Nurses readily support the right of Patients to access this medicine" The twofold motion adopted by the Congress ofNursing Practice calls for the education of all RN's regardingcurrent evidence based on theraputic uses of CANNABIS; and theinvestigation of the theraputic efficacy of CANNABIS in controlledtrials. Mathre added that this is a defacto statement by the ANAthat marijuana has medical value; a way of showing support forsimilar resolutions passed by other US health care organizations;and should be recognized by the US government as a polite way ofcalling the denial of marijuana as medicine for the sick and dieingas illogical. With one out of every 40 registered voters a nursewe should expect the politicians might pay close attention towhat the Nurses of America are demanding. The State nursing association of Virginia,Mississipi, Colorado, New York, and California as well as theAmerican Public Health Association, the National Nurses Societyon Addictions and some two dozen other groups have all voicedtheir demand for the administration of theraputic cannabis to beallowed by primary care providers rather than denied to the sickby prosecuters and their laws. Patients Out of Time, a nonprofit organizationcomprised of five of the eight legal marijuana patients and expertsin the theraputic Cannabis field, either crafted or was a consultantto these organizations.

This demand echoed that of a sister organization the Virginia Nurses Society on Addictions who first voiced the needs of physicians to be able to prescribe cannabis as a medicine in August of 1993.  In May of 1995 the National Nurses Society on Addictions (NNSA) joined this call to compassion.  The sponsor of the VA resolutions, Mary Lynn Mathre RN, an expert in substance abuse and consultant in that field to the University of Virginia's Health Sciences Center, said of the NNSA resolution, "This is a clear demonstration that addiction experts and specialists understand that cannabis has potential therapeutic value and patients should be allowed access to this medicine."     The Mississippi Nurses Association passed a therapeutic cannabis resolution in October of 1995 as did the Colorado Nurses Association in November 1995.  Also in November the annual conference of the American Public Health Association issued their demand for therapeutic cannabis, to be published in their March 1996 journal, after "sailing through" the voting process according to their representative.  Patients Out of Time either prepared or spoke for all of these resolutions.     Patients Out of Time is an organization that recognizes the need for some patients to be accorded the compassion and dignity to alleviate their pain and sickness by using a natural plant, cannabis, under a doctor's care.  Patients Out of Time is composed of legal and illegal cannabis using patients; health care professionals; and tolerant but affirmative citizens who desire a pro choice modality of treatment for the ill and dying.     Mary Lynn Mathre RN, MSN, CARN, president of Patients Out of Time will be presenting "Therapeutic Cannabis & the Law: Ethical Dilemma for Nurses" at the 100th Anniversary Conference of the American Nurses Association on June 17th, 1996 in Washington, DC.  With her will be Barbara Douglass, a Director of Patients Out of Time and one of eight legal marijuana patients and Irvin Rosenfeld, the second patient to receive U.S. Government supplied marijuana and National Spokesman for Patients Out of Time.

Many patients suffering from and receiving treatment for cancer, AIDS, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis receive relief from using marijuana. Marijuana helps patients with nausea, vomiting and muscle spasms where other medications are not effective. Currently, these patients must break the law to use marijuana to relieve their symptoms. This measure is a compassionate alternative for patients suffering from these diseases to obtain relief. For these reasons, the California Nurses Association supports AB 1529 and respectfully requests your signature.

Marijuana has been found to be effectivein the treatment of glaucoma by reducing intraocularpressure and in reducing nausea and vomiting causedby chemotherapy.

Box 4091 Des Moines, IA 50333 Dear Carl, Enclosed please find copies of the letter I have written to the Black Hawk County DistrictCourt concerning Allen Helmers, andalso the letterthat I have sent to the Waterloo Courierthanking them for the article on Allen. I hope that theyare satisfactory as I feel like I am terribly uninformed. Ihave been, like so many others, busy raising my family andworking for the last twenty years, stupidly trusting the powersthat be to do what is right (those days are over!). So,now, I will learn all that I can, and I will do what I can tofight for freedom. As I say above, I am uninformed, I do not understand yourreference to Charles Larson and the Saudi Arabian highway partol? I will take notes on the proceedings concerning Allen H. and willwrite something up and send it to you. And, like I saidbefore, anything else? Also, any suggestions that will helpmy letter writing would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Sincerely, Denise Casella 626 Baltimore Waterloo, IA 50702 phone & fax 319-236-8401 email DCase10471@aol.com Seriously ill individuals are suffering because of the prohibitory federal policies which list cannabis (marijuana) as a Schedule I drug of the Controlled Substances, which means it cannot be used by patients or prescribed by physicians. Marijuana Prohibition The placement of drugs into the various Schedules is under the authority of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). To be placed in the Schedule I category, a drug must meet all three of the following criteria: 1) it has no therapeutic value, 2) it is not safe for medical use, and 3) it has high abuse potential. After a twenty-year legal battle to get marijuana removed from the Schedule I category, the case finally came before Judge Francis Young, the chief administrative law judge for the DEA. In 1988, he ruled that marijuana did not meet the first two criteria for placement in Schedule I and must be removed from that restricted category and made available for physicians to prescribe. Unfortunately, the DEA chose not to abide by their judge's decision and marijuana remains in Schedule I. In the past, some patients have been able to receive medical cannabis/marijuana through the Investigational New Drug (IND) Program (administered by the Food and Drug Administration) when their physicians have submitted the required application papers. However in February 1992, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services closed the access to medical marijuana, dismissing hundreds of submitted applications, most of which were for AIDS patients. As of March 1995, there are only 8 legal marijuana patients still alive and receiving their medication through the IND program, but legal access for other Americans is no longer available. Therapeutic Value Cannabis has been used medicinally throughout the world for centuries. Cannabis contains more than 60 cannabinoids which are unique to the cannabis plant, one of which is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive cannabinoid. However it appears to be the combination of various cannabinoids which seem to have the greater therapeutic value. As a medicine, cannabis has been found to be effective in a) reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma, thus preventing blindness, b) reducing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, c) stimulating the appetite for AIDS patients suffering from the wasting syndrome, d) controlling spasticity associated with spinal cord injuries and multiple sclerosis, e) increasing comfort for persons suffering from chronic pain, and f) controlling seizures for persons suffering from seizure disorders. While the mechanism of action is not completely understood, marijuana seems to work differently than many conventional medications, which offers a possible alternative when the conventional therapies are not effective. Safety Regarding safety, cannabis is remarkably non-toxic. It is virtually impossible to overdose with this drug in its natural state. The estimated lethal dose is 20,000 to 40,000 times a normal dose. Judge Francis Young, the DEA's administrative law judge, noted in his ruling that marijuana is "one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man." The side effect of greatest concern is potential harm to the lungs caused by smoking. However, this risk can be minimized in a number of ways. All drugs pose potential risks, and when used medicinally the goal is to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks. Potential for Abuse In regard to physical dependence from chronic, regular use, cannabis has relatively minor, if any, withdrawal symptoms. Tolerance to natural marijuana develops slowly, if at all. The effects of marijuana are generally more subtle than those of other drugs of abuse. It is considered not strong enough by many addicts and rarely is their drug of choice. Support for Therapeutic Cannabis Thirty five states, have recognized marijuana's therapeutic potential and have passed legislation supporting its value. Therapeutic use of cannabis/marijuana is also supported by several organizations including the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, the American Medical Student Association, the California Medical Association, Mothers Against Misuse and Abuse (MAMA), the National Lymphoma Foundation, the National Association of Attorneys General, Patients Out of Time, Physicians for AIDS care, and the Virginia Nurses Association. Patients Risks Due to the Prohibition Despite its illegal status, desperate patients and their families continue to break the law in order to obtain and use this medicine when conventional therapies are not effective or are too toxic. This has placed patients at risk for obtaining contaminated cannabis and has placed patients and their families or significant others at risk for criminal charges. Some patients may not disclose of their therapeutic cannabis use to their health care provider because of possible legal consequences and are subsequently not monitored to determine the benefits and risks. Role of Addictions Nurses As Addictions nurses, members of the National Nurses Society on Addictions (NNSA) have an understanding of the negative health consequences that substance abuse and/or addiction can cause. Substance abuse and addiction are not about "bad" drugs, but rather about "bad" or unhealthy relationships with drugs. Persons can develop a substance abuse or addiction problem from any psychoactive drug, legal or illegal. Accordingly, our focus is on prevention of substance abuse and addiction as well as treatment for persons with such problems. Addictions nurses understand that no drug is completely safe and that any drug can be abused. Prior to using any medication or drug, the patient should have an understanding of the expected benefits and associated risks so that he or she can make a responsible decision regarding its use. As nurses, we have an ethical obligation to advocate for optimal health care for all individuals. Medicine which enhances the quality of life for persons suffering from life and sense-threatening illnesses should not be prohibited because some persons may develop a substance abuse and/or addiction problem to that medicine. Cannabis does have therapeutic value and has a wide margin of safety, and therefore practitioners should have the right to prescribe cannabis to patients when the potential benefits surpass the health risks. NNSA's Position on Access to Therapeutic Cannabis The National Nurses Society on Addictions urges the federal government to remove marijuana from the Schedule I category immediately, and make it available for physicians to prescribe. NNSA urges the American Nurses' Association and other health care professional organizations to support patient access to this medicine. NNSA supports ongoing human research to determine alternate methods of administration to minimize health risks. NNSA supports research regarding the various cannabinoids and combinations thereof, to determine the greatest therapeutic potential. **Approved by the NNSA Board of Directors on May 1, 1995 (This paper will be printed to the official NNSA format and made available by June, 1995.)

Health care professionals in Virginia are not legally able to provide patients with safe, well-informed help in obtaining needed medicine. Background: Cannabis has a wide margin of safety for use under medical supervision and cannot cause lethal reactions. Rationally considered, cannabis is far less toxic and far safer than many routinely prescribed and over-the-counter medicines currently used today. Cannabis has been found to be effective in a) reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma, thus preventing blindness, b) reducing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, c) stimulating the appetite for persons living with AIDS and suffering from the wasting syndrome, d) controlling spasticity associated with spinal cord injuries and multiple sclerosis, e) easing the pain for many chronic pain sufferers, and f) controlling seizures associated with seizure disorders. The Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) Chief Administrative Law Judge ruled in 1988 that marijuana must be removed from the Schedule I category and made available for physicians to prescribe. However, the DEA administrators have chosen not to remove marijuana from the Schedule I category. In the past, some patients have been able to receive medical marijuana through the Investigational New Drug Program (administered by the Food and Drug Administration) when their physicians have submitted the required application papers. However, in February 1992, the US Secretary of Health and Human Services closed this access to medical marijuana, dismissing hundreds of submitted applications, most of which were for AIDS patients. Only the 15 patients who were already receiving medical marijuana through this program were allowed to continue to receive their medicine and only eight are alive to date. Approved 3/95 Thirty-six states, including Virginia, have recognized marijuana's therapeutic potential and have passed legislation supporting its value. Therapeutic use is also supported by several organizations including: the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, the National Association of AttorneysGeneral, The American Medical Student Association, the California Medical Association, the Virginia Nurses Society on Addictions, Physicians for AIDS Care, and the National Lymphoma Foundation. Despite its illegal status, patients and their families continue to obtain and use this medicine when conventional therapies have not been effective or are too toxic. This has placed patients at risk for obtaining contaminated marijuana and has placed patients and their families at risk for criminal charges. Virginia Nurses Association Position Patients are often prescribed toxic and potentially addictive medicine with the understanding that the benefits will outweigh the risks. As with many other medications and therapies, a practitioner should have the right to prescribe cannabis to his/her patient(s) when he/she determines potentialbenefits surpass the possible health risks. Nurses must urge the federal government to recognize this as a medical emergency and allow access to cannabis as a medication.WT01-B19-128IA087-000627-B029-204http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/MEDICAL/POT/ptpolicy.html 206.61.184.43 19970122060206 text/html 2759HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 06:01:57 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:57:24 GMTContent-length: 2544 PATIENTS OUT OF TIME OFFICIAL POLICY STATEMENT The organization known as Patients Out of Time is a nonprofit licensee of the Commonwealth of Virginia that shall lobby and educate all disciplines of health care professionals; their specialty and professional organizations; and the public at large about medical cannabis (marijuana). Prior to the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, marijuana was widely used by medical doctors in the United States for a variety of physical and emotional ailments. The U.S. government began a litany of "reefer madness" propaganda and police actions that are with us today. Coupled with the bureaucratic demands of the tax act, the practice of physicians prescribing cannabis for therapeutic purposes in such an environment became subject to great scrutiny and therefore unwise. Cannabis' therapeutic value was no longer taught in medical schools, it vanished from the pharmacopeia of the U.S., it became outlawed. Patients Out of Time shall focus it's power to reinstitute cannabis as a legitimate medicine for use within the United States. Thirty-six states have recognized the therapeutic potential of cannabis and have passed legislation supporting it's medical use. Cannabis, under modern research protocol, has been found to be effective in reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma, reducing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, stimulating the appetite for persons living with AIDS and suffering from wasting syndrome, controlling spasticity associated with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis, reduction in the intensity of chronic pain, and controlling seizures associated with seizure disorders. Patients Out of Time has no other interest, nor does the organization have any opinion, stated or unstated, about any issue other than therapeutic cannabis. All lobbying, educating, communication, or any other endeavor of Patients Out of Time shall be limited to the sole subject - Marijuana as Medicine! 1/95 **Patients Out of Time has an electronic bulletin board system which will serve as a centralized warehouse for information relating to therapeutic cannabis. This bulletin board contains research data, historical records, legal cases, legislation, and position papers by organizations supporting legal access to this medicine.

The Medicinal Use of Marijuana Mary Lynn Mathre, MSN RN CARN Some addictions nurses have thought of marijuana only as a drug associated with abuse and/or addiction. However, the drug has been documented as having medicinal value. This article examines the medicinal value of marijuana and the history of efforts to prohibit marijuana's use. The therapeutic value of marijuana The therapeutic properties of marijuana come from the numerous chemicals found in the leaves, buds, and resin of the cannabis plant. The cannabis plant, commonly called hemp, is also well known for the value of its fiber and pulp from the stalk as well as the highly nutritional seed oil. The history of marijuana's medicinal use was traced by Mikuriya (1973). The earliest records of medicinal marijuana use have been traced back to China in 2737 BC, and evidence of its therapeutic use can be found throughout world cultures. It was used in colonial America and listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, as tincture of cannabis, until 1941. In the 19th century, William B. O'Shaughnessy, MD, studied marijuana and concluded that it was safe and effective in the treatment of various maladies. The first extensive U.S. study, conducted by the Ohio State Medical Society in 1860, had similar conclusions. More recently, in 1980, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences, at the request of the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and the director of the National Institutes of Health, agreed to conduct a review and analysis of health-related effects of marijuana. IOM's findings recognized marijuana's therapeutic potential in decreasing the intraocular pressure for glaucoma patients, controlling the severe nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, acting as an anticonvulsant, relaxing muscles and thus counteracting spasticity problems, and other uses. The IOM investigators highly recommended further research to determine the full therapeutic potential of this drug. This study also noted that marijuana seems to work differently than other conventional medicines (Institute of Medicine, 1982). The government's response was to print only 300 copies of thisstudy -- not even enough for each member of Congress. Safety: Numerous studies have been conducted to determine marijuana's toxic level: they have concluded that it would take 20,000 to 40,000 times the normal dose to induce death (Institute of Medicine, 1982: Randall, 1988). Another way of stating this would be that a person would have to ingest (or inhale) 1,500 pounds in 15 minutes. After studying all the evidence, the judge in DPF v. DEA #92-1179 and ACT v. DEA #92-1168 found marijuana to be "one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man" (Randall, 1989, p. 440). He continued. "One must reasonably conclude that there is accepted safety for use of marijuana under medical supervision. To conclude otherwise, on the record, would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious" (Randall, 1989, p. 444). Addictive potential: In regard to physical dependence from chronic use, marijuana has relatively minor, if any, withdrawal symptoms. Tolerance to natural marijuana develops slowly, if at all. The effects of marijuana are generally more subtle than those of other substances of abuse, such as crack cocaine: often it is considered not strong enough bymany addicts and rarely is their drug of choice. A knowledge of addiction provides the nurse with the understanding that it is not the drug that makes the addict, but rather the negative relationship a person has with a particular drug or drugs. People can become addicted to marijuana just as they can to any other psychoactive drug. Treatment for their addiction should be available to these people. However, the fact remains that marijuana, like many other psychoactive drugs, does have medical value: the fact that some people may have an addiction problem should not prevent others from benefiting from its therapeutic potential. Studies have found opioids to be effective pain management agents, with an addiction rate of less that 1% in hospitalized patients treated for their pain, (McCaffery & Vourakis, 1992). The prohibition efforts Under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, marijuana is a Schedule I controlled drug. This status prohibits its use by anyone and prohibits physicians from prescribing it for patients. Until February 1992, there was a little-known loophole that allowed a handful of patients legal access to this medicine: the Investigational New Drug (IND) Program administered by the Food and Drug Administration. Unfortunately, in February 1992, U.S. Secretary of Health & Human Services Louis Sullivan, MD, closed this access to all new applicants, as well as to more than 30 patients who had been approved for having access to this medicine but had not yet received their supply. Only 10 patients who had been approved and already were receiving their medicine have been allowed continued legal access to this drug. Various theories attempt to rationalize the government's prohibition of this drug/plant: As an efficient fuel, it presented competition to the oil industry. As a durable natural fiber, it presented competition to the synthetic fiber industry; in fact, Levi's jeans originally were made of hemp. "Reefer madness" hysteria was created in the 1930s by Harry Anslinger of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, which eventually evolved into the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Use of the Mexican name of the cannabis plant, marijuana, was popularized by the Hearst newspaper chain to scare the public into believing that there was a new and dangerous drug being introduced to American youth by black musicians and Mexicans. The act of bigotry insinuated that the use of this drug would lead to insanity or acts of violence such as rape or murder. The result of this media blitz was the passage of the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, which marked the beginning of marijuana's prohibition (Herer, 1991). The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 completed the prohibition efforts. This act provided five levels of control for psychoactive drugs, with Schedule I drugs under the most restrictions and Schedule V drugs under the fewest restrictions. To be placed in Schedule I, a drug had to meet three criteria: (a) it had to have no therapeutic value, (b) it had to be deemed unsafe for use under a physician's care, and (c) it had to be highly addictive. The DEA was given authority to place drugs in the "appropriate" schedules. the DEA placed marijuana in the Schedule I category, which resulted in the complete prohibition of the growth and use of this plant -- an act that could be seen as politically and medically generated. Marijuana does not appear to meet the criteria for Schedule I. Responding to prohibition: The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) was founded in 1970 in response to the harsh penalties, including lifetime prison sentences, instituted by a variety of state and federal laws for the possession of marijuana. While NORML's primary focus was to change the legal status of marijuana for all users, the organization also began legal action to allow patients access to its medical use. This legal action has continued for more than 20 years with the assistance of the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT) and the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF). Finally, the lawsuit was brought before the DEA's own chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, with the motion to remove marijuana from the Schedule I category and make it available by prescription. Only two criteria needed to be challenged: (a) that marijuana had medicinal value and (b) that marijuana was safe for therapeutic use. In 1988, after reviewing more than 5,000 pages of evidence, Young ruled that marijuana did meet both criteria, and therefore it must be removed from Schedule I (Randall, 1988, 1989). However, in 1989, DEA Director John Lawn refused to abide by Young's decision and marijuana was kept in Schedule I. More recently, the Physicians' Association for AIDS Care and National Lymphoma Foundation have joined this lawsuit to continue the fight (DPF v. DEA #92-1179 and ACT v. DEA #92-1168). A political and legal issue or a health issue? Since the passage of the Controlled Substances Act, 35 states have fought the prohibition of marijuana and have passed legislation recognizing marijuana's therapeutic value (Randall & O'Leary, 1993). In 1991, the city of San Francisco, ravaged by the AIDS epidemic, passed a resolution recognizing marijuana's medicinal value; by 1992, the California Medical Association recognized marijuana's medicinal value and made plans to take its resolution to the American Medical Association to press for a similar national policy. These state and local acts, although will intended, are useless, as the federal prohibition overrides them. Despite the prohibition of the natural marijuana plant, pharmaceutical companies were allowed to develop a marijuana pill that is composed of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive chemical in the plant. There are other cannabinoids in this plant that have their own therapeutic action and/or influence the action of others. A plant that can be easily grown and consumed as medicine is Schedule I, while a pill of the main psychoactive chemical contained in that plant can be developed by a pharmaceutical company and sold for profit as a Schedule I drug. Also important to note is that it appears the pharmaceutical industry pressured the government to prohibit university research of marijuana. The role of addictions nurses in the medicinal use of marijuana Addictions nurses understand that no drug is completely safe and that any drug can be abused. Prior to using any medication or drug, the patient should have an understanding of its expected benefits and associated risks so that he or she can make a responsible decision regarding its use. Nurses are patient advocates. Addictions nurses advocate treatment for addicted people. Addictions nurses also advocate medicinal treatment of life- and sense-threatening illnesses if the medicine improves the quality of life for a patient. Nurses, as healthcare professionals, must honestly and rationally examine this issue, rather than respond to scare tactics and moral judgments about "illegal drug users." As addictions nurses, we are expected to base our knowledge of drugs of abuse and the disease of addiction on scientific evidence and clinical experience. Advocating legal access to marijuana for patients whose quality of life can be improved through the use of this drug is a moral and ethical obligation we owe the general public, if we are truly serving as patient advocates.

Do you know that there has never been a documented overdose from cannabis/marijuana? Do you know that tincture of cannabis and other cannabis preparations were often prescribed by American physicians for a variety of ailments earlier this century? Do you know that the name was changed (from cannabis to marijuana) in the 1930's to create the hysteria about a "new" drug threat which ultimately led to the prohibition of the cannabis plant? Do you know that the oil from the cannabis seed does not contain the psychoactive cannabinoids, but is one of the richest sources of two essential fatty acids? Do you know that Levi jeans were originally made from hemp and the first draft of the Declaration of Independence was written on hemp paper - cloth and paper products known for durability and quality without toxic waste in processing. Do you know that the government had to re-educate the American farmers (1942 film by the Department of Agriculture, "Hemp for Victory") on how to grow marijuana/hemp because we desperately needed the fiber and oil products (especially rope)? Do you know that cannabis does not cause significant physical addiction? Do you know the health risks (side effects and adverse consequences) of cannabis? Do you know that all legal access to medical cannabis in the U.S. has been closed since 1992? As a health care professional, can you provide a patient with research-based rationale as to why he or she cannot or should not use this medicine other than simply - "its against the law"?

INTRODUCTION      This is a rulemaking pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 551, et seq., to determine whether the marijuana plant (Cannabis sativa L) considered as a whole may lawfully be transferred from Schedule  I to Schedule II of the schedules established by the Controlled  Substances Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 801, et seq.  None of the parties  is seeking to "legalize" marijuana generally or for recreational  purposes.  Placement in Schedule II would mean, essentially, that  physicians in the United States would not violate Federal law by  prescribing marijuana for their patients for legitimate therapeutic  purposes.  It is contrary to Federal law for physicians to do this as  long as marijuana remains in Schedule I.  This proceeding had its origins  on May 18, 1972 when the National Organization for the Reform of  Marijuana Laws (NORML) and two other groups submitted a petition to the  Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) [footnote 1], predecessor ______________________ 1    The powers and authority granted by the Act to the Attorney General      were delegated to the Director of BNDD and subsequently to the      Administrator of DEA.  28 C.F.R. § 0.100, et seq. agency to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA or the Agency), asking that marijuana be removed from Schedule I and freed of all controls entirely, or be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule V where it would  be subject to only minimal controls.  The Act by its terms had placed marijuana in Schedule I thereby declaring, as a matter of law that it had no legitimate use in therapy in the United States and subjecting the substance to the strictest level of controls.  The Act had been in effect for just over one year when NORML submitted its 1972 petition.      On September 1, 1972 the Director of BNDD announced his refusal to accept the petition for filing, stating that he was not authorized to institute proceedings for the action requested because of the provisions  of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961.  NORML appealed this  action to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  Circuit.  The court held that the Director had erred in rejecting the  petition without "a reflective consideration and analysis," observing  that the Director's refusal "was not the kind of agency action that  promoted the kind of interchange and refinement of views that is the  lifeblood of a sound administrative process."  NORML v. Ingersoll, 162  U.S. App. D.C. 67, 497 F.2d 654, 659 (1974).  The court remanded the  matter in January 1974 for further proceedings not inconsistent with its  opinion, "to be denominated a consideration on the merits."  Id.      A three-day hearing was held at DEA [footnote 2] by Administrative  Law Judge Lewis Parker in January 1975.  The judge found in NORML's favor  on several issues but the Acting Administrator of DEA entered a final  order denying NORML's petition "in all respects."  NORML again petitioned  the court for review.  Finding fault _________________ 2    DEA became the successor agency to BNDD in a reorganization carried      out pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, eff. July 1,      1973.  38 Fed Reg. 15932 (1973).                                   - 2 - with DEA's final order the court again remanded for further proceedings  not inconsistent with its opinion.  NORML v. DEA, 182 U.S. App. D.C. 114,  559 F.2d 735 (1977).  The Court directed the then-Acting Administrator of  DEA to refer NORML's petition to the Secretary of the Department of  Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) for findings and, thereafter, to  comply with the rulemaking procedures outlined in the Act at 21 U.S.C. §  811 (a) and (b).      On remand the Administrator of DEA referred NORML's petition to HEW for scientific and medical evaluation.  On June 4, 1979 the Secretary of HEW advised the Administrator of the results of the HEW evaluation and recommended that marijuana remain in Schedule I.  Without holding any further hearing the Administrator of DEA proceeded to issue a final order ten days later denying NORML's petition and declining to initiate proceedings to transfer marijuana from Schedule I.  44 Fed. Reg. 36123 (1979).  NORML went back to the Court of Appeals.      When the case was called for oral argument there was discussion of  the then-present status of the matter.  DEA had moved for a partial  remand.  The court found that "reconsideration of all the issues in this  case would be appropriate" and again remanded it to DEA, observing: "We  regrettably find it necessary to remind respondents [DEA and HEW] of an  agency's obligation on remand not to 'do anything which is contrary to  either the letter or spirit of the mandate construed in the light of the  opinion of [the] court deciding the case.'"  (Citations omitted.)  NORML  v. DEA, et al., No. 79.1660, United States Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia Circuit, unpublished order filed October 16, 1980.   DEA was directed to refer all the substances at issue to the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS), successor agency to HEW, for scien-                                   - 3 - tific and medical findings and recommendations on scheduling.  DEA did so and HHS has responded.  In a letter dated April 1, 1986 the then-Acting Deputy Administrator of DEA requested this administrative law judge to commence hearing procedures as to the proposed rescheduling of marijuana and its components.      After the Judge conferred with counsel for NORML and DEA, a notice  was published in the Federal Register on June 24, 1986 announcing that  hearings would be held on NORML's petition for the rescheduling of  marijuana and its components commencing on August 21, 1986 and giving any  interested person who desired to participate the opportunity to do so.   51 Fed. Reg. 22946 (1986).      Of the three original petitioning organizations in 1972 only NORML  is a party to the present proceeding.  In addition the following entities responded to the Federal Register notice and have become parties, participating to varying degrees:  the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (ACT), Cannabis Corporation of America (CCA) and Carl Eric Olsen, all seeking transfer of marijuana to Schedule II; the Agency, National Federation of Parents for Drug free Youth (NFP) and the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), all contending that marijuana should remain in Schedule I.      Preliminary prehearing sessions were held on August 21 and December  5, 1986 and on February 20, 1987. [footnote 3]  During the preliminary  stages, on January 20, 1987, NORML filed an amended petition for  rescheduling.  This new petition abandoned NORML's previous requests for  the complete descheduling of marijuana or rescheduling to Schedule V.  It  asks only that marijuana be placed in Schedule II.      At a prehearing conference on February 20, 1987 this amended  petition was _______________ 3    Transcripts of these three preliminary prehearing sessions are      included in the record.                                   - 4 - discuss. [footnote 4]  All Parties present stipulated, for the purpose of this proceeding, that marijuana has a high potential for abuse and that abuse of the marijuana plant may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.  They then agreed that the principal issue in this proceeding would be stated thus:           Whether the marijuana plant, considered as a whole, [footnote           5] may ________________ 4    The transcript of this prehearing conference and of the subsequent      hearing session comprise 15 volumes numbered as follows:           Vol. I     -  Prehearing Conference, October 16, 1987           Vol. II    -  Cross Examination, November 19, 1987           Vol. III   -  Cross Examination, December 8, 1987           Vol. IV    -  Cross Examination, December 9, 1987           Vol. V     -  Cross Examination, January 5, 1988           Vol. VI    -  Cross Examination, January 6, 1988           Vol. VII   -  Cross Examination, January 7, 1988           Vol. VIII  -  Cross Examination, January 26, 1988           Vol. IX    -  Cross Examination, January 27, 1988           Vol. X     -  Cross Examination, January 28, 1988           Vol. XI    -  Cross Examination, January 29, 1988           Vol. XII   -  Cross Examination, February 2, 1988           Vol. XIII  -  Cross Examination, February 4, 1988           Vol. XIV   -  Cross Examination, February 5, 1988           Vol. XV    -  Oral Argument, June 10, 1988 Pages of the transcript are cited herein by volume and page, e.g. "Tr.

Two subsidiary issues were agreed on, as follows:           1.  Whether the marijuana plant has a currently accepted               medical use in treatment in the United States, or a               currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.           2.  Whether there is a lack of accepted safety for use of               the marijuana plant under medical supervision. As stated above, the parties favoring transfer from Schedule I to Schedule II are NORML, ACT, CCA and Carl Eric Olsen.  Those favoring retaining marijuana in Schedule I are the Agency, NFP and IACP.      During the Spring and Summer of 1987 the parties identified their witnesses and put the direct examination testimony of each witness in writing in affidavit form.  Copies of these affidavits were exchanged. Similarly, the parties assembled their proposed exhibits and exchanged copies.  Opportunity was provided for each party to submit objections to the direct examination testimony and exhibits proffered by the others.   The objections submitted were considered by the administrative law judge  and ruled on.  The testimony and exhibits not excluded were admitted into  the record.  Thereafter hearing sessions were held at which witnesses  were subjected to cross-examination.  These sessions were held in New  Orleans, Louisiana on November 18 and 19, 1987; in San Francisco,  California on December 8 and 9, 1987; and in Washington, D.C. on January  5 through 8 and 26 through 29, and on February 2, 4 and 5, 1988.  The  parties have submitted proposed findings and conclusions and briefs.   Oral arguments were heard by the judge on June 10, 1988 in Washington.                                   - 6 -                                    II.                             RECOMMENDED RULING      It is recommended that the proposed findings and conclusions  submitted by the parties to the administrative law judge be rejected by  the Administrator except to the extent they are included in those  hereinafter set forth; for the reason that they are irrelevant or unduly  repetitious or not supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  21  C.F.R. § 1316.65(a)(1).                                    III.                                   ISSUES      As noted above, the agreed issues are as follows:           Principle issue:           Whether the marijuana plant, considered as a whole, may           lawfully be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of           the schedules established by the Controlled Substances Act.           Subsidiary issues:           1.  Whether the marijuana plant has a currently accepted               medical use in treatment in the United States, or a               currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.           2.  Whether there is a lack of accepted safety for use of               the marijuana plant under medical supervision.                                   - 7 -                                    IV.                   STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHEDULING      The Act provides (21 U.S.C. § 812(b)) that a drug or other substance may not be placed in any schedule unless certain specified findings are made with respect to it.  The findings required for Schedule I and  Schedule II are as follows:           Schedule I. -             (A)  The drug or other substance has a high potential           for abuse.             (B)  The drug or other substance has no currently accepted           medical use in treatment in the United States.             (C)  There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the           drug or other substance under medical supervision.           Schedule II. -             (A)  The drug or other substance has a high potential for           abuse.             (B)  The drug or other substance has a currently accepted           medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently           accepted medical use with severe restrictions.             (C)  Abuse of the drug or other substances [sic] may lead to           severe psychological or physical dependence.      As noted above the parties have stipulated, for the purpose of this proceeding, that marijuana has a high potential for abuse and that abuse  of it may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.  Thus the dispute between the two sides in this proceeding is narrowed to whether  or not marijuana has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and whether or not there is a lack of accepted safety for use of marijuana under medical supervision.      The issues as framed here contemplate marijuana's being placed only  in                                   - 8 - Schedule I or Schedule II.  The criteria for placement in any of the  other three schedules established by the Act are irrelevant to this  proceeding.                                   - 9 -                                     V.                     ACCEPTED MEDICAL USE IN TREATMENT                               - CHEMOTHERAPY      With respect to whether or not marijuana has a "currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States" for chemotherapy patients, the record shows the following facts to be uncontroverted. Findings Of Fact           1.  One of the most serious problems experienced by cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy for their cancer is severe nausea and vomiting caused by their reaction to the toxic (poisonous) chemicals administered to them in the course of this treatment.  This nausea and vomiting at times becomes life threatening.  The therapy itself creates a tremendous strain on the body.  Some patients cannot tolerate the severe nausea and vomiting and discontinue treatment.  Beginning in the 1970's there was considerable doctor-to-doctor communication in the United  States concerning patients known by their doctors to be surreptitiously  using marijuana with notable success to overcome or lessen their nausea  and vomiting.           2.  Young patients generally achieve better control over nausea and vomiting from smoking marijuana than do older patients, particularly when the older patient has not been provided with detailed information on how to smoke marijuana.           3.  Marijuana cigarettes in many cases are superior to  synthetic THC capsules in reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and  vomiting.  Marijuana                                   - 10 - cigarettes have an important, clear advantage over synthetic THC capsules in that the natural marijuana is inhaled and generally takes effect more quickly than the synthetic capsule which is ingested and must be  processed through the digestive system before it takes effect.           4.  Attempting to orally administer the synthetic THC capsule  to a vomiting patient presents obvious problems - it is vomited right  back up before it can have any effect.           5.  Many physicians, some engaged in medical practice and some teaching in medical schools, have accepted smoking marijuana as effective in controlling or reducing the severe nausea and vomiting (emesis) experienced by some cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.           6.  Such physicians include board-certified internists, oncologists and psychiatrists.  (Oncology is the treatment of cancer through the use of highly toxic chemicals, or chemotherapy.)           7.  Doctors who have come to accept the usefulness of marijuana in controlling or reducing emesis resulting from chemotherapy have dose  so as the result of reading reports of studies and anecdotal reports in  their professional literature, and as the result of observing patients  and listening to reports directly from patients.           8.  Some cancer patients who have acknowledged to doctors that they smoke marijuana for emesis control have indicated in their  discussions that, although they may have first smoked marijuana  recreationally, they accidentally found that doing so helped reduce the  emesis resulting from their chemotherapy.  They consistently indicated  that they felt better and got symptomatic relief from the intense nausea  and vomiting caused by the chemotherapy.  These patients                                    - 11 - were no longer simply getting high, but were engaged in medically  treating their illness, albeit with an illegal substance.  Other  chemotherapy patients began smoking marijuana to control their emesis  only after hearing reports that the practice had proven helpful to  others.  Such patients had not smoked marijuana recreationally.           9.  This successful use of marijuana has given many cancer chemotherapy patients a much more positive outlook on their overall treatment, once they were relieved of the debilitating, exhausting and extremely unpleasant nausea and vomiting previously resulting from their chemotherapy treatment.          10.  In about December 1977 the previously underground patient practice of using marijuana to control emesis burst into the public media in New Mexico when a young cancer patient, Lynn Pearson, began publicly  to discuss his use of marijuana.  Mr. Pearson besought the New Mexico legislature to pass legislation making marijuana available legally to seriously ill patients whom it might help.  As a result, professionals in the public health sector in New Mexico more closely examined how  marijuana might be made legally available to assist in meeting what now  openly appeared to be a widely recognized patient need.          11.  In many cases doctors have found that, in addition to suppressing nausea and vomiting, smoking marijuana is a highly successful appetite stimulant.  The importance of appetite stimulation in cancer therapy cannot be overstated.  Patients receiving chemotherapy often lose tremendous amounts of weight.  They endanger their lives because they  lose interest in food and in eating.  The resulting sharp reduction in  weight may well affect their prognosis.  Marijuana smoking induces some  patients to eat.  The benefits are obvious, doctors have found.  There is  no significant loss of weight.  Some patients will gain weight.                                   - 12 - This allows them to retain strength and makes them better able to fight  the cancer.  Psychologically, patients who can continue to eat even while receiving chemotherapy maintain a balanced outlook and are better able to cope with their disease and its treatment, doctors have found.          12.  Synthetic anti-emetic agents have been in existence and utilized for a number of years.  Since about 1980 some new synthetic  agents have been developed which appear to be more effective in  controlling and reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting than  were some of those available in the 1970's.  But marijuana still is found  more effective for this purpose in some people than any of the synthetic  agents, even the newer ones.          13.  By the late 1970's in the Washington, D.C. area there was a growing recognition among health care professionals and the public that marijuana had therapeutic value in reducing the adverse effects of some chemotherapy treatments.  With this increasing public awareness came increasing pressure from patients on doctors for information about marijuana and its therapeutic uses.  Many patients moved into forms of unsupervised self-treatment.  While such self-treatment often proved very effective, it has certain hazards, ranging from arrest for purchase or  use of an illegal drug to possibly serious medical complications from contaminated sources or adulterated materials.  Yet, some patients are willing to run these risks to obtain relief from the debilitating nausea and vomiting caused by their chemotherapy treatments.          14.  Every oncologist known to one Washington, D.C. practicing internist and board-certified oncologist has had patients who used marijuana with great success to prevent or diminish chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.  Chemotherapy patients reporting directly to that Washington doctor that they                                   - 13 - have smoked marijuana medicinally vomit less and eat better than patients who do not smoke it.  By gaining control over their severe nausea and vomiting these patients undergo a change of mood and have a better mental outlook than patients who, using the standard anti-emetic drugs, are  unable to gain such control.          15.  The vomiting induced by chemotherapeutic drugs may last up  to four days following the chemotherapy treatment.  The vomiting can be intense, protracted and, in some instances, is unendurable.  The nausea which follows such vomiting is also deep and prolonged.  Nausea may  prevent a patient from taking regular food or even much water for periods  of weeks at a time.          16.  Nausea and vomiting of this severity degrades the quality  of life for these patients, weakening them physically, and destroying the  will to fight the cancer.  A desire to end the chemotherapy treatment in  order to escape the emesis can supersede the will to live.  Thus the  emesis, itself, can truly be considered a life-threatening consequence of  many cancer treatments.  Doctors have known such cases to occur.  Doctors  have known other cases where marijuana smoking has enabled the patient to endure, and thus continue, chemotherapy treatments with the result that  the cancer has gone into remission and the patient has returned to a  full, active satisfying life.          17.  In San Francisco chemotherapy patients were surreptitiously using marijuana to control emesis by the early 1970's.  By 1976 virtually every young cancer patient receiving chemotherapy at the University of California in San Francisco was using marijuana to control emesis with great success.  The use of marijuana for this purpose had become  generally accepted by the patients and increasingly by their physicians  as a valid and effective form of treatment.  This was particularly true  for younger cancer patients, somewhat less common for                                   - 14 - older ones.  By 1979 about 25% to 30% of the patients seen by one San Francisco oncologist were using marijuana to control emesis, about 45 to 50 patients per year.  Such percentages and numbers vary from city to  city.  A doctor in Kansas City who sees about 150 to 200 new cancer  patients per year found that over the 15 years 1972 to 1987 about 5% of  the patients he saw, or a total of about 75, used marijuana medicinally.          18.  By 1987 marijuana no longer generated the intense interest  in the world of oncology that it had previously, but it remains a viable  tool, commonly employed, in the medical treatment of chemotherapy  patients.  There has evolved an unwritten but accepted standard of  treatment within the community of oncologists in the San Francisco,  California area which readily accepts the use of marijuana.          19.  As of the Spring of 1987 in the San Francisco area,  patients receiving chemotherapy commonly smoked marijuana in hospitals  during their treatments.  This in-hospital use, which takes place in  rooms behind closed doors, does not bother staff, is expected by  physicians and welcomed by nurses who, instead of having to run back and  forth with containers of vomit, can treat patients whose emesis is better  controlled than it would be without marijuana.  Medical institutions in  the Bay area where use of marijuana obtained on the streets is quite  common, although discrete, include the University of California at San  Francisco Hospital, the Mount Zion Hospital and the Franklin Hospital.   In effect, marijuana is readily accepted throughout the oncologic  community in the bay area for its benefits in connection with  chemotherapy.  The same situation exists in other large metropolitan  areas of the United States.          20.  About 50% of the patients seen by one San Francisco oncologist                                   - 15 - Click here for Part 2WT01-B19-135IA087-000627-B022-38http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/MEDICAL/YOUNG/young2.html 206.61.184.43 19970122053730 text/html 39215HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:37:21 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:02:47 GMTContent-length: 38999 Judge Young - Part 2 during the year l987 were smoking marijuana medicinally. This is about 90 to 95 individuals. This number is higher than during the previous ten years due to the nature of this physician's practice which includes patients from the "tenderloin" area of San Francisco, many of whom are suffering from AIDS-related lymphosarcoma. These patients smoke marijuana to control their nausea and vomiting, not to "get high." They self- titrate, i.e., smoke the marijuana only as long as needed to overcome the nausea, to prevent vomiting.          21.  The State of New Mexico set up a program in 1978 to make  marijuana available to cancer patients pursuant to an act of the State  legislature.  The legislature had accepted marijuana as having medical  use in treatment.  It overwhelmingly passed this legislation so as to  make marijuana available for use in therapy, not just for research.   Marijuana and synthetic THC were given to patients, administered under  medical supervision, to control or reduce emesis.  The marijuana was in  the form of cigarettes obtained from the Federal government.  The program  operated from 1979 until 1986, when funding for it was terminated by the  State.  During those seven years about 250 cancer patients in New Mexico  received either marijuana cigarettes or THC.  Twenty or 25 physicians in  New Mexico sought and obtained marijuana cigarettes or THC for their  cancer patients during that period.  All of the oncologists in New Mexico  accepted marijuana as effective for some of their patients.  At least ten  hospitals involved in this program in New Mexico, in which cancer  patients smoked their marijuana cigarettes.  The hospitals accepted this  medicinal marijuana smoking by patients.  Voluminous reports filed by the  participating physicians make it clear that marijuana is a highly  effective anti-emetic substance.  It was found in the New Mexico program  to be far superior to the best available conventional                                   - 16 - anti-emetic drug, compazine, and clearly superior to synthetic THC pills.   More than 90% of the patients who received marijuana within the New  Mexico program reported significant or total relief from nausea and  vomiting.  Before the program began cancer patients were surreptitiously  smoking marijuana in New Mexico to lessen or control their emesis  resulting from chemotherapy treatments.  They reported to physicians that  it was successful for this purpose.  Physicians were aware that this was  going on.          22.  In 1978 the Louisiana legislature became one of the first- State legislatures in the nation to recognize the efficacy of marijuana  in controlling emesis by enacting legislation intended to make marijuana available by prescription for therapeutic use by chemotherapy patients.   This enactment shows that there was widespread acceptance in Louisiana of the therapeutic value of marijuana.  After a State Marijuana  Prescription Review Board was established, pursuant to that legislation,  it became apparent that, because of Federal restrictions, marijuana could  be obtained legally only for use in cumbersome, formal research programs.   Eventually a research program was entered into by the State, utilizing synthetic THC, but without much enthusiasm, since most professionals who had wanted to use marijuana clinically, to treat patients, had neither the time, resources nor inclination to get involved in this limited, formal study.  The original purpose of the Louisiana legislation was frustrated by the Federal authorities.  Some patients, who had hoped to  obtain marijuana for medical use legally after enactment of the State legislation, went outside the law and obtained it illicitly.  Some  physicians in Louisiana accept marijuana as having a distinct medical  value in the treatment of the nausea and vomiting associated with certain types of chemotherapy treatments.                                   - 17 -          23.  In 1980 the State of Georgia enacted legislation  authorizing a therapeutic research program for the evaluation of  marijuana as a medically recognized therapeutic substance.  Its enactment  was supported by letters from a number of Georgia oncologist and other  Georgia physician, including the Chief of oncology at Grady Hospital and  staff oncologist at Emory University Medical Clinic.  Sponsors of the  legislation originally intended the enactment of a law making marijuana  available for clinical, therapeutic use by patients.  The bill was  referred to as the "Marijuana-as-Medicine" bill.  The final legislation  was crafted, however, of necessity, merely to set up a research program  in order to obtain marijuana from the one legitimate source available -  the Federal Government, which would not make the substance available for  any other purpose other than conducting a research program.  The act was  passed by an overwhelming majority in the lower house of the legislature  and unanimously in the Senate.  In January 1983 an evaluation of the  program, which by then had 44 evaluable marijuana smoking patient- participants, accepted marijuana smoking as being an effective anti- emetic agent.          24.  In Boston, Massachusetts in 1977 a nurse in a hospital  suggested to a chemotherapy patient, suffering greatly from the therapy  and at the point of refusing further treatment, that smoking marijuana  might help relieve his nausea and vomiting.  The patient's doctor, when  asked about it later, stated that many of his younger patients were  smoking marijuana.  Those who did so seemed to have less trouble with  nausea and vomiting.  The patient in question obtained some marijuana and  smoked it, in the hospital, immediately before his next chemotherapy  treatment.  Doctors, nurses, and orderlies coming into the room as he  finished smoking realized what the patient had been doing.  None of them                                   - 18 - made any comment.  The marijuana was completely successful with this  patient, who accepted it as effective in controlling his nausea and  vomiting.  Instead of being sick for weeks following chemotherapy, and  having trouble going to work, as had been the case, the patient was ready  to return to work 48 hours after that chemotherapy treatment.  The  patient thereafter always smoked marijuana, in the hospital, before chemotherapy.  The doctors were aware of it, openly approved of it and  encouraged him to continue.  The patient resumed eating regular meals and  regained lost eight, his mood improved markedly, he became more active  and outgoing and began doing things together with his wife that he had  not done since beginning chemotherapy.          25.  During the remaining two years of this patient's life,  before his cancer ended it, he came to know other cancer patients who  were smoking marijuana to relieve the adverse effects of their  chemotherapy.  Most of these patients had learned about using marijuana  medically from their doctors who, having accepted its effectiveness,  subtly encouraged them to use it.          26.  A Boston psychiatrist and professor, who travels about the  country, has found a minor conspiracy to break the law among oncologists  and nurses in every oncology center he has visited to let patients smoke  marijuana before and during cancer chemotherapy.  He has talked with  dozens of these health care oncologists who encourage their patients to  do this and who regard this as an accepted medical usage of marijuana.   He has known nurses who have obtained marijuana for patients unable to  obtain it for themselves.          27.  A cancer patient residing in Beaverton, Michigan smoked  marijuana medicinally in the nearby hospital where he was undergoing  chemotherapy from early 1979 until he died of his cancer in October of  that year.  He smoked it in                                   - 19 - his hospital room after his parents made arrangements with the hospital for him to do so.  Smoking marijuana controlled his post-chemotherapy  nausea and vomiting, enabled him to eat regular-meals again with his  family, and he became outgoing and talkative.  His parents accepted his  marijuana smoking as effective and helpful.  Two clergymen, among others,  brought marijuana to this patient's home.  Many people at the hospital  supported the patient's marijuana therapy, none doubted its helpfulness  or discouraged it.  This patient was asked for help by other patients.   He taught some who lived nearby how to form the marijuana cigarettes and  properly inhale the smoke to obtain relief from nausea and vomiting.   When an article about this patient's smoking marijuana appeared in a  local newspaper, he and his family heard from many other cancer patients  who were doing the same.  Most of them made an effort to inform their  doctors.  Most Physicians who knew their patients smoked marijuana  medicinally approved, accepting marijuana's therapeutic helpfulness in  reducing nausea and vomiting.          28.  In October 1979 the Michigan legislature enacted  legislation whose underlying purpose was to make marijuana available  therapeutically for cancer patients and others.  The State Senate passed  the bill 29-5, the House of Representatives 100-0.  In March 1982 the  Michigan legislature passed a resolution asking the Federal Congress to  try to alter Federal policies which prevent physicians from prescribing  marijuana for legitimate medical applications and prohibit its use in  medical treatments.          29.  In Denver, Colorado a teenage cancer patient has been  smoking marijuana to control nausea and vomiting since 1986.  He has done  this in his hospital room both before and after chemotherapy.  His doctor  and hospital staff know he does this.  The doctor has stated that he  would prescribe marijuana for                                   - 20 - this patient if it were legal to do so.  Other patients in the Denver  area smoke marijuana for the same purpose.  This patient's doctor, and  nurses with whom he comes in contact, understand that cancer patients  smoke marijuana to reduce or control emesis.  They accept it.          30.  In late 1980 a three year old boy was brought by his  parents to a hospital in Spokane, Washington.  The child was diagnosed as  having cancer.  Surgery was performed.  Chemotherapy was begun.  The  child became extremely nauseated and vomited for days after each  chemotherapy treatment.  He could not eat regularly.  He lost strength.   He lost weight.  His body's ability to ward off common infections, other  life-threatening infections, significantly decreased.  Chemotherapy's  after-effects caused the child great suffering.  They caused his watching  parents great suffering.  Several standard, available anti-emetic agents  were tried by the child's doctors.  None of them succeeded in controlling  his nausea or vomiting.  Learning of the existence of research studies  with THC or marijuana the parents asked the child's doctor to arrange for  their son to be the subject of such a study so that he might have access  to marijuana.  The doctor refused, citing the volume of paperwork and  record-keeping detail required in such programs and his lack of  administrative personnel to handle it.          31.  The child's mother read an article about marijuana smoking  helping chemotherapy patients.  She obtained some marijuana from friends.   She baked cookies for her child with marijuana in them.  She made tea for  him with marijuana in it.  When the child ate these cookies or drank this  tea in connection with his chemotherapy, he did not vomit.  His strength  returned.  He regained lost weight.  His spirits revived.  The parents  told the doctors and nurses at the hospital of their giving marijuana to  their child.  None objected.                                   - 21 - They all accepted smoking marijuana as effective in controlling  chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.  They were interested to see  the results of the cookies.          32.  Soon this child was riding a tricycle in the hallways of  the Spokane hospital shortly after his chemotherapy treatments while  other children there were still vomiting into pans, tied to intravenous  bottles in an attempt to re-hydrate them, to replace the liquids they  were vomiting up.  Parents of some of the other patients asked the  parents of this "lively" child how he seemed to tolerate his chemotherapy  so well.  They told of the marijuana use.  Of those parents who began  giving marijuana to their children, none ever reported back encountering  any adverse side effects.  In the vast majority of these cases, the other  parents reported significant reduction in their children's vomiting and  appetite stimulation as the result of marijuana.  The staff, doctors and  nurses at the hospital knew of this passing on of information about  marijuana to other parents.  They approved.  They never told the first  parents to hide their son's medicinal use of marijuana.  They accepted  the effectiveness of the cookies and the tea containing marijuana.          33.  The first child's cancer went into remission.  Then it  returned and spread.  Emotionally drained, the parents moved the family  back to San Diego, California to be near their own parents.  Their son  was admitted to a hospital in San Diego.  The parents informed the  doctors, nurses and social workers there of their son's therapeutic use  of marijuana.  No one objected.  The child's doctor in San Diego strongly  supported the parent's giving marijuana to him.  Here in California, as  in Spokane, other parents noticed the striking difference between their  children after chemotherapy and the first child.                                   - 22 - Other parents asked the parents of the first child about it, were told of the use of marijuana, tried it with their children, and saw dramatic improvement.  They accepted its effectiveness.  In the words of the  mother of the first child: ". . . When your kid is riding a tricycle  while his other hospital buddies are hooked up to IV needles, their heads  hung over vomiting buckets, you don't need a federal agency to tell you  marijuana is effective.  The evidence is in front of you, so stark it  cannot be ignored."  [footnote 6]          34.  There is at least one hospital in Tucson, Arizona where  medicinal use of marijuana by chemotherapy patients is encouraged by the  nursing staff and some physicians.          35.  In addition to the physicians mentioned in the Findings  above, mostly oncologists and other practitioners, the following doctors  and health care professionals, representing several different areas of expertise, accept marijuana as medically useful in controlling or  reducing emesis and testified to that effect in these proceedings:                a.  George Goldstein, Ph.D., psychologist, Secretary of  Health for the State of New Mexico from 1978 to 1983 and chief  administrator in the implementation of the New Mexico program utilizing  marijuana;                b.  Dr. Daniel Danzak, psychiatrist and former head of the  New Mexico program utilizing marijuana;                c.  Dr. Tod Mikuriya, psychiatrist and editor of  Marijuana: Medical Papers, a book presenting an historical perspective of  marijuana's medical use;                d.  Dr. Norman Zinberg, general psychiatrist and Professor  of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School since 1951; ____________________ 6    Affidavit of Janet Andrews, ACT rebuttal witness, par. 98.                                   - 23 -                e.  Dr. John Morgan, psychopharmacologist, Board-certified  in Internal Medicine, full Professor and Director of Pharmacology at the  City University of New York;                f.  Dr. Phillip Jobe, neuropsychopharmacologist with a  practice in Illinois and former Professor of Pharmacology and Psychiatry  at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine in Shreveport,  Louisiana, from 1974 to 1984;                g.  Dr. Arthur Kaufman, formerly a general practitioner in  Maryland, currently Vice-President of a private medical consulting group  involved in the evaluation of the quality of care of all the U.S.  military hospitals throughout the world, who has had extensive experience  in drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation programs;                h.  Dr. J. Thomas Ungerleider, a full Professor of  Psychiatry at the University of California in Los Angeles with extensive  experience in research on the medical use of drugs;                i.  Dr. Andrew Weil, ethnopharmacologist, Associate  Director of Social Perspectives in Medicine at the College of Medicine at  the University of Arizona, with extensive research on medicinal plants;  and                j.  Dr. Lester Grinspoon, a practicing psychiatrist and  Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School.          36.  Certain law enforcement authorities have been outspoken in  their acceptance of marijuana as an antiemetic agent.  Robert T. Stephan,  Attorney General of the State of Kansas, and himself a former cancer  patient, said of chemotherapy in his affidavit in this record: "The  treatment becomes a terror."  His cancer is now in remission.  He came to  know a number of health care professionals whose medical judgment he  respected.  They had accepted marijuana                                   - 24 - as having medical use in treatment.  He was elected Vice President of the  National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) in 1983.  He was  instrumental in the adoption by that body in June 1983 of a resolution  acknowledging the efficacy of marijuana for cancer and glaucoma patients.   The resolution expressed the support of NAAG for legislation then pending  in the Congress to make marijuana available on prescription to cancer and  glaucoma patients.  The resolution was adopted by an overwhelming margin.   NAAG's President, the Attorney General of Montana, issued a statement  that marijuana does have accepted medical uses and is improperly  classified at present.  The Chairman of NAAG's Criminal Law and Law  Enforcement Committee, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, issued a  statement emphasizing that the proposed rescheduling of marijuana would  in no way affect or impede existing efforts by law enforcement  authorities to crack down on illegal drug trafficking.          37.  At least one court has accepted marijuana as having medical  use in treatment for chemotherapy patients.  On January 23, 1978 the  Superior Court of Imperial County, California issued orders authorizing a  cancer patient to possess and use marijuana for therapeutic purposes  under the direction of a physician.  Another order authorized and  directed the Sheriff of the county to release marijuana from supplies on  hand and deliver it to that patient in such form as to be usable in the  form of cigarettes.          38.  During the period 1978-1980 polls were taken to ascertain  the degree of public acceptance of marijuana as effective in treating  cancer and glaucoma patients.  A poll in Nebraska brought slightly over  1,000 responses - 83% favored making marijuana available by prescription,  12% were opposed, 5% were undecided.  A poll in Pennsylvania elicited  1,008 responses - 83.1% favored availability by prescription, 12.2% were  opposed, 4.7% were undecided.  These                                   - 25 - two surveys were conducted by professional polling companies.  The  Detroit Free Press conducted a telephone poll in which 85.4% of those  responding favored access to marijuana by prescription.  In the State of  Washington the State Medical Association conducted a poll in which 80% of  the doctors belonging to the Association favored controlled availability  of marijuana for medical purposes. Discussion      From the foregoing uncontroverted facts it is clear beyond any  question that many people find marijuana to have, in the words of the  Act, an "accepted medical use in treatment in the United States" in  effecting relief for cancer patients.  Oncologists, physicians treating  cancer patients, accept this.  Other medical practitioners and  researchers accept this.  Medical faculty professors accept it.  Nurses  performing hands-on patient care accept it.      Patients accept it.  As counsel for CCA perceptively pointed out at  oral argument, acceptance by the patient is of vital importance.  Doctors  accept a therapeutic agent or process only if it "works" for the patient.   If the patient does not accept, the doctor cannot administer the  treatment.  The patient's informed consent is vital.  The doctor  ascertains the patient's acceptance by observing and listening to the  patient.  Acceptance by the doctor depends on what he sees in the patient  and hears from the patient.  Unquestionably, patients in large numbers  have accepted marijuana as useful in treating their emesis.  They have  found that it "works".  Doctors, evaluating their patients, can have no basis more sound than that for their own acceptance.      Of relevance, also, is the acceptance of marijuana by state  attorneys-                                   - 26 - general, officials whose primary concern is law enforcement.  A large  number of them have no fear that placing marijuana in Schedule II, thus  making it available for legitimate therapy, will in any way impede  existing efforts of law enforcement authorities to crack down on illegal  drug trafficking.      The Act does not specify by whom a drug or substance must be  "accepted [for] medical use in treatment" in order to meet the Act's  "accepted" requirement for placement in Schedule II.  Department of  Justice witnesses told the Congress during hearings in 1970 preceding  passage of the Act that "the medical Profession" would make this  determination, that the matter would be "determined by the medical  community."  The Deputy Chief Counsel of BNDD, whose office had written  the bill with this language in it, told the House subcommittee that "this  basic determination . . . is not made by any part of the federal  government.  It is made by the medical community as to whether or not the  drug has medical use or doesn't". [footnote 7]      No one would seriously contend that these Justice Department  witnesses meant that the entire medical community would have to be in  agreement on the usefulness of a drug or substance.  Seldom, if ever, do  all lawyers agree on a point of law.  Seldom, if ever, do all doctors  agree on a medical question.  How many are required here?  A majority of  51%?  It would be unrealistic to attempt a plebiscite of all doctors in  the country on such a question every time it arises, to obtain a majority  vote.      In determining whether a medical procedure utilized by a doctor is actionable as malpractice the courts have adopted the rule what it is  acceptable ____________________ 7    Drug Abuse Control Amendments - 1970: Hearings on H.R. 11701 and      H.R. 13743 Before the Subcommittee on Public Health and Welfare of      the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 91st      Congress, 2d Sess. 678, 696, 718 (1970) (Statement of John E.      Ingersoll, Director, BNDD).                                   - 27 - for a doctor to employ a method of treatment supported by a respectable  minority of physicians.      In Hood v. Phillips, 537 S.W. 2d 291 (1976) the Texas Court of Civil  Appeals was dealing with a claim of medical malpractice resulting from a  surgical procedure claimed to have been unnecessary.  The court quoted  from an Arizona court decision holding that           a method of treatment, as espoused and used by . . . a           respectable minority of physicians in the United States,           cannot be said to be an inappropriate method of treat-           ment or to be malpractice as a matter of law even though           it has not been accepted as a proper method of treatment           by the medical profession generally. Ibid. at 294.  Noting that the Federal District court in the Arizona case found a "respectable minority" composed of sixty-five physicians  throughout the United States, the Texas court adopted as "the better  rule" to apply in its case, that           a physician is not guilty of malpractice where the           method of treatment used is supported by a respect-           able minority of physicians. Ibid.      In Chumbler v. McClure, 505 F.2d 489 (6th Cir. 1974) the Federal  courts were dealing with a medical malpractice case under their diversity  jurisdiction, applying Tennessee law, The Court of Appeals said:           . . . The most favorable interpretation that may be           placed on the testimony adduced at trial below is           that there is a division of opinion in the medical           profession regarding the use of Premarin in the Treat-           ment of cerebral vascular insufficiency, and that Dr.           McClure was alone among neurosurgeons in Nashville in           using such therapy.  The test for malpractice and for           community standards is not to be determined solely by           a plebiscite.  Where two or more schools of thought           exist among competent members of the medical profes-           sion concerning proper medical treatment for a given           ailment, each of which is supported by responsible                                   - 28 -           medical authority, it is not malpractice to be among           the minority in a given city who follow: one of the           accepted schools. 505 F.2d at 492 (Emphasis added).  See, also, Leech v. Bralliar, 275  F.Supp. 897 (D.Ariz., 1967).      How do we ascertain whether there exists a school of thought  supported by responsible medical authority, and thus "accepted"?  We  listen to the physicians.                The court and jury must have a standard measure           which they are to use in measuring the acts of a           doctor to determine whether he exercised a reasonable           degree of care and skill; they are not permitted to           set up and use any arbitrary or artificial standard           of measurement that the jury may wish to apply.  The           proper standard of measurement is to be established           by testimony of physicians, for it is a medical           question. Hayes v. Brown, 133 S.E. 2d. 102 (Ga., 1963) at 105.      As noted above, there is no question but that this record shows a  great many physicians, and others, to have "accepted" marijuana as having  a medical use in the treatment of cancer patients' emesis.  True, all  physicians have not "accepted" it.  But to require universal, 100%  acceptance would be unreasonable.  Acceptance by "a respectable minority"  of physicians is all that can reasonably be required.  The record here  establishes conclusively that at least "a respectable minority" of  physicians has "accepted" marijuana as having a "medical use in treatment  in the United states."  That others may not makes no difference.      The administrative law judge recommended this same approach for  determining whether a drug has an "accepted medical use in treatment" in  The Matter Of MDMA Scheduling, Docket No. 84-48.  The Administrator, in  his first final rule in that proceeding, issued on October 8, 1986  [footnote 8], declined to adopt this approach.  He ____________________ 8    51  Fed. Reg. 36552 (1986).                                   - 29 - ruled, instead, that DEA's decision on whether or not a drug or other substance had an accepted medical use in treatment in the United States would be determined simply by ascertaining whether or not "the drug or other substance is lawfully marketed in the United States pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 . . . ." [footnote 9]      The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that  the Administrator erred in so ruling. [footnote 10]  That court vacated  the final order of October 8, 1986 and remanded the matter of MDMA's  scheduling for further consideration.  The court directed that, on  remand, the Administrator would not be permitted to treat the absence of  interstate marketing approval by FDA as conclusive evidence on the  question of accepted medical use under the Act.      In his third final rule [footnote 11] of the matter of the  scheduling of MDMA the Administrator made a series of findings of fact as  to MDMA, the drug there under consideration, with respect to the evidence  in that record.  On those findings he based his last final rule in the  case. [footnote 12] ____________________ 9    Ibid., at 36558. 10   Grinspoon v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 828 F.2d 881 (1st.      Cir., 1987). 11   53 Fed. Reg. 5156 (1988).  A second final rule had been issued on      January 20, 1988.  It merely removed MDMA from Schedule I pursuant      to the mandate of the Court of Appeals which had voided the first      final rule placing it there.  Subsequently the third final rule was      issued, without any further hearings, again placing MDMA in Schedule      I.  There was no further appeal. 12   In neither the first nor the third final rule in the MDMA case does      the Administrator take any cognizance of the statements to the      Congressional committee by predecessor Agency officials that the      determination as to "accepted medical use in treatment" is to be      made by the medical community and not by any part of the federal      government.  See page 27, above.  It is curious that the      administrator makes no effort whatever to show how the BNDD      representatives were mistaken or to explain why he now has abandoned      their interpretation.  They wrote that language into the original      bill.                                   - 30 - That third final rule dealing with MDMA is dealing with a synthetic,  "simple", "single-action" drug.  What might be appropriate criteria for a  "simple" drug like MDMA may not be appropriate for a "complex" substance  with a number of active components.  The criteria applied to MDMA, a  synthetic drug, are not appropriate for application to marijuana, which  is a natural plant substance.      The First Circuit Court of Appeals in the MDMA case told the  Administrator that he should not treat the absence of FDA interstate  marketing approval as conclusive evidence of lack of currently accepted  medical use.  The court did not forbid the Administrator from considering  the absence of FDA approval as a factor when determining the existence of  accepted medical use.  Yet on remand, in his third final order, the  Administrator adopted by reference 18 of the numbered findings he had  made in the first final order.  Each of these findings had to do with  requirements imposed by FDA for approval of a new drug application (NDA)  or of an investigational new drug exemption (IND).  These requirements  deal with data resulting from controlled studies and scientifically  conducted investigations and test.      Among those findings incorporated into the third final MDMA order  from the first, and relied on by the Administrator, was the determination  and recommendation of the FDA that the drug there in question was not  "accepted".  In relying on the FDA's action the Administrator apparently  overlooked the fact that the FDA clearly stated that it was interpreting  "accepted medical use" in the Act as being equivalent to receiving FDA  approval for lawful marketing under the FDCA.  Thus the Administrator  accepted as a basis for his MDMA third final rule the FDA recommendation  which was based upon a statutory interpretation which the Court                                   - 31 - of Appeals had condemned.      The Administrator in that third final rule made a series of further  findings.  Again, the central concern in these findings was the content  of test results and the sufficiency or adequacy of studies and scientific  reports.  A careful reading of the criteria considered in the MDMA third  final order reveals that the Administrator was really considering the  question: Should the drug be accepted for medical use?; rather than the  question: Has the drug been accepted for medical use?  By considering  little else but scientific test results and reports the Administrator  was making a determination as to whether or not, in his opinion, MDMA  ought to be accepted for medical use in treatment.      The Agency's arguments in the present case are to the same effect.   In a word, they address the wrong question.  It is not for this Agency to  tell doctors whether they should or should not accept a drug or substance  for medical use.  The statute directs the Administrator merely to  ascertain whether, in fact, doctors have done so.      The MDMA third final order mistakenly looks to FDA criteria for  guidance in choosing criteria for DEA to apply.  Under the Food, Drug and  Cosmetic Act the FDA is deciding - properly, under that statute - whether  a new drug should be introduced into interstate commerce.  Thus it is  appropriate for the FDA to rely heavily on test results and scientific  inquiry to ascertain whether a drug is effective and whether it is safe.   The FDA must look at a drug and pass judgment on its intrinsic  qualities.  The DEA, on the other hand, is charged by 21 U.S.C. §  812(b)(1)(B) and (2)(B) with ascertaining what it is that other people  have done with respect to a drug or substance: "Have they accepted it?;"  not "Should they accept it?"                                   - 32 - In the MDMA third final order DEA is actually making the decision  that doctors have to make, rather than trying to ascertain the decision  which doctors have made.  Consciously or not, the Agency is undertaking  to tell doctors what they should or should not accept.  In so doing the  Agency is acting beyond the authority granted in the Act.      It is entirely proper for the Administrator to consider the  pharmacology of a drug and scientific test results in connection with  determining abuse potential.  But abuse potential is not in issue in this  marijuana proceeding.      There is another reason why DEA should not be guided by FDA criteria  in ascertaining whether or not marijuana has an accepted medical use in  treatment.  These criteria are applied by FDA pursuant to Section 505 of  the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), as amended. [footnote 13]   When the FDA is making an inquiry pursuant to that legislation it is  looking at a synthetically formed new drug.  The marijuana plant is  anything but a new drug.  Uncontroverted evidence in this record  indicates that marijuana was being used therapeutically by mankind 2000  years before the Birth of Christ. [footnote 14]      Uncontroverted evidence further establishes that in this country  today "new drugs" are developed by pharmaceutical companies possessing  resources sufficient to bear the enormous expense of testing a new drug,  obtaining FDA approval of its efficacy and safety, and marketing it  successfully.  No company undertakes the investment required unless it  has a patent on the drug, so it can recoup its development costs and make  a profit.  At oral argument Government counsel conceded that "the FDA  system is constructed for pharmaceutical companies.  I won't ____________________ 13   21 U.S.C. § 355. 14   Alice M. O'Leary, direct, par. 9.                                   - 33 - deny that." [footnote 15]      Since the substance being considered in this case is a natural plant  rather than a synthetic drug, it is unreasonable to make FDA-type  criteria determinative of the issue in this case, particularly so when  such criteria are irrelevant to the question posed by the act: does the  substance have an accepted medical use in treatment?      Finally, the Agency in this proceeding relies in part on the FDA's recommendation that the Administrator retain marijuana in Schedule I.   But, as in the MDMA case, that recommendation is based upon FDA's  equating "accepted medical use" under the Act with being approved for  marketing by FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the  interpretation condemned by the First Circuit in the MDMA case.  See  Attachment A, p.24, to exhibit G-1 and exhibit G-2.      The overwhelming preponderance of the evidence in this record  establishes that marijuana has a currently accepted medical use in  treatment in the United States for nausea and vomiting resulting from  chemotherapy treatments in some cancer patients.  To conclude otherwise,  on this record, would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious. ____________________ 15   Tr.

ACCEPTED MEDICAL USE IN TREATMENT                               - GLAUCOMAFindings of Fact     The preponderance of the evidence establishes the following facts with respect to the accepted medical use of marijuana in the treatment ofglaucoma.          1.  Glaucoma is a disease of the eye characterized by the excessive accumulation of fluid causing increased intraocular pressure, distorted vision and, ultimately, blindness.  In its early stages this pressure can sometimes be relieved by the administration of drugs.  When such medical treatment fails adequately to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP), surgery is generally resorted to.  Although useful in many cases, there is a high incidence of failure with some types of surgery.  Further, serious complications can occur as a result of invasive surgery.  Newer, non-invasive procedures such as laser trabeculoplasty are thought by some to offer much greater efficacy with fewer complications.  Unless the IOP is relieved and brought to a satisfactory level by one means or another, the patient will go blind.          2.  Two highly qualified and experienced ophthalmologists in the United States have accepted marijuana as having a medical use in treatment for glaucoma.  They are John C. Merritt, M.D. and Richard D. North, M.D.  Each of them is both a clinician, treating patients, and a researcher.  Dr. Merritt is also a professor of ophthalmology.  Dr. North has served as a medical officer in ophthalmology for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and has worked with the Public Health Service and FDA.                                 - 35 -           3.  Dr. Merritt's experience with glaucoma patients using marijuana medicinally includes one Robert Randall and, insofar as the evidence here establishes per petitioners' briefs, an unspecified number of other patients, something in excess of 40.          4.  Dr. North has treated only one glaucoma patient using marijuana medicinally - the same Robert Randall mentioned immediately above.  Dr. North had monitored Mr. Randall's medicinal use of marijuana for nine years as of May 1987          5.  Dr. Merritt has accepted marijuana as having an important place in the treatment of "End Stage" glaucoma.  "End Stage" glaucoma, essentially, defines a patient who has already lost substantial amounts of vision; available glaucoma control drugs are no longer able adequately to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent further, progressive sight loss; the patient, lacking additional IOP reductions, will go blind.          6.  Robert S. Hepler, M.D., is a highly qualified and experienced ophthalmologist.  He has done research with respect to the effect of smoking marijuana on glaucoma.  In December 1975 he prescribed marijuana for the same Robert Randall mentioned above as a research subject.  Dr. Hepler found that large dosages of smoked marijuana effectively reduced Robert Randall's IOP into the safe range over an entire test day.  He concluded that the only known alternative to preserve Randall's sight which would avoid the significant risks of surgery is to include marijuana as part of Randall's prescribed medical regimen.  He further concluded in 1977 that, if marijuana could have been legally prescribed, he would have prescribed it for Randall as part of Randall's regular glaucoma maintenance program had he been Randall's personal physician.                                 - 36 - Nonetheless, in 1987 Dr. Hepler was of the opinion that marijuana didnot have a currently accepted medical use in the United States for thetreatment of glaucoma.          7.  Four glaucoma patients testified in these proceedings.  Each has found marijuana to be of help in controlling IOP.          8.  In 1984 the treatment of glaucoma with Cannabis was the subject of an Ophthalmology Grand Rounds at the University of California, San Francisco.  A questionnaire was distributed which queried the ophthalmologists on cannabis therapy for glaucoma patients refractory to standard treatment.  Many of them have glaucoma patients who have asked about marijuana.  Most of the responding ophthalmologists believed that THC capsules or smoked marijuana need to be available for patients who have not benefited significantly from standard treatment.          9.  In about 1978 an unspecified number of persons in the public health service sector in New Mexico, including some physicians, accepted marijuana as having medical use in treating glaucoma.         10.  A majority of an unspecified number of ophthalmologists known to Arthur Kaufman, M.D., who was formerly in general practice but now is employed as a medical program administrator, accept marijuana as having medical use in treatment of glaucoma.         11.  In addition to the physicians identified and referred to in the findings above, the testimony of patients in this record establishes that no more than three or four other physicians consider marijuana to be medically useful in the treatment of glaucoma in the United States.  One of those Physicians actually wrote a prescription for marijuana for a patient, which, of course, she was unable to have filled.                                 - 37 -          12.  There are test results showing that smoking marijuana has reduced the IOP in some glaucoma patients.  There is continuing research underway in the United States as to the therapeutic effect of marijuana on glaucoma.Discussion     Petitioners' briefs fail to show that the preponderance of the evidence in the record with respect to marijuana and glaucoma establishes that a respectable minority of physicians accepts marijuana as being useful in the treatment of glaucoma in the United States.     This conclusion is not to be taken in any way as criticism of the opinions of the ophthalmologists who testified that they accept marijuana for this purpose.  The failure lies with petitioners.  In their briefs they do not point out hard, specific evidence in this record sufficient to establish that a respectable minority of physicians has accepted their position.     There is a great volume of evidence here, and much discussion in the briefs, about the protracted case of Robert Randall.  But when all is said and done, his experience presents but one case.  The record contains sworn testimony of three ophthalmologists who have treated Mr. Randall.  One of them tells us of a relatively small number of other glaucoma patients whom he has treated with marijuana and whom he knows to have responded favorably.  Another of these three doctors has successfully treated only Randall with marijuana.  The third testifies, despite his successful experience in treating Randall, that marijuana does not have an accepted use in such treatment.     In addition to Robert Randall, Petitioners point to the testimony of three other glaucoma patients.  Their case histories are impressive, but they contribute                                 - 38 - little to the carrying of Petitioner's burden of showing that marijuana is accepted for medical treatment of glaucoma by a respectable minority of physicians.  See pages 26-29, above.     Petitioners have in evidence copies of a number of newspaper clippings reporting statements by persons claiming that marijuana has helped their glaucoma.  The administrative law judge is unable to give significant weight to this evidence.  Had these persons testified so as to have been subject to cross-examination, a different situation would be presented.  But these newspaper reports of extra-judicial statements, neither tested by informed inquiry nor supported by a doctor's opinion, are not entitled to much weight.  They are of little, if any, materiality.     Beyond the evidence referred to above there is a little other "hard" evidence, pointed out by petitioners, of Physicians accepting marijuana for treatment of glaucoma.  Such evidence as that concerning a survey of a group of San Francisco ophthalmologists is ambiguous, at best.  The relevant document establishes merely that most of the doctors on the grand round, who responded to an inquiry, believed that the THC capsules or marijuana ought to be available.     In sum, the evidence here tending to show that marijuana is accepted for treatment of glaucoma falls far, far short of quantum of evidence tending to show that marijuana is accepted for treatment of emesis in cancer patients.  The preponderance of the evidence here, identified by petitioners in their briefs, does not establish that a respectable minority of physicians has accepted marijuana for glaucoma treatment.                                 - 39 -                                   VII.                   ACCEPTED MEDICAL USE IN TREATMENT                    - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, SPASTICITY                        AND HYPERPARATHYROIDISMFindings Of Fact     The preponderance of the evidence clearly establishes the following facts with respect to marijuana's use in connection with multiple sclerosis, spasticity and hyperparathyroidism.          1.  Multiple sclerosis is the major cause of neurological disability among young and middle-aged adults in the United States today.  It is a life-long disease.  It can be extremely debilitating to some of its victims but it does not shorten the life span of most of them.  Its cause is yet to be determined.  It attacks the myelin sheath, the coating or insulation surrounding the message-carrying nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord.  Once the myelin sheath is destroyed, it is replaced by plaques of hardened tissue known as sclerosis.  During the initial stages of the disease nerve impulses are transmitted with only minor interruptions.  As the disease progresses, the plaques may completely obstruct the impulses along certain nerve systems.  These obstructions produce malfunctions.  The effects are sporadic in most individuals and the effects often occur episodically, triggered either by malfunction of the nerve impulses or by external factors.          2.  Over time many patients develop spasticity, the involuntary and abnormal contraction of muscle or muscle fibers.  (Spasticity can also result from serious injuries to the spinal cord, not related to multiple sclerosis.)          3.  The symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary according to the area of                                 - 40 - the nervous system which is affected and according to the severity of the disease.  The symptoms can include one or more of the following:  weakness, tingling, numbness, impaired sensation, lack of coordination, disturbances in equilibrium, double vision, loss of vision, involuntary rapid movement of the eyes (nystagmus), slurred speech, tremors, stiffness, spasticity, weakness of limbs, sexual dysfunction, paralysis, and impaired bladder and bowel functions.          4.  Each person afflicted by multiple sclerosis is affected differently.  In some persons, the symptoms of the disease are barely detectable, even over long periods of time.  In these cases, the persons can live their lives as if they did not suffer from the disease.  In others, more of the symptoms are present and acute, thereby limiting their physical capabilities.  Moreover, others may experience sporadic, but acute, symptoms.          5.  At this time, there is no known prevention or cure for multiple sclerosis.  Instead, there are only treatments for the symptoms of the disease.  There are very few drugs specifically designed to treatspasticity.  These drugs often cause very serious side effects.  At the present time two drugs are approved by FDA as "safe" and "effective" for the specific indication of spasticity.  These drugs are Dantrium and Lioresal baclofen.          6.  Unfortunately, neither Dantrium nor Lioresal is a very effective spasm control drug.  Their marginal medical utility, high toxicity and potential for serious adverse effects make these drugs difficult to use in spasticity therapy.          7.  As a result, many physicians routinely prescribe tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, mood elevators and sedatives such as Valium to patients experiencing spasticity.  While these drugs do not directly reduce spasticity                                 - 41 - they may weaken the patient's muscle tone, thus making the spasms less noticeable.  Alternatively, they may induce sleep or so tranquilize the patient that normal mental and physical functions are impossible.          8.  A healthy, athletic young woman named Valerie Cover was stricken with multiple sclerosis while in her early twenties.  She consulted several medical specialists and followed all the customary regimens and prescribed methods for coping with this debilitating disease over a period of several years.  None of these proved availing.  Two years after first experiencing the symptoms of multiple sclerosis her active, productive life - as an athlete, Navy officer's wife and mother - was effectively over.  The Social Security Administration declared her totally disabled.  To move about her home she had to sit on a skateboard and push herself around.  She spent most of her time in bed or sitting in a wheelchair.          9.  An occasional marijuana smoker in her teens, before her marriage, she had not smoked it for five years as of February 1986.  Then a neighbor suggested that marijuana just might help Mrs. Cover's multiple sclerosis, having read that it had helped cancer patient's control their emesis.  Mrs. Cover acceded to the suggestion.         10.  Just before smoking the marijuana cigarette produced by her neighbor, Mrs. Cover had been throwing up and suffering from spasms.  Within five minutes of smoking part of the marijuana cigarette she stopped vomiting, no longer felt nauseous and noticed that the intensity of her spasms was significantly reduced.  She stood up unaided.         11.  Mrs. Cover began smoking marijuana whenever she felt nauseated.  When she did so it controlled her vomiting, stopped the nausea and increased her                                 - 42 - appetite.  It helped ease and control her spasticity.  Her limbs were much easier to control.  After three months of smoking marijuana she could walk unassisted, had regained all of her lost weight, her seizures became almost nonexistent.  She could again care for her children.  She could drive an automobile again.  She regained the ability to lead a normal life.         12.  Concerned that her use of this illegal substance might jeopardize the career of her Navy officer husband, Mrs. Cover stopped smoking marijuana several times.  Each time she did so, after about a month, she had retrogressed to the point that her multiple sclerosis again had her confined to bed and wheelchair or skateboard.  As of the Spring of 1987 Mrs. Cover had resumed smoking marijuana regularly on an "as needed" basis.  Her multiple sclerosis symptoms are under excellentcontrol.  She has obtained a full-time job.  She still needs a wheelchair on rare occasions, but generally has full use of her limbs and can walk around with relative ease.         13.  Mrs. Cover's doctor has accepted the effectiveness of marijuana in her case.  He questioned her closely about her use of it, telling her that it is the most effective drug known in reducing vomiting.  Mrs. Cover and her doctor are now in the process of filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with FDA so that she can legally obtain the marijuana she needs to lead a reasonably normal life.         14.  Martha Hirsch is a young woman in her mid-thirties.  She first exhibited symptoms of multiple sclerosis at age 19 and it was diagnosed at that time.  Her condition has grown progressively worse.  She has been under the care of physicians and hospitalized for treatment.  Many drugs have been prescribed for her by her doctors.  At one point in 1983 she listed the drugs that had been                                 - 43 - prescribed for her.  There were 17 on the list.  None of them has given her the relief from her multiple sclerosis symptoms that marijuana has.         15.  During the early stages in the development of her illness Ms. Hirsch found that smoking marijuana improved the quality of her life, keeping her spasms under control.  Her balance improved.  She seldom needed to use her cane for support.  Her condition lately has deteriorated.  As of May l987 she was experiencing severe, painful spasms.  She had an indwelling catheter in her bladder.  She had lost her locomotive abilities and was wheelchair bound.  She could seldom find marijuana on the illegal market and, when she did, she often could not afford to purchase it.  When she did obtain some, however, and smoked it, her entire body seemed to relax, her spasms decreased or disappeared, she slept better and her dizzy spells vanished.  The relaxation of her leg muscles after smoking marijuana has been confirmed by her personal care attendant's examination of them.         16.  The personal care attendant has told Ms. Hirsch that she, the attendant, treats a number of patients who smoke marijuana for relief of multiple sclerosis symptoms.  In about 1980 another patient told Ms. Hirsch that he knew many patients who smoke marijuana to relieve their spasms.  Through him she met other patients and found that marijuana was commonly used by many multiple sclerosis patients.  Most of these persons had told their doctors about their doing so.  None of those doctors advised against the practice and some encouraged it.         17.  Among the drugs prescribed by doctors for Ms. Hirsch was ACTH.  This failed to give her any therapeutic benefit or to control her spasticity.  It did produce a number of adverse effects, including severe nausea and vomiting which, in turn, were partly controlled by rectally administered anti-emetic                                 - 44 - drugs.         18.  Another drug prescribed for her was Lioresal, intended to reduce her spasms.  It was not very effective in doing.  But it did cause Ms. Hirsch to have hallucinations.  On two occasions, while using this drug, Ms. Hirsch "saw" a large fire in her bedroom and called for help.  There was no fire.  She stopped using that drug.  Ms. Hirsch has experienced no adverse reactions with marijuana.         19.  Ms. Hirsch's doctor has accepted marijuana as beneficial for her.  He agreed to write her a prescription for it, if that would help her obtain it.  She has asked him if he would file an IND application with the FDA for her.  He replied that the paperwork was "overwhelming".  He indicated willingness to put the paper work together.         20.  When Greg Paufler was in his early twenties, employed by Prudential Insurance Company, he began to experience the first symptoms of multiple sclerosis.  His condition worsened as the disease intensified.  He had to be hospitalized.  He lost the ability to walk, to stand.  Diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis, a doctor prescribed ACTH for him, an intensive form of steroid therapy.  He lost all control over his limbs and experienced severe, painful spasms.  His arms and legs became numb.         21.  ACTH had no beneficial effects.  The doctor continued to prescribe it many months.  ACTH made Paufler ravenously hungry and he began gaining a great deal of weight.  ACTH caused fluid retention and Paufler became bloated, rapidly gaining weight.  His doctor thought Paufler should continue this steroid therapy, even though it caused the adverse effects mentioned plus the possibility of sudden heart attack or death due to respiratory failure.  Increased dosages                                 - 45 - of this FDA-approved drug caused fluid to press against Paufler's lungs making it difficult for him to breathe and causing his legs and feet to become swollen.  The steroid therapy caused severe, intense depression marked by abrupt mood shifts.  Throughout, the spasms continued and Paufler's limbs remained out of control.  The doctor insisted that ACTH was the only therapy likely to be of any help with the multiple sclerosis, despite its adverse effects.  Another, oral, steroid was eventually substituted.         22.  One day Paufler became semi-catatonic while sitting in his living room at home.  He was rushed to the hospital emergency room.  He nearly died.  Lab reports indicated, among other things, a nearly total lack of potassium in his body.  He was given massive injections of potassium in the emergency room and placed on an oral supplement.  Paufler resolved to take no more steroids.         23.  From time to time, prior to this point, Paufler had smoked marijuana socially with visiting friends, seek some relief from his misery in a temporary "high".  He now began smoking marijuana more often.  After some weeks he found that he could stand and then walk a bit.  His doctor dismissed the idea that marijuana could be helpful with multiple sclerosis, and Paufler, himself, was skeptical at first.  He began discontinuing it for a while, then resuming.         24.  Paufler found that when he did not smoke marijuana his condition worsened, he suffered more intense spasms more frequently.  When he smoked marijuana, his condition would stabilize and then improve;spasms were more controlled and less severe; he felt better; he regained control over his limbs and could walk totally unaided.  His vision, often blurred and unfocused, improved.  Eventually he began smoking marijuana on a daily basis.  He ventured outdoors.  He was soon walking half a block.  His eyesight returned to normal.                                 - 46 - His central field blindness cleared up.  He could focus well enough to read again.  One evening he went out with his children and found he could kick a soccer ball again.         25.  Paufler has smoked marijuana regularly since 1980.  Since that time his multiple sclerosis has been well controlled.  His doctor has been astonished at Paufler's recovery.  Paufler can now run.  He can stand on one foot with his eyes closed.  The contrast with his condition, several years ago, seems miraculous.  Smoking marijuana when Paufler feels an attack coming on shortens the attack.  Paufler's doctor has looked Paufler in the eye and told him to keep doing whatever it is he's doing because it works.  Paufler and his doctor are exploring the possibility of obtaining a compassionate IND to provide legal access to marijuana for Paufler.         26.  Paufler learned in about 1980 of the success of one Sam Diana, a multiple sclerosis patient, in asserting the defense of "medical necessity" in court when charged with using or possessing marijuana.  He learned that doctors, researchers and other multiple sclerosis patients had supported Diana's position in the court proceeding.         27.  Irwin Rosenfeld has been diagnosed as having Pseudo Pseudo Hypoparathyroidism.  This uncommon disease causes bone spurs to appear and grow all over the body.  Over the patient's lifetime hundreds of these spurs can grow, any one of which can become malignant at any time.  The resulting cancer would spread quickly and the patient would die.         28.  Even without development of a malignancy, the disease causes enormous pain.  The spurs press upon adjacent body tissue, nerves and organs.  In Rosenfeld's case, he could neither sit still nor lie down, nor could he walk,                                 - 47 - without experiencing pain.  Working in his furniture store in Portsmouth, Virginia, Mr. Rosenfeld was on his feet moving furniture all day long.  The lifting and walking caused serious problems as muscles and tissues rubbed over the spurs of bone.  He tore muscles and hemorrhaged almost daily.         29.  Rosenfeld's symptoms first appeared about the age of ten.  Various drugs were prescribed for him for pain relief.  He was taking extremely powerful narcotics.  By the age of 19 his therapy included 300 mg. of Sopor (a powerful sleeping agent) and very high doses of Dilaudid.  He was found to be allergic to barbiturates.  Taking massive doses of pain control drugs, as prescribed, made it very difficult for Rosenfeld to function normally.  If he took enough of them to control the pain, he could barely concentrate on his schoolwork.  By the time he reached his early twenties Rosenfeld's monthly drug intake was between 120 to 140 Dilaudid tablets, 30 or more Sopor sleeping pills and dozens of muscle relaxants.         30.  At college in Florida Rosenfeld was introduced to marijuana by classmates.  He experimented with it recreationally.  He never experienced a "high" or "buzz" or "floating sensation" from it.  One day he smoked marijuana while playing chess with a friend.  It had been very difficult for him to sit for more than five or ten minutes at a time because of tumors in the backs of his legs.  Suddenly he realized that, absorbed in his chess game, and smoking marijuana, he had remained sitting for over an hour - with no pain.  He experimented further and found that his pain was reduced whenever he smoked marijuana.         31.  Rosenfeld told his doctor of his discovery.  The doctor opined that it was possible that the marijuana was relieving the pain.  Something                                 - 48 - certainly was - there was a drastic decrease in Rosenfeld's need for such drugs as Dilaudid and Demerol and for sleeping pills.  The quality of pain relief which followed his smoking of marijuana was superior to any he had experienced before.  As his dosages of powerful conventional drugs decreased, Rosenfeld became less withdrawn from the world, more able to interact and function.  So he has continued to the present time.         32.  After some time Rosenfeld's doctor accepted the fact that the marijuana was therapeutically helpful to Rosenfeld and submitted an IND application to FDA to obtain supplies of it legally for Rosenfeld.  The doctor has insisted, however, that he not be publicly identified.  After some effort the IND application was granted.  Rosenfeld is receiving supplies of marijuana from NIDA.  Rosenfeld testified before a committee of the Virginia legislature in about 1979 in support of legislation to make marijuana available for therapeutic purposes in that State.         33.  In 1969, at age 19, David Branstetter dove into the shallow end of a swimming pool and broke his neck.  He became a quadriplegic, losing control over the movement of his arms and legs.  After being hospitalized for 18 months he returned home.  Valium was prescribed for him to reduce the severe spasms associated with his condition.  He became mildly addicted to Valium.  Although it helped mask his spasms, it made Branstetter more withdrawn and less able to take care of himself.  He stopped taking Valium for fear of the consequences of long-term addiction.  His spasms then became uncontrollable, often becoming so bad they would throw him from his wheelchair.         34.  In about 1973 Branstetter began smoking marijuana recreationally.  He discovered that his severe spasms stopped whenever he smoked marijuana.                                 - 49 - Unlike Valium, which only masked his symptoms and caused him to feel drunk and out of control, marijuana brought his spasmodic condition under control without impairing his faculties.  When he was smoking marijuana regularly he was more active, alert and outgoing.         35.  Marijuana controlled his spasms so well that Branstetter could go out with friends and he began to play billiards again.  The longer he smoked marijuana the more he was able to use his arms and hands.  Marijuana also improved his bladder control and bowel movements.         36.  At times the illegal marijuana Branstetter was smoking became very expensive and sometimes was unavailable.  During periods when he did not have marijuana his spasms would return, preventing Branstetter from living a "normal" life.  He would begin to shake uncontrollably, his body would feel tense, and his muscles would spasm.         37.  In 1979 Branstetter was arrested and convicted of possession of marijuana.  He was placed on probation for two years.  During that period he continued smoking marijuana and truthfully reported this, and the reason for it, to his probation officer whenever asked about it.  No action was taken against Branstetter by the court or probation authorities because of his continuing use of marijuana, except once in the wake of his publicly testifying about it before the Missouri legislature.  Then, although adverse action was threatened by the judge, nothing was actually done.         38.  In 1981 Branstetter and a friend, a paraplegic, participated in a research study testing the therapeutic effects of synthetic THC on spasticity.  Placed on the THC Branstetter found that it did help control his spasms but appeared to became less effective with repeated use.  Also, unlike marijuana,                                 - 50 - synthetic THC had a powerful mind-altering effect he found annoying.  When the study ended the researcher strongly suggested that Branstetter continue smoking marijuana to control his spasms.         39.  None of Branstetter's doctors have told him to stop smoking marijuana while several, directly and indirectly, have encouraged him to continue.  Branstetter knows of almost 20 other patients, paraplegics, quadriplegics and multiple sclerosis sufferers, who smoke marijuana to control their spasticity.         40.  In 1981 a State of Washington Superior Court judge, sitting without a jury, found Samuel D. Diana not guilty of the charge of unlawful possession of marijuana.  In so doing the judge upheld Diana's defense of medical necessity.  Diana had been a multiple sclerosis patient since at least 1973.  He testified that smoking marijuana relieved his symptoms of double vision, tremors, unsteady walk, impaired hearing, tendency to vomit in the mornings and stiffness in the joints of his hands and legs.         41.  Among the witnesses was a physician who had examined defendant Diana before and after he had used marijuana.  This doctor testified that marijuana had been effective therapeutically for Diana, that other medication had proven ineffective for Diana and that, while marijuana may have some detrimental effects, Diana would receive more benefit than harm from smoking it.  The doctor was not aware of any other drug that would be as effective as marijuana for Mr. Diana.  Other witnesses included three persons afflicted with multiple sclerosis who testified in detail as to marijuana's beneficial effect on their illness.         42.  In acquitting defendant Diana of unlawful possession of marijuana the trial judge found that the three requirements for the defense of medical necessity had been established, namely: defendant's reasonable belief that his                                 - 51 - use of marijuana was necessary to minimize the effects of multiple sclerosis; the benefits derived from its use are greater than the harm sought to be prevented by the controlled substances law; and no drug is as effective as marijuana in minimizing the effects of the disease in the defendant.         43.  Denis Petro, M.D., is a neurologist of broad experience, ranging from active practice in neurology to teaching the subject in medical school and employment by FDA as a medical officer reviewing IND's and NDA's.  He has also been employed by pharmaceutical companies and has served as a consultant to the State of New York.  He is well acquainted with the case histories of three patients who have successfully utilized marijuana to control severe spasticity when other, FDA-approved drugs failed to do so.  Dr. Petro knows of other cases of patients who, he has determined, have effectively used marijuana to control their spasticity.  He has heard reports of additional patients with multiple sclerosis, paraplegia and quadriplegia doing the same.  There are reports published in the literature known to Dr. Petro, over the period at least 1970 - 1986, of clinical tests demonstrating that marijuana and THC are effective in controlling or reducing spasticity in patients.         44.  Large numbers of paraplegic and quadriplegic patients, particularly in Veterans Hospitals, routinely smoke marijuana to reduce spasticity.  While this mode of treatment is illegal, it is generally tolerated, if not openly encouraged, by physicians in charge of such wards who accept this practice as being of benefit to their patients.  There are many spinal cord injury patients in Veterans Hospitals.         45.  Dr. Petro sought FDA approval to conduct research with spasticity patients using marijuana.  FDA refused but, for reasons unknown to him, allowed                                 - 52 - Click here for Part 4WT01-B19-137IA087-000627-B022-93http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/MEDICAL/YOUNG/young4.html 206.61.184.43 19970122053759 text/html 30440HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 05:37:49 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:02:28 GMTContent-length: 30224 Judge Young - Part 4 him to make a study using synthetic THC.  He and colleagues made such a study.  They concluded that synthetic THC effected a significant reduction in spasticity among multiple sclerosis patients, but study participants who had also smoked marijuana reported consistently that marijuana was more effective.         46.  Dr. Petro accepts marijuana as having a medical use in the treatment of spasticity in the United States.  If it were legally available and he was engaged in an active medical practice again, he would not hesitate to prescribe marijuana, when appropriate, to patients afflicted with uncontrollable spasticity.         47.  Dr. Petro presented a paper to a meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.  The paper was accepted for presentation.  After he presented it Dr. Petro found that many of the neurologists present at this most prestigious meeting were in agreement with his acceptance of marijuana as having a medical use in the treatment of spasticity.         48.  Dr. Andrew Weil, a general medicine practitioner in Tucson, Arizona, who also teaches at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, accepts marijuana as having a medical use in the treatment of spasticity.  In multiple sclerosis patients the muscles become tense and rigid because their nerve supply is interrupted.  Marijuana relieves this spasticity in many patients, he has found.  He would prescribe it to selected patients if it were legally available,         49.  Dr. Lester B. Collins, III, a neurologist, then treating about 20 multiple sclerosis patients a year, seeing two or three new ones each year, stated in 1983 that he had no doubt that marijuana worked symptomatically for some multiple sclerosis patients.  He said that it does not alter the course of                                 - 53 - the disease but it does relieve the symptoms of spasticity.         50.  Dr. John P. Morgan, board certified in internal medicine, Professor of Medicine and Director of Pharmacology at CCNY Medical School in New York and Associate Professor of Medicine and Pharmacology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, accepts marijuana as having medical use in treatment in the United States.  If he were practicing medicine and marijuana were legally available he would prescribe it when indicated to patients with legitimate medical needs.Discussion     Based upon the rationale set out in pages 26 to 34, above, the administrative law judge concludes that, within the meaning of the Act, 21 U.S.C. � 812(b)(2)(B), marijuana "has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States" for spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis and other causes.  It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious to find otherwise.  The facts set out above, uncontroverted by the Agency, establish beyond question that some doctors in the United States accept marijuana as helpful in such treatment for some patients.  The record here shows that they constitute a significant minority of physicians.  Nothing more can reasonably be required.  That some doctors would have more studies and test results in hand before accepting marijuana's usefulness here is irrelevant.     The same is true with respect to the hyperparathyroidism from which Irvin Rosenfeld suffers.  His disease is so rare, and so few physicians appear to be familiar with it, that acceptance by one doctor of marijuana as being useful in treating it ought to satisfy the requirement for a significant minority.  The Agency points to no evidence of record tendingto establish that marijuana is                                - 54 - not accepted by doctors in connection with this most unusual ailment.  Refusal to acknowledge acceptance by a significant minority, in light of the case history detailed in this record, would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious.                                 - 55 -                                   VIII.            ACCEPTED SAFETY FOR USE UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION     With respect to whether or not there is "a lack of accepted safety for use of [marijuana] under medical supervision", the record shows the following facts to be uncontroverted.Findings of Fact          1.  Richard J. Gralla, M.D., an oncologist and Professor of Medicine who was an Agency witness, accepts that in treating cancer patients oncologists can use the cannabinoids with safety despite their side effects.          2.  Andrew T. Weil, M.D., who now practices medicine in Tucson, Arizona and is on the faculty of the College of Medicine, University of Arizona, was a member of the first team of researchers to perform a Federal Government authorized study into the effects of marijuana on human subjects.  This team made its study in 1968.  These researchers determined that marijuana could be safely used under medical supervision.  In the 20 years since then Dr. Weil has seen no information that would cause him to reconsider that conclusion.  There is no question in his mind but that marijuana is safe for use under appropriate medical supervision.          3.  The most obvious concern when dealing with drug safety is the possibility of lethal effects.  Can the drug cause death?          4.  Nearly all medicines have toxic, potentially lethal effects.  But marijuana is not such a substance.  There is no record in the extensive medical literature describing a proven, documented cannabis-induced fatality.                                 - 56 -           5.  This is a remarkable statement. First, the record on marijuana encompasses 5,000 years of human experience.  Second, marijuana is now used daily by enormous numbers of people throughout the world.  Estimates suggest that from twenty million to fifty million Americans routinely, albeit illegally, smoke marijuana without the benefit of direct medical supervision.  Yet, despite this long history of use and the extraordinarily high numbers of social smokers, there are simply no credible medical reports to suggest that consuming marijuana has caused a single death.          6.  By contrast aspirin, a commonly used, over-the-counter medicine, causes hundreds of deaths each year.          7.  Drugs used in medicine are routinely given what is called an LD-50.  The LD-50 rating indicates at what dosage fifty percent of test animals receiving a drug will die as a result of drug induced toxicity.  A number of researchers have attempted to determine marijuana's LD-50 rating in test animals, without success.  Simply stated, researchers have been unable to give animals enough marijuana to induce death.          8.  At present it is estimated that marijuana's LD-50 is around 1:20,000 or 1:40,000.  In layman terms this means that in order to induce death a marijuana smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much marijuana as is contained in one marijuana cigarette.  NIDA-supplied marijuana cigarettes weigh approximately .9 grams.  A smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.          9.  In practical terms, marijuana cannot induce a lethal response as a result of drug-related toxicity.                                 - 57 -          10.  Another common medical way to determine drug safety is called the therapeutic ratio.  This ratio defines the difference between a therapeutically effective dose and a dose which is capable of inducing adverse effects.         11. A commonly used over-the-counter product like aspirin has a therapeutic ratio of around 1:20.  Two aspirins are the recommended dose for adult patients.  Twenty times this dose, forty aspirins, may cause a lethal reaction in some patients, and will almost certainly cause gross injury to the digestive system, including extensive internal bleeding.         12.  The therapeutic ratio for prescribed drugs is commonly around 1:10 or lower.  Valium, a commonly used prescriptive drug, may cause very serious biological damage if patients use ten times the recommended (therapeutic) dose.         13.  There are, of course, prescriptive drugs which have much lower therapeutic ratios.  Many of the drugs used to treat patients with cancer, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis are highly toxic.  The therapeutic ratio of some of the drugs used in antineoplastic therapies, for example, are regarded as extremely toxic poisons with therapeutic ratios that may fall below 1:1.5.  These drugs also have very low LD-50 ratios and can result in toxic, even lethal reactions, while being properly employed.         14.  By contrast, marijuana's therapeutic ratio, like its LD-50, is impossible to quantify because it is so high.         15.  In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume.  For example, eating ten raw potatoes can result in a toxic response.  By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death.         16.  Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically                                 - 58 - active substances known to man.  By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of medical care.         17.  Some of the drugs most widely used in chemotherapy treatment of cancer have adverse effects as follows:               Cisplatin, one of the most powerful chemo-         therapeutic agents used on humans - may cause deafness;         may lead to life-threatening kidney difficulties and         kidney failure; adversely affects the body's immune         system, suppressing the patient's ability to fight a         host of common infections.               Nitrogen Mustard, a drug used in therapy for         Hodgkins disease - nauseates; so toxic to the skin         that, if dropped on the skin, this chemical literally         eats it away along with other tissues it contacts; if         patient's intravenous lead slips during treatment and         this drug gets on or under the skin the patient may         suffer serious injury including temporary, and in         extreme cases, permanent, loss of use of the arm.               Procarbizine, also used for Hodgkins disease -         has known psychogenic, i.e., emotional, effects.               Cyoxin, also known as Cyclophosphanide -         suppresses patient's immune system response; results         in serious bone marrow depletion; studies indicate         this drug may also cause other cancers, including         cancers of the bladder.               Adriamycan, has numerous adverse effects; is         difficult to employ in long term therapies because it         destroys the heart muscle.While each of these agents has its particular adverse effects, as indicated above, they also cause a number of similar, disturbing adverse effects.  Most of these drugs cause hair loss.  Studies increasingly indicate all of these drugs may cause other forms of cancer.  Death due to kidney, heart or respiratory failure is a very real possibility with all of these agents and the margin for error is minimal.  Similarly, there is a danger of overdosing a patient weakened by his cancer.  Put simply, there is very great risk associated with the medical                                 - 59 - use of these chemicals agents.  Despite these high risks, all of these drugs are considered "safe" for use under medical supervision and are regularly administered to patients on doctor's orders in the United States today.         18.  There have been occasional instances of panic reaction in patients who have smoked marijuana.  These have occurred in marijuana-naive persons, usually older persons, who are extremely anxious over the forthcoming chemotherapy and troubled over the illegality of their having obtained the marijuana.  Such persons have responded to simple person-to-person communication with a doctor and have sustained no long term mental or physical damage.  If marijuana could be legally obtained, and administered in an open, medically-supervised session rather than surreptitiously, the few instances of such adverse reaction doubtless would be reduced in number and severity.         19.  Other reported side effects of marijuana have been minimal.  Sedation often results.  Sometimes mild euphoria is experienced.  Short periods of increased pulse rate and of dizziness are occasionally experienced.  Marijuana should not be used by persons anxious or depressed or psychotic or with certain other health problems.  Physicians could readily screen out such patients if marijuana were being employed as an agent under medical supervision.         20.  All drugs have "side effects" and all drugs used in medicine for their therapeutic benefits have unwanted, unintended, sometimes adverse effects.         21.  In medical treatment "safety" is a relative term.  A drug deemed "safe" for use in treating a life-threatening disease might be "unsafe" if prescribed for a patient with a minor ailment.  The concept of drug "safety" is relative.  Safety is measured against the consequences a patient would confront in the absence of therapy.  The determination of "safety" is made in terms of                                  - 60 - whether a drug's benefits outweigh its potential risks and the risks of permitting the disease to progress.         22.  In the context of glaucoma therapy, it must be kept in mind that glaucoma, untreated, progressively destroys the optic nerve and results in eventual blindness.  The danger, then, to patients with glaucoma is an irretrievable loss of their sight.         23.  Glaucoma is not a mortal disease, but a highly specific, selectively incapacitating condition.  Glaucoma assaults and destroys the patient's most evolved and critical sensory ability, his or her vision.  The vast majority of patients afflicted with glaucoma are adults over the age of thirty.  The onset of blindness in middle age or later throws patients into a wholly alien world.  They can no longer do the work they once did.  They are unable to read a newspaper, drive a car, shop, walk freely and do all the myriad things sighted people take for granted.  Without lengthy periods of retraining, adaptation and great effort these individuals often lose their sense of identity and ability to function.  Those who are young enough or strong-willed enough will regain a sense of place, hold meaningful jobs, but many aspects of the life they once took for granted cannot be recaptured.  Other patients may never fully adjust to their new, uncertain circumstances.         24.  Blindness is a very grave consequence.  Protecting patients from blindness is considered so important that, for ophthalmologists generally, it justifies the use of toxic medicines and uncertain surgical procedures which in other contexts might be considered "unsafe."  In practice, physicians often provide glaucoma patients with drugs which have many serious adverse effects.         25.  There are only a limited number of drugs available for the                                 - 61 - treatment of glaucoma.  All of these drugs produce adverse effects.  While several government witnesses lightly touched on the side effects of these drugs, none provided a full or detailed description of their known adverse consequences.         26.  The adverse physical consequences resulting from the chronic use of commonly employed glaucoma control drugs include a vast range of unintended complications from mild problems like drug induced fevers, skin rashes, headaches, anorexia, asthma, pulmonary difficulties, hypertension, hypotension and muscle cramps to truly serious, even life-threatening complications including the formation of cataracts, stomach and intestinal ulcers, acute respiratory distress, increases and decreases in heart rate and pulse, disruption of heart function, chronic and acute renal disease, and bone marrow depletion.         27.  Finally, each FDA-approved drug family used in glaucoma therapy is capable of producing a lethal response, even when properly prescribed and used.  Epinephrine can lead to elevated blood pressure which may result in stroke or heart attack.  Miotic drugs suppress respiration and can cause respiratory Paralysis.  Diuretic drugs so alter basic body chemistry they cause renal stones and may destroy the patient's kidneys or result in death due to heart failure.  Timolol and related beta-blocking agents, the most recently approved family of glaucoma control drugs, can trigger severe asthma attacks or cause death due to sudden cardiac arrhythmias often producing cardiac arrest.         28.  Both of the FDA-approved drugs used in treating the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, Dantrium and Lioresal, while accepted as "safe" can, in fact, be very dangerous substances.  Dantrium or dantrolene sodium carries a boxed warning in the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR) because of its very high toxicity.  Patients using this drug run a very real risk of developing sympto-                                 - 62 - matic hepatitis (fatal and nonfatal).  The list of sublethal toxic reactions also underscores just how dangerous Dantrium can be.  The PDR, in part, notes Dantrium commonly causes weakness, general malaise and fatigue and goes on to note the drug can also cause constipation, GI bleeding, anorexia, gastric irritation, abdominal cramps, speech disturbances, seizure, visual disturbances, diplopia, tachycardia, erratic blood pressure, mental confusion, clinical depression, renal disturbances, myalgia, feelings of suffocation and death due to liver failure.         29.  The adverse effects associated with Lioresal baclofen are somewhat less severe, but include possibly lethal consequences, even when the drug is properly prescribed and taken as directed.  The range on sublethal toxic reactions is similar to those found with Dantrium.         30.  Norman E, Zinberg, M.D., one of Dr. Weil's colleagues in the 1968 study mentioned in finding 2, above, accepts marijuana as being safe for use under medical supervision.  If it were available by prescription he would use it for appropriate patients.         31.  Lester Grinspoon, M.D., practicing psychiatrist researcher and Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, accepts marijuana as safe for use under medical supervision.  He believes its safety is its greatest advantage as a medicine in appropriate cases.         32.  Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D., a psychiatrist practicing in Berkley, California who treats substance abusers as inpatients and outpatients, accepts marijuana as safe for use under medical supervision.         33.  Richard D. North, M.D., who has treated Robert Randall for glaucoma with marijuana for nine years, accepts marijuana as safe for use by his patient                                 - 63 - under medical supervision.  Mr. Randall has smoked ten marijuana cigarettes a day during that period without any evidence of adverse mental or physical effects from it.          34.  John C. Merritt, M.D., an expert in ophthalmology, who has treated Robert Randall and others with marijuana for glaucoma, accepts marijuana as being safe for use in such treatment.         35.  Deborah B. Goldberg, M.D., formerly a researcher in oncology and now a practicing physician, having worked with many cancer patients, observed them, and heard many tell of smoking marijuana successfully to control emesis, accepts marijuana is proven to be an extremely safe anti-emetic agent.  When compared with the other, highly toxic chemical substances routinely prescribed to cancer patients, Dr. Goldberg accepts marijuana as clearly safe for use under medical supervision.  (See finding 17, above.)         36.  Ivan Silverberg, M.D., board certified in oncology and practicing that specialty in the San Francisco area, has accepted marijuana as a safe anti-emetic when used under medical supervision.  Although illegal, it is commonly used by patients in the San Francisco area with the knowledge and acquiescence of their doctors who readily accept it as being safe for such use.         37.  It can be inferred that all of the doctors and other health care professionals referred to in the findings in Sections V, VI and VII, above, who tolerate or permit patients to self-administer illegal marijuana for therapeutic benefit, accept the substance as safe for use under medical supervision.                                 - 64 - Discussion     The Act, at 21 U.S.C. � 812(b)(1)(C), requires that marijuana be retained in Schedule I if "[t]here is a lack of accepted safety for use of [it] under medical supervision."  If there is no lack of such safety, if it is accepted that this substance can be used with safety under medical supervision, then it is unreasonable to keep it in Schedule I.     Again we must ask - "accepted" by whom?  In the MDMA proceeding the Agency's first Final Rule decided that "accepted" here meant, as in the phrase "accepted medical use in treatment", that the FDA had accepted the substance pursuant to the provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.  51 Fed. Reg. 36555 (1986).  The Court of Appeals held that this was error.  On remand, in its third Final Rule on MDMA, the Agency made the same ruling as before, relying essentially on the same findings, and on others of similar nature, just as it did with respect to "accepted medical use."  53 Fed. Reg. 5156 (1988).     The administrative law judge finds himself constrained not to follow the rationale in that MDMA third Final Order for the same reasons as set out above in Section V with respect to "accepted medical use" in oncology.  See pages 30 to 33.  Briefly, the Agency was looking primarily at the results of scientific tests and studies rather than at what physicians had, in fact, accepted.  The Agency was wrongly basing its decision on a judgment as to whether or not doctors ought to have accepted the substance in question as safe for use under medical supervision.  The criteria the Agency applied in the MDMA third Final Rule are inappropriate.  The only proper question for the Agency here is: Have a significant minority of physicians accepted marijuana as safe for use under medical supervision?                                 - 65 -      The gist of the Agency's case against recognizing marijuana's acceptance as safe is to assert that more studies, more tests are needed.  The Agency has presented highly qualified and respected experts, researchers and others, who hold that view.  But, as demonstrated in the discussion in Section V above, it is unrealistic and unreasonable to require unanimity of opinion on the question confronting us.  For the reasons there indicated, acceptance by a significant minority of doctors is all that can reasonably be required.  This record makes it abundantly clear that such acceptance exists in the United States.     Findings are made above with respect to the safety of medically supervised use of marijuana by glaucoma patients.  Those findings are relevant to the safety issue even though the administrative law judge does not find accepted use in treatment of glaucoma to have been shown.     Based upon the facts established in this record and set out above one must reasonably conclude that there is accepted safety for use of marijuana under medical supervision.  To conclude otherwise, on this record, would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious.                                 - 66 -                                    IX.                               CONCLUSION                                  AND                          RECOMMENDED DECISION     Based upon the foregoing facts and reasoning, the administrative law judge concludes that the provisions of the Act permit and require the transfer of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II.  The Judge realizesthat strong emotions are aroused on both sides of any discussion concerning the use of marijuana.  Nonetheless it is essential for this Agency, and its Administrator, calmly and dispassionately to review the evidence of record, correctly apply the law, and act accordingly.     Marijuana can be harmful.  Marijuana is abused.  But the same is true of dozens of drugs or substances which are listed in Schedule II so that they can be employed in treatment by physicians in proper cases, despite their abuse potential.     Transferring marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II will not, of course, make it immediately available in pharmacies throughout the country for legitimate use in treatment.  Other government authorities, Federal and State, will doubtless have to act before that might occur.  But this Agency is not charged with responsibility, or given authority, over the myriad other regulatory decisions that may be required before marijuana can actually be legally available.  This Agency is charged merely with determining the placement of marijuana pursuant to the provisions of the Act.  Under our system of laws the responsibilities of other regulatory bodies are the concerns of those bodies, not of this Agency,     There are those who, in all sincerity, argue that the transfer of marijuana                                 - 67 - to Schedule II will "send a signal" that marijuana is "OK" generally for recreational use.  This argument is specious.  It presents no valid reason for refraining from taking an action required by law in light of the evidence.  If marijuana should be placed in Schedule II, in obedience to the law, then that is where marijuana should be placed, regardless of misinterpretation of the placement by some.  The reasons for the placement can, and should, be clearly explained at the time the action is taken.  The fear of sending such a signal cannot be permitted to override the legitimate need, amply demonstrated in this record, of countless suffers for the relief marijuana can provide when prescribed by a physician in a legitimate case.     The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision.  It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance in light of the evidence in this record.     The administrative law judge recommends that the Administrator conclude that the marijuana plant considered as a whole has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, that there is no lack of accepted safety for use of it under medical supervision and that it may lawfully be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II.  The judge recommends that the Administrator transfer marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II.Dated: SEP 6 1988                                      Francis L.

Iowa DOT IN THE SUPREME COURT OF IOWANo. 111/94-453Filed May 24, 1995F I L E DJul 14 1995CLERK SUPREME COURTWANDA JOY HILLS,     Appellee,vs.IOWA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATIONAND MOTOR VEHICLE DIVISION,     Appellant.     Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Muscatine County, J.L. Burns, Judge.     Judicial review of agency action revoking driver's operating privileges.  AFFIRMED.     Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, David A. Ferree, Special Assistant Attorney General, and Kerry Anderson, Assistant Attorney General, for appellant.     Wanda Hills, Muscatine, pro se.     Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Carter, Lavorato, and Snell, JJ.                               2HARRIS, Justice.     A statutory change called for revocation of drivers' operating privileges upon certain listed criminal convictions.  The question here is whether the change applies to convictions that occurred after the effective date, but for acts committed previously.  The district court reversed such a revocation, determining that to allow it would amount to an ex post facto application of the law.  We affirm.     Petitioner Wanda Joy Hills was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated on April 1, 1993.  Following a search incident to arrest, she was also charged with possession of marijuana in violation of then Iowa Code section 204.401(3) (1991) (section 204.401(3) has since been renumbered as section 124.401(3) (1995)).     Hills arranged to plead guilty to the marijuana possession charge at a pretrial conference, initially scheduled for June 29, 1993.  On June 22, however, the district court, on its own motion, changed the date of the pretrial hearing to July 2, 1993.  Hills entered her guilty plea on July 2.  In the meantime, on July 1, 1993, Iowa Code section 321.209(8) became effective.  It provides for mandatory revocation by the DOT of the driver's license of anyone convicted of a controlled substance offense under Code section 124.401. [footnote 1]     The DOT revoked Hills' license over her protest that there could be no revocation on the basis of occurrences prior to July 1, 1993.  On judicial review____________________     [footnote 1]  Iowa Code � 321.209(8) states:          Mandatory revocation.  The department shall upon twenty      days' notice and without preliminary hearing revoke the      license or operating privilege of an operator upon receiving      a record of the operator's conviction for any of the      following offenses, when such conviction has become final:          ....          8.  A controlled substance offense under section      124.401 ....                                3the district count reversed the agency action, holding that, to apply the new statute to offenses committed prior to its effective date, violated the ex post facto principles of the state and federal constitutions.  The DOT brought this appeal to challenge the holding.     I.  Ex post facto applications of law are prohibited by article I section 9 clause 3 of the United States Constitution and by article I section 21 of the Iowa Constitution.  The ex post facto clauses forbid     [punishing as a crime] an act previously committed, which      was innocent when done, [or making] more burdensome the      punishment for a crime, after its commission, or [depriving]      one charged with crime of any defense available according to      [the] law at the time when the act was committed.Adair Benevolent Soc'y v. State, 489 N.W.2d 1, 4 (Iowa 1992); see also State v. Kaster, 469 N.W.2d 671, 673-74 (Iowa 1991).  The ex post facto prohibition applies only to penal and criminal actions, not to civil actions.  State v. Taggart, 186 Iowa 247, 254, 172 N.W. 299, 301 (1919) (citing Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386 (1798)).  Our review of this constitutional question is de novo.  State v. Niehaus, 452 N.W.2d 184, 187 (Iowa 1990).     II.  The question is whether the revocation was, in essence, a punishment.  If so the ex post facto prohibition would apply.  On the other hand if the revocation was merely a civil penalty, designed to enhance public safety, the ex post facto prohibition would not apply.  This is because civil penalties do not violate ex post facto clauses, even though their penalties may be retroactive and more burdensome.  Thus our controlling question is whether license revocation based on possession of a controlled substance is a civil penalty or a criminal (or a quasi-criminal) punishment.     The State argues that license revocations are civil in nature, and as an abstract proposition cases support this contention.  See, e.g., State v. Moret, 486 N.W.2d 589, 591 (Iowa 1992) (driver's license suspension of a habitual                                 4offender of motor vehicle laws is for public safety, not for punishment of the offender); State v. Blood, 360 N.W.2d 820, 822 (Iowa 1985) (driver's license revocation for OWI not intended as punishment but designed solely for the protection of the public).  In State v. Funke, ___ N.W.2d ___, ___ (Iowa 1995), we rejected a former jeopardy challenge to a driver's license revocation on the basis that a civil proceeding was involved, not a criminal one.  Because it was a civil proceeding, we found the former jeopardy prohibition no impediment to the revocation because the statute authorizing revocation did not serve both the twin goals of punishment-deterrence and retribution.  We said public safety -- not punishment -- was the goal; deterrence and retribution were not involved.  Id. at ___.     Our Funke former jeopardy holding, however, does not necessarily control Hills' ex post facto challenge.  Ex post facto, in contrast with former jeopardy challenges, cannot be posited on civil matters.  Iowa has limited the doctrine to cases criminal in nature.  In re Ponx, 276 N.W.2d 425, 428 (Iowa 1979).  This limitation on the ex post facto doctrine applies even where the civil consequences are "serious" in nature.  Id.     The question then is whether Hills' license revocation, based on the controlled substance violation, was civil or criminal in nature.  The answer turns on whether the essential aim of the controlled substance revocation was to promote highway safety.  We think in this respect it differs from the "habitual offender" revocation statute we considered in Funke.     In contending the revocation is civil in nature, the DOT argues there is a "direct connection" between the possession of controlled substances, driving, and public safety.  The district court did not perceive such a connection and neither do we.  Persons who illegally possess drugs are of course subject to appropriate criminal punishment.  But many such persons choose not to drive.  When they                                 5do not, they do not affect highway safety.  Any connection between drugs, driving, and public safety is at most indirect.  The amended statute authorizing this license revocation was aimed essentially at enhancing punishment for controlled substance possession.  As such it was quasi-criminal and not civil in nature.  Ex post facto principles therefore prohibit application of the amended statute.  The district court was correct in so holding.

Barney Frank (D-MA) recently introduced H.R. 2618, a federal medical marijuana bill. H.R. 2618 reschedules marijuana from schedule I to schedule II, thereby making it available by prescription. This bill was first introduced 1981 and was co-sponsored by four Republicans, including Rep. Newt Gingrich, then an obscure second-term congressman from suburban Atlanta. The measure was subsequently reintroduced (H.R. 4498) in early 1982 with 71 additional co-sponsors. If your member of Congress is supportive of medical marijuana, please take a moment to contact him/her to urge they co-sponsor the Frank medical marijuana bill. Interested members or staff should contact Mr. Robert Raben on Rep. Frank's staff (202-225-6906). Although more research is needed, it is clear from rapidly accumulating anecdotal evidence that marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and suffering for patients with a number of serious ailments, and that it is less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines for which it may be substituted. Marijuana is an effective means of overcoming nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, and nausea and appetite loss in the wasting syndrome of AIDS. It is also useful for various spastic conditions including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia, and it lowers intraocular pressure in people who suffer from open-angle glaucoma. For some people with epilepsy it is the only anticonvulsant that works. It has been used for centuries as an analgesic and is considered by many to be the best approach to migraine. It is also useful to some patients for the symptomatic treatment of depression, menstrual cramps, asthma and pruritus. Many seriously ill patients in this country are already using marijuana to reduce their pain and suffering, even though they must risk arrest to obtain and use it. Informal buyers' clubs supplying marijuana to the seriously ill have been formed in many cities. Some of these clubs are small and almost clandestine; a few, such as the one in San Francisco, operate openly and serve several thousand clients on a regular basis. Despite these heroic efforts, the underground emergency distribution system reaches only a small proportion of the tens of thousands of patients who could benefit from legal marijuana. This bill would amend federal law to permit physicians to prescribe marijuana to patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, glaucoma or spastic condition including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia and quadriplegia. Thirty-six states have adopted legislation designed to facilitate the availability of medical marijuana, but none of these programs can be implemented without a an amendment to federal law.

The ACLU hired Belden & Russonello (B&R), a Washington, D.C.-based research and polling firm, and Doug Gould, a communications strategies consultant, to conduct the study.       In brief, B&R conducted four pre-survey focus groups in Dayton, Ohio (2) on February 16, 1995, and in Baltimore, Maryland (2) on February 28, 1995.  The focus groups were followed by a national random digit dial survey by telephone, from March 31 through April 5,l995, among 1,001 registered voters.  The sample was designed to represent all households in the nation, and the margin of sampling error for a sample of 1,001 is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.       The findings that emerged from this work clearly demonstrate that a very substantial majority of the voting public supports a change in marijuana policy with respect to its medical uses.  The key findings were as follows:  1. Legalization of marijuana for medical use is favored by a clear majority of American voters.       A very substantial majority of respondents (93%) has heard that      marijuana had medical uses.  Twenty-two percent know someone who      has used marijuana for medicinal reasons.  A series of questions       were posed to test the public's views on legalizing marijuana for       medical purposes:  Q. Do you think it would be a good                VERY GOOD.............47% idea or a bad idea to legalize marijuana          SOMEWHAT GOOD..........32 to relieve pain and for other medical             SOMEWHAT BAD............4 uses if prescribed by a doctor?                   VERY BAD...............12 Nadine Strossen President * Ira Glasser Executive Director * Kenneth B. Clark Chair, National Advisory Council * Richard Zacks Treasurer Q.

Q. Conclusive tests on the possible medical        STRONGLY FAVOR....31% uses of marijuana have not been completed.         SOMEWHAT FAVOR.....24 Would you favor or oppose making marijuana         SOMEWHAT OPPOSE....15 legally available for medical uses, even           STRONGLY OPPOSE....27 though testing has not been complete?  Q.

STRONGLY DISAGREE...8  2. Fewer than half the respondents thought the argument most often posed by opponents of medical marijuana was convincing, i.e. that legalizing marijuana for medical purposes would lead to more social use, and the largest group thought it was " very unconvincing":  Q. Is the following argument very convincing, somewhat convincing, somewhat unconvincing or very unconvincing as a reason for keeping marijuana illegal:  > Legalizing marijuana for medical uses        Very  Smwht  Smwht   Very will make it too easy for other people to      Conv  Conv   Unconv  Unconv get it and abuse it.                           25%   22     19      32WT01-B19-141IA087-000628-B026-87http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/MEDICAL/dpf.html 206.61.184.43 19970122061025 text/html 6383HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 06:10:16 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:03:57 GMTContent-length: 6168 NEWS RELEASE The Drug Policy Foundation CONTACT: Dave Fratello or Rob Stewart at (202) 537-5005 Board of Directors: Arnold S.

The bill, H.R. 2618, was introduced by Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.). It is modeled on legislation sponsored in the early 1980s by several members of Congress, including Republicans Newt Gingrich (Ga.), Bill McCollum (Fla.), John Porter (Ill.) and Frank Wolf (Va.). David C. Condliffe, DPF's executive director, said, "Most Americans are shocked when they learn that a doctor cannot prescribe marijuana to seriously ill patients, including cancer and AIDS patients. Polls repeatedly show that the public favors giving doctors the authority to prescribe marijuana to patientswho find no relief from other medicines. But the federal government has refused to budge. Barney Frank's bill would end this cruel policy and help thousands of Americans. His leadership on this vital issue is admirable." Currently, 36 states have endorsed the medical use of marijuana. However, state acts that recognize marijuana's medical usefulness are mainly symbolic because the federal government has classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug, which means that it has no officially sanctioned medical use. H.R. 2618 would reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, along with cocaine and amphetamines, which are tightlyregulated. The bill would establish an office in the Department of Health and Human Services to administer a domestic medical marijuana supply that would be distributed to patients through licensed hospitals and pharmacies. Harvard Medical School professor and DPF Advisory Board member Dr. Lester Grinspoon said, "The fact that thousands of people daily break the law by going to underground Cannabis Buyers Clubs is powerful testimony to the importance of this legislation. These people are being open about using cannabisbecause it relieves their symptoms better than legally available medicines, not because they want better access to a recreational drug." The Drug Policy Foundation                                     Nov. 13,1995News Release                                                         Page 2 "Even as an illegal drug, cannabis stands out among the modern medicines as a safe and effective treatment for a wide range of symptoms," Grinspoon added. "For example, it appears to be the best drug available to treat the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. Cannabis can also be used to control the nausea from AIDS or the drugs used to treat it, to reduce muscle spasms brought on by multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia, to lower intraocular pressure in people who have open-angle glaucoma, to suppress an epileptic's convulsions, to treat painful migraines. The list goes on." DPF President Arnold Trebach said, "This bill would provide not just relief but dignity to patients suffering from life- and sense-threatening diseases. It makes no sense to force patients into a black market where neither their safety nor the purity of their medicine is guaranteed." Trebach added, "The Drug Policy Foundation welcomes H.R. 2618 after having worked for years as lead counsel in a lawsuit to reschedule marijuana. One of the important results of that suit was that, in 1988, the Drug Enforcement Administration's chief administrative law judge agreed with us that marijuana was a remarkably safe and medically useful drug." Since 1987, the Drug Policy Foundation has been a lead party in the suit to get the DEA to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug. Most recently, in February 1994, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., upheld the DEA's authority to maintain the medical ban on marijuana, despite evidence of its value. Grinspoon, co-author of Marihuana, The Forbidden Medicine (Yale University Press, 1993), commented, "My representative, Barney Frank, is making an invaluable contribution to medical science with his bill. It will spur more and better research on a drug that, through popular misunderstandings, has been wrongfully excluded from modern medicine. At the same time, we must recognize that cannabis is not a perfect drug and that it won't work for all patients. Still, it will be a major step forward when doctors and patients can exercise the choice to use cannabis - especially when nothing else in the pharmacopoeia works." # # # ADDITIONAL CONTACT INFORMATION: * For Rep.

Bill McCullum Chair, Crime Subcommittee 2266 Rayburn H.O.B. Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Representative McCullum: I am writing to request that you cosponsor a bill which will be introduced by my representative, The Honorable Barney Frank of Massachusetts. This bill would allow physicians to prescribe cannabis to patients with certain medical symptoms and syndromes. It is modeled after a similar bill which you co-sponsored in 198I and again in 1983. The urgent need for such iegislation is indicated by the fact that thousands of patients in 26 cities have formed Cannabis Buyers Clubs throuqh which, with a note from their doctors, they can obtain at cost a small amount ot marihuana (cannabis) for medical use. They are risking arrest because they have found that marihuana relieves their symptoms better than the available legal medicines. For example, it appears to be the best available treatment for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. Many people with AIDS also suffer from nausea caused by the disease itself or the drugs needed to treat it. In most of these people marihuana eliminates the nausea more effectively than conventional antinauseants. Marihuana is also used in the treatment of glaucoma, migraine, and muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, parapleqia, and quadriplegia. Again, it is often safer and more effective than any of the legal medicines available for these purposes. This medical marihuaha bill would allow people who need medical cannabis to obtain it legally with a doctor's prescription, and to use it without having to suffer the anxiety created by its iilegal status. A growing number of citizens and physicians have come to understand that outlawing the medical use of cannabis is both unscientific and immoral. A recent national poll indicates that 85% of Americans are in favor of allowing medical marihuana, and 36 states now have passed laws designed to facilitate its availability. These hopes cannot be realized until the federal qovernment passes similar legislation. I am enclosinq a copy of a Commentary published in the June, 1995, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association which may help you to understand why your support for Representative Frank's bill is important. If you would like to learn more about this issue, I would be glad to send you a copy of a book written by James B. Bakalar and me (Marihuana, the Forbidden Medicine, Yale University Press, 1993). If I can help in any other way, please get in touch with me. My telephone and fax numbers are listed below. Thank you for considering cosponsorship of this most important and humane legislation. Sincerely yours, Lester Grinspoon, M.D. LG/pa Enclosure 617-277-3621 (phone) 617-277-8423 (fax)WT01-B19-144IA087-000632-B044-1http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/COPTIC/GARVEY/garvey01.html 206.61.184.43 19970122072635 text/html 4474HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:26:19 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:03:22 GMTContent-length: 4259 MORE LIGHT ON HAILE SELASSIE Lesson 5 God There is a God and we believe in Him. He is not a person nor a physical being. He is spirit and He is universal intelligence. Never deny that there is a God. God being universal intelligence created the universe out of that intelligence. It is intelligence that creates. Man is a part of the creation of universal intelligence and man was created in the image and likeness of God only by his intelligence. It is the intelligence of man that is like God, but man's intelligence is only a unitary particle of God's universal intelligence. God out of His universal intelligence made matter and made mind. That matter is made by God and man is matter as well as mind; then man must be in the image of God, because nothing could exist without God. As God made the universe out of His universal knowledge or intelligence so man in his unitary knowledge or intelligence can make a typewriter, an automobile or a chair, but cannot make the universe because his unitary intelligence is not as much or as great as universal intelligence. All the unitary intelligence of the universe goes to make God who is the embodiment of all intelligence, so no man can be as great as God because he is only a unit of God and God is the whole. No man therefore can measure God nor ask God questions because he is not as intelligent as God and therefore cannot understand God. It is presumptuous therefore, when man questions God from his limited unitary intelligence. Man never dies. Nothing dies. Man is made of body and spirit. The spirit is God. It is intelligence. The body of man is matter. It changes from living matter in the man to other matter in the soil. It is always the same matter. It doesn't die in the sense of how we understand death. It changes. When man sleeps and passes away in the flesh he goes to earth that lives on, out of which other men and things are formed. All matter is related so man is related to earth and earth related to man. We eat ourselves over and over again. When we eat the apple, the banana, the fig, the cherry, the grape, when we drink the water, we are eating and drinking ourselves over and over again, so nothing is lost and nothing dies, so do not be afraid of death, because what you call death is only change and you are still in the universe either in the spirit of God to whom your spirit goes after the change or as matter which goes on forever. You are related to the flower, to the beautiful rose, to the trees, to the fish and to other animals just as you are related to God. All of you sprung from God who is universal intelligence. Do not be more cowardly than the rose, the apple, the coconut, the sheep, the fish or the cow to do that which all must, and which we call death, to die. If you are going to weep to die then the rose should weep to die. If you weep you are a coward. Die like a man because you are not lost, you are still there. You only weep because you are a glutton, because you think you will not get any more to eat and drink and any more happy times; just as you have been feeding upon things, and other beings who came here before you, so someone else must feed on you to make creation true, otherwise God would not be fair to everybody and everything, and God is fair and just and no respecter of persons or things.

The criticisms on the matter were really prompted for the purpose of enlightening the Negro world about the true situation of affairs and to awaken him from his usual sentimental dreams. NOT UNDERSTANDING. Some people, a limited few, not understanding the purpose, entertained narrow views as to whether the Emperor should be criticized or not, and actually suggested that he was above criticism, no doubt, because of his "divinity." Where they got this idea from we are unable to explain, other than to charge it to real ignorance about the present state of our peculiarly civilized world. There is one satisfaction, and that is, that The Black Man being read in all parts of the world, has succeeded in creating an enlightenment that is positively necessary if the Negro is to seriously and intelligently grapple with the problems that confront him, particularly those that are political. NOT UNFAIRNESS. No one desires to be unfair to Haile Selassie. The only sad thing is that he has been unfair to himself, to his country and his countrymen, by acting in a manner not consistent with ordinary political intelligence necessary to our age, in understanding the machinations, cunning and vile methods and systems of Governments and peoples. Those who pay a little attention to European and American politics, must wonder, with great astonishment, how Haile Selassie could have made such colossal blunders in ignoring the sacred trust imposed upon him, of jealously safe-guarding the interest of the country and people whom he elevated himself to rule so as to prevent them from falling into the very covetous hands and under the domination of an enemy who made no secret of his threat toward the usurpation of the people's political freedom and the conquest of the country. SYMPATHY FOR THE EMPEROR. If there is sympathy for Haile Selassie, it must be for his unfortunate ignorance of history which should be the guide of every modern statesman and ruler to enable him to successfully protect the national interests involved. Any tyro who has read European history knows that the Machiavellian policy is as evident today as in the day of the originator of the policy, and politically the diplomatic word must be taken not in the literal sense but with a grain of salt. Undertakings between Governments should be considered from the angle of diplomacy which generally hides the truth that is intended. Haile Selassie was not able to understand the hidden methods and motives encouched in diplomatic papers and ad-vices. The result was, as Machiavelli would suggest, his being trapped to the advantage of the astute Mussolini, whose diplomacy for the good of Italy could well be understood by the keen diplomat. When it is understood that Haile Selassie ruled over a State with more than twelve million people and one of the richest in the world in natural resources, his best friends surely cannot compliment him for leaving that country in the hands of a foreign foe, and by the methods he adopted. KEPT COUNTRY UNPREPARED. He kept his country unprepared in a modern civilization whose policy was strictly aggressive. He resorted senti-mentally to prayer and to feasting and fasting, not consistent with the policy that secures the existence of present-day freedom for peoples whilst other nations and rulers are building up armaments of the most destructive kind as the only means of securing peace and protection. He reclined on the peculiar policy of leaving everything to the Almighty Wisdom of the Universal Creator Who, in all history, has never yet taken political sides between two rival human political forces and powers. For God to maintain his equilibrium, He cannot take sides in human political differences between peoples and nations, otherwise He would cease to be the God of the one, yet positively declaring Himself to be the God of the other. So as the result shows, God had nothing to do with the campaign of Italy in Abyssinia, for on the one side we had the Pope of the Catholic Church blessing the Crusade and the other the Coptic Church fasting and praying with confidence of victory. THE ITALIAN FORCE. The Italians triumphed by the use of mustard gas. Surely God was not on the side of the Italians helping them to disload the gas of death. The Abyssinians lost. God could not have been on their side either. It is logical therefore that God didn't take sides, but left the matter to be settled by the strongest human battalion. Haile Selassie had no equipment and no food. He never even had gas masks. The Emperor remained in the Palace long enough to give the Italians a good foothold in Abyssinia, and then when he left the Palace it was only for seeing his poorly equipped soldiers flee before the enemy and to gain time for himself to get back to the Palace and flee the country with all he could lay his hands on, leaving the unfortunate people to the mercy of the heartless invader. These are the facts. Those who do not want to know them may, like the ostrich, hide their heads in the sand; but those of us who know and understand, realize that battles are not won this way. We are sorry for the Emperor, because we realize he didn't know better. As a fact, he didn't know what it was all about, but that it was just a matter of attacking his Divine right of being Emperor and that the consequence could well be left to God Who ordained the Divinity that made him Emperor. HOLDING CROWNS. Kings and Emperors do not hold their crowns today by Divine right. They hold them by superior statesmanship, such as is being demonstrated to us by the nations of Europe and America. When the Negroes get this kind of a sense in their heads they will be able to fight a successful war in Abyssinia and elsewhere.WT01-B19-146IA087-000632-B044-221http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/COPTIC/MAZUR/mazur1.html 206.61.184.43 19970122072853 text/html 25979HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:28:45 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:05:23 GMTContent-length: 25763 Marijuana as a Holy Sacrament - Part 1                      MARIJUANA AS A HOLY SACRAMENT:      IS THE USE OF PEYOTE CONSTITUTIONALLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THAT              OF MARIJUANA IN BONA FIDE RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES?

Genesis 1:29 (King James).      This past April, within one week, the Supreme Court: 1) denied certiorari to Carl Eric Olsen, an Ethiopian Zion Coptic priest appealing the denial of a DEA exemption for the sacramental use of marijuana; [footnote 1] and 2) held that the State of Oregon could deny unemployment compensation to two Native Americans who had been fired for the sacramental use of peyote. [footnote 2]  Similarities between the two cases end there.  The Supreme Court's latter holding does not change the fact that Congress and the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"), have decided to accommodate the religious practices of the Native American Church ("NAC"), and accord it a preferential position by establishing, pursuant to regulation, its right to religious drug use over against all other churches. {footnote 3]  Part I of this article will set forth the favorable treatment which the federal government extends to the NAC regarding its unlimited exemption to use peyote in religious ceremonies.

THE NATIVE AMERICAN CHURCH ENJOYS A DEA EXEMPTION FROM THE      FEDERAL DRUG LAWS PROHIBITING INGESTION OF PEYOTE      A. The Native American Church      When one tries to solidify a definition of the NAC, it must be remembered that America has 307 Native American tribes living within its borders. [footnote 8]  There is no majority control of the NAC and as a result, the only statement "that is safe to make is that there is, in many places and in many ways, a concept of a Native American Church."

[footnote 11]  It is believed that those who partake of peyote enter into direct contact with God and experience a heightened sense of comprehension which includes a deep feeling of compassion for others. [footnote 12]      Worship in the NAC centers around the "peyote meeting" which begins at sundown and continues at least until day break. [footnote 13] Normally, the ceremony is conducted to give thanks or to receive guidance. [footnote 14]  Participants sit in a circle around a fire, [footnote 15] consume peyote during the ceremony, and may pray, sing, or use a drum. [footnote 16]  Other accouterments can include a fan, eagle bone or feather, whistle, rattle, and/or a prayer cigarette.

[footnote 21]  Peyote, which is native to the region of the Rio Grande Valley and southward, is a plant classified botanically as Lophorphora Williamsii Lemaire.  It is a small, spineless, low growing cactus and is carrot or turnip-like in shape and size.  Only the fleshy, rounded top grows above ground.  After the pincushion top is sliced off and dried, it becomes a hard and brittle disk-like button, which is used ceremoniously to produce "profound sensory and psychic phenomena."  35 Fed. Reg. 14789-90 (1970).      [footnote 22]  Id.  LSD is a "Psychedelic" which refers to a class of drugs including mescaline and marijuana, among others, whose primary effect is to expand consciousness, heighten intellectual activity, and increase sensory awareness.  Leary v. United States, 383 F.2d 851, 858, 860 (5th Cir. 1967), rev'd on other grounds, 395 U.S. 6 (1969).  Researchers have found that religious reactions in those partaking of psychedelic drugs are present in varying degrees from about 25% to 90% of all users.  United States v. Kuch, 288 F. Supp. 439, 444 (D.D.C. 1968).  A "religious reaction" is defined as a sharpening of the senses and a mixed feeling of awe and fear.  There may be a sense of mystery, peace, and a sharpening of impressions as to all natural objects, perhaps something like the vision Moses had of the burning bush.  Id.      [footnote 23]  Peyote Way Church of God v. Smith, 742 F.2d 193, 197 (5th Cir. 1984).      [footnote 24]  For a discussion of the dissolve of the BNDD and the creation of the DEA, see the notes to 21 U.S.C. § 881 (1988).                                    4 reported that mescaline may produce an altered consciousness marked by: 1) confused mental states and dreamlike revivals of past traumatic events; 2) alteration of sensory perception evidenced by visual illusions and distortion of space and perspective; 3) alteration of mood with anxiety, euphoria, or ecstacy; 4) alteration of ideation with impairment of concentration and intelligence; and 5) alteration of personality with impairment of conscious functioning and the deterioration of inhibitions. [footnote 25]  Indeed, ingestion of peyote may result in such severe reactions as psychosis and suicide. [footnote 26]  The federal drug laws which prohibit peyote use, however, do not apply to participants who ingest peyote as part of the NAC religious ritual. [footnote 27]      C.

On the other hand, some report that through the use of peyote: 1) euphoria and good feelings are heightened; 2) colors and music are more vivid and more pleasing; 3) prayers take on an intense philosophical and ethical quality; and 4) a state of inner peace takes place where the individual may experience visions or sensations of the supernatural.

S 1307.31 (1990).

[footnote 29]  Schedule I substances are defined as those which meet the following three criteria:      1)  "a high potential for abuse";      2)  "no currently accepted medical use in treatment in      the United States"; and      3)  "a lack of accepted safety for use ... under      medical supervision." [footnote 30] Peyote is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance [footnote 31] of the CSA which prohibits its distribution, its possession with intent to distribute, and its possession without a prescription. [footnote 32]      Section 1307.03 of the Code of Federal Regulations allows a petitioner to apply for an exception to "any provision" of the ____________________     [footnote 29]  21 U.S.C. § 812 (1988).

Church of N.Y. v. United States, 468 F. Supp. 1247, 1249 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (also citing 79 Stat. 226 § 3(a)).           "Peyote was classified as a 'narcotic' in the Narcotic Farm Act of 1929, 45 Stat. 1085, to enable peyote 'addicts' to seek treatment at federal facilities.  The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 also classified peyote as a narcotic or hypnotic substance, 52 Stat. 1050, and imposed certain labeling requirements.  Neither statute prohibited the manufacture or distribution of peyote."  Amicus Memorandum before DEA, July 1988, App. 16, at 404 n.3 (Memorandum Opinion for the Chief Counsel, DEA, Dec. 22, 1981).                                    6 drug prohibitions. [footnote 33]  Indeed, evidence may be presented to the Attorney General by any interested party in order to determine whether a particular drug should be reclassified, added, or removed from the schedules. [footnote 34]  The CSA also authorizes the Attorney General to establish registration procedures to permit persons to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances and confers broad authority to grant and waive registration requirements. [footnote 35]      D.  The Native American Church Exemption      The language of the CSA contains no exemptions from its prohibitions; nonetheless, in 1965, Congress passed the Drug ____________________     [footnote 33]  21 C.F.R. § 1307.03 (1990).  The regulations implementing the CSA's provisions concerning the scheduling of controlled substances, registration of manufacturers, labeling of substances, issuance of prescriptions, record-keeping and reporting requirements, and similar matters are codified at 21 C.F.R. §§ 1300-1316 (1990).

Cir. 1977) ("Recognizing that the results of continuing research might cast doubts on the wisdom of initial classification assignments, Congress created a procedure by which changes in scheduling could be effected.").  Citing marijuana as an example, Congress noted the need for flexibility when it enacted the CSA:      The extent to which marihuana should be controlled is a      subject upon which opinions diverge widely.  There are      some who not only advocate its legalization but would      encourage its use; at the other extreme there are some      States which have established the death penalty for      distribution of marihuana to minors.

Id.                                    7 Abuse Control Amendments with the understanding that bona fide religious use of peyote was exempt from regulation. [footnote 36]  The ____________________     [footnote 36]  After the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, 79 Stat. 226 § 3(a) ("H.R. 2"), passed the Senate and were being debated in the House, Congressman Harris stated the following:           Mr. Harris:  The last amendment of substance made      by the Senate deletes the provisions of the House bill      which provided that the term "depressant or stimulant      drug" does not include peyote used in connection with      ceremonies of a bona fide religious organization.           Some concern has been expressed by many of the      religious groups affected, and by certain civil      liberties organizations concerning the possible impact      of this amendment on religious practices protected by      the first amendment to the Constitution.           Two court decisions have been rendered in this      area in recent years.  One, a decision by Judge Yale      McFate in the case of Arizona v. Attakai, No. 4098, in      the superior court of Maricopa County, Phoenix,      Arizona, July 26, 1960; and a California decision,      People against Woody, decided August 24, 1964, in the      Supreme Court of California.  Both these cases held      that prosecutions for the use of peyote in connection      with religious ceremonies was a violation of the first      amendment to the Constitution.           In view of all this, I requested the views of the      Food and Drug Administration and have been assured that      the bill, even with [sic without] the peyote exemption      appearing in the House-passed bill, cannot forbid bona      fide religious use of peyote.           Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to      include the letter from the Food and Drug      Administration at this point in my remarks.           Dear Mr. chairman: In response to your           request we are stating the position the Food           and Drug Administration expects to take if           H.R. 2 becomes law as it passed the Senate           with respect to the use of peyote in           religious ceremonies.           We have been advised by a representative of           the North [sic Native] American Church that           this church is a bona fide religious           organization and that peyote has bona fide           use in the sacrament of the church.  The           representative has agreed to document both of           these statements.           If the church is a bona fide religious           organization that makes sacramental use of           peyote, then it would be our view that H.R.                                    8 Attorney General in 1966, adopted a regulation effectuating Congress' intent. [footnote 37]  In 1970, when Congress passed the CSA, the BNDD assured Congress that a peyote use exemption would be carried forward by regulation.

The Attorney General has delegated responsibility under the CSA to the DEA Administrator pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 0.100 (1990).      [footnote 38]  The CSA hearings contain the following:      Mr. [Congressman] Satterfield.  I have one other      question.  I recall when we were discussing dangerous      drugs a few years ago, the question came up about the      Native American Church involving Indians in the west      who use and have for centuries used peyote in      connection with religious services.  It is my      understanding that they enjoy an exemption under the      current law.      My question is whether in any of the bills we have      before us, if passed, would in any way affect this      present exemption?      Mr. Sonnenreich.  [Deputy Chief Counsel of BNDD].                                    9 the BNDD promulgated the current regulation which provides:           SPECIAL EXEMPT PERSONS           § 1307.31 Native American Church.           The listing of peyote as a controlled           substance in Schedule I does not apply to the           nondrug use of peyote in bona fide religious           ceremonies of the Native American Church, and           members of the Native American Church so           using peyote are exempt from registration.           Any person who manufactures peyote for or           distributes peyote to the Native American           Church, however, is required to obtain           registration annually and to comply with all           other requirements of law. [footnote 39] ____________________     In the first instance, Mr. Satterfield, the Native      American Church did ask us by letter as to whether or      not the regulation, exempting them by regulation, would      be continued and we assured them that it would because      of the history of the church.  We presently are      involved in another hearing regarding another church      that is a non-Indian church that is seeking the      exemption and the order is going to be published, I      believe, either today or tomorrow denying them the same      exemption as the Native American Church.      We consider the Native American Church to be sui generis.      The history and tradition of the church is such that there      is no question but that they regard peyote as a deity as it      were, and we'll continue the exemption.      Mr. Satterfield.  You do not see anything in the Senate      bill that would make this impossible?      Mr. Sonnenreich.  No.  Under the existing law      originally the Congress was going to write in a      specific exemption but it was then decided that it      would be handled by regulation and we intend to do it      the same way under this law.      Mr. Satterfield.  Thank you.  I have no other      questions.

[footnote 51]  The EZCC's longstanding religious tradition of marijuana ingestion may have a history that dates back further than the Native American use of peyote.  Some authors postulate that many Indian religions did not incorporate the peyote ritual into their religious practices until the 1920s and 30s.  See A. Marriott, supra note 9, at 78-79; see also Amicus Memorandum Before DEA, July 1988, at 34 (citing W. La Barre, The Peyote Cult 110-23 (4th ed. 1975)).      [footnote 52]  Id. at 14.  The EZCC has compiled works of scholarship and ancient references which substantiate and detail the religious use of marijuana from time immemorial.  See Amicus Memorandum Before DEA, July 1988, App. 6.  For instance, The Book of Grass 11-12 (G.  Andrews & S. Vinkenoog ed. 1967), is cited for a passage on ancient Scythia and Iran by Mircea Eliade:      only one document appears to indicate the existence of      a Getic shamanism: It is Strabols account of the      Mysian KAPNOBATAI, a name that has been translated, by      analogy with Aristophanes' AEROBATES, as 'those who      walk in clouds', but which should be translated as      'those who walk in smoke'.  Presumably the smoke is      hemp smoke, a rudimentary means of ecstasy known to      both the Thracians and the Scythians...." Amicus Memorandum Before DEA, July 1988, App. 6 at 6-7.

[footnote 55]  Church members state that their ingestion of marijuana during worship does not result in any side-effects [footnote 56] or intoxication, nor is that a desirable goal.      The Church not only does not encourage but in fact      absolutely forbids the recreational use of marijuana      for the purpose of achieving intoxification.  The      Church believes that such intentional misuse of      marijuana, by members or nonmembers, constitutes      sacrilegious behavior.

See Research Report by Brian L. Weiss, M.D., P.A. of Florida (1980) (EZCC members, some of whom have smoked marijuana in high doses for sixteen hours a day for up to fifty years, suffer no apparent psychological or physical harm; tolerance appears to have developed with no acute or chronic side effects); Research Report by Kenneth C. Fischer, M.D. of Florida (1980) (after doing a "complete intensive neurological examination on 31 members" of the EZCC, the "most impressive thing ... is the true paucity of neurological abnormalities I was able to discern"); American Association for the Advancement of Science, Cognition and Long-Term Use of Gania, 213 SCIENCE 465-66 (1981) (prolonged and heavy use of ganja have not resulted in any systematic decrements in mental abilities suggestive of impairment of brain or cerebral function; cognition I.Q. scores were high, and individuals appear to be healthy and highly functional); Neuropsychological Evaluation by Jeffrey Schaeffer, Ph.D. of California (1981) (despite measurable amounts of cannabinoid metabolites in his body and a history of very long-term use of cannabis, Carl Eric Olsen demonstrated no impairment of his cognitive, cerebral, intellectual, or new learning abilities, nor was there any suggestion of damage to the central nervous system or long and short-term memory ability; moreover, his ability to adapt to change remains at a very high level).

Olsen Proceeds Pro Se      From 1983 to 1985, Carl Eric Olsen, a member and priest of the EZCC, had repeated unilateral communications with the DEA attempting to procure for his Church a drug law exemption for the sacramental ingestion of marijuana. [footnote 61]  It was not until the ____________________      [footnote 57]  Id. at 15.      [footnote 58]  Id. at 18.

[footnote 60]  Id. at 17-18.      [footnote 61]  Olsen's Brief, Aug. 18, 1986, App. 13-20, 28-29, 31-35.  Olsen proposed the following statutory language:      SPECIAL EXEMPT CHURCH.  Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.      The listing of marijuana as a controlled substance in      Schedule I does not apply to the non-drug use of      marijuana in bona fide religious ceremonies of the      Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church and members of the      Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church so using marijuana are      exempt from registration.  Any person who manufactures      marijuana for or distributes marijuana to the Ethiopian      Zion Coptic Church, however, is required to obtain                                     15 District of Columbia federal district court issued a show cause order to the DEA in response to Olsen's writ of mandamus filed in 1986, that the DEA finally responded. [footnote 62]  John C. Lawn, the DEA Administrator, answered Olsen's requests in the form of a three paragraph letter which stated in part:           In 1984, an estimated 7,800 to 9,200 metric tons      of marijuana were illegally consumed in the United      States.  It has been estimated that over 20 million      people in the United States use marijuana on a regular      basis.  Marijuana abuse is a major public health      problem in this country.  Accordingly, the      investigation and prosecution of marijuana traffickers,      the interdiction of marijuana smuggling and the      eradication of the drug at its source continue to be      major concerns of drug law enforcement both      domestically and internationally.           In view of the immensity of the marijuana abuse      problem in the United States and the magnitude of the      criminal activity surrounding the production and      trafficking in this substance, the Administrator of the      Drug Enforcement Administration concludes that the      interest of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church in the      ceremonial use of marijuana is outweighed by the      compelling governmental interest in controlling the use      and illegal distribution of marijuana in the United      States. [footnote 63]      The district court dismissed Olsen's mandamus petition as moot; appealing the dismissal, Olsen stated, "The DEA gave no reasons at all for denying the exemption, the DEA only gave _______________      registration annually and to comply with all other      requirements of law. Id.  App. 13, 16, 18.      [footnote 62]  Id. App. 2-4.  Olsen also had filed a mandamus petition in the Eleventh Circuit.  Olsen v. DEA, 776 F.2d 267 (llth Cir. 1985) (affirming district court's denial of olsen's request for a mandamus to compel DEA to respond to petitions for marijuana exemption because the statute authorizing exemptions does not provide for a religious exemption).      [footnote 63]  Olsen's Brief, Aug. 18, 1986, App. 11-12.                                     16 reasons for denying marijuana use to the general public. [footnote 64] Olsen also appealed the DEA's denial, admitting that the DEA had a compelling interest in the overall enforcement of the CSA, but arguing that the exemption granted to the NAC had not undermined that interest nor would a limited exemption for the EZCC. [footnote 65]  Olsen pointed out that the DEA previously denied a peyote exemption to the Church of the Awakening ("CotA"), after finding that the CotA was not similar to the NAC because "peyote is essential and central to the [NAC] religion in that without peyote their religion would not and could not exist." [footnote 66]  The DEA made no such findings regarding the EZCC denial. [footnote 67]      In its response, the government set forth the three-part test from United States v. Lee, [footnote 68] for establishing a free exercise claim [footnote 69] and cited various free exercise cases. [footnote 70]   ____________________      [footnote 64]  Id. at 5.

Kennedy v. BNDD, 459 F.2d 415 (9th Cir. 1972) (ruling that statute granting the peyote exemption only to NAC was unconstitutional but nonetheless holding that extending the exemption to the CotA would not cure the defect, thus, the exemption for the CotA was denied), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1115 (1973).

The following cases involve churches seeking a peyote exemption.  Peyote Way Church of God v. Smith, 742 F.2d 193 (5th Cir. 1984) (reversing summary judgment which had been entered for government and remanding for weighing of interests involved because Texas and federal exemptions for NAC tended to negate compelling state interest in denying such exemption to Peyote Way Church); United States v.

[footnote 71]  Thus, the government tried to distinguish the NAC, stating that Congressional testimony presented by the director of the BNDD during the CSA hearings indicated that the NAC was considered      sui generis.  The history and tradition of the church      is such that there is no question but that they regard      peyote as a deity. [footnote 72] By contrast, the EZCC "does not have such a Congressional recognition of its status." [footnote 73]      Olsen replied with a discussion of the key case regarding the sacramental use of marijuana, Leary v. United States. [footnote 74] Timothy Leary and his daughter were found in possession of marijuana upon their re-entry into this country by car from Mexico.

[footnote 77] Leary admitted that if he could not use marijuana, it would not affect his religious beliefs. [footnote 78]  The court held that the laws regulating marijuana serve a compelling governmental interest in avoiding a "substantial threat to public safety, peace or order." [footnote 79]      Examining the NAC exemption, the court reviewed two California cases. [footnote 80]  In People v. Woody, the state court found a free exercise right to use peyote for NAC members who had been arrested during a ceremony, [footnote 81] and in In re Grady, the state court held that a peyote preacher could offer a first amendment defense to prosecution for possession of peyote. [footnote 81]  The Leary court found that unlike Leary's use of marijuana, peyote "played 'a central role in the ceremony and practice of the Native American Church, [and that the] ceremony marked by sacramental use of peyote, ____________________      [footnote 76]  Id. at 857, 860.

[footnote 83]  The Leary court continued:      The exemption accorded the use of peyote in the limited      bona fide religious ceremonies of the relatively small,      unknown Native American Church is clearly      distinguishable from the private and personal use of      marijuana by any person who claims he is using it as a      religious practice.

Seventeen years later, the Fifth Circuit again distinguished Leary from other religious drug use cases.  Deciding that the Peyote Way Church of God would be entitled to the peyote exemption if it could establish that it was a bona fide religion, the court stated that Leary had not established that marijuana played a central role in the ceremony and practice of the church, and Leary sought unrestricted freedom to possess and use marijuana in any manner.

[EZCC] members would be restricted to using      marijuana during their Saturday evening prayer      ceremony, which lasts from 8:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m.;      2.  During that ceremony, and for the eight hours      following that ceremony, Church members would not leave      the place where the ceremony is conducted; they would      not drive automobiles or otherwise go out in public;      3.  Ingestion of marijuana would be limited to Church      members who had reached the age of majority, according      to the laws of the state in which the ceremony takes      place; and      4.  Ingestion of marijuana would be limited to full      Church members who had undergone the confession      ritual [footnote 95] for entering the Church's      community. [footnote 96]      Turning to the substantive arguments, Amicus stated that contrary to the position espoused by the government, the legislative history of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 ("AIRFA"), [footnote 97] did not support the argument that Congress ____________________     [footnote 94]  See supra note 61.

Olsen stated that he was willing to work out any details or arrangements with the DEA that would facilitate mutual agreement on the exemption and its logistics.  Id.      [footnote 97]  AIRFA provides in pertinent part:      Whereas the traditional American Indian religions, as      an integral part of Indian life, are indispensable and      irreplaceable:      be it      Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,      That henceforth it shall be the policy of the United      States to protect and preserve for American Indians      their inherent right of freedom to believe, express,      and exercise the traditional religions of the American                                    24 specifically intended to limit the peyote exemption to the NAC; instead, Congress recognized that preferential treatment of the NAC would run afoul of the establishment clause.

In the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs Hearing on AIRFA the following statements were reported:      The clear intent of this section is to insure for      traditional native religions the same rights of free      exercise enjoyed by more powerful religions.

Other pertinent statements include:      [D]irect Federal interference in the religious      ceremonies imposes upon one religion, by Government      action, the values of another.

[footnote 100]  When the Department of Justice informed the administration that it did not object to the President's signing of AIRFA, it made specific mention of the fact that Congress had incorporated the Department of Justice's position that a preference for Native American religions could not be extended without violating the establishment clause. [footnote 101] Furthermore, DEA attorneys concurred in the remarks made by the Justice Department, writing, in a memo commenting on the Justice Department's position, that "no line can be drawn between religions claiming a bona fide use of drugs." [footnote 102]  In 1981, the office of Legal Counsel ("OLC"), published a memorandum opinion for the Chief Counsel of the DEA, stating that "Indian religion cannot be treated differently than other religions similarly situated without violation of the Establishment Clause."

With respect to these matters, Indians stand      on no different footing than do other minorities in our      pluralistic society.

An exemption for Indian religious use of peyote would      not be grounded in the unique political status of      Indians.  Instead, the exemption would be based on the      special culture and religion of the Indians.  In this      respect, Indian religion cannot be treated differently      than other religions similarly situated without      violation of the Establishment Clause.

Amicus quoted Lawrence Tribe as stating that the government is in effect:      telling the individual that it knows what is best for      his body and mind.  Surely the individual may respond,      "I know what is best for my soul."

The monitoring      of such restrictions would be extremely burdensome on      an agency which is charged with enforcement of a very      comprehensive drug law. [footnote 107]      D.

[footnote 108]  Citing Leary, [footnote 109] in addition to other cases, [footnote 110] the Administrator asserted that the EZCC had no free exercise right to use marijuana; moreover, it did not enjoy an "equal protection" right to an exemption because the EZCC "advocates the continuous use of marijuana or 'ganja', while the Native American Church's use of ____________________     [footnote 107]  Government Memorandum Before DEA, at 17.

Additionally, there would be no way to enforce the Saturday night exemption proposed by Olsen short of constant surveillance, requiring "Herculean efforts."  Id.

[footnote 111]  The Administrator further distinguished marijuana from peyote stating that "the actual abuse and availability of marijuana in the United States is many times more pervasive in American society than that of peyote." [footnote 112]  Substantiating this claim, the Administrator stated that between 1980 and 1987, the DEA seized 19.4 pounds of peyote as compared to 15,302,468.7 pounds of marijuana. [footnote 113]      This overwhelming difference explains why an      accommodation can be made for a religious organization      which uses peyote in circumscribed ceremonies, and not      for a religion which espouses continual use of      marijuana.  The Administrator also notes that Mr.      Olsen's conviction in United States v. Rush involved      the illegal importation of 20 tons of marijuana....  If      Mr. Olsen's assertions that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic      Church in the United States has never had, "more than      between 100 and 200 members in this country," 20 tons      of marijuana would be an outrageous quantity to supply      their religious needs.

The Court of Appeals Denies the Exemption      1.

[footnote 117]  Regarding Olsen's proposal, the majority found that because EZCC members were allowed to use marijuana "every day throughout the day," the proposal would not be "self-enforcing" and would require "burdensome and constant official supervision and management."

The case was argued before Circuit Judges Bader Ginsburg, Silberman, and Buckley.  Amicus was asked if he knew of any decisions where courts had held that the free exercise clause required government accommodation of religiously motivated conduct despite the government's position that accommodation posed a significant health risk.

[footnote 119]  Reviewing the "establishment clause-equal protection challenge," the court accorded great deference to the DEA and found that the EZCC is not similarly situated to the NAC, [footnote 120] because of the vast differences between peyote and marijuana regarding their demand, abuse, and availability. [footnote 121]  Resting its decision upon the "immensity of the marijuana control problem in the United States," the court refused to find an establishment clause violation and pointed out additional distinctions between the two religions:      1)  The peyote ritual is a traditional, precisely          circumscribed ritual;      2)  Peyote is itself an object of worship;      3)  Use of peyote outside of the ritual is sacrilegious          for the NAC; and      4)  The NAC, for all practical purposes other than the          special stylized ceremony, reinforces the state's ____________________     [footnote 119]  Id. at 1462 (quoting Town v.

[footnote 122] The sharp contrast between the NAC and the EZCC was further evidenced by Olsen's statement that marijuana is smoked continually "through everything that we do." [footnote 123]  Again reviewing Olsen's proposed exemption, the court cryptically concluded that "'narrow' use, concededly, is not his religion's tradition." [footnote 124]      2.  Judge Buckley's Dissent      Judge Buckley dissented "because the majority fail[ed] to address the Establishment Clause implications of the Drug Enforcement Agency's rejection of Olsen's request for a limited religious exemption." [footnote 125]  The DEA's denial "creates a clear-cut denominational preference in favor of the Native American Church." [footnote 126] Application of strict scrutiny requires the DEA to show a compelling interest served by the denominational preference and to show that the different treatment was closely fitted to further that interest. [footnote 127]  Judge Buckley found that the ____________________     [footnote 122]  Id.      [footnote 123]  Id. (quoting State v. Olsen, 315 N.W.2d 1, 7 (Iowa 1982)).      [footnote 124]  Id.      [footnote 125]  Id. at 1468.  Judge Buckley found it irrelevant that the NAC could be distinguished on the basis of the sui generis legal status of American Indians, stating, "[T]hat Church's status as an indigenous faith does not affect its religious character."  Id. at 1469.      [footnote 126]  Id. (quoting Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982), and Everson v. Board of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 15 (1947)).      [footnote 127]  Id. at 1468-69 (quoting Larson, 456 U.S. at 246-47)).  Instead of using the Larson establishment clause analysis as urged by Judge Buckley which would have required strict scrutiny                                    32 DEA's explanation fell "far short" of meeting the strict scrutiny standard. [footnote 128]      In fact, Judge Buckley found the DEA's reasoning to be extremely superficial in light of the Supreme Court decision of Larson v. Valente. [footnote 129]  In Larson, religious denominations in Minnesota receiving more than fifty percent of their funds from members and affiliated organizations were not required to comply with registration and reporting laws regarding their fund raising activities. [footnote 130]  This statute had the effect of granting a denominational preference to well-established churches, and the Court applied strict scrutiny to Minnesota's well reasoned ____________________in view of the denominational preference, the majority relied on an equal protection analysis.  Id. at 1463-64 & n.5.  The majority cited Walz v. Tax Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664, 694, 696 (1970), for this proposition and Judge Buckley acknowledged that this analysis had been mentioned in a concurring opinion by Justice Frankfurter in Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S. 67, 70 (1953).  878 F.2d at 1463 n.5, 1468.  However, both of these cases involved laws which applied equally to all religions.  The Walz Court examined the New York tax exemption law for religious, educational, or charitable uses, 397 U.S. at 666-67, while the Court in Fowler reviewed the constitutionality of a law that prohibited all religious meetings in any public park in Rhode Island.  345 U.S. at 67.  The Larson Court found this distinction critical, stating that the Lemon test applied to "laws affording a uniform benefit to all religions," while a law that discriminates among religions must "be invalidated unless it is justified by a compelling governmental interest and unless it is closely fitted to further that interest."  Larson, 456 U.S. at 246-47, 252 (citations omitted).  Indeed, the Court in Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437 (1971), specifically stated that in the establishment clause cases, equal protection is not an independent argument.  Id. at 449 n.14.

[footnote 131] While the Supreme Court agreed that Minnesota had a compelling state interest in protecting its citizens from abusive solicitation practices, it found that Minnesota had not demonstrated that the exemption was necessary to further that interest nor that the exemption was closely fitted to furthering the interest. [footnote 132]  Finding that the statutory exemption failed to pass a strict scrutiny analysis, the Supreme Court extended it to the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon, holding that any bona fide religion would qualify for the exemption. [footnote 133]      Addressing the DEA's argument that the two religions warranted different treatment because of: 1) their differing sacramental drug use rituals; and 2) the different law enforcement problems vis a vis the two drugs, Judge Buckley asserted that Olsen's proposed exemption effectively eliminated the first distinction. [footnote 134]  Additionally, Judge Buckley challenged the DEA's argument that the abuse and availability of marijuana justified the disparate treatment: ____________________     [footnote 131]  Id. at 248-51.      [footnote 132]  Id.      [footnote 133]  See id. at 255.  The majority in Olsen had asserted that even if it were to find an establishment clause violation, it was not certain that extension rather than invalidation of the exemption was proper.  878 F.2d at 1464.  Judge Buckley retorted that such indecision could not excuse the court from properly reviewing an underinclusive statute.  Id. at 1471.      [footnote 134]  Id. at 1469-70.                                    34      The government's interest in preventing abuse of a      given drug is not proportional to the drug's      prevalence.  By classifying both marijuana and peyote      as Schedule I controlled substances, Congress has      determined that the federal government has a compelling      interest in preventing the illegal distribution and use      of both drugs. [footnote 135]      Noting that the DEA had no difficulty monitoring compliance of more than 250,000 members of the NAC, Judge Buckley questioned the DEA's lack of solid reasoning why monitoring compliance of one-hundred to two-hundred EZCC members would be so impossible. [footnote 136]  Indeed, the exemption would place no restrictions on the DEA's normal enforcement operations other than at the church for a limited number of hours once a week. [footnote 137]  Judge Buckley stated that he would remand the case to the DEA so that it could more adequately review and address Olsen's establishment claim.

THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION      The establishment clause prohibits both the state and federal government from passing laws which prefer one religion over another. [footnote 141]  Whether one adheres to the "broad" interpretation of the establishment clause or the "narrower" interpretation, all scholars agree that the establishment clause was meant by the framers to prevent the government from bestowing a preference on one religion; [footnote 142] and, as such, to protect the "small, new, or unpopular denominations" [footnote 143] from "subtle departures from neutrality, 'religious gerrymanders,' as well as ____________________"denominational preference" is conferred by governmental action.  Amicus Certiorari Petition, Dec. 13, 1989, at 9-14 (citing Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228 (1982)).  Moreover, Amicus argued that confusion surrounding the definition of "denominational preference" was arising, and courts needed guidance on when strict scrutiny should be applied.  Id. at 15-22.      In response, the government asserted that no free exercise, establishment, or equal protection rights had been violated because "DEA's exemption for religious peyote use in 21 C.F.R. § 1307.31 applies equally to all bona fide religious groups."  Respondent's Opposition To Petition For Writ Of Certiorari, Feb. 1990, at 9.  As a result, no denominational preference was created and the Lemon test as opposed to strict scrutiny was applicable.  Id. at 10.  Moreover, the government argued that the DEA's "considered professional judgment" concerning the burden of monitoring the exemption should not be questioned.  Id. at 12.

[footnote 145]  As a result, the EZCC has been denied even the narrowest exemption for its sacrament while the NAC enjoys an unlimited exemption for peyote.      A.  Comparing The Two Exemptions      The majority stated that Olsen had proposed an exemption identical to the one accorded to the NAC. [footnote 146]  This is not true. Olsen's proposed exemption is very narrow, restricting the sacramental use of marijuana to three hours, one day per week. [footnote 147]  The exemption states that once the three hour worship service has finished, members may not leave the place where the ceremony was conducted for eight additional hours.  The exemption specifically prohibits members from driving or going out in public during that post-worship period. Only EZCC members who are of the age of majority may participate in the service and "membership" is ____________________     [footnote 144]  Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 452 (1971) (citations omitted).      [footnote 145]  The total denial of an exemption to the EZCC has had tragic results for the members.  The EZCC has publicly stated:      Through ... the police force, the church has been      severely harassed, victimized and discriminated      against.  Our members have passed through several acts      of police brutality, our legal properties maliciously      destroyed, members falsely imprisoned, divine services      broken up, and all these atrocities performed upon the      Church, under the name of political laws and their      justice. 1 The Coptic World, Dec. 19, 1987, at 8.  As the Court in Larson explained, the free exercise clause and the establishment clause work in close conjunction, the guarantees of one reinforcing the guarantees of the other.  Larson, 456 U.S. at 244-45.      [footnote 146]  878 F.2d at 1464.      [footnote 147]  See supra notes 94-96 and accompanying text.                                    37 strictly construed. [footnote 148]      While the majority described the NAC exemption as "tightly-cabined," [footnote 149] nothing could be further from the truth.  The NAC exemption is unlimited; it states that "Schedule I does not apply to the nondrug use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native American Church." [footnote 150]  The only benefit strictly limited to "members" is a waiver of the registration requirement if the member manufactures or distributes peyote to the NAC. [footnote 151]  Other than that, the exemption does not limit participation in the peyote ceremony to church members or people of majority, nor does it restrict driving or even suggest a detoxification period.  Given the lack of any consensus on the meaning of "Native American Church," either among Native Americans or by those outside of the Church, and the widely diverging views on how the religious ceremony is to be conducted, [footnote 152] the peyote exemption is very broad, indeed.      The majority was quite concerned with how rigidly membership was enforced in the EZCC and whether membership was required before one was allowed to participate in the sacrament.

[footnote 154]      B.  Comparing the Law Enforcement Problems      The majority stated that it based its "decision on the immensity of the marijuana control problem." [footnote 155]  But under a strict scrutiny analysis, this statement becomes less persuasive. [footnote 156] Thirty-three states have enacted some type of legislation which recognizes that marijuana has valid medicinal uses. [footnote 157]  These states have not found that an immense "marijuana control problem" presents any barrier to creating limited marijuana exemptions.

[footnote 156]  Since Larson, there can be no doubt that the Supreme court requires the application of strict scrutiny when the government grants a denominational preference.

[footnote 160]  Moreover, the majority accepted without question the DEA data about abuse, availability, and demand instead of examining marijuana in terms of current trends.      The DEA set forth statistics regarding the amounts of marijuana seized between 1980-1987. [footnote 161]  Yet a breakdown of these statistics year by year establishes that the use of marijuana has been steadily decreasing since 1979.

Polls taken over the last 10 years show marijuana use down as much as 50 percent." [footnote 165]  The fact that Alaska, the only state where marijuana possession was legal, recently voted to re-criminalize it and other similar trends, [footnote 166]  calls into question the continued vitality of marijuana's allure.  Whether marijuana is decriminalized or recriminalized, the population appears less and less interested in pursuing its use.  These types of changes in attitudes about marijuana make "the job of law enforcement so much easier," [footnote 167] and cast some doubt not only on the DEA's complaints concerning marijuana control problems in general but more specifically the ____________________     [footnote 164]  Police and communities want to designate police resources to more serious crimes.

In addition, it simply defies logic that a church with a membership of 250,000 to 300,000 people would be easier to monitor than a church with a membership of one-hundred to two-hundred people.  Olsen agreed to provide a list of member names and places of worship.  Under the NAC exemption, however, the DEA has no idea where or when ceremonies will take place or who will be participating.  This would appear to make monitoring exponentially more difficult.  Nonetheless, monitoring the NAC exemption, apparently, has not imposed a burden on the DEA.  Nor does it seem likely that monitoring the limited EZCC exemption would be significant.      C.  Comparing the Churches' Rituals      The NAC ritual which involves an all night service perhaps once a week, [footnote 168] is more acceptable in the court's view than the EZCC ritual which traditionally is a daily observance.  The majority's concern about the EZCC's regular use of its sacrament seems to state a clear preference for religions that engage sparingly in the use of their sacrament. [footnote 169]  The Catholic Church offers the holy sacrament for ingestion at every worship service (mass), and members are free to engage in worship on a daily ____________________     [footnote 168]  Participants gather at sunset and ingest peyote all through the night.

[footnote 170]  On the other hand, many Protestant denominations offer the holy sacrament once a month, or less. [footnote 171]  Speaking in terms of one's religious tradition, how often one partakes of holy communion should not be a basis upon which one church receives an exemption and another church does not.  The EZCC ritual is more akin to the lifestyle of a religious order living in community where communion might be celebrated at various times throughout the day.  The majority found it significant that EZCC members were allowed to ingest their sacrament outside of the confines of the church facility.[footnote 172]  This concern again seems to be placing an unfair premium on certain types of rituals.  The Protestant and Catholic Churches of America celebrate and distribute their sacrament in shopping malls, [footnote 173] parking lots, [footnote 174] buses, [footnote 175] hospitals, [footnote 176] parks, [footnote 177] homes; [footnote 178] in fact there is no place where ____________________     [footnote 170]  See The New Encyclopaedia Britannica 588 (1987); M.

Furthermore, finding it significant that ingestion of the sacrament be limited to the confines of a "church facility" appears suspect when it is not at all clear that the NAC even has the functional equivalent of a "church facility." [footnote 179]      The majority dispensed with Olsen's proposed exemption by stating that "'narrow' use, concededly, is not his religion's tradition." [footnote 180]  The court cannot in good faith use the tradition of the EZCC as a basis for suggesting that the exemption will not be adhered to. Whether an exemption tracks a religious tradition or not is irrelevant, has never been the law, and should not be used to circumvent a religious group's proposal to compromise.  Accepting the EZCC's offer to modify its traditions rather than resorting to total ban on the religion's sacrament would seem to serve the government's best interest.  Given the choice between an unlimited drug exemption for a church which is loosely knit together with few checks on behavior [footnote 181] and a narrowly drawn exemption which incorporates many checks on behavior for a church that nonetheless has not traditionally restricted its sacrament, the latter seems preferable. ____________________     [footnote 177]  See O'Hair v.

[footnote 184]  The peyote ceremony has myriad manifestations, and there is no prohibition on how often one might participate in a NAC ceremony--while Olsen has limited participation in the EZCC sacrament to one night per week, and it is always the same night. [footnote 185] Second, the DEA has conceded in its briefs that marijuana for the EZCC is an object of worship. [footnote 186]  Third, for the EZCC, use of marijuana outside of the ritual is sacrilegious: "The ____________________     [footnote 182]  878 F.2d at 1464.

[footnote 187]  Even during the ceremony, those ingesting marijuana do not inhale the smoke into their lungs; they avoid its intoxicating effects by taking it into their mouths and exhaling it from their noses." [footnote 188]  Finally, the EZCC religion, for all practical purposes, reinforces the state's prohibitions.  The members of the EZCC do not approve of drug abuse in any form, and alcohol is strictly forbidden." [footnote 189]  Indeed, all aspects of conduct are strictly regulated by a literal interpretation of the Old Testament. [footnote 190]  Thus, the differences noted by the majority are instead distinct similarities between the two churches.      D.  Comparison of the Drugs      Both peyote and marijuana are Schedule I drugs which means that they both: 1) have a high potential for abuse; 2) have no currently accepted medical use in treatment; and 3) lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. [footnote 191]  The only argument that can be made that these drugs are not similarly situated in terms of the government's definition regarding dangerous drugs, is that marijuana does not even meet the second ____________________     [footnote 187]  See supra notes 55-57 and accompanying text.

"But in terms of a direct physical threat to the body, 'it's probably true that [marijuana's] greatest danger is if a bale of it falls on you,' said David Friedman, deputy director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse's preclinical research division and the official in charge of overseeing that agency's marijuana research."  Washington Post, Sept. 19, 1990, at A19.  Administrative Law Judge, Francis L. Young, found that "[m]arijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man."  In re Marijuana Rescheduling Petition, No. 86-22 at 58-59 (Sept. 6, 1988) ("In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume.").  The Judge stated further that "[a] smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response."  Id. at 57-58.  Based on his findings, after two years of testimony, Judge Young recommended that marijuana be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II.  Id. at 67-68.  It is interesting to note that Olsen was a party to this suit.  Id. at 4, 6.

[footnote 201] V.   CONCLUSION      Congress and the DEA have accorded a sacramental drug exemption to Native Americans regarding peyote. [footnote 202]  The EZCC has tried for years to obtain a similar exemption regarding marijuana. [footnote 203] This past June, the Supreme Court denied certiorari to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals decision denying the EZCC a sacramental drug exemption similar to that held by the NAC. [footnote 204]      The court of appeals decision to deny an exemption to the EZCC violates the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution. [footnote 205]  The court's reliance on the DEA's statement that it has greater law enforcement control problems with marijuana will not satisfy an application of strict scrutiny.  The DEA must explain why a very narrow exemption extended to one-hundred to two-hundred people would undermine its interest in preventing drug abuse when an unlimited exemption for peyote extended to 300,000 to 400,000 people does not. [footnote 206] Additionally, there must be a forthright analysis of the current trends regarding the public's abuse of marijuana and the growing body of ____________________     [footnote 201]  See supra notes 141-44 and accompanying text.

[footnote 207]      The court set forth various aspects of the NAC which made it particularly well suited for an exemption, and then failed to recognize that the EZCC has demonstrated significant similarity to the NAC regarding these aspects. [footnote 208]  For example, the EZCC views the recreational use of its sacrament as sacrilegious, has much stricter controls on its membership, and regards marijuana as a deity as does the NAC concerning peyote. [footnote 209]  Additionally, as a result of its proposed exemption, the EZCC would exercise much greater control over its ceremony than the NAC. [footnote 210]      The EZCC is being denied a benefit accorded to another church because of its ritual, its traditions, because it is not indigenous, and because of the abuse of its sacrament by others.  The EZCC has proposed to modify its tradition and ritual, to adhere to practices which are much more restrictive than those of the NAC, and to help with monitoring problems, to no avail. [footnote 211]  The reasons for the denial appear to flow from the fact that the EZCC is a relatively new religion to this country, of black origins, small, and unpopular.

(Health & Saf. Code, § 11360, subd. (a); count one.) Appellant was also charged with possession of marijuana for sale. (Health & Saf. Code, § 11359; count two.) (CT 1-2.) On April 11, 1995, appellant waived jury trial and proceeded by way of a court trial. (CF 219.) On May 19, appellant was found guilty on both counts. (CT 266.) On July 10, 1995, appellant was granted five years probation. Among the terms and conditions of probation imposed, appellant was required to serve 240 days in jail, not to possess or use any controlled substances unless medically prescribed, and not to associate with any unrelated person known to be a possessor, user, or trafficker of controlled substances. (CT 271.) That same day, appellant filed his notice of appeal. (CT 273A.) STATEMENT OF FACTS On March 27, 1994, appellant was driving his BMW through the Temeculaborder patrol checkpoint when he was stopped at the primary inspectionarea. (CT 19-261/.) Appellant's BMW was directed to the secondary inspection area where a canine sniff was conducted. (CT 19-21.) The dog alerted to the presence of contraband. (CT 22.) Appellant initially refused to provide the border patrol agents the keys to his trunk, but then relented. (CT 23.) Inside the trunk, the agents found two duffle bags containing a total of 40 one-pound packages of marijuana. (CT 23-24.) Appellant told the agents he was coming front the Alpine area of San Diego County. (CT 26.) Rolling papers were found on appellant's person, and $2,350 was found under the dashcover inside the BMW. (CT 27, 39.) After appellant was given his Miranda2/ rights, he spontaneously told Joel Ontiveros, a sheriff's investigator, that the passenger in his car, Bret Corey Mixcel, wasn't involved with the "stuff" in his car, that it was all "my stuff [i.e., appellant's]." (CT 30, 35, 37, 41.) Sheriff's Investigator Ontiveros provided his expert opinion based on his training and experience that the 40 pounds of marijuana appellant was transporting was Mexican grown and was possessed for purposes of selling. (CT 41-42.) He estimated the wholesale value of the marijuana to be $40,000 and the retail value at $360,000 to $3.6 million dollars. (CT 43.) It was important to Ontiveros' opinion about appellant possessing the marijuana for sale that the marijuana was broken down into one-pound increments which makes re-sale easier. (CT 43-44.) Appellant testified he is a priest of the Israel Zion Coptic Church; there are only 24 members of this church in the entire state of Wisconsin and they are the members of appellant's family and the family of his friend,Michael Matteson. (RT 319-320, 326-327; CT 71, 1143/.) His church is incorporated in the state of Wisconsin. (CT 71, 114.) Appellant estimated the total membership of the Israel Zion Coptic Church from Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina and elsewhere (including men, women and children) as between 200-250 members. (CT 74.) The Israel Zion Coptic Church is an offshoot of the Rastafarianmovement and the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. (RT 334-342; CT 84.) The Israel Zion Coptic's doctrine incorporates the use of marijuana (referred to as "ganja") as a sacrament used during religious services and gatherings. (CT 71-73, 114.) Appellant was arrested in 1987 in Wisconsin for growing marijuana. (RT 392-393.) One of the conditions of his probation in Wisconsin was not to grow marijuana anymore. (RT 393-393.) Because of this probation condition, appellant decided to travel to San Diego to purchasemarijuana for the church's use. (RT 391-394.) About $30,000 was collected between appellant and two friends from Iowa to make the purchase. (RT 391, 349.) Appellant drove to San Diego and purchased the 40 pounds of marijuana. (RT 400-402.) He was stopped at the Temecula checkpoint while driving back to Wisconsin.4/ APPELLANT'S CONTENTIONS 1. There was insufficient evidence to support a conviction of guilt based upon intent to sell madjuana. 2. The trial court cannot side-step the First Amendment freedom of religion issue on the basis that appellant's acts constituted a commercial activity. 3. The trial court cannot side-step the First Amendment issue and impose probation conditions which burden appellant's freedom of association and free exercise of religion. 4. Appellant's use of marijuana is protected by the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENT 1. Substantial evidence supports appellant's conviction on count two, possession of marijuana for sale. A. The lower court's findings. B. Analysis. 2. The trial court properly ruled appellant's act of transporting marijuana across state lines, some of which would go to individuals not connected with his church, constituted a commercial activity. 3. Appellant waived any objections to the terms and conditions of probation by not objecting to them at the time of sentencing. 4. It is unnecessary to reach the issue of whether appellant's use of marijuana is protected by the First Amendment's free exercise of religion clause; but if it is reached, appellant's argument should still be rejected. A. California's marijuana laws are in furtherance of compelling governmental interests. B. California's marijuana laws are the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling state interests in public health and safety. ARGUMENT I. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTS APPELLANT'S CONVICTION ON COUNT TWO, POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA FOR SALE Appellant argues there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on count two, possession of marijuana for sale, in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11359. (AOB 5.) More specifically, appellant argues the evidence did not show he intended to sell the marijuana, but only to give it away as a sacrament in his church. (AOB 5.) Appellant's argument should be rejected for at least four reasons: (1) "sale" includes "non-cash benefits" and appellant was seeking to obtain the non-cash benefit of new adherents to his church in exchange for giving them marijuana; (2) appellant through his own testimony revealed he was to receive an additional amount of marijuana in-kind for his actions of purchasing and delivering these pounds of marijuana; (3) appellant has failed to rebut the inference, created by virtue of the large amount of marijuana he possessed, that the marijuana was possessed for sale; and (4) circumstantial evidence (regarding packaging, and appellant's possession of $2,350 in cash) led Sheriff's Investigator Joel Ontiveros to state his expert opinion that appellant possessed the marijuana for purposes of sale. In considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, theappellate court must review the record in the light most favorable to thejudgment below to determine whether the record discloses substantialevidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendantguilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (Jackson v. Virginia (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781]; People v. Johnson (1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578; People v. Olguin (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1382.) Although the appellate court must ensure the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, it is the exclusive province of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which the determination depends. (People v. Barnes (1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 303.) The appellate court must also draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence which support the trier offact's verdict. (People v. Alcala (1984) 36 Cal.3d 604, 623; People v. Hernandez (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1177, 1181.) The same standard applies where the People rely primarily on circumstantial evidence. (People v. Perez (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1117, 1124.) Although it is the trier of fact's duty to acquit a defendant if it finds the circumstantial evidence is susceptible of two interpretations, one which suggests guilt and the other innocence, it is the trier of fact, not the appellate court which must be convinced of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. (Ibid.) "If the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact's findings, the opinion of the reviewing court that the circumstances might also be reasonably reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the judgment." (Ibid.) Thus, the relevant inquiry on appeal is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. (Jackson v. Virginia, supra, 443 U.S. at p. 319; People v. Lucero (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1006, 1020; People v. Hernandez, supra, 219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1182.) A. The Lower Court's Findings At sentencing, the court made the following relevant comments with regards to count two, possession for sale of marijuana: "[THE COURT]: I cannot stress how significant the Court found your testimony about the whole series of transactions and thought that went into the decision to leave the state of Wisconsin and its neighboring states and journey over a thousand miles to Southern California to acquire the marijuana which you were going to transport back. "....................... "You are going to be punished in this case [not because of] your involvement with this drug as part of your religion ... but because of your involvement with this drug as part of a commerce of marijuana users. The amount of 40 pounds, the sum of money of $28,000 are not insignificant amounts in the Court's eyes, nor do I think in the eyes of the community. This doesn't look like just Gregory Peck trying to practice his religion. This is Gregory Peck supplying others with marijuana at a particular price as part of the kind of money changing that another revolutionary took offense to when he picked up a whip and drove the money changers from the temple. There are things that occur in a religious context that are not religious, and that's how I view the evidence in this case." (RT 533-535; emphasis added.) B. Analysis Appellant's argument there is insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of possession for sale of marijuana should be rejected for at least the following four reasons: First, the meaning of "sale" within Health and Safety Code section 11359 has been greatly expanded after issuance of the opinion in People v. Lazenby (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1842. CALJIC No. 12.21 (Marijuana -- Illegal Possession For Sale) was revised in 1993 in light of Lazenby to define "sale" as "any exchange of marijuana for cash, favors, services, goods or other non-cash benefits." Lazenby looked back at former Health and Safety Code section 11008 which included "barter, exchange, or gift" within the definition of "sale." (People v. Lazenby, supra, 6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1845.) Lazenby noted that when former section 11008 was repealed in 1972 to bring California into substantial conformity with federal law, there was no indication the Legislature sought to prohibit only sales for cash. (Ibid.) The conclusion that "sale" includes transfers other than for money comports with the evident purposes of the California legislation, the commonly accepted meaning of the term and settled rules of statutory interpretation. (Ibid.) It is clear from his testimony that appellant intended to provide at least some of the 40 pounds of marijuana to others who were not members of his church. (RT 356-357, 387-389, 394-399, 405-408, 412-413.) In return, appellant was seeking to obtain new adherents to his church because in his words there could be no faith without the marijuana. (RT 356-358, 385-388, 405-408.) Such an exchange is certainly a "non-cash benefit" within the meaning of the jury instruction. Second, it is plain appellant was receiving physical and tangiblebenefit from the exchange of the maftjuana. Specifically, appellant was receiving more marijuana. Appellant testified he took $30,000 topurchase the marijuana in San Diego. (RT 391, 394.) Of that money, only $4,000 was his own. (RT 394.) Yet, appellant testified he was to receive one-third of the total amount of marijuana. (RT 404.) As the lower court noted at sentencing, appellant was "supplying others with marijuana at a particular price as part of the kind of money changing ..." (RT 534; emphasis added.) This exchange of marijuana had no spiritual element to it. A more precise definition of this transaction is probably "barter." It is common for drug dealers to receive payment in kind. Although it is sometimes difficult to tell in such situations who is the buyer and who is the seller, this type of exchange of marijuana for something of value is precisely what the law was intended to prohibit. Third, appellant acknowledges that possession of a large amount of a controlled substance itself affords a reasonable inference of possession for sale. (AOB 7; People v. Goliday (1973) 8 Cal.3d 771, 783-784; People v. Ingram (1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 673, 681; People v. Grant (1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 563, 570.) Appellant then attempts to rebut this inference by pointing to his own self-serving testimony about how he intended to give the marijuana to the members of his church for theiruse of it as a sacrament. (AOB 6-7; RT 405-407.) However, since "sale" is not limited to the exchange of marijuana for cash (see People v. Lazenby, supra, 6 Cal.App.4th 1842, and above discussion), appellant has failed to rebut the inference. Fourth, putting appellant's self-serving testimony aside, therewas strong circumstantial evidence that the marijuana was possessed forsale. The 40 pounds of marijuana was already broken down into one pound increments, each pound individually wrapped. (CT 44.) Moreover, appellant had $2,350 in cash (CT 27, 39) in his BMW (which he claimed was a gift from his mother, RT 392). The retail value of the marijuana, depending on the quality, was worth $360,000 to $3.6 million dollars. (CT 43.) These factors led Sheriff's Investigator Joel Ontiveros to testify that in his expert opinion the 40 pounds of marijuana appellant was transporting was possessed for purposes of sale. (CT 41-42.)5/ All of these reasons demonstrate there was substantial evidence to support appellant's conviction on count two, possession for sale of marijuana. II. THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY RULED APPELLANT'S ACT OF TRANSPORTING MARIJUANA ACROSS STATE LINES, SOME OF WHICH WOULD GO TO INDIVIDUALS NOT CONNECTED WITH HIS CHURCH, CONSTITUTED A COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY It is not disputed that by finding appellant had engaged in commercial activity the lower court side-stepped the constitutional issue of whether the Health and Safety Code prohibitions against possession for sale and transporting of marijuana violated appellant's First Amendment right to freely practice his religion. Appellant attacks his conviction on both counts arguing the lower court erred by virtue of failing to reach the constitutional issue. (AOB 8.) Appellant is wrong. The caselaw is clear that constitutional questions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds. Moreover, there is substantial evidence to support the court's conclusion that appellant's transportingof 40 pounds of marijuana was commercial activity. Immediately prior to finding appellant guilty, the lower court made the following pertinent findings: "[THE COURT]: Because this case deals with marijuana commerce, which is incidental to rather than an inteitral part of the practice of the defendant's religious beliefs, the Court feels it is not necessary for this Court to determine whether the State of California has adopted the lease [sic, "least"] restrictive means in order to further these valid governmental interests that relate to commercing in marijuana." (RT 519; emphasis added.) "[THE COURT:] It's important to note that the Court is not confronted in this particular case with an individual who possessed a small unable quantity of marijuana in the privacy of his own home or house of worship or one who was cultivating a modest number of plants for personal use with the intent to utilize them as part of religious ceremonies or rights, but rather, the amount of contraband involved and the circumstances under which it was possessed clearly indicates that on the defendant's own admission that he was -- he had purchased this marijuana for the purpose of transporting it interstate commerce to the state of Wisconsin to the environs near his home where it would be distributed to other individuals, some of whom were not involved in the practice -- practices of the Israel Zion Coptic Church. The defendant candidly acknowledged that he had no control over those drugs which would go to other parties. The amounts of money involved in the purchase and the amount of the drugs themselves are clearly set forth in the record." (RT 519-520; emphasis added.) It is a well-settled rule of appellate review that constitutional questions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds. (In re San Diego Commerce (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1236; In re Shannon B. (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1235, 1246, fn. 7; Reed v. City & County of San Francisco (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 572, 575; People v.Bowen (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 783, 789; Palermo v. Stockton Theatres, Inc. (1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 65.) This is such a case. It is unnecessary to the disposition of this issue that the constitutionality of appellant's use of marijuana in his religion be determined. There is substantial evidence to support the lower court's finding that appellant was engaging in marijuana commerce which was not called for by his religion, hence not covered by any assertion of First Amendment rights. Appellant testified he had pooled $30,000 together between himself and two other people from Iowa to purchase the 40 pounds of marijuana. (RT 391, 394.) These two people from Iowa had been members of appellant's church in Iowa, but the Iowa church had broken up. (RE 394-395.) Appellant had no way of knowing whether these friends of his from Iowa, who were going in with him on the purchase of the 40 pounds of marijuana, were going to use it as a sacrament," use it recreationally, or sell it commercially. (RT 412-415.) Prior to going into this pooled transaction to purchase the 40 pounds of marijuana, appellant and his church members had been practicing their religion by purchasing small amounts of marijuana at the going Wisconsin rate of $40-$60 for quarter-ounce amounts. (RT 393.) Appellant considered this too expensive which is why he decided to buy a bulk amount in San Diego where he knew he could buy it much cheaper. (RT 392-394.) The fact that appellant had another avenue for practicing his religion with marijuana (i.e., purchasing it in smaller retail amounts in Wisconsin) which did not involve violating California's laws against trafficking in marijuana demonstrates the lower court was correct in side-stepping appellant's constitutional challenge. Constitutionalquestions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds. (Ibid.)6/ Appellant's history also suggests his interest in the commercial aspect of marijuana is a long-standing concern. When appellant was arrested in 1987 for growing marijuana on his farm in Wisconsin, approximately 1,600 marijuana plants were seized. (State v. Peck (Wis.App. 1988) 422 N.W2d 160, 162.) Clearly, this was more marijuana than the 24 members of his congregation (RT 326-327) could reasonably use. Recently, the Ninth Circuit analyzed a similar constitutional challenge brought by Rastafarians on religious grounds to their prosecution under federal statutes against marijuana trafficking. (United States v. Bauer (9th Cir. 1996) 75 E3d 1366.) Although the Ninth Circuitruled that under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act the district court erred in excluding evidence in support of a religious defense as to the counts of simple possession, the district court also ruled it was not error to side-step the freedom of religion issue altogether with regards to the counts beyond simple possession of marijuana: "As to the counts relating to conspiracy to distribute, possession with intent to distribute, and money laundering, the religious freedom of the defendants was not invaded. Nothing before us suggests that Rastafarianism would require this conduct. These counts stand." (United States v. Bauer, supra, 75 F.3d at pp. 1375-1376; emphasis added.) Just as Rastafarianism was not a proper defense to commercial trafficking in marijuana in Bauer, appellant's professed religious beliefs (which are an off-shoot of Rastafarianism; RT 334-342; CT 84) was not a proper defense to appellant's commercial trafficking in marijuana in the instant case. The lower cottrt was correct in side-stepping the constitutional issue of whether California's statutes against possession for sale and transportation of marijuana violated appellant's First Amendment right to freely practice his religion. III. APPELLANT WAIVED ANY OBJECTIONS TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PROBATION BY NOT OBJECTING TO THEM AT THE TIME OF SENTENCING Appellant next argues the terms of his probation which prohibit him from possessing or using any controlled substance, and also prohibit him from associating with unrelated persons who possess, use or traffic in controlled substances unconstitutionally burden his free exercise of religion and his freedom of association. (AOB 17.) Appellant waived this issue by failing to object to these terms and conditions of probation at the sentencing hearing. In People v. Welch (1993) 5 Cal.4th 228, the California Supreme Court held that the failure to object to probation conditions at the time of sentencing waives the issue on appeal. (Id., at pp. 234-237; accord People v. Scott (1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 356-358; see also People v. Planavsky (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1302.) In the instant case, the probation report which was issued on June 29, 1995, recommended probation for appellant on condition appellant comply with specified terms and conditions including: "(1) Violate no law or ordinance; "........................... "(6) Not associate with any unrelated person known to be a possessor, user, or trafficker of controlled substances, nor any unrelated person on probation or parole; and "(7) Not possess nor use any controlled substances unless medically prescribed; any prescribed usage to be immediately reported to the Probation Officer." (CT 266I-266K.) At the sentencing hearing held July 10, 1995, defense counsel stated appellant was "willing and able to comply with the terms of probation." (RT 525.) The court specifically addressed appellant and invited him to comment on the recommendations of the probation report: "THE COURT: Mr. Peck ... I've [sic] assume you've read through the probation officer's report and understand the terms and conditions of probation they are recommending. "You have a right at this point in time, as far as I'm concerned, to address the Court as to the decisions I'm about to make ..." (RT 529.) Despite this invitation, appellant did not object personally or through counsel to the recommended terms and conditions of probation. Then, the court went through each individual term and condition of probation on the record with appellant (RT 535-541) after which the court again invited any comment on the terms of probation from appellant: "[THE COURT:] You understand all of these terms and conditions? "THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do. "THE COURT: You have any question about anything I said to you? "THE DEFENDANT: No, I don't. "THE COURT: Do you accept these terms and conditions? "THE DEFENDANT: Yes." (RT 541.) Because appellant failed to object to the terms and conditions of probation at the time of sentencing, the issue is waived on appeal. (People v. Welch, supra, 5 Cal.4th at pp. 234-237; People v. Scott, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 356-358; People v. Planavsky, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 1302.)7/ IV. IT IS UNNECESSARY TO REACH THE ISSUE OF WHETHER APPELLANT'S USE OF MARIJUANA IS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION CLAUSE; BUT IF IT IS REACHED, APPELLANT'S ARGUMENT SHOULD STILL BE REJECTED As previously stated, respondent argues it is unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue of whether appellant's use of marijuana is protected by the First Amendment because he was punished for marijuana trafficking which was incidental to, rather than an integral part of, the practice of his religion. (See Argument II, supra, incorporated here by reference.) However, assuming arguendo this Court reaches the constitutional issue, respodent submits appellant's convictions here for transporting marijuana and possession for sale of marijuana are not protected by the First Amendment's Free exercise of religion clause for the following reasons. Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (hereinafter "RFRA") in 1993 (42 U.S.C. § 2000bb)8/ in response to the United States Supreme Court opinion in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith (1990) 494 U.S. 872, 108 L.Ed.2d 876,110 S.Ct. 1595. (Hereinafter Smith.) While implicitly criticizing Smith, the statute does not present itself as an interpretation of the Constitution overruling Smith; rather it consists of a command that must be followed as a matter of federal law. (United States v. Bauer, supra, F.3d at p. 1374.) The statute restored and codified the "compelling interest test" as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner (1963) 374 U.S. 398 [10 L.Ed.2d 965, 83 S.Ct. 1790]; and Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972) 406 U.S. 205 [32 L.Ed.2d 15, 92 S.Ct. 1526], for purposes of analyzing whether statutes substantially burden religious exercise without compelling justification. (42 U.S.C. § 2000bb, subds. (a) and (b); see United States v. Bauer, supra, 75 F.3d at pp. 1374-1375.) The compelling interest test is set forth in the statute as follows: "Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person -- "(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and "(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest." (42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1, subd. (b).) Applying this test to the instant case, the lower court correctly found that California's laws prohibiting the transportation and possession for sale of marijuana were in furtherance of compelling governmental interests. (RT 519.) Moreover, respondent submits California's statutes (Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11360 and 11359) are the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling governmental interests.9/ A. California's Marijuana Laws Are In Futherance of Compelling Governmental Interests In the instant case, the lower court held that California's lawsprohibiting the transportation and possession for sale of marijuana werein furtherance of compelling governmental interests: "[THE COURT:] From the evidence received in this trial, the Court finds that the enforcement of laws prohibiting commercial transactions in marijuana embodied in Health and Safety Code Section 11359 and 11360 are valid and compelling public health safety, societal and governmental health interest[s] on the part of the People on [sic, "of"] the state of California." (RT 519.) The lower court's ruling was correct and should be upheld by this Court. In examining the reasons supporting this conclusion, it shouldfirst be noted that two other states, Wisconsin and Iowa, have come to the same conclusion with regard to religious constitutional challenges to the marijuana laws by members of the Coptic Church. 1. Deference Should Be Given To Decisions ByOther State Courts Which Have Ruled On This Issue In State v. Peck, supra, 422 N.W2d 160, appellant was thedefendant and he challenged Wisconsin's marijuana laws on the same grounds he is challenging California's marijuana laws in the instant case. The Wisconsin court stated in relevant part as follows: "The Wisconsin legislature, in enacting ch. 161, Stats. [Wisconsin's drug laws], expressly found that the abuse of marijuana and other controlled substances 'constitutes a serious problem foe society.' [Citation.] ... In Rush [United States v. Rush (1st Cir. 1984) 738 F.2d 497], a case involving an identical 'free exercise' challenge to federal drug laws by the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, the court, while recognizing conflicting opinions as to whether marijuana is a health hazard and a threat to social welfare or simply a harmless recreational drug, noted that: "Every federal court that has considered the matter, so far as we are aware, has accepted the congressional determination that marijuana in fact poses a real threat to individual health and social welfare, and has upheld the criminal sanctions for possession and distribution of marijuana even where such sanctions infringe on the free exercise of religion. Id. at 512. [Footnote omitted.] "A majority of state courts considering the question have reached a similar result. [Footnote omitted.] "..................... "Preservation of the public health and safety is the obvious purpose underlying Wisconsin's drug laws, and we see a compelling state purpose in the regulation of marijuana and other controlled substances. On this record, and in light of the nearly unanimous rulings of other state and federal courts on the issue, we conclude that the state interest is of sufficient magnitude to override Peck's first amendment interest in using the drug as a daily continual sacrament in his admittedly sincere role as a member of the Israel Zion Coptic Church. [Footnote omitted.]" (State v. Peck, supra, 422 N.W2d at pp. 163-164; emphasis added.) Similarly, in State v. Olsen (Iowa 1982) 315 N.W.2d 1, the defendant, a priest in the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church charged with possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, challenged the trial court's refusal of his requested instructions on the religious use of marijuana asa defense. The Supreme Court of Iowa concluded: "A compelling state interest sufficient to override Olsen's free exercise clause argument is demonstrated in this case." (Id., at p. 9.) Appellant testified he regularly smoked marijuana and would then drive on the streets and highways of Wisconsin. (RT 363-367, 373-376, 423.) In fact, he had smoked marijuana in his hotel the morning of his arrest. (RT 410.) Had the 40 pounds of marijuana in appellant's car not been seized, they would clearly have had a deleterious effect on thecitizens of Wisconsin, and possibly Iowa. Appellant, with rolling papers in his pocket, was found headed north on Interstate 13, and presumablywould have exited California within a few hours and passed through several other states before arriving home in Wisconsin. Because the effects of appellant driving possibly under the influence of marijuana would have been felt in the states of Wisconsin and Iowa, this Court should give deference to the decisions of those states. Comity should be given to the decisions of the sister states of Wisconsin and Iowa with regard to decisions primarily affecting the health and welfare of citizens of those states. (See People v. Pensinger (1991) 32 Cal.3d 1210, 1261.) 2. The Evidence In This Case Demonstrated Compelling State Interests The testimony of expert witnesses and appellant's own testimony about the casual and continuous smoking of marijuana by members of his church demonstrated why California has compelling state interests in regulating marijuana to promote public health and safety in California. Prosecution expert Dr. Marcelline Burns testified she had "hands-on" experience in administering smoked marijuana to individuals and then observing them as they are asked to perform a variety of tasks. (RT 102-107, 110-129.) Dr. Burns described tests she conducted with regard to attention and motor skills, particularly the driving of automobiles and flying of airplanes. (RT 110-129, 238-239.) She testified individuals smoking marijuana10/ were unsafe to drive a car. (RT 126-129, 132-135, 236, 301, 305-306.) Dr. Burns testified such individuals displayed tracking, concentration, and reaction time problems. (RT 126-129, 132.) She testified these symptoms would persist for four to eight hours. (RT 134.) Dr. Burns noted several studies indicate marijuana use may cause short-term changes in brain structure, temporarily lowered testosterone levels, and possible "a-motivational syndrome." (RT 243-244.) Based upon the effects she has observed in those who use marijuana, and the literature she has read, she had strong concerns about providing marijuana to children. (RT 129, 237-238.) Defense expert Dr. John Morgan testified he too had strong concerns about providing marijuana to children. (RT 189, 221-222.) He believed marijuana use impaired driving. (RT 199, 202-203.) Because marijuana causes a quickening of the heart rate, Dr. Morgan recommended that anyone intending to smoke marijuana should first have a physical exam. (RT 220-221.) The manner in which appellant and other members of his church use marijuana takes on partictilar significance when considered in light of the above expert testimony. Appellant testified members of his church occasionally smoke marijuana all day long. (RT 359; see also RT 205.) Appellant acknowledged marijuana is provided to children; sometimes children earlier than eight years smoke marijuana. (RT 319-321, 382-385.) On a typical day, appellant stated he would start the morning by sharing a joint with his wife; sometimes smoking an entire joint by himself. (RT 363-367.) He would then leave to work in his fence installing business. (RT 363-367.) He has a mechanical hold digging machine he operates. (RT 367.) In order to get to job sites, appellantdrives on the roads and highways of Wisconsin. (RT 363-367.) If time permits, appellant smokes a joint during lunch and then drives back towork in his vehicle. (RT 364.) In the evening, appellant smokesmarijuana again, often times sharing it with his wife and at least someof his children. (RT 319-321, 363-367, 382-385.) The older children sometimes smoked marijuana in the evening even though they would begoing to school the next day with their homework assignments. (RT 384-387.) Appellant testified that thouagh he and his wife smoked marijuana, they were typically the only persons watching their children as they played. (RT 390.) Appellant's friend, Michael Matteson, who is also a member of appellant's church does things much the same as appellant expect that he is a carpenter. (RT 324-328, 358-361.) Mr. Matteson spends a lot of time in his carpentry workshop operating electric tools including a band saw. (RT 369-371.) Nevertheless, marijuana is smoked there byMr. Matteson and his children. (RT 371-373.) Appellant makes no effort to limit his marijuana use to certain days of the week or to specific religious ceremonies (RT 360-362, 354-355), such as Native American Church members do with peyote and marijuana. (RT 36, 40-41, 45-46, 51-55, 67-69.) Rather, he provides it to his young children and he smokes marijuana frequently before getting behind the wheel to drive on public streets and before operating heavy machinery. Such disregard for the health and safety of himself, his family and the public at large vividly demonstrates why California has a compelling interest to intervene and regulate such conduct. The lower court did not abuse its discretion in so finding. B. California's Marijuana Laws Are The Least Restrictive Means Of Furthering The Compelling State Interests In Public Health And Safety The least restrictive means prong of the compelling state interest test is less developed than the first prong of identifying a compelling state interest. The reason this is so appears to be because once a court has found a compelling state interest, it is difficult for a court to dictate how this interest might be "fine-tuned" in its application. Administration of a law is an executive function which must take into account such problems as day-to-day administrative mechanics, distribution of limited resources, long-term effects, and other such considerations. As stated by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals in State v. Peck, supra, 422 N.W.2d at page 164, footnote 3: "Peck suggests without elaboration, that the state could accomplish its goals by developing 'reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on the use of marijuana.' Any such action, however, would be for the legislature, not the courts, to undertake." (Emphasis added.) Nevertheless, assuming this Court has reached this stage of the constitutional analysis11/, a key distinction should be kept in mind: because appellant was convicted of marijuana trafficking offenses (Health & Saf. Code, § 11360, subd. (a), transporting marijuana; and Health & Saf. Code, § 11359, possession of marijuana for sale) rather than simple possession of marijuana, the real issue presented here is whether Health and Safety Code sections 11360, subdivision (a), and 11359 are the least restrictive means with regard to controlling marijuana trafficking. The issue is not, as appellant attempts to frame it, whether California's laws with regard to simple possession of an unspecified amount of marijuana for personal religious use are the least restrictive means available so as not to infringe on the First Amendment religious freedom rights of citizens.12/ With this distinction in mind, let us turn to Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, supra, 494 U.S. 872. In Smith, Justice O'Connor concurred in the judgment of the majority but did so byapplying the Sherbert test, which is exactly what Congress mandated in subsequently passing the RFRA in 1993. (42 U.S.C. § 2000bb, subd.(b).) With regard to peyote use within the context of a religious ceremony of the Native American Church, she found there was a compelling state interest in the regulation of peyote by the government and it was advanced by the least restrictive means. She wrote, "I would conclude that uniform application of Oregon's criminal prohibition is 'essential to accomplish' [citationj its overriding interest in preventing the physical harm caused by the use of a Schedule I controlled substance." (Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. at p. 905.) Justice O'Connor gave two reasons. First, "[b]ecause the health effects caused by the use of controlled substances exist regardless of the motivation of the user, the use of such substances, even for religious purposes, violates the very purpose of the laws that prohibit them. [Citation.]" (Ibid.) Second, "in view of the societal interest in preventing trafficking in controlled substances, uniform application of the criminal prohibition at issue is essential to the effectiveness of Oregon's stated interest in preventing any possession of peyote. [Citation.]" (Ibid.) Though Justice O'Connor was discussing peyote, the same rationales apply equally with regard to marijuana. The health effects and dangers exist both with regard to adults and children notwithstanding the religious purpose for which appellant claims it is used. To permit appellant to use and distribute marijuana among friends and family even for religious purposes does not resolve state health concerns. Likewise, with regard to preventing trafficking in marijuana -- to accept appellant's religious defense to his trafficking convictions would put an unworkable burden on law enforcement and the courts to divine who fall into the category of a religious exemption at any given moment in time. It was also encourage completely non-religious marijuana traffickers to raise bogus religious defenses in efforts to cloak their true nefarious purposes. (See United States v. Meyers (D.Wyo. 1995) 906 F.Supp. 1494 [district court rejected claim that self-declared "Reverend" in the "Church of Marijuana" had legitimate religious beliefs protectable under RFRA].) Similarly, this Court in Music Plus Four, Inc v. Barnet (1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 113, upheld a city ordinance which prohibited the display and sale of drug and marijuana paraphernalia (pipes, "alligator" clips, etc.) to minors. This Court found it was a compelling state interest "of the highest priority" to "protect children from exploitation by those trafficking in drugs and drug-related products." (Id., at p. 130.) Likewise, this Court found that the city ordinance which required minors to be accompanied by a parent or guardian before such drug and marijuana paraphernalia could be displayed or sold to them was "the least restrictive means to achieve that goal." (Music Plus Four, Inc. v. Barnet, supra, 114 Cal.App.3d at p. 130; emphasis added.) If it is a compelling state interest of the highest priority to protect children from exposure to marijuana-related products, certainly it is an even higher priority to protect them from the actual trafficking of marijuana. Likewise, Health and Safety Code sections 11360, subdivision (a), and 11359 are the least restrictive means with regard to controlling marijuana trafficking because the threat of substantial prison incarceration is necessary as a deterrent to those who would traffic marijuana to our children and citizens in general. The fact that these laws also provide flexibility with the possibility of probation (such as in appellant's case) for those motivated by more benign purposes also reflects how these statutes are the least restrictive means for achieving the state's compelling interests in ensuring public health and safety. Ultimately, in this specific case, the least restrictive means prong is not of great importance. Even if California had in place a system by which appellant was able to lawfully obtain marijuana for religious purposes, such a system would still not address most of the state's primary concerns. Appellant gets into motor vehicles and drives shortly after smoking marijuana. It seems relatively clear appellant does not believe marijuana smoking substantially impairs a driver or heavy machine operator. He gives marijuana to children. If the state permitted appellant's use of marijuana but forbade it to his children, appellant apparently would not follow such a law as he believes it is necessary for children to smoke marijuana once they have reached the "age of reason" in order to follow his beliefs. (KT 382-384.) For all these reasons, appellant's use of marijuana is not protected by the First Amendment. CONCLUSION For all these reasons, appellant's use of marijuana is not protected by the First Amendment. Dated: June 4, 1996. Respectfully submitted, DANIEL E.

Counsel stipulated that the transcript of the Grand Jury proceedings be admitted into evidence at trial. (RT 14.) 2. Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 U.S. 436, 444 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694]. 3. Counsel stipulated that the transcript of the August 29, 1994, Evidence Code section 402 hearing being admitted into evidence at trial. (RT 9-10.) 4. Expert witnesses also testified regarding the effects and harmfulness of marijuana. The testimony of these witnesses is discussed in Argument IV. 5. It should also be noted that it was unlikely appellant could have used the entire 13 pounds of marijuana which was to be his portion of the 40 pounds entirely by his church. Appellant testified that there were only 24 members of his church, including his children. (RT 326-327.) Appellant also testified he and his wife smoked an average of about three joints of marijuana per day between them. (RT 363-364.) However, Sheriffs Investigator Ontiveros testified that according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Campaign Against Marijuana Planting (CAMP), ten pounds of marijuana would yield enough hours of intoxication for one person to stay intoxicated for 2.1 years contintiously. That's smoking one-half gram marijuana joint or marijuana cigarette every two hours, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year." (CT 42.) 6. Assuming arguendo the lower court should not have side-stepped appellant's First Amendment challenge, it should still be rejected for the reasons set forth in Argument IV, infra. 7. Even assuming arguendo the issue were not waived on appeal, the terms and conditions of probation were proper in any event (See Argument IV, infra.) 8. The lower court noted that the RFRA controlled in this case: The defense contends and the People concede in this case that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 governs the application of California state laws relating fo the use, possession, and distribution of marijuana by the defendant in this case." (RT 519.) Appellant's reliance on the old California case People v. Woody (1964) 61 Cal.2d 716 to support his constitutional challenge is misplaced. Woody based its analysis strictly on federal grounds and did not analyze the issue based on independent state grounds. 9. The threshold consideration for even applying the compelling interest test is to determine the sincerity of the defendant's belief in the tenants and practices of the religion of which he asserts he is a part. (United States v. Bauer, supra, 75 F.3d at p.1376.) Here, the prosecution contested the sincerity of appellant's beliefs but the court implicitly found them to be sincere. (RT 518-519, 533-534.) Insofar as the lower court's determination is a factual finding, it is entitled to deference on appeal. (See People v. Marquez (1992) 1 Cal.4th 553, 570; People v. Meredith (1992) 11 Ca1.App.4th 1548, 1561; People v. Gallant (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 200, 206.) However, if the court's finding is a mixed question of fact and law, this Court is entitled to review the issue independently. (Ibid; see also People v. Boissard (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 972, 977.) Respondent submits appellant's religious beliefs are not sincerely held. (See Argument I, supra; see CT 238-239; see also tbe factors used in U.S. v. Myers (D.Wyo. 1995) 906 F.Supp. 1494 to determine the sincerity of the religious beliefs of a self-declared "Reverend" in the "Church of Marijuana.") 10. Dr. Burns noted her laboratory marijuana was about six to seven times weaker than marijuana found on the street. (RT 235.) 11. See Transport Workers' Local 234 v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (3rd Cir. 1988) 863 F.2d 1110, 1120 [the least restrictive means analysis applied in cases implicating the First Amendment is not applicable to cases arising under the Fourth Amendment]. 12. Indeed, had appellant been arrested for mere possession of less than an ounce of marijuana for use in his religion, he would only have suffered a citation (the equivalent of a speeding ticket and not even been booked. (Health & Saf. Code, § 11357, subd. (b).) Clearly, such a legislative scheme for simple possession of small amounts of marijuana is the least restrictive means of achieving the compelling state interest in public health and safety.WT01-B19-154IA087-000632-B046-105http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/COPTIC/LETTERS/jim-04.html 206.61.184.43 19970122073324 text/html 26413HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:33:17 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:04:19 GMTContent-length: 26197 Tranmer, Jim - October 29, 1996 Federal Prison System James Tranmer 17547-050 P.O. Box 1000 Lewisburg, PA 17837 Hello, dear Jeffery, and hearty greetings toall you meet; Thank you for the invigorating note that you most recently sentto me and especially appreciate your saintly remembrance of Brianand your thoughtful communication to him. I hope you areaware that he is no longer in McKean FCI. He was accused ofinciting a riot there last October when the Federal prisonsacross Amerika spontaneously erupted after congress refused to addressthe harsh penalties meted out to crack (read black) users and distributorsas opposed to the powder cocaine sentences. Anyway, he'sbeen on lockdown ever since and is presently being housed inBeckley, W. Va. He is a warrior. I have no excuses, real or imagined, why I have not been moreprompt in returning a letter to you. I do thank you forreminding me that I am full of shit, lest at any time I shouldhappen to overlook such an obvious bit of information. Besides, I like it when you talk dirty to me :-). I willsay that I have thought of you on numerous occasions and evenreminded myself that I should respond to your letters andacknowledge receipt of your gift to me of the book "GreenGold," but, alas, I had no movement of my spirit to exercise mypencil hand until just now and I am grateful for the stimulationthat you provided. By the way, in answer to your question,there is nothing that you either said or did that pissed me offin any way. It has been a long time since anyone has pissedme off by anything that they have said to me or about me. Thisdoes not mean, however, that I am incapable of reacting to verbal stimulus,for this is one of my favorite pursuits of interest -- to reactverbally to something someone has said or done. Hammeringwhat I consider to be hypocrisy or ignorance or any number ofother moral infirmaties always gives me great pleasure. I am always interested in updates about any and all or our formerassocates in the Coptic experience and also all of those who wereconsidered to be merely fringe performers, imposter performers,or bad performers who were excommunicated from the fellowship ofkindred minds (?) pecking order because of some perceivedblasphemy in the mind of the spiritually tyrannical Nyah BingiMan. I find all of these characters, or whichever categorythey may be classified, to be of great interest to me. As Ireview each individual that I came in contact with as a result ofthis spiritual movement, which somehow evolved into theganja-smuggling juggernaut known as Coptic, I find that almost unanimouslythese people were motivated to do what they did by a sincere beliefthat they were drawing themselves closer to the will of the trueand living God. When many were the recipients of critical"fire," and some even permanently ostracized from theright hand of God or banished to a limbo or non-descriptbanality, it was more devastating than anything they could have previouslyimagined. They examined themselves, thought that theirintentions were simply to know God and to attempt to purifythemselves, and suddenly they found themselves alienated fromtheir adopted spiritual family and stamped with the accurseddesignation of "fuckery." All because they didnot fit into the extremely limited parameters of Keith's cadre ofsycophants and mindless robots. No one could stand up tothat spiritually powerful asshole who rode roughshod over hiskingdom of ass-kickers who readily and willingly stepped on eachother in order to draw closer to his and Wally's fiegnedholiness. Meanwhile, these two guys were fucking dozens ofwomen, each under the guise of sanctifying them. I won't gointo all the horrifying hypocrisy that occurred under the Copticbanner. And even though all were guilty of plenty of sinsduring the 4, 3, and 8 era, only Keith and Wally were in aposition to lead and, thus, they are ultimately responsible forthe catastrophe whose fruit is the rottenness we now behold amongall those of use who vowed to "Let perfect love andfriendship reign, through all eternity." I am not condemning anyone. I am merely stating whathappened even though I am not going into an in depth analysis ofthe overwhelming corruption that resulted. If, perhaps, youwill allow me to make a little analogy. Think of a minefieldthat lies in the path of a group objective which promisesunimagined euphoria for all those involved. There is no wayof circumventing the hazards posed by the lethal mines. Someone, or maybe even a few, must encounter the minefieldhead-on, exploding the deadly obstacles, and, by this foray into unchartedterritory of vanity, clear a path that can safely be trod by allthose who come after. Once this path has been cleared, canwe pretend that nothing has happened? Do we pretend thatthose who were blown apart by the mines are still among us in onepiece because we do not want to accept that they are mutilatedbeyong recognition? Do we then refuse to proceed to thesafety and joy of the promised euphoria? This may not bethe most enlightened symbolism that could be posed, but I'm sureyou can comprehend what it is that I'm inferring. When first we became aware of the existence of the spirituallight, a group of us gathered in a place near Papine, in St.Andrew Parish near Kingston, Jamaica. There was amanifestation in the embodiment of a guy we knew as Brother Ivy,one George Baker Ivy. Only a small number of the sistersand brothers who would at some later times and dates becomeassociated with this movement actually say and experienced thevibration of that man during those few short months. Thisin no way indicates any special hierarchy because of thisexperience or as a result of a lack of this experience. Itis simply, throught the best effort of my memory and my honestportrayal of the understanding of those events, whathappened. I have a detailed story of how it was that I arrivedat Papine on March 8, 1971, but suffice to say that I wasdirected there by Nathan and Cynthia, generally, and, morespecifically, by Howard after I arrived in Miami. I travelled alone and, when I reached the humble "camp"in the wilderness I was initially greeted by Ivy, himself, and asmall group of men constructing a foul coup. When Iproceeded to the actual building that was the church, I encounteredTommy, Gary, Alan, and a fellow named Herbie inside. Herbie wasrun off by Keith after Ivy's death for the inforgivabletransgression of trimming his hair. Tommy, Gary, and Alanbecame Keith's chosen heirs after his death to the accumulationof the physical attainments of the ganja enterprise. Ironic, to say the least. Anyway, Marvin and Andy, Nathanand Cynthia, Brad, Jake, Sarah, Bobby, Tommy, Howard, Gary, Alan,Bighead Stevie, Judy, Cliff, myself, and some others who may nothave remained among us for too long attended the spiritual feasthosted by Ivy. A bevy of African-descendant Jamaicans werealso in attendance, some sporadic and some daily. Keith,Wally, Dougie (Samson), Kootman, Shine, Blossom, and Flowers werebut a few of these Jamaicans. Without question; not even the slightest, unmurmured question;the show, the stage, the script, the spirit, and all of the bitactors and actresses belonged to Ivy. There was onepervading and prevalent premise that permeated every singly beingthat I personally encountered during this time. This wasnot something that was told to you or to anyone upon theirarrival, but once someone had discerned for themselves what wasspiritually taking place, then the accepted premise was openlydiscussed by all of those who had what was considered to be thatdiscernment. What was that discernment? Quitesimply and unequivocally that Ivy was the resurrected spirit ofthe Christ spoken of in the scriptures. Quite simply andirrevocably that Ivy was the embodiment of that divine and holyspirit which has become known to mankind as the savior of humanity,the annointed one. Of this one fact there was nodispute. Of this one fact there was no doubt. Of thisone fact all of those people whom I have previously mentionedwere in agreement. Whatever any of them may say now, orwhatever any of them may have said or done subsequent to theman's departure from that body, I assure you with every morsel ofconsciousness that may exist within me and I vow a solemn oath toyou on the blood coursing through my veins that all of thesepeople, along with myself, confessed with our mouths that thisman, Ivy, was the Christ. No one challenged hisauthority as the only begotten son of that omnipotent God. I, personally, spoke to Keith of this spiritual phenomenon andhe, as my spiritual equal and brother at that time, wholeheartedlyapplauded my awakening and nurtured me personally in the self evidenttruth that we were both privy to. It was only after thedeath of Ivy and a period of youthful uncertainty and stumblingthat Keith asserted his sagacious knowledge of our blind trustand became our master rather than our brother. I will not delve into this transition at length because it is amatter that each person must acknowledge for themselves. Ifeach person, both man and woman, examines their personal story ofhow they first because aware of this spirit that continues tobind us in the most unusual manner, then I am certain that theywill be able to link their spiritual awakening, and whateverawareness they may possess, directly to Ivy. It is a factwhich must be. Whomever you first heard about this thingcalled "Doctrine" from can be traced to Ivy. It mattersnot whom this person was or these persons were. None of uscan claim ownership of this message of salvation, of these wordsor consolation. If, perchance, we were fortunate enough tobe a momentary vessel of the precious promise, this divinecovenant, then let us give thanks. And since we have allbeen the recipients of this holy hope of perfect love, then letus give thanks. We have quibbled for too long. Timeis really gliding on. I can think of no reason to hold onto animosity for anyone, least of all any of the sisters and thebrothers who share the common hope of the redemption from sin and corruptionthat we share. At the same time, I cannot with a clearconscience whitewash the past into something that is nottrue. Once we acknowledge what has happened, eitherspecific deeds which we have done or the cosmics that we havecollectively experienced, we will be free to laugh and to singand to praise. Otherwise, we are bound spiritually frombeholding the glory which we do possess individually and, to amuch greater extent, collectively. When you, Jeff, expressed bewilderment in one of your previousletters so long ago concerning the declaration which I made aboutIvy's divinity; that all things have authority only as they areviewed in the light of his divine sonship, that Ivy is the soneof God and that this and only this lends credence to any claimsthat we may make; I was absolutely flabbergasted by yourincredulity. It really shows how far we all strayed from when first we saw thelight. That someone like yourself, and many others of thebrothers and sisters who came among this congregation after Keithhad usurped control of all of our destinies, could be aroundBrad, Jake, Cliff, Tommy, Big Al, etc., etc., etc., and me and notbe acutely aware of Ivy and the indisputable aura of his divinitywhich made all of this spirituality that we know and lovepossible is a testament to our shamefulness. We should allhide our nakedness by diving into the valley of disbelievingunfaithfulness. It is a good thing that God is merciful andlaughs at our frailties. Keith turned us against each other for the love of filthylucre. Wally pretended to be a high priest with theregimented and mandatory hours of prayer. I know that theirattempts to place themselves on a plateau above their brethrenand sisters was an act of treachery and spiritualwickedness. All that multiple wife shit was a cloak forsatisfying their lusts. They both, Keith and Wally,willingly sacrificed their brethren and sisters lives so thatthey could fulfill their own vain interpretations of thescripture with them as Moses, Aaron, Peter, James, and John allof the other starring roles. What assholes! Keith befriendedthe nasty gunmen and actually catered to those murdering scoundrels. The litany of these types of events goes on and on. My handis tired. Did you ever notice how few new people cameamongst us as anything other than casual observeres or moneygrubbers during their tenure? In the few short months of Ivy's resurrection, a reverberationtransmitted itself to and through literally hundreds of souls andlinks them together even today after more than twenty-five yearsof various turmoils. All of those who would profess to be loyal adherents to thevanity of the Coptic trip of Keith and company should rememberthat the man died alone, most probably of A.I.D.S., shitting uphimself and without the service of even a hot cup of tea. This seems a cold tribute, but true nevertheless. The poorguy had to suffer unimaginable loneliness in his last days onearth and because I knew him well and loved him, I feel thehorrifying emotions that abide outside of the realms of sincerethanksgiving that have at times overtaken all of us. Someone had to walk through the minefield to clear away all ofthe fatal flaws of a spiritual mortal. These vanities havebeen exposed and they can never again withstand the light ofawareness. Some may desire to retain a hierarchy ofhypocrisy but it has become no longer acceptable to a consciousnessthat is determined to give glory where glory is due, to givehonor where honor is due. These accolades belong to Godwho, though in us all, is far above us all. Man, primarilyman and not so much woman, in his vanity to proclaim himself tobe God has erred continually and abundantly by forgetting andneglecting the true attributes of the divine nature -- humility,long-suffering, the joy of service, and a few more that I'm sureyou can recall. Humble yourself and the spirit will cheeryou, humble yourself and you will walk with God. By theway, despite all the spiritual vibrancy that Ivy exuded, he was a determinedservant to us all and, although regal in every aspect of hisbeing, he managed to instill spiritual awareness and infailingcharismatic magnetism in all of us that experienced hisresurrection. It was so powerful that we were able to transmitthis purity to others in spite of our own delicatecondition. Again, I remind you, the consciousness that youpossess concerning your own spiritual being can be traceddirectly to Ivy through one of his emissaries that I have previouslywritten about. The seed of the precious fruit was Ivy andthat whole Coptic experience was a diversion from the purity ofthat holiness. All of our enthusiasm, all of our exuberancefrom the discovery of the font of life, all of our dedication todo the will of God, all of our desire to serve was recognized byKeith and selfishly channelled into a smuggling operation whichultimately brought great riches to Keith and a few others butfinally caused the alienation of the sistes and the brotherstoward each other, Carl "Z-man" Swanson's death, andprison sentences for a large number of the brothers. Somany things come to my mind about that absolute travestymasquerading as godliness that it is impossible to even begin torelate the depths of deceitfulness which occurred among us insuch a limited purview as a short letter. Tomes, with inputfrom all of the participants, would be required to get the properperspective or, perhaps, endless hours of truthful reasoningwould help expose everyone's persistent desire to mask ourparticipation in a fraudulent counterfeit after we had experiencedand handled the genuine article. Where does all of this leave us now? Just exactly where weare. Each of us has a few brothers and sisters from thatspiritual age with whom we communicate and/or associate. Then, generally speaking, there is a larger number of brothersand sisters from the said era with whom no contact or associationis desired. This category is loathed, coveted, or presumedto be cursed for some self-serving reason which only theindividual, themself, knows. This completely illogical,nasty, and unchristianlike reasons to harbor ill-will may haveeven stemmed from a time when Keith or Wally, sitting on their spuriousthrone of judgment, pronounced that the poor brother or sister in questionwas, indeed, "fuckery." Of course, this lentjustification to depise the dear soul into eternity. Howludicrous and downright mean-spirited are these nerds? Andthey want someone to take them seriously. Even their prayeris sin. And the longer and the more persistently stubbornsomeone opts to be in holding onto these unclean spirits, themore insistent that someone determines to be in defending thewickedness of that exclusionary little club of scurrilous nincompoops,then the longer it will be before we can "Behold how goodand how pleasant it is for sisters and brothers to dwell togetherin unity." And that does not mean everyone living inone house while other houses stand empty awaiting a cache ofsmuggled ganja. I cannot predict how it should be or how it will be or how itwon't be. I am, however, absolutely confident that whenpeople genuinely love one another, then they can solve anyproblems which may arise with ease and minimal effort. Youcannot condemn someone that you love! Leave those weighty mattersto God. We can resist any evil behavior so that it does notenter into our own realm or action, but we must always beready to forgive, especially those we know to besojourners with us on this path whose destination leads us to aperfect praise of that perfect spirit that we have tasted of andknown. Outside of this simple, realistic desire to achievethis acceptable demeanor, all else results in vanity and vexationof the spirit. That was a pretty long-winded dissertation about a subject thatis so long in the past. See what your short note to meinspired. And believe me, I really had to restrain myselflest a more scathing analysis of our collective present conditionhad poured forth. This past summer was noteworthy to me because of some very nice encountersthat Judy was fortunate enough to experience. Shethoroughly enjoyed each one and realizes how uplifting thespecial bond is between all of these old characters. Over the 4th of July she went up to Billie's and Pop's house withJane Swanson and Irene (Chuck's wife). Gary and Eileen werethere and Bobby. Sweet reminiscing and a touch ofspontaneous praise. Nate and Cynthia and Marvin and Andy visited here in Iowa Cityand, of course, the subject was our mutual experience and theblessedness of this holy spirit that we know and love. Jane and Joel came though Iowa with Blossom and Big Bob in towand spent a short time together on some land that Jane has insouthern Iowa. Plenty of kids, Rich Cone, and a few otherfolks who had experienced this spirit but were never considered apart of the fellowship because they didn't have Keith's sanction. They didn't even know him, but are a part of that spirit family nonetheless. Plenty of stories and updates always accompany each of these folksabout other of the brothers and sisters whom we may not have been fortunateenough to see just yet. All are languishing, whether theyrealize it or not, for the company of their spiritualsibblings. All are languishing to see the saints and toharmonize with others of this limitless family of Ivy'soffspring. All await, whether consciously orsubconsciously, for the fullfillment of that promise that weheard when first we saw the light. Samson claims, via Nate and Cindy, that he should be the elderwho is heir to whatever remains of the skeletal bones of theCoptic and that he wants the St. Thomas property only to have aplace for the brothers and sisters to congregate when and if theyare ever moved to do such a thing. :-) I can only speak formyself. I have everything that I had hoped for when I firstheard this blessed promise. I can actually sing psalms andI love to do it even though at present it is an exercise Iperform alone. If this is my sole inheritance, I know thatI am blessed. I have the armaments to carry me through anybattle from both enemies within and enemies without. Iremember Samson as a real jovial and uplifting character atcertain times. When he started his routine about Mr. Mach-a-vahcome from afar riding on his pimbacarry he could certainly entertainanyone. His rendition of "From Greenland's IcyMountains" is truly divine. His long-suffering is notforgotten. But then, as with all of us, there are certainaspects of his personality that must be left behind because weall know that "You cannot get to Zion with a carnalmind." In any event, we march on to tomorrow. Who can say what itwill bring? We maintain our individual hopes. Weknow, and God certainly knows, what it is that we truly hope for. If I have provided you with a little food for your spirit toprocess, then I am glad. If not, then I am almost asglad. I know that your hope is a blessed hope simply fromthe things which you say and my limited knowledge of your activities. I can see good in each of the oldtime sisters and brothers. I sincerely long to see each one of them and to probe the regionsof Zion that we have journeyed to in times post. I suspectthat we are all a bit more familiar with the surroundings thistime around and will not get lost so easily. When Judy was with Gary and the rest that I previously mentionedat Billie's place near Chicago last summer, Gary reminisced abouta recent moment that he had spent with Tommy and some others inMiami. He said something like, "If Tommy is everreleased from the feds ominous threat of another trial that 'all hellwill break loose'," meaning that "Bro. Louv" willsomehow resurrect into the awesome reviver of the Copticlegacy. I say Tommy is not going to bust even a singlegrape until he acknowledges the Vanity Fair of the whole Coptic episodeand refreshes his memory concerning the enormous vitality that hewas infused with by Ivy in the very beginning. He must stoppretending to be the Apostle Paul or Brother Louv and just becontent with being Brother Tommy who, in reality, is one of themost lovely and lovable creatures of all time. Cliff sent a message via E-mail to Carl asking the rhetoricalquestion, "What happened to the brethren?" Ifanyone has even the slightest comprehension concerning whatreally happened to the sisters and the brothers, I suspect it wouldbe old Cliff. How ironic that Tommy and Cliff have beenwithin a few miles of each other for over 10 years and each hastheir own reasons for remaining aloof. I know them bothquite well and love each for his stubborn faithlessness. Come on down, boys and girls, there is no difference here. I love the memory of each, for that is all that I have. I remain, then, the old goat who has lost his bleat, -- Jim WT01-B19-155IA087-000632-B046-127http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/COPTIC/LETTERS/brian-03.html 206.61.184.43 19970122073333 text/html 8417HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:33:26 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:03:56 GMTContent-length: 8202 Tranmer, Brian - October 23, 1996 Brian Tranmer 02683-017 Post Office Box 350 Beaver, WV 25813 10/23/96 Louv brother Carl, I know that it's been a little while since Ireturned something for the last letter you sent me but sometimesI'm just not in the letter writing mood plus there's not much newto tell you anyway. It's still the same old fuckery goingon here, it seems like everytime the guards change shifts (thepolice change every quarter so we get a few new assholes everythree months) we have to go through a bunch of extra shit untilwe break them in or else we just get used to them and learn howto work around the assholes. It's funny how people learn toadapt to most any situation and one thing that's good aboutsuffering is that it forces people to stand together that wouldbe hating each other under normal circumstances. I alsolike to believe the old cliche that "Suffering builds character." Sometimes I do wonder though if people that suffer get any reward inthe long run because you see people all over the earth sufferingand they never get any relief. Who knows maybe they getsome kind of blessing that we can't see but like you said"God is with those with the biggest armies or the mostmoney." Of course there has to be suffering to changewrongs that are being done and when you're suffering for a causeor something you believe in it can give you a certain pride anddignity that is a blessing in itself. The differencebetween people who know what they're suffering for and people who don'tare like night and day, people that go into suffering sacrificingand giving up small pleasures to make things better (or a hope ofmaking things better) in the long run get a self worth and selfrespect that is like no other. It's a feeling that a persongets when they know that they might have some effect on the futureof or on the betterment of the human race. It's this spiritor desire to change things that has made man progress this farand have made man willing to give up their lives if necessary forsomething they believe in. So my point is that maybe theblessing that one gets for suffering is the feeling ofsatisfaction or self worth that a person feels or maybe sufferingis something that is necessary to make man learn how to livetogether in peace and how to better themselves in the longrun. Maybe that's why the Bible says that we should "Bearour suffering with joy," maybe our little minds can'tcomprehend the blessing that we get because we can't see the bigpicture of how mankind benefits through our suffering. Brother Jeffery wrote me a letter and sent me a few old picturesthe other day which was very nice of him to take the time todo. However, some of the thanks goes to you because he saidthat it was through your letters (or maybe it was through the"Internet computer system" because he also saidsomething about that) that he learned that I wanted some oldpictures. I wrote him back and thanked him and I also toldhim what I thought led to the brothers' down fall and why I feelthat they haven't been able to resurrect anything. Even thoughI was young I saw how things progressed, as I'm sure you know my fatherwas one of the first white brothers in Jamaica. I knewbrother Ivy, I lived at every house (except the one right beforehis death) that "Niah Keith" (with brother Keith andhis family) ever lived at in Jamaica, his children were like brothersand sisters to me. I lived with brother Wally, BrotherCootman (that was sister Phyllis's father) and shit I even livedat brother Dohgie's (Laurenton Dickens's) house (me being the onlywhite person there) in Bull Bay for about four months (I wasabout 9 years old at the time) one time while my parents were inAmerica. I lived with my family in America at all theplaces (I'm sure that you remember that my family lived up inMaine) where they made the moves and I was at all three of(the ranch, the Canal and Maine) the big busts and I went to ajuvenile (the Canal and Maine) home on two of them. I'mjust stating all of this to say that I was there from thebeginning (the beginning meaning when the white brothers firstwent to Jamaica) so I saw how things manifested throughtime. As I told brother Jeffery in my letter to him, thething that the brothers had in the beginning that drew themtogether, the thing that made them able to work together andaccomplish so much in such a short time was the louv and unitythey had for each other in the beginning. After a while throughthe hunger for power and greed certain ones set themselves up ona pedestal (as big Bob would say "The Elderberries")and started to think that they were some how more holy than theirbrother. It shifted from equality to some kind of a peckingorder where instead of looking out for their brothers & sisters bestinterest all they could do is play politics and think they werebetter than other people. Really I think it's a disgracehow the brothers ended up hating each other, no wonder not eventheir own children wanted to live that kind of life style. What ever you do you can't leave out the youth because young peopleare the future so you have to teach them what you know. That's another thing that the brothers did wrong, with all thosebig smart Coptic Priests around it's funny how they didn't teachthe children shit, they should have at least taught us how todrive those boats, if they would have maybe I wouldn't be hereright now. :-) As I said the only thing that the brothershad at one time that made them different from the rest of theworld was the louv (that's the spirit that, if used in the rightframe of mind, ganja enhances) so when they lost that for eachother they couldn't set an example for or draw anyone. For the brothersto ever come together in a spirit again they have to put asideall the bad thought and hatred that they carry for eachother. How did the old saying go? "Think rightlove and pray and you'll live in rejoicing every day." Louv is what the world is lacking and that's the key. Fighting for the freedom of ganja is good but if you can'tdisplay and give people the understanding of the frame of mindthat you're supposed to be in when you smoke it then people mightget the wrong concept (especially young people) of the spiritthat it induces and go on to abuse it just like most everyoneelse does. Ganja is a medicine it can be easilyabused. I believe that in the beginning the brothers hadthe spirit that the herb enhances but as time went on they lostthat spirit and ganja became the focal point (I know that Iabused it) and that's when they started to abuse it. It doesn'tdo any good to point the finger at anybody because we all make mistakesin life, (what was the old saying, "We all sin and fallshort of the glory of God") so the idea is to lift eachother and try not to make those same mistakes again. Maybeone day after the brothers get beat hard enough they'll forgetabout the bad feelings that they carry for each other and cometogether and have some fun. I'm not going to hold my breaththough. :-( One Louv!!

Box 1000 Lewisburg, PA 17837 September 6, 1996 Carl, I found a few minutes to write a fewlines to TomHarkin. I don't have much confidence, as you probablyknow, in either the judicial or the legislative branches of theU.S. Government. I tried to be brief and to the point and,as you will see in reading the enclosed copy, I did not attemptto employ diplomacy. It is difficult for me to see any ofthese politicians, lawyers, judges, etc. as being the least bitcompassionate or even attempting to understand people who useherb or advocate the use of herb. If these elected officialssincerely believed that the herb is evil, I could more readilyaccept their mealy-mouthed stance against its use in anycapacity. But I am thoroughly convinced of their consciousparticipation in a heartless, esoteric ploy, the goal of which isknown by these fraudulent marionettes who masquerade as myrepresentative and who pretend to have my well-being as themotive of their profession. I know that this is a lie andthat they represent the interests of those who have enabled themto achieve the lofty position that is indicated by theirparticular title. Pain and suffering are not their concernunless it happens to befall them or their families. I'm sure myletter will do neither good nor harm for Allen Helmers'tribulation because the political machine is determined to keepmarijuana from the people at all cost and these demons will treat Mr. Helmers withthe same bloodstained hands with which the have slain so manybefore him. I invoked the names of Jake and Tommy because the incident actuallytook place and because there are warriors in this great conflictwho know something about this subject and they are both armedwith the spiritual weapons that can make these impostersregurgitate. When and if they resurrect these dreadfulswords of the spirit is a question I am incapable oraddressing. We both know that some elementary exercises inhumility and some very real and elementary exorcisms of vanity,pride, and ill-will are required on an individual basis before wecan once again proclaim with conviction, "One God for usall." Judy has spent some time this summmer with manyseemingly incompatible spirits from days gone by. SistersBillie, Eileen, Jane S., Jane Z., Blossom, Irene L., Cynthia,Andy, Chris N., and probably a few more I cannot recall. Brothers Booblius, Rich Cone, Nate, Marv, Chuck L., Joel Z., andI know some others who slip my mind - Pops and Gary to nametwo. Bobby Kleine, too. Plus having talked to Lanceron the phone and having heard about dozens more via the oldgrapevine. Several Jamaicans having joined StevieKleinschmidt on the journey over yonder. Judy loved thecompany of each one and longs to talk and sing with as many moreas would be physically possible because she feels a "specialbond" with all of these fine folks. No shit!! Iwonder why? Could it be that we hold something in commonthat is magical in its mystery and yet so real to all ofus? We are only depriving ourselves of something holy anddivine if we attempt to exclude anyone. No one needworry. I can't come just yet, but sometime in May of 2024I'll be there. Save me a seat, Carl. Better get rightwith God, come and do it now, and at the cross of King Alpha andQueen Omega we lay our burden down! No one is better thananyone else and, thank God, no one is any worse. What aglory when we'll all be there. Have I lost my mind? Iactually do love all these characters, and more. Keep upthe good work.

Box 1000 Lewisburg, PA 17837 September 4, 1996 Hello Carl, Please ignore the surplus Hallmark. It was free from the chapel so I picked up a few. I am, however, happy for you because it seems a worthwhile expenditure of the happy emotion. I thank you for your continued consideration of an old goat like unto myself. I appreciate your thoughtful assistance toward my postal expenditures and I am well supplied with stamps even though I have been a bit negligent in communicating with those that I should be communicating with and also with several folks who, more than likely, have no desire whatsoever in hearing from me. Believe me. My musings and my meditations are not of a type which would be extremely popular with the masses. And they are not of a carnal nature, as I have by some act of divine grace been able to subdue those pesky, guilt-ridden little morsels of banality. HOORAY! I always enjoy receiving your newsletters and I laud your efforts to somehow make a reasonable argument of common sense to a set of religiously and politically indoctrinated, self-serving coterie of prejudiced money-grubbers whose motives are not righteous and who have redefined justice and liberty to suit themselves and their puppeteers. But over all, what I have enjoyed the most from what you have sent to me were the letters from Brian and your replies. Whichever came first I do not know, and which was a reply I cannot say, but I will say that I am very proud to be Brian's father and his perception of humanity is very moving to me. It was very kind of you to show an interest in the young man and to encourage him in the manner that you have. I know he has to be uplifted whenever he receives any correspondence from anyone. He has been persecuted to a draconian degree because of the herb and he has withstood all of these diabolical forces. Regardless of what anyone may think about ganja and society's resistance to people like Brian and myself who refuse to acquiesce to the mischief that they say is law, we will most likely remain the stubborn, stupid, quixotic dolts that we are until they succeed in squeezing the life out of us. Judy has been seeing a lot of the old brothers and sisters over the past several months and she has been completely delighted in the company of each and every one of them even though some animosities and a variety of misunderstanding seems to linger between various cliques so to speak. Is it possible that these old characters could ever be of one heart, one aim, one destiny as well all professed when first we saw the light? Of course it is possible. Is it probable? Only the bookmakers know the odds on that one. When Cliff sends you the cryptic little question, "What happened to the brethren?" I suspect that this is simply a rhetorical question disguised as some great mystery. I suspect we all have some clue as to what happened to us as individuals and also what happened to us as a collective group. There were also many sisters. So the question is not simply, "What happened to the brethren?" More aptly, "What happened to the sisters and the brethren?" Note: I now put the ladies before the hairy reasoners. I received the Garvey book. Thanks! I will write something to the Senator and I'll send you a copy. I love you all very much and almost all of my thoughts are of the HOOD. Female & male. Jane Zimmerwoman is a great gal.

I haven't heard from you for a long time. I recently heard about a recent 8th Circuit decision pertaining to a group of Rastas having the right to a freedom of religion defense in regards to possession of some marijuana they were growing. I assume that you published part of the decision in the Iowa NORML newsletter. The last newsletter I have from you is the fall of 1995. Please send me your latest newsletter containing the said decision if possible. I recently returned from a trip to Florida. While there I read some articles in Hemp Magazine out of Texas. The articles were implying that the DEA was overstepping its authority when they opposed farmers in Colorado trying to get the right to grow hemp for commercial purposes. The DEA also goes public declaring that marijuana is not a medicine & even had an agent at a protest against a radio station in Massachusetts that was playing marijuana songs. The article was saying that the DEA is paid to enforce the law not make it. Do you think that a class action lawsuit against the DEA on behalf of the sick & dying, the farmers who want to grow hemp commercially, the environmentalists who know hemp is good for the environment, those who would use marijuana as a spiritual sacrament, etc., is feasible? Looking forward to hearing from you on this matter.

Thanks also for the comments on Judas, and for saying that I don't fit the role. I wasn't suggesting that I play that role, I was merely addressing the fact that Christ loved Judas. This goes to the part where Christ talked about loving your enemies and doing good to them that hate you and despitefully use you. That was all I was getting at. As for telling my story, I'm sure a lot of the old church members would consider my version a complete betrayal of everything they believe in. I don't smoke the herb, for one thing. I consider the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church to have fallen because of selling the herb. I doubt very much if my views would be received with much sympathy from them. What I was getting at was that I don't give Judas the opportunity to kill me. I don't have any secrets which cannot be revealed. I've certainly done some embarrassing things that would make me feel ashamed to speak of them in public, but nothing that would put me (or anyone else) in a prison cell. I agree that Judas ended up destroying himself because of his actions, but it wasn't because Christ held any bad feelings toward him. You can rejoice in the knowledge that anyone who treats you treacherously will live in torment, although I'm not exactly sure that's something to rejoice over. I'd prefer it if people didn't act treacherously at all. I try not to give them the opportunity. At any rate, I was simply looking at things from my own perspective. I stopped smoking the herb so that no one would have control over me, particularly the informer. I suppose an informer could make something up from imagination, but at least it would be a lie. The way I was living before, the informer could have told the truth, like Judas, and put me away for a long time. I'll admit that it takes more than an informer's word sometimes (although not all the time, since your dad is living proof of that), but usually it takes some actual evidence to back it up. In my case, an informer could say I was breaking the law, but it would be difficult to prove it, since I don't. I'm looking to partake of my sacrament openly, or at least legally. I could do that in Holland, and I may move there some day. I think we should all be thinking about the very real world we live in, instead of isolating ourselves in some camp somewhere and selling herb to everyone to pay for it (a recipe for disaster, in my opinion). Prison taught me one thing, and that was that God was not on my side. As Marcus Garvey so wisely said, God doesn't take sides. Garvey liked what Napoleon had to say about it, "God is on the side with the biggest battalion." So far, we don't even have a security guard any more. I'd say we have some organizing to do. Thanks for the news about Stevie. I think I heard about it from someone else - maybe it was you. I agree that he was a good brother. Keep in touch. Sincerely, Carl E.

My conscience starts to bother me (which I believe is Goud's spirit working inside of a person) when I don't take the time to reciprocate or show some kind of appreciation for a letter or something someone has done for me. Anyway, I received your letter and as always I do enjoy hearing from you. Now to comment on some of the things in your letter. First let me say that I don't mind at all you sending some copies of my last letter to some of the brothers or even if you put it on "Internet," really I'm flattered that you think it's good enough and that other people would actually be interested in reading it. I didn't think that my letter writing skills were that good especially since I just learned (one good thing I got out of coming to prison) how to half-way write a letter in the last couple of years. Plus I never did call anyone's name (in the personal things I wrote) so I don't see where it could possibly do any harm. Shit, in fact it might even do some good. Maybe one of those "Assholes" that I was talking about will see it and their conscience (Goud) will start bothering them. This brings us back to the topic of "Judas" which at one point in your letter (surprisingly) you compared yourself to. Of course there is many ways that a "Judas" can manifest himself but I don't see where you would fit in any of those categories. I don't know of any time where you sold out your brothers' or friends' trust, that you betrayed for personal gain, or to save you from some pain. I don't know of any time when you and someone were in on something together and then you sold them out when the going got rough, or a time when you ever turned your back on a brother in need. You've never pinned any person (by name) to any particular event. Because you want to tell of your old experiences and adventures that doesn't make you a "Judas," plus you tell everyone straight up (since you've come to this frame of mind) not to tell you their secrets. You try to stay away from people (all the old brothers that might have something to hide) that have secrets to prevent anything from ever being told. Mind you, I don't necessarily agree with all of your views but I don't hold them against you and I damn sure don't look at you as a "Judas." Now I'm going to comment on some of the other aspects of "Judas" and his judgment. Let me ask you a question, Who do you think put it in "Judas'" heart to kill himself? Wasn't it the love that Christ had and the goodness that he showed "Judas" that made his conscience (which I believe is the spirit of Goud that makes it hard for a man to live with his wickedness) bother him so much that he had to go kill himself? If you believe that Goud works through man and knows the heart of every man then it was Goud who put it in his heart to kill himself. I don't know if it's true or not but from what I understand suicide is the only sin that can't be forgiven. So if you look at it from that perspective Goud did turn "Judas into dog meat." I believe that the Bible is a parable book and the story of "Judas" just shows that a disloyal person has not been respected since the beginning of time. I don't know if you heard this or not but just in case you didn't "Brother Stevie" (A.K.A. "Broke Back") got killed, by a drunken driver, in St. Louis not too long ago. I was sorry to hear it he was a good brother. From the dungeons of "Babylon" your brother always. Louv, Brian P.S. If you can send me another one of those "Louv Story" pamphlets.WT01-B19-161IA087-000632-B047-35http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/COPTIC/LETTERS/olsen-01.html 206.61.184.43 19970122073525 text/html 4091HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:35:09 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:04:09 GMTContent-length: 3876 Olsen, Carl - June 29, 1996 Carl Olsen Post Office Box 4091 Des Moines, IA 50333 June 29, 1996 Dear Brian, Thanks for the letter. I hope you don't mind if I send copies to some of the brothers and post it on my COPTIC page on the World Wide Web (Internet). I almost hesitate to publish it because of some of the very personal things you said, but I think you can explain them or retract them, as the case may be, so that it is only a manifestation of your thoughts at the time you wrote them. The first issue you brought up that concerns me is your statement about hating "Judas." I wonder if you think that Christ hated Judas. My understanding has always been that Christ loved Judas just as much as the other disciples. As a matter of fact, shortly after I stopped smoking ganja, I started calling myself "the informer," because I wanted people to know that I was no longer keeping any secrets. If you have a secret, don't tell it to me. Somewhere in the Bible it talks about there being no secret that will not be revealed. I think there's another line about that which was spoken in secret will be shouted from the rooftops, or something like that. When I stopped smoking ganja, I also keyed on the scripture where Christ tells his disciples that he will no longer partake of the sacrament until he partakes of it new with them in the kingdom of God. We were always taught that you make heaven or hell out of your life here on earth, not somewhere up in the sky. So that means that we have to make marijuana legal, or at least have the power to tell the world that we use it without being persecuted for it (that would be my idea of heaven on earth). I think we can assume that Christ had the power to turn Judas into dog meat. It was only Christ's obedience to his father that caused him to allow Judas to play the role that he did, to serve as a warning to the rest of us not to play Judas' role. Thanks for letting me know what you've heard about Tom Reilly. It's unreal how many years that man has been out on appeal bail. I always figured that it was a government plot to keep him quiet (looks like it worked). After all, he was the spokesman and he made them very uncomfortable by going on 60 Minutes and giving all those media interviews. Anyway, it just goes to show you that the high will be brought low and the low will be brought high, and everything will even out in the end. I was also interested in hearing about Brother Dogie, although the last time I talked to him (a year or two ago) he said he didn't want to be involved with the property at St. Thomas. This is an unusual turn of events, although I guess I'm not surprised. My reason for not wanting to have any connection to the property in St. Thomas is because I quit selling and smoking ganja. As far as I'm concerned, that property in St. Thomas is just a dead weight. It's the last remnant of a life that I left behind - a life that I've been trying to kill. I have pity for poor Brother Dogie wanting to tie that dead weight around his own neck, but I guess that's just the way it all has to work out. As for Jane, I'm sure she's just as happy as I am that she has nothing to do with it. Thanks for Mike Hatfield's number. I haven't gotten hold of him yet, but I'll keep trying. Keep in touch and let me know what you think about my comments. Sincerely, Carl E.

Box 1280 Beaver, WV 25813 June 22, 1996 Louv Brother Carl, First let me tell you that I did receiveboth of your last packages and I did find the contents veryinteresting, in fact that's just the kind of stuff that I'vewanted (I'm referring to the literature on thebrothers) because every time I try to explain to people how Igrew up it's hard for them to comprehend or relate to the fullpicture of the spirit and mind set of the thing. Of coursethey can all grasp and usually like the concept of smoking ganjain Church but it's hard for them to understand (which was far moreimportant) the powerful spirit of louv and brotherhood that drewthe true brothers together. Even though everyone loved toburn ganja that was not the main essence of the spirit, that justintensified the spirit that was already there. I love toburn herb and I know that you do too (we used to smoke ittogether all the time) but that is not what makes usbrothers. What makes us brothers is that we care about andtry to uplift a fellow brother or sister in whatever little waywe can. Everyone might disagree on certain things but whenyou can come together in unity and put aside your differences or compromiseon them I don't think that there is any greater feeling than thatand I believe that that was the essence of the brothers. That spirit was even why the brothers were so successful in theganja movements, it's just sad that most of them carry badthought against or even hate each other now. Anyway, backto the subject of trying to get people to try to understand thekind of life that I grew up in, that's the reason why one time Ihad asked you to send me some of the old pictures (since I knowthat you were the main picture man) so that I could show them to people,but I remember that you told me that you had left all of your oldpictures out at Jim's farm in Miami. :-( Now second, I want tothank you for the money that you sent me, that was very kind andthoughtful of you, I do appreciate it and I won't ever forgetit. Shit, that's two weeks at the commissary for me. :-) Loyalty and devotion is also something that I learned to valueand respect from both growing up in the Church and, of course,from my father which has always been a very loyal person. Shit, I could have been out of prison a long time ago if I would havewanted to sell out my so-called friends and brothers (I say"so-called" because most of them wouldn't even take thetime to write me a letter now) but growing up the way I didtought and instilled in me to hate "Judas" (informer)which is a principle (even though most of the people that I wasloyal to didn't really appreciate it) that I'm happy I havebecause I know that it's a principle that no amount of money inthe world can buy, either you have it or you don't. Stilleven in the belly of the beast I have to count myblessings. Speaking of bing in the "Belly of thebeast" I don't know if you know it of not but I'm still inthe "Hole" where I've been now for nine months now(since October 24) and they say that I have nine more togo. Yes, they've put me on "Terrorist status" andthey're trying to punish me hard for the riot that happened lastyear. Of course, this is against their own law (in the BOPrule book it says that it's a violation of our human rights tokeep us in segregation for any longer than 180 days) but they'regetting around their own laws by saying that we are a "longterm hold over." As I'm sure you know the law was madeonly for us, they can break them whenever they get ready, it's aprime example of "Just-us." Supposedly we arewaiting on bed space in a penitentiary but the truth is that weare down here being punished over and over again. "This is definitely the bloodclot beast. Now to bring you up to date on a little of the recent gossip onsome of your old brethren. I heard that the government wasrevoking BrotherLouv's (new name "Brother Nate")appeal bond or whatever the fuck he was out of prison on, I hadthought that he was all finished with (especially since he's beenout so long) that bullshit but I guess that there is stillsomething hanging over his head. Anyway I heard that theywant him to go back to prison for a few months and then start onhis five years of parole. If that was his reason for notwanting to talk to any of the old brothers they ended up fuckinghim anyway and now he'll really have a good reason. Another thingI heard is that brother (elderberry) Dogie was suing the brothersfor the farm up in St. Thomas because he says that "He's thelast surviving elderberry so the farm is rightfullyhis." It's really something how some brothers gavetheir life to build the thing and then other ones reaped all therewards. I mean why wasn't sister Jane given a piece of theland after brother Carl died? I don't know but I would saythat the elderberries were some real shit when it came to lookingout for their brothers and sisters. Oh yes, by the way, Italked to Michael Hatfield (the lawyer) the other day and heasked me if you were hooked up to the "Internet computersystem" which at the time I hadn't gotten your package yetso I told him that I didn't know. Needless to say that itwas quite a coincidence when a couple of days after he asked methat I received your package telling me about your Internet work. Anyway he was curious to know what youwere doing lately so if you want to give him a call sometimehere's his phone number 352-669-2131. I would give you acall but I only get one phone call every two weeks so I usually callmy Mother. Can you believe that the Warden here has thesame name as you? Maybe he's some family to you and youcould call him up and tell him to take it easy on me. Well my brother I'm going to end this letter here but let me saythat I think the "Internet" thing is a good idea. Obviouslyit's a good way to spread the word, you've already found a goodbrother (ChristopherHarrison) that's hungry forsome true brothers and some doctrine, it sounds like he alreadyhas the spirit. I'm not much of a letter writer but I'llwrite him a letter as soon as I get caught up. I thank you again for being a good brother to both me and my father. Much louv and respect, your brother always, Brian WT01-B19-163IA087-000631-B004-2http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/COPTIC/LETTERS/harrison.html 206.61.184.43 19970122073551 text/html 3055HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:35:43 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:04:37 GMTContent-length: 2840 Harrison, Christopher - May 24, 1996 May 24, 1996 Dear Brother Olsen, I am writing this letter to you to ask that more informationabout my Father's first Family, The Coptic Church, be sent to me by mailat 600 Lindsay Ave., Sacramento, CA 95838, under the name of ChristopherHarrison. I would also like to thank you for your work, which without I may never have been brought back to knowing my Father. For as long as I can remember, I have been studying the Bible (King James and various translations of it), trying to understand Him. Growing up in the Baptist Church (offspring of the orignial falsity, The Catholic Church), I had been taught, along with the rest of the lost spirits, that my Father is a mystery; and that He always will be a mystery to me. This ignorance has led me to believe in the status quo (evil), leading me into the life- (actually death-) time pursuit of being a lawyer. I had applied to law schools, thinking that, upon acceptance, I would be completed & happy. (This went along with the belief that this was the sky God's will.) It was not until some days ago that I realized that this sky god is actually Satan, trying to lead me astray. It was at this point that I realized the Light, and knew that I could not remain sinless in this world. I knew that Goud was real, and that my spirit needs to return to be among the Brethren, the Coptics. I came to the Truth after months of prayer and sacrifice,leading me to search for your page on the Internet. When I first read it, I was convinced that there was truth in it; but it was not until I continued the search that I was able to confirm that it was all Truth through reading the passages of our forefathers (the Essenes and the Gnostics). It was during this time that I knew it was time for me to return to the ways of my Father. As you may well understand, I am full yet not satisfied, inwant yet I have everything. I write to you because I now know what work my Father has for me: not to study the laws and precepts of those spirits who are bound by Satan, but to study the laws and ways of my ancestors. In this, I may continue towards knowledge and carry on His works. So that I may begin my tutorship as soon as possible, I ask that your Honor would contact me immediately at (510) 631-3267. Giving Honor and Praises to our Most High, the Inner Spirit, our Eternal Source of Life.

The presentation is prepared by Richard Lawrence Miller, a Missouri native whose book Truman: The Rise to Power carefully documented Harry S. Truman's years in state politics. Miller is also a nationally recognized authority on drug control law. Hemp was once an important Missouri textile fiber crop. Economic factors have caused hemp's popularity to rise and decline several times since the early 1800's. The last national production peak was in the 1940's. Demand for natural fibers and for alternative sources of food and wood products may make hemp profitable in Missouri once again. Large crops are profitably grown in France, a country with comparable labor and transportation costs. In order for Missouri farmers to produce commercial hemp, the state government surely needs to establish a registration system similar to the old federal one which assured that commercial production of hemp did not result in diversion of plants for use as marijuana. When that system was in effect, federal authorities in the executive and legislative branches expressed satisfaction with it. French authorities today use a similar system with success. TRADITIONAL MARKETS Fiber. Hemp produces some of the strongest natural fiber for cordage and textiles. Cloth can be rough or fine grade, ranging from canvas to linen. Fabric is "breathable," durable, and absorbs more moisture than cotton. Hemp is commonly blended with cotton to produce garments with best advantages of both fibers. Hemp fiber can be spun in flax mills. Hemp can also be "cottonized," allowing it to be processed in cotton mills, or spinning equipment can be adjusted specifically to accommodate hemp. Today's retail price of hemp/cotton blend clothing is comparable to denim. Hemp fiber is currently a specialty import item; commercial scale domestic production could bring down retail clothing prices. The price factor, combined with growing demand for "natural" clothing, could make production of hemp fiber economically viable for Missouri farmers. Paper. Hemp produces fiber and wood that can be pulped for paper production. The wood (called "hurds") is left over from fiber production; the same crop can yield fiber and wood. For paper purposes, hemp hurd yields are about four times what can be harvested from the same acreage of forest. Hemp crops could thereby reduce global deforestation. As with textiles, paper can be produced in grades ranging from rough to fine. Hemp paper is strong--sheets can be tissue thickness without tearing easily. It also has a low acid content, meaning the sheets won't grow brittle with age and disintegrate as do high acid papers. Strength and low acid content make hemp especially appealing to book and journal publishers. In France hemp paper is widely used for rolling cigarettes. Markets for hemp paper exist today. If forest log prices increase, hemp markets could expand. An editorial in the June 1991 trade journal Pulp and Paper asked governmental authorities to expedite production of hemp paper. Meal. Hemp seed can be processed for food. Traditional markets are birdseed, cattle feed, and huuman food. Hemp has not been widely used as human food in the United States, although specialty items such as granola bars are marketed, and hemp can be processed into breakfast cereal. Hemp is a more common human food in Asia and eastern Europe. Oil. Hemp has as many food applications as any other vegetable oil. POTENTIAL MARKETS Wood. Construction board pressed from hemp hurds is used in France. Such sheeting can be used for walls, floors, roofs. An American market likely exists. Plastics. Assorted plastic products can be produced from hemp, ranging from cellophane to plumbing pipe. Whether such production can be done on a commercial scale, at prices competitive with petroleum plastics, has not been demonstrated. But a potential plastics market exists. Fuel. The same can be said of hemp as a source of motor fuel. It can run diesel engines and can also yield high octane gasoline, but we do not know whether such production can be done commercially at a price competitive with petroleum. We do know that hemp wood and charcoal can be burned in power plant and boiler room applications, and that emissions lack sulfur and acids that pollute the atmosphere. The high yield of hemp wood per acre, compared to fforest wood, may make hemp wood an attractive fuel. Oil. Paint and varnish manufacturers formerly used large quantities of hemp to obtain quick drying oils. Rising petroleum prices could help reestablish this traditional use of hemp. DEMAND FOR HEMP TODAY The last peak of U.S. production was in the 1940's, mainly to substitute for other fiber that could no longer be imported due to hazards of World War II. When those imports became available after the war, American production plummeted. On a world basis, however, hemp production has continued to thrive. Large crops are grown and marketed in Europe. With current interest in natural fiber clothing, hemp's advantages of strength and absorbency suggest it could establish a viable place in American textile markets. Human and animal food uses are another traditional market for exploration. Missouri farmers could gain an early advantage in such markets. CULTIVATION Historical experience and agricultural research show that Missouri's climate and soils are ideal for hemp. It will grow almost anywhere, although fiber crops require different production agriculture techniques than seed crops require. Crops need little attention and are subject to few diseases or pests. LAW In the past fifty years commercial production of hemp in the United States and Europe has been closely monitored by the government agencies because the plant that produces hemp also produces marijuana. Experience demonstrates that commercial scale production of hemp does not add to illicit marijuana supplies. Industrial hemp plants contain such small amounts of the marijuana drug that the fields are left alone by persons who seek marijuana. This was observed in the United States in the 1940's and is observed in France today. After concern about marijuana increased in the 1930's, government agencies in the United States and Europe established a registration system for hemp producers. Basically, a farmer of good character and who has a purchase contract for the crop can register as a commercial hemp producer. Registered persons are left alone by law enforcement authorities. Such a registration system does not legalize marijuana. Indeed, it expedites marijuana prosecutions because authorities never have to deal with a defense that an unregistered hemp crop is intended for legitimate purposes--if purposes are legitimate, the producer is registered. When federal drug laws were rewritten in the 1970's the hemp industry no longer existed in the United States, and the registration system was abandoned by the federal government. This abandonment means that individual states can now choose whether to encourage hemp production, using the old safeguards against marijuana production. If Missouri establishes a registration system, hemp farmers who register in this state will have a monopoly on American hemp production for the time being. Missouri farmers would thereby have the ground floor advantage in exploiting markets. ABOUT THE AUTHOR OF THE REPORT Richard Lawrence Miller graduated from William Jewell College in 1971 (BA history) and was trained as a radio broadcaster at Northwest Missouri State University (BA 1973). The Missouri Broadcasters Association cited his public affairs work as outstanding. In 1975 the Missouri House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring Miller's work in presenting the workings of the legislature to radio listeners. Miller did public affairs broadcasting at Northwest Missouri State, Kirkwood Community College (Cedar Rapids, Iowa) and University of Missouri--Kansas City. He has also worked at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library, preserving and organizing its photograph collection. And Miller supervised the College of Pharmacy library at the University of Iowa. In 1982 he converted his long-standing part-time interest in historical research into full time endeavor. His first history book, published by McGraw-Hill in 1985, was Truman: The Rise to Power. The Washington Post called it "a classic contribution to our understanding of a great man and the lost time that molded him and gave him to the nation." The Post also said, "In lush and loving detail, Miller presents a magisterial study of the texture of local politics in early 20th century mid-America. Miller boasts--it is an unusual and refreshing boast for a political biographer today--that he is 'the son of a county patronage politician,' and that his family's livelihood 'depended on courthouse intrigue and electioneering.' What is often evaded, in the sterile world of the new media politics, as something declasse and vaguely shameful, Miller celebrates; and this background has served his well indeed." Miller's second book, published by Walker and Company in 1988, was Heritage of Fear: Illusion and Reality in the Cold War. Contrary to perceptions promoted by senior federal officials, in this book Miller argued that world communism was weak rather than strong, indeed that the so-called "communist empire" was on the verge of collapse. His thesis met harsh skepticism, but events soon demonstrated the correctness of his analysis. Miller's latest book is published by Praeger, one of the nation's most distinguished publishers of scholarly research. In The Case for Legalizing Drugs Miller argues that most problems associated with illicit drugs are caused by their illegality, not their chemistry, and that reforming such laws would not be a surrender to drugs, but a liberation from them. Federal judge Robert W. Sweet said, "This volume abounds in facts relating to drug use. Didactic and jarring in certain of its theses, but a necessary study for those concerned about drug use in America." Miller's work is cited as authoritative by other scholars such as William E. Pemberton (Harry S Truman: Fair Dealer and Cold Warrior), Richard Rhodes (The Making of the Atomic Bomb), Hugh Thomas (Armed Truce: The Beginnings of the Cold War 1945-1946), Stephan Fox (Blood and Power: Organized Crime in Twentieth-Century America), and William Wilbanks (The Myth of a Racist Criminal Justice System). In addition to scholarly books, Miller's writings have appeared in publications such as Army, a professional military journal published by the Association of the U.S. Army. He has presented results of his research to professional meetings hosted by history departments at Northeast Missouri State University and University of Missouri--Kansas City, and at law conferences held at the University of Missouri law schools at Columbia and Kansas City. He is scheduled as a featured-speaker at an upcoming meeting of the Missouri Association of Drug and Alcohol Counselors, and is tentatively scheduled to appear with Nobel laureate Milton Friedman and other drug policy experts at the International Conference on Drug Policy Reform to be held in Washington, DC, in November 1991. The Drug Policy Foundation of Washington, DC, plans to publish Miller's analysis of ethics in medical research involving adolescent marijuana smokers. His analysis of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration laboratory system, an examination commissioned by FDA scientists, helped convince Senator Robert Dole to abandon his support for consolidating FDA laboratories around the country, and instead Senator Dole successfully worked to retain the current system. While studying drug control law, Miller noticed that Cannabis sativa L., the plant that yields marijuana, seemed unique among drug producing plants because it had many non-drug commercial uses. Those non-drug uses have long been protected by law; in the 1940's U.S. farmers raised many thousands of acres of cannabis while strict anti-marijuana laws remained in effect. Miller concluded that the hemp growing system used throughout the country in the 1940s could be reinstated in Missouri without boosting illicit marijuana supplies, providing Missouri farmers with an alternative crop and a virtual market monopoly on U.S. hemp production. The following report explains how Miller reached this conclusion. TRADITIONAL MARKETS In 1944 USDA agronomist B.B. Robinson noted that "hemp yields on an average twice as much textile fiber per acre as fiber flax and three times as much fiber per acre as cotton. It is one of the heaviest fiber--yielding crops adapted to production in the United States."(1) Fred Brenckman, Washington DC representative of the National Grange declared that hemp had proven its place as an agricultural crop: "We believe that the time is opportune for agriculture and the spinning industry to combine their knowledge and experience in establishing a hemp industry in the United States."(2) A member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, Guy M. Gillette of Iowa, concurred: "There are interests that do not want their markets usurped by the type of [hemp] industry that we have been trying to develop here, and this committee has already given consideration to the presentation of legislation looking to the preservation and continuance of these industries that give promise to furnish an outlet for our surplus farm acreage and employment to our people in the post-war period."(3) The National Farmers Union declared that farmers wanted "to determine the type of cooperative effort that could be organized to keep these mills in production and provide an outlet for a very satisfactory crop." The Union called for "the widest use of hemp within the American market."(4) Clearly, at one time mainstream leaders in agriculture and government viewed hemp as a legitimate crop. They were well aware of markets that demanded hemp. FIBER Baggage lining.(5) Canvas.(6) Carpet. Fiber is used for rug warp, yarn, and thread.(7) Clothing. Hemp is made into work clothesth can produce low grade clothing, or linen quality textiles can produce fine clothing. Hemp can be processed by flax spinning mills, (10) and it can be "cottonized" so cotton spinners can process the fiber without special adjustment for hemp. (11) In the 1920's the cottonizing process produced hemp fiber ready for spinning at half the price of preparing lower grade cotton itself for spinning. (12) "Hackling" allows hemp fiber to be spun on flax spinners. (13) In the 1940's, however, using cotton equipment for hemp had a commercial advantage over flax equipment because cotton equipment had a higher output. (14) In the 1940's research was proposed for further adaptions of hemp fibers to cotton spinners. (15). Thus additional capabilities may exist today. Blending hemp with other fibers, such as cotton or wool, expands the possibilities. Imported hemp/cotton blend shirts are currently price competitive with denim shirts. Domestic fiber might make hemp clothing more price-attractive yet. Around 1960 hemp clothing was common in South Korea, worn by about one-third of the population (16) (a market that surely could not afford high clothing prices).Construction materials. Fiber can made into home insulation. (17)Cordage. Fiber has long been us, leisure clothes, sport shirts, summer and tropical clothing, stiffening for collars, hat braid. (8) Durability, moisture absorbency, and "breathability" give hemp cloth advantages over some competing fibers. A U.S. Department of Agriculture specia Fiber is still effective for maintenance of insulators. (21)Fire hose. (22)Fuel. Waste fiber can be burned to power rope and twine factories with high efficiency. (23)Interior decorating fabric. (24)Linen. Products include tablecloths and bed sheets. (25)Linoleum. Fiber was once used for linoleum backing (26) but linoleum itself is becoming obsolete, replaced by vinyl flooring. Napery. Fiber can be made into napkins and doilies. (27)Netting. Fiber can be used for fishnets and other nets and webbing (as in parachutes). (28)Oakum. Oakum is made from "tow," short lengths of fiber. It was once used for caulking ships and for packing in assorted machinery, but is probably superseded by other materials today.Paper. The bulk of French fiber is used for paper rather than cloth. (29) Kimberly--Clark (the Kleenex company) currently uses French hemp to make paper for cigarettes and Bibles. (30) In 1976--95% of the French crop was used for cigarette paper, the remainder for Bibles,list states, "Hemp fiber is superior in that it absorbs about 250 percent of the power of absorption of cotton. In other words, a pound of hemp will absorb about 2 1/2 pounds of water, where a pound of cotton will absorb only 1." (9) "Homespun" rough clo domestic wood pulp, (33) the U.S. paper and publishing industries have been reluctant to use hemp on a large scale. Years ago a hemp industry spokesman described hemp imports as "just a ridiculous situation, because it [paper] can be made out of our local products in this country." (34) A domestic hemp supply could be far more competitive than imports are, particularly if federal forestry policies increase the price of logging in national forests. In the early 1980's Canadian Hemp Industries Corporation planned to devote at least 1,000 acres to fiber production for cigarette paper and fine grade paper. (35) At that time Canadian cigarette manufacturers depended on European sources for paper. When hemp fiber is grown for paper the quality can be ed for small lines and wrapping cords. It was once used for fishline (18) but is probably obsolete in that application.Drapery. 9)Electrical. Fiber was once used to insulate electrical wires, (20) but is probably superseded by other materials todadifficulty 25,000 or 30,000 or 40,000 acres of hemp...being used in the paper industry and in the plastic industry." (36) (For plastics, see below in "Fiber By-Products" section.) Book and journal publishing industries face a growing demand for low acid paper, and hemp combines low acid with good tensile strength. In the 1980's work was underway to incorporate hemp into lower grade papers as well. Hemp was once used for newspapers. (37) The paper industry should be an important market. (As noted in the "By-Products" section immediately below, in addition to hemp fiber, hemp hurds are another source of paper.)Plumbing. Fiber was once used to caulk water mains, spigots, soil pipes, sewer pipes, gas pipes. (38) It is probably superseeeeeeded by other materials today.Rope. Hemp is used for assorted all-fiber ropes, both as pure hemp and blended with other fibers. Hemp is also used as core for metal rope. (39) In wet environments hemp rope is superior to many other kinds, in strength and durability.Sacking. Products include burlap, sugar sacks, reinforced paper. (40)Tarpaulins. (41)Thread. Chief use for higher grades of U. S. crop in World War I was thread for shoes and harnesses, (42) and those applications continued afterwards. (43) Hemp thread is used in leather goods (44) and wherever heavy duty thread is required. In 1945 a specialist from the U.S. Department of Agriculture stated that hemp fiber "can be spun into thread of approximately 30 lay, and it can be done economically, and it will serve every purpose that linen serves." (45)Toweling. High moisture absorbency makes hemp ideal for towels. (46)Twine. Hemp binder twine is used in harvesting grain. (47) Household twine is another product. Hemp is also used with wallpaper, mattresses, upholstery, sacking, brooms, shipping tags, ham strings, bell cord, gas meter cord, hat blocking cord. (48) Hemp's strength allows twine to be of lighter weight than when made from competing fibers. (49)Upholstery. (50) (19)Electrical. Fiber was once used to insulate electrical wires, (20) but is probably superseded by other materials today. electric condensers, and apparently tea bags. (31) American hemp has been used for those first three purposes, plus carbon paper and (according to one authority) U.S. paper currency. (32) Because hemp fiber imports are three times more expensive thans produce stalks having the diameter of a pencil, 2-inch diameter stalks are possible if a farmer wants to sacrifice fiber in order to get a maximum amount of hurds. (53) They have assorted uses. Construction materials. Hurds can be transformed into wood sheeting resembling Masonite. Hurd sheeting has good insulating properties, can be light as cork or denser than teak. It is suitable for interior or exterior applications, can be made rot resistant so painting is unnecessary. In the 1940's cost was competitive with other materials used for same purposes. (54) In the 1980's a hemp hurd building board product with "good sound-proofing properties" was available in Europe. (55) In 1944 Dr. O.E. Sweeney, head of the department of chemical engineering at Iowa State College said hurds could be made into I beams "two and half times as great as steel" in tensile strength, (56) Explosives. Hurds can be processed to make explosives such as dynamite or TNT. (57) Illinois fireworks regulations explicitly mention hemp products. (58) Farm operations. Hurds "make excellent bedding for livestock," (59) also litter for poultry. (60) Straw can serve as cattle feed. (61) While not a by-product per se, an additional use in France has been to plant hemp as windbreaks and as pollinization screens. (62) Hemp can exceed 15 feet in height. Fuel. Hemp hurds can be burned to power dryers in hemp breaking mills, and to power other needs at the mill with high efficiency. (63) "Breaking" is the first step of processing stalks into fiber. Breaking mills typically do "scutching" also, separating fiber from the stalk. Furfural. In the 1940's researchers estimated that technology of that era allowed about 45% of pentosan carbohydrates in hurd pulp to be extracted as furfural, (64) an oil that can be used to make dyes, lacquers, and resins. (About 25% of hurds is comprised of pentosans. 65). In 1944 Dr. O. E. Sweeney, head of the department of chemical engineering at Iowa State College, said that hemp furfural could produce a good motor fuel for automobiles, with proper engine adjustments, but the fuel would cost four times what gasoline then cost. (66) Subsequent technological developments suggest that methanol from hemp can be converted into high octane gasoline. Whether such production could be done on a commercial scale, and what the price comparison would be to gasoline in the 1990's are open questions. Glass. Hurds can be processed into glass. (67) Paper. Ohio hemp man R. S. Webb raised 600 acres in 1915, "probably the largest single crop in the United States" and sold hurds to paper mills, which produced " a very good grade" of paper from them. (68) The next year the U. S. Department of Agriculture reported lower than when fiber is grown for textiles; thus the paper market could be open to Missouri farmers as they learn skills needed to produce superior textile fiber. In 1937 a hemp industry representative told Congress, "I can readily visualize without muchth tree wood, but questioned whether producing hemp hurd crops would be cheaper than logging in 1916. (69) In 1944 a Canadian hemp man contended the ratio for paper manufacturing was 1 acre of hemp to 5 acres of spruce. (70) Studies around 1920 found hemp wood to have similar characteristics to tree wood for paper making. (71) Researcher in the 1940's found hemp hurds to be good raw material for heavy wrapping paper, cardboard, boxboard, drawing paper, stationery, and bond paper. (72) Conc Wrapping. Hemp cloth was once used to wrap cotton bales, still useful in gunny sack applications.Yarn. Hemp yarn has naval and carpet uses, also belts and webbing. (51) In 1945 a spinning mill spokesperson declared, "We use no fiber for our fine yads (as opposed to the entire plant) measure at 39% alpha-cellulose. (77) A 1957 report from McGill University and the Pulp and Paper Research Institute of Canada says that nearly 80% of hemp fiber is alpha-cellulose, a range accepted by a standard chemicrns at the present time except American hemp.....It is an excellent fiber." (52)FIBER BY-PRODUCTS Hurds are a wood by-product of fiber production; a fiber crop will produce hurds in addition to fiber. Although standard fiber cultivation technique USDA scientists in the 1950's, hemp's rating was exceeded by only 2 species and equaled by only 6. The federal scientists concluded that hemp "shows considerable promise as a source of pulp. However, production of hemp in the United States is rigidly controlled." (79) A 1977 Italian study judged hemp hurds to be commercially practicable for the paper industry. (80) The prolific nature of hemp as a paper source, with an acre of hemp producing about four times as much pulp as an acre of forest, would help conserve forests. In addition, paper production from hemp should produce less water pollution than production from wood pulp because factories need lower amounts of chemicals to liberate lignin from hemp hurds. (81) In June 1991 an editorial entitled "It's Time to Reconsider Hemp" appeared in the trade journal Pulp and Paper. Technical editor Jim Young said the industry should make much broader use of hemp. He concluded, "U.S. hemp growing restrictions were set aside to meet material shortages during World War II. They should now at least be modified to meet pending shortages of fiber, energy, and environmental quality." (82) Plastics. The cellulose content of fiber and hurds make them raw materials for plastics. (83) In the 1930's one authority said the plastics market for hurds would cover production costs of a fiber crop, making fiber income pure profit. (84) (The bushiness of seed hemp makes its stems less suitable for cellulose applications. 85). In the 1930's Amhempco Corporation of Danville, Illinois, was established (in part) to use hurds for plastic. (86) Plastics manufacturers were buying hurds as raw material in the 1940's. (87) Hurds can be made into cellophane, photographic film base, and general plastics. (88) In 1944 Dr. O. E. Sweeney, head of the department of chemical engineering at Iowa State College, described hemp hurd plastic as "probably the cheapest plastic that has yet been worked out." (89) Textiles. By the 1940's "artificial silk" (rayon) was made from hurds in Italy. (90)SEED Animal feed. Seed is used for caged small animals such as rodents. (91) Bird feed. A long-standing market serves food needs of pigeons (squab) and house pets. (92) Farm operations. Seedcathat hurds produced good paper. Especially important today is the USDA finding that one acre of hemp can produce the same amount of paper as four acres of forest. The USDA reported that the hemp paper manufacturing process was economically competitive wi. (94) Seed is more commonly used for human food in Asia and eastern Europe than in the West. (95) Oil, which has sweet taste, also used for food in Asia. (96) Under President Ronald Reagan federal law defined hemp as a food resource vital to national defense. (97) Fuel. Hemp oil is a traditional lamp fuel in rural Russia. (96) Oil. Oil content of seed can be 30%, perhaps even 40%. (99) Hemp was once used in soaps. (100) Hemp has produced fast drying oil for paints, varnishes, and erned about rates of cutting in forests, in the 1950's the U. S. Department of Agriculture made an extensive survey of non-tree sources for paper. (73) Described as "the most complete attempt to compare thoroughly a large number and diversity of plant maof hemp oil in the 1980's in paint, varnish, and soap manufacturing. (103) Hemp oil can also be used for cattle feed. (104) In the 1930's hemp seed was crushed for oil by Durkee, Eldorado Western Vegetable Oil, Berkeley Oil and Meal Producers, Cottonoil, Pacific Nutoil Vegetable Oil Products, California Flaxseed Products, Archer Daniels. (105) The market was substantial enough to require railroad tank car shipments. (106) Sport Fishing. Anglers use hemp seed products for bait, (107)SEED BY-PRODUCTS Biomass. As an experiment on January 4, 1978 the Eugene, Oregon, Water & Electric Board burned six tons of cannabis biomass, such as would result from bushy plants cultivated for hemp seed. The fuel served downtown steam custometerials in the same laboratory applying uniform procedures and analyses," (74) the scientists examined 200 species. Sample papers were made and subjected to standard industry tests. The scientists concluded that "alpha-cellulose content of a raw materi burned as fuel closer to points of its production.OTHER Beverage alcohol. Green stems and leaves produce Jamaican white rum. (109) ECONOMICS OF HEMPFIBER The most recent peak for hp production in the United States was during World War II. The war's end saw a return of competing foreign fiber imports (abaca, sisal, jute) and reduced application of federal hemp price guarantees--such subsidies were limited to mills already in business. New companies had to operate at world market prices without federal support. The challenge was from inherently cheaper competing fibers, not from imports per se; protective tariffs would likely have made no difference. (110) Hemp farming declined dramatically, although a half dozen private hemp companies were active in the late 1940's, and several hundred producers were still registered in the 1950's.

(113) As the 1930's began, breaking mills sold hemp fiber to spinning mills at a lower price than cotton fiber, but spinning costs made hemp yarn more expensive than cotton yarn. (114) In years just before World War II, industry-wide proceeds were $ 0.18 a pound for "line" fiber (a superior grade), (115) or $ 0.09 to the farmer. For crops of 1941-1943 growers served by Atlas Hemp Mills, Juneau, Wisconsin received an average gross of $ 120 an acre in those three years for all hemp fiber, including line and the inferior "tow" grade. (116) Matt Rens Hemp Co. growers netted on average $ 110 an acre in 1942. (117) After deductions for seed and rental of harvest equipment, at the J. LeRoy Farmer Hemp Mill in those years farmers producing an "average" crop netted $ 80 to $ 100 an acre. (118) Average national prices for other 1941-43 crops, per acre harvested (computed by comparing prices per pound or bushel to yield of pounds or bushels per acre): corn $ 30 per acre, wheat $ 20, oats $ 17, soybeans $31, Irish potatoes $ 147, tobacco $ 341. (119) (Those prices are gross income, not net profit.) The government mill price of line fiber during the war was $ 0.30. (120) The method of farmer compensation based on fiber price, however, was not used by the government during the war. As noted in the next paragraph the government paid by tonnage of stalk regardless of how much fiber the stalk yielded. Farmers preferred this method, and private mills had difficulty getting crops. (121) The effect was to make the hemp industry a virtual federal government monopoly. During World War II, in addition to six private breaking mills already in existence, the federal government absorbed the cost of erecting 42 more. The government guaranteed prices for stalks sold to mills, $ 30 to $ 50 a ton according to grade. Average price to all farmers through mid-1944 was $ 43 a ton. (122) In Illinois the average cost of stalk production in 1943 was $ 21 a ton. (123) During World War II, with stalk yields of up to 4 tons per acre hemp was more lucrative than corn for some farmers. One Iowan netted a profit (after deducting production costs) of $ 154 an acre in 1943. (124) In 1945 a private Wisconsin mill operator said his growers were netting $ 90 to $ 100 an acre. (125) In 1944 one Iowa hemp farmer declared that growers were learning the crop and improving their efficiency so much that they could get lower prices per ton and still realize increased profits. (126) A 30-year veteran of the hemp mill industry said in 1945, "All our farmers are realizing a good return from this crop, and they are anxious to grow it. We have to turn them down every year because we cannot handle all the acreage the farmers wish to produce." (127) Also in 1945, a U. S. Department of Agriculture specialist declared, "Normally the hemp income is a little bit more than corn. If the income from corn is $ 65 an acre the farmal would serve as the best single criterion for predicting both pulp yield and pulp quality of a given species." (75) Analysis found that 37.6% of hemp was comprised of alpha-cellulose, (76) one of the highest amounts found in any dicotyledon plant. HuIn 1943 they produced 370,000 tons of stalk. Fiber comes from the thin outer layer of stalk and in the 1940's comprised 20% or less of stalk weight, so tonnage of fiber would be less; 4,000 to 8,000 pounds of stalk might yield 600 to 1,000 pounds of fiber. (129) In 1944 a private Wisconsin mill characterized 1,000 pounds of fiber per acre as "an average good crop." (130) By the mid-1970's average fiber yies of West European growers surpassed the average 1940's American yield of 890 pounds per acre. Italian fields produced 1,100 pounds of fiber per acre, France 1,600, West Germany 1,700. (131) Missouri hemp farms today might be far more productive than data from the 1940's indicates. In the late 1940's a USDA authority declared that hemp had higher fiber yields per acre than cotton, allowing hemp to be grown more cheaply than cotton. For the farmer, however, retting and milling expenses offset hemp's initial price advantage over cotton. ("Retting" prepares stalks for the breaking mill, and in traditional U. S. agricultural practice retting is done on the farm.) The USDA authority felt that if retting and milling technology saw improvement, hemp fiber production could become more profitable than cotton for American farmers. (132) Such technological advances have occurred in foreign countries. Another important advance is the breeding of varieties of hemp with higher fiber content. In 1975 varieties were known with fiber content in stalks surpassing 25%; one European variety was reported to have 31%. (133) Compared to the 1940's when fiber yields were 20% of stalks, modern varieties could reduce farmers' costs per pound by 25% to 50%. Greater productivity could make crops more profitable than in the 1940's when they enjoyed federal price supports. Assorted stalk breaking and scutching techniques can further increase profitability by increasing the ratio of "line" fiber (longer, more desirable strands) over "tow" fiber (shorter strands). In the 1940's government breaking mills produced 50% line to 50% tow. (134) At the same time the private Atlas Hemp Mills of Juneau, Wisconsin, produced 67% line to 33% tow, attributed to "better lands, more pains in handling, and improved processing machinery." (135) An establishedroth valued at $ 61.7 million. (137) The 1958 Korean fiber price computes to $ 0.33 a pound, tobacco $ 0.60, sugarbeets $ 0.006, peanuts $ 0.11, Irish potatoes $ 0.01.

(109) ECONOMICS OF HEMPFIBER The most recent peak for hemS OF HEMPFIBER The most recent peak for hemer ton of stalks. A breaking mill that prepared fiber for paper production sold the fiber for $ 590 to $ 1,540 per ton, depending on type. (142) As can be seen below, recent annual world harvests have totaled 244,000 tons from 1,000,000 acres withe Pro Folder:V$HQ 0?T$HA*w^ AE ?T$H for fiber hemp to raise about 20,000 acres in 1980. (139) One French cooperative sold 20% of its hemp to England. (140) In 1976 French farmers producing fiber for paper got about $ 78 per ton of stalks. (141) Around 1980 French farmers got $ 103 p a yield of 486 pounds of line and tow fiber per acre. Annual World Hemp Fiber Production 1979-86 (143) [insert chart here] SEED Around 1913 dealers paid Kentucky farmers $ 2.50 to $ 5.00 bushel, with yields ranginrices paid to seed growers in the 1940's are elusive, but in World War II the federal government sold seed to fiber farmers for $ 11.00 a bushel. (149) In 1976 farmers in France got about $ 11.00 per bushel, with typical yields of 2.4 to 3.2 bushels per acre. (150) The difference between American and French yields seems inexplicable at first. A possible explanation may be the French practice of harvesting seed from fiber crops ("lint seed") rather than from specially planted seed crops (although seed harvested for sowing comes from plants cultivated for that purpose). Quite possibly seeds form only at the top of a spindly French fiber stalk, rather than throughout the many stems and branches of bushy American hemp specially cultivated for seed.

If the fiber sales were no longer needed to pay for production, hemp fiber prices could drop low enough--at no cost to farmers-- to compete with other fibers. (153) CULTIVATIONFIBER PRODUCTION Fiber hemp grows best in well drained soil that doesn't crust and that holds moisture within two or three inches of the surface. (154) Illinois experts recommend silt loams and clay loams. (155) Iowa experts emphasize good drainage, (156) noting that soggy soil produces weak fiber. (157) A USDA agronomist declared Missouri's soil and climate "favorable" for commercial hemp. (158) In the 1940's , northwest and southeast Missouri were considered the best areas in the state for commercial hemp production. (159) An acre that produces 75-80 bushels of corn can proal technology reference book in 1980. (78) Such findings are important because paper pulp might not be made from the entire plant but instead just from parts high in cellulose. Of the 126 dicotyledons given an overall rating for paper making by theke is made from "residue of the seed after the oil has been extracted." It can be used for cattle feed and fertilizer. (93) Food. Seed can be made into granola bars and breakfast cereal. Seed contains plentiful amounts of fat, sugar, and albuminnough hemp crops remove quite a bit of nutrient, (167) hemp sheds leaves that return nutrients to the field, and upper leaves remaining on stalks drop to the ground as part of the field "retting" process described below. (168) In field retting the soil also recovers about 20% (by weight) of organic material from stalks, and farmers can plow stubble under. (169) Hemp's net extraction from soil fertility is thereby less than many other crops (170) and is considered comparable to corn. (171) Corn, incidentally, does well when planted after hemp. (172) During the 1970's in France winter wheat commonly followed hemp. (173) French growers find that hemp clears weeds and cereal parasites from wheat fields, and the deep hemp roots help with tilling. (174) Hemp crops are noted for improving physical condition of soil. (175) Indeed, hemp has been recommended as a crop for soil building purposes. (176) U. S. hemp production fell after World War II because planted acreage fell, not because soil fertility declined. (177) Fields can be plowed in fall or spring, though some authorities recommend fall. Hemp thrives in the type of seedbed prepared for alfalfa. (178) Seed can be broadcast or planted by seed drill no deeper than one inch; drilling improves yield. (179) Seed is about the size of wheat, 44 pounds to the bushel, and 33-55 pounds per acre are recommended for fiber crops. (180) Higher seeding rates don't increase the yield of stalks per acre, but can increase yield of fiber from stalks. (181) Experiments suggest that treatment with seed disinfectants have small or zero effect on yield. (182) In the Midwest the best time to plant hemp is after oats and before corn. (183) The first week of May may be ideal around Ames, Iowa. (184) Growing season is 120 days. Hemp grows quickly and reaches heights of 5 to 15 feet; for fiber production, height of 6 to 8 feet and stalk thickness of 0.25 inch is ideal. (185) Fiber hemp is planted in thick stands (20 or more plants per square foot) that smother weeds. Few diseases or pests trouble crops. Once seedlings appear, farmers rarely must do anything until harvest. Hard rain is unlikely to lodge hemp, but strong hail can damage crops (by destroying leaves and thereby harming plant growth). (186) Fiber hemp needs ample moisture, and drought harms crops; a climate with at least 30 inches of annual rainfall is recommended. (187) In the 1920's authorities reported irrigation to be feasible. (188) Traditionally in the Unitelacquers; in the United States the Armstrong Cork Products Company and Sherwin Williams company once used large quantities. (101) The Archer Daniels Company declared hemp oil to be superior to linseed oil. (102) A Canadian industry journal reports use ram was $ 4 to $ 7 per harvested acre, deducted from crop payment by the mill rather than paid up-front by the farmer. (190) Private mills had similar arrangements with their growers. (191) Harvest starts in late August and continues through September. American authorities recommend harvesting while pollen sheds and before seeds form. (192) Before 1967 French growers harvested after seed matured, but French practice now follows the American one. (193) If harvested stalks are stacked and stored in dry conditions they will keep for years. They do not have to be processed right away. (194) Normally, harvested fiber stalks must be "retted." In retting, stalks are commonly left on the ground for weeks or months so weather may start to decompose them, making it easier for breaking and scutching mills to remove fiber from stalks. Field retting is sometimes called dew retting. Heavy dew, "reasonably high" humidity , and intermittent rain are important for field retting. (195) Stalks can also be retted underwater in ponds or tanks. This method produces better fiber than field retting, but in the 1940's American technology did not make water retting economical in comparison with field retting. (196) Research at Iowa State College established that controlled water retting could be accomplished in 36 hours. (197) The head of the federal hemp program declared in 1944, "If a program of controlled retting can be developed, I am very confident that there is no limit as to the tonnage that can be grown successfully and profitably in this country." (198) One account from the 1970's noted a Swedish water retting operation with capacity for 150 tons of stalk at any given time, producing 33 tons of fiber per day. (199) Some work has been done in processing unretted hemp. (200) Retting is universally considered the hardest part of hemp farming, because shrewd judgment is needed to determine when the crop is properly retted. Fiber yields from improperly retted crops are inferior. In the 1980's Canadian Hemp Industries Corporation demonstrated a decorticator that stripped fiber from stalks upon harvest in the field without retting. (201) Such technology eliminates the riskiest part of raising hemp fiber crops, making them more economically viable than they were in the 1940's. After stalks are field retted, they are bound and shocked. These steps typically occur at the peak of soybean and corn silo filling, and require more labor than corn harvesting, but 1940's farm operations handled the labor demand. (202) Until around World War I hemp farming was labor intensive, but mechanical harvesters and mill machinery dramatically reduced labor requirements. In the 1920's mechanized Wisconsin hemp farmers were able to compete with cheap foreign labor. (203) In 1943 a typical Illinois hemp farm required 19.4 man hours per acre for the season. (204) Farmers send bales of retted stalks to breaking mills. As a general rule, the higher the yield of stalks per acre, the higher the quality of fiber from that yield. (205)SEED PRODUCTION Although Missouri had large hemp fiber crops in the 1800's, the last remnants of the state's hemp production in the 1940's supplied seed for fiber growers. (206) Climate and soil types recommended for fiber production are essentially the same for seed production, although ample soil calcium is emphasized for seed. (207) Seed hemp is commonly planted in hills 4 or 5 feet apart, thinned to 3-5 young plants. (208) Plants become bushy. With American varieties growing season for seed is at least 180 days. (209) Traditional harvest method is to cut the plants by hand 8-24 inches above the ground, and shock small bundles of them. After drying (a process taking a few days to 3 weeks) each shock is put on a tarpaulin and seeds are manually beaten off with sticks. "While this seems a rather crude way of collecting the seed, it is doubtless the most economical and practical method that may be devised. The seed falls so readily from the dry hemp stalks that it would be impossible to move them without a very great loss. Furthermore, it would be very difficult to handle plants 10 to 14 feet high, with rigid branches 3 to 6 feet in length, so as to feed them to any kind of thrashing machine." (210) Seed for new crops is sent to a cleaning mill. Seed for oil is shipped to a crusher. Although traditional U. S. cultivation practice requires farmers to choose between fiber or seed production, foreign seed growers have harvested seed stalks for low grade fiber. (211) Before the mid-1960's such practice was also traditional among fiber growers in France, where fiber is used for paper rather than textiles, and can therefore be of lower quality. Seed harvested this way is used for animal feed and for planting new crops. (212) American experience indicates that such seed is poor for new crops, however.

After 80 years of drug prohibition, and more than 24 years since President Nixon declared a War on Drugs, it is clear that the best way for the nation to address drug use and abuse has not yet been identified. The abuse of illegal drugs, and the resultant crime, police corruption, growth of gangs and drug cartels, and costs of enforcement point out the need to find a better way. The Drug Policy Forum of Iowa is part of the national discussion on this crucial issue. The Drug Policy Forum of Iowa is open to everyone, regardless of their current views on drug policy. Our common goal is a desire to openly investigate the options. We support a federal blue-ribbon commission to study the drug problem, review the work of previous commissions, and report its findings to the American people. Through private dialogue and public debate, we hope to focus attention on drug policy and facilitate the building of a new consensus. As one step in this process, we are asking candidates for state and federal office to complete the enclosed survey. We understand that multiple-choice answers may not reflect everyone's views, so please feel free to write your own response to any question. The purposes of this survey are to ascertain the range of views on drug policy, and to build a network of people who are interested in participating in further discussion of this issue.

November 26, 1996 U.S. Senate To Hold Hearing RegardingMedical Marijuana Initiatives November 26, 1996, Washington, D.C.: The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on Monday,December 2, regarding the potential impact of and federalresponse to voter-approved drug reform initiatives in Californiaand Arizona that endorse the use of marijuana as amedicine. The committee, headed by vocal medical marijuanaopponents Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Joe Biden (D-Del.), hasentitled the hearing: "A Prescription for Addiction? The Arizona and California Medical Drug UseInitiatives." Biden and others previously voiced their disapprovalover the notion of medical marijuana at a September 4 hearingregarding adolescent drug use. Among those who have reportedly been invited to attend thehearing are Drug Czar Barry Mccaffrey, California AttorneyGeneral Dan Lungren, Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, Drug EnforcementAdministrator Thomas Constantine, and Maricopa County ProsecutorRick Romley, all ardent opponents of the initiatives. Reportedly, neither McCaffrey nor Lungren is likely to appearbecause of scheduling conflicts. It is expected that aphysician opposed to medical marijuana will be brought in totestify as well. In defense of the initiatives, NORML is currently workingwith Senate Judiciary Committee member Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)to try to get Harvard Medical Professor, Dr. Lester Grinspoon,scheduled to testify at the hearing. Grinspoon is a memberof NORML's Board of Directors and has authored numerousbooks and articles in scientific journals regarding marijuana's therapeuticvalue. At this time, the committee has yet to make a finaldecision. Since the initiatives' passage, proponents have speculated as towhether the federal government will target physicians andpatients who comply with the new state laws. So far, nospecific recommendations have come from the Office of NationalDrug Control Policy (ONDCP). Both McCaffrey and the DrugEnforcement Administration have issued statements affirming thatfederal law prohibiting cultivation and possession of marijuanaremain in full force despite the states' actions. The California initiative says that, "Patients or definedcaregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medicaltreatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from the general provisionsof law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation ofmarijuana." It further provides that, "Physiciansshall not be punished or denied any right or privilege forrecommending marijuana to a patient for medicalpurposes." The Act does not supersede statelegislation prohibiting persons from possessing or cultivatingmarijuana for non-medical purposes. California votersapproved the measure by a vote of 56 to 44 percent. Proposition 200 in Arizona, known as the "DrugMedicalization, Prevention and Control Act," is broader thanCalifornia's measure and would essentially "medicalize"Arizona's drug policy. The Act calls for mandatory, courtsupervised treatment and probation as an alternative toincarceration for non-violent drug users and provides expandeddrug treatmrnent programs. It also permits doctors toprescribe controlled drugs such as marijuana to patientssuffering from serious illnesses such as glaucoma, multiplesclerosis, cancer, and AIDS. Arizonans voted in favor ofthe initiative by a vote of 65 to 35 percent. "The voters of California and Arizona have given a mandateto Washington to address the issue of access to medicalmarijuana," said NORML Deputy Director Allen St.Pierre. "Unfortunately, by limiting the invitees tomainly law enforcement personnel, it appears that this hearingwill be far from balanced. Hopefully, subsequent hearingswill feature broader points of view and will allow both doctorsand patients to testify."

November 21, 1996 Office Of National Drug Control PolicyRestates Opposition To Medical Marijuana Initiatives November 15, 1996, Washington, D.C.: Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey re-emphasized the administration'sopposition to voter-approved drug reform initiatives inCalifornia and Arizona that endorse the use of marijuana as amedicine. The announcement came following several closed-doormeetings with law enforcement and state officials. "There could not be a worse message to young people than theprovisions of these referenda," stated McCaffrey in aNovember 15 press release. "Just when the nation istrying its hardest to educate teenagers not to use psychoactivedrugs, now they are being told that 'marijuana [is] medicine.' The conflicting message is extremely harmful." The California initiative says that, "Patients or definedcaregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medicaltreatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from the general provisionsof law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation ofmarijuana." It further provides that, "Physiciansshall not be punished or denied any right or privilege forrecommending marijuana to a patient for medicalpurposes."

It also permits doctors toprescribe controlled drugs such as marijuana to patientssuffering from serious illnesses such as glaucoma, multiplesclerosis, cancer, and AIDS; however, this aspect of the measureis in direct conflict with federal law. Arizonans voted infavor of the initiative by a vote of 65 to 35. "By our judgment, increased drug abuse in every categorywill be the inevitable result of the referenda," saidMcCaffrey. In the weeks following the initiatives passage, proponents havespeculated as to whether the federal government will targetphysicians and patients complying with the new state laws. On this matter, McCaffrey stated that federal law remains in"full force" despite the states' actions and that theJustice Department "will take action" when the evidencemerits. "It is unfortunate that General McCaffrey chose only to meetwith those who oppose the notion of marijuana as medicine whenmeeting to strategize the federal response to the passage of the Californiaand Arizona initiatives," said NORML Deputy DirectorAllen St. Pierre, who noted that at least two physicians wholearned of the meetings were barred from attending. "These initiatives address health issues; to exclude inputfrom physicians who are explicitly and specifically mentioned isunacceptable."

(Meanwhile) Drug Czar's Office Refuses NORMLMeeting November 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.: The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has denied NORML'srequest for a meeting with Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey. NORMLhad offered to meet with McCaffrey following comments made by theGeneral on National Public Radio that he "welcomed" NORML'sinvolvement in the national debate over drug policy. According to a letter signed by Janet Crist, Chief of Staff,"The Director feels strongly that, in light of NORML'svigorous support for pro-marijuana ballot initiatives inCalifornia and Arizona along with its longstanding advocacy forthe legalization of marijuana, the meeting you proposed wouldserve no useful purpose." She added that, "Your organization's agenda to legalize theuse of ... marijuana ... is unsupportable (sic) on health,safety, as well as humanitarian grounds." "It's a shame that the Drug Czar was not sincere in hisoffer to meet with NORML to discuss certain aspects ofAmerican drug policy," said NORML Executive DirectorR. Keith Stroup. "He has said on numerous occasionsthat we cannot arrest our way out of the drug problem; NORML hassaid for 26 years that an adult marijuana user should not facecriminal penalties. I think that there are a number ofpoints that we could agree on. Certainly, healthy discourseon this pertinent topic can only move the issue forward." Ironically, McCaffrey reiterated his invitation to meet with NORMLrepresentatives while speaking at American University inWashington D.C. on November 13. This action prompted NORML'sExecutive Director to again request a meeting with the Drug Czarto discuss policy options. For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre of NORML@ (202) 483-5500. Supreme Court Overturns Ohio Traffic StopDecision November 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.: The Supreme Court ruled that police do not have to inform driversduring a routine traffic stop that they are legally free to gobefore asking for consent to search their vehicle. Theruling overturns a 1995 Ohio Supreme Court decision mandatingthat police must first inform motorists that they are"legally free to go" before requesting the driver'spermission to search their car for drugs or other contraband. Writing the opinion for the court, Chief Justice WilliamRehnquist said that the court has "consistently eschewedbright-line rules" in Fourth Amendment analysis, and insteadmust examine the "totality of the circumstances" on acase by case basis. "It would be unrealistic torequire the police to always inform detainees that they are freeto go before a police consent search may be deemedvoluntary," Rehnquist concluded. In deciding the case, the High Court rejected the argument thatmany individuals will assume that they are in a police officer'scustody as long as the officer continues to interrogatethem. "While knowledge of the right to refuse consentis one factor to be taken into account, the government need notestablish such knowledge as the sine qua non of aneffective consent," Rehnquist opined. The case is cited as Ohio v. Robinette, No. 95-891. For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre or PaulArmentano of NORML @ (202) 483-5500. German State Plans To Sell Marijuana OverThe Counter November 19, 1996, Schleswig-Holstein,Germany: The small German state of Schleswig-Holsteinrecently announced plans to sell marijuana over the counter in anattempt to separate cannabis from the "hard" drugmarket, according to Reuters News Service. The state saidit will soon apply to the federal drugs agency for a permit tosell marijuana. The state Health Minister, Heide Moser, said authorities werelosing credibility by treating marijuana as if it were as adangerous as other "harder" drugs such as cocaine andheroin. "General warnings about the dangers of drugsare no longer being taken seriously," she said. The idea drew criticism from the German federal government whosespokesman said that, "Schleswig-Holstein's stance has littleto do with reality." The state, which is governed by a coalition of Social Democratsand environmentalist Greens, said it had not yet decidedprecisely where and how much cannabis would be available if its projectwins approval. Marijuana is technically illegal in Germany, but the SupremeCourt ruled in 1994 that possession of small amounts of cannabisfor personal use should no longer be punished. -END- MORE THAN 10 MILLIONMARIJUANA ARRESTS SINCE 1965 ...

November 14, 1996 Drug Czar Holds Meeting With California LawEnforcement To Discuss New State Medical Marijuana Law November 14, 1996, Washington, D.C.: Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey is scheduled to meet today withCalifornia law enforcement officials from the "No on215" campaign, including Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates,to discuss the federal response to the passage of Proposition215. The Office of National Drag Control Policy (ONDCP) had vigorouslycampaigned against the initiative and reaffirmed theAdministration's opposition to the passage of the measure in a November9 press release. "The passage of [Proposition 215] creates a significantthreat to the drug control system that protects ourchildren," the release said. "...As the DrugEnforcement Administration and the Department of Justice havestated, Federal law is unchanged by the passage of th[is]initiative. Doctors in ... California ... who prescribe aSchedule I drug as medicine, notwithstanding state law, willviolate federal law. The provision in the Californiameasure that allows patients and caregivers to grow and possessmarijuana also violates federal law. The decision to bringappropriate criminal or administrative enforcement action willbe, as always, decided on a case by case basis." Dr. Tod H. Mikuriya, who has long been involved with medicalmarijuana research, recently learned of the meeting, but wasdenied attendance by Assistant General Counsel Warren Hall. It was explained to Mikuriya that the list of participants waslimited to those opposed to Proposition 215. A follow upletter requesting Mikuriya's attendance was faxed by Rep. RonaldDellums (D-Calif.) who asked that the White House "doeverything possible to gain admission to this meeting for Dr.Mikuriya. Mikuriya has requested that the meeting be rescheduled to a laterdate in order to allow representatives from the Californiamedical community to attend the meeting. "Thelimitation of the list of invitees to those in law enforcement tostrategize on the response to the passage of Proposition 215 inCalifornia ... would appear to be possibly illegal if not grosslyimproper," he said. "[This] proposition involveshealth issues. To exclude input from physicians who are explicitlyand specifically mentioned is unacceptable. This act ofinstitutional denial demonstrates bad faith on the part of theparticipants from California who are sworn to uphold and enforcestate law."

Medical Marijuana Supporters Plan'Effective, Responsible' Procedures, Legislation To ImplementProposition 215 November 6, 1996, Santa Cruz, CA: Ameeting has been scheduled in Santa Cruz on November 16 todiscuss plans for implementing legislation to provide for thewell regulated distribution of medical marijuana to patients andresearchers. Although Proposition 215 makes concessions forpatients who possess and use marijuana for a legitimate medicalneed, it does not address the question of distribution. "We want Proposition 215 to work as effectively andresponsibly as possible in meeting the needs of patients andresearchers, with appropriate safeguards to prevent abuses,"says Lynnette Shaw, co-chair of the California Medical MarijuanaCouncil (CMMC), which is organizing the meeting. The CMMCincludes representatives of the state's medical marijuana"Cannabis Buyers' Clubs," that are currently supplyingpatients through the underground market. The conference will discuss ways in which CBC's can legitimizetheir operations under Proposition 215, with well definedprocedures for identifying medical marijuana patients, validating physicians'recommendations, and preventing diversions to non-medicaluses. Proposition 215 supporters are hoping to propose someform of legal licensing system for CBC's via implementory legislationin the state legislature next year. They also want toestablish legal cultivation facilities to supply both patientsand researchers with high-quality marijuana under legal, wellcontrolled conditions. Proposition 215 supporters contest claims by opponents, such asAttorney General Dan Lungren, that the initiative was writtenloosely so as to encourage abuses. "Proposition 215was deliberately framed in general terms so that the state andfederal governments could work out regulatory details of thedistribution system," says Dale Gieringer of CaliforniaNORML. "We want to work with local state and federalauthorities in ironing out any ambiguities in the law so as toprevent abuses." "Proposition 215 is not the last word on the subject, justthe first," said Shaw.

Arizona Governor May Veto Voter ApprovedInitiative November 6, 1996: Phoenix, AZ: ArizonaGov. Fife Symington may attempt to veto a recently passed stateinitiative allowing physicians to prescribe marijuana as amedicine and mandating that non-violent drug offenders receivetreatment rather than incarceration. The initiative passedon November 5 by a vote of 65 percent to 35 percent. An aide to Symington said last week that the governor believes hehas the authority to veto successful ballot initiatives whichpass with a simple majority of voters, but without a majority ofall registered voters. The governor has up to 30days to decide a course of action. Symington campaignedagainst the measure prior to the election. John MacDonald, Government Affairs Director of the ArizonaAttorney General's Office, said a veto by the governor wouldviolate the state's constitution, though he added that thesubject of referendum vetoes hasn't been fully studied by theattorney general or members of his staff. "Our opinion is that the governor has no constitutionalauthority to veto what the people have voted in favor of,"he said. "We expect he will follow the law. Ifhe does not, we expect that one way or the other he will wind upin court." For more information, please contact either Allen St. Pierreor Paul Armentano of NORML @ (202) 483-5500. Buyers' Club Activists Plead 'Morally NotGuilty' At Arraignment November 1996, Oakland, CA: Fivedefendants from the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club plead"morally not guilty" at their arraignment in AlamedaCounty Superior Court. The five individuals have beencharged with possession of marijuana for sale, the sale ortransportation of marijuana, and conspiracy, stemming from anAugust 4 raid by state law enforcement on the nearly 12,000member club. "The fact is, we did sell marijuana in San Francisco to sickand dying people for three and a half years," CBC founderDennis Peron told reporters outside the courtroom. "Wewere morally compelled to do this." Judge Larry Goodman scheduled a December 17 hearing on a motionfiled by the defendants to move the trial from Oakland to SanFrancisco. They argue that the trial should be conducted in SanFrancisco because that is where the club was located. Judge Goodman has already denied a gag order sought by theattorney general's office, saying he was not persuaded byarguments that pretrial press coverage could prejudice potentialjurors.

The result came despite heavy campaigning by opponents anddecades of anti-marijuana hysteria. The passage of Proposition 215 in California and Proposition 200in Arizona demonstrates that Americans can clearly distinguishbetween the use of marijuana as a medicine for serious illpatients and legalization for recreational use. It furthershows that the country has reached a consensus on the former, evenas it remains divided on the latter. "This is a victory for medical marijuana as well as forpatients and doctors," said NORML Deputy DirectorAllen St. Pierre. "It shows that Americans do not wantthe federal government to interfere with the relationship betweena seriously ill patient and the recommendation of his or her physician." Both state and nationwide polls taken prior to this election'svote have shown that a majority of Americans favor medicalmarijuana reform. The recent events in California andArizona may finally push those on Capitol Hill to take a close andobjective look at this issue. It may also encourage some ofthe 23 states that currently have laws regarding medicalmarijuana to modify their measures so that they can begindirectly benefiting patients. "These votes demonstrate that the public are ahead of thepoliticians when it comes to reforming our drug policies,specifically medical access to marijuana," said NORMLExecutive Director R. Keith Stroup. "Americans do notbelieve that denying medicine to the sick and dying should ever bea part of the drug war." The California initiative says that "Patients or definedcaregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medicaltreatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from the general provisionsof law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation ofmarijuana." It further provides that, "Physiciansshall not be punished or denied any right or privilege for recommending marijuanato a patient for medical purposes." The Act does not supersedestate legislation prohibiting persons from possessing orcultivating marijuana for non-medical purposes. "Despite heavy opposition from federal politicians and lawenforcement, the California medical marijuana initiative passedbecause individuals know by either their own personal experienceor by the experiences of those around them that marijuana hasmedical utility," said St. Pierre. "The governmenthas lost all credibility on this issue by claimingotherwise." "With the passage of Proposition 215 in California, newlegal protections will be put into place for patients who usemarijuana under a doctor's order," said Dave Fratello ofCalifornians for Medical Rights (CMR), one of the primary proponentsof the measure. The group also announced that they willoffer a toll-free number, 1 (888) YES-4-215, to explain how 215works, and for whom it is and is not designed. Proposition 200 in Arizona, known as the "DrugMedicalization, Prevention and Control Act," is broader thanCalifornia's measure and would essentially "medicalize"Arizona's drug policy. The Act calls for mandatory, court supervisedtreatment and probation as an alternative to incarceration for non-violentdrug users and provides expanded drug treatment programs. It will also allow doctors to prescribe controlled drugs such asmarijuana to patients suffering from serious illnesses such asglaucoma, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and AIDS. Arizonansvoted in favor of the initiative by a vote more than two to one. "These votes give a flashing green light to the Americanpublic that they have the power to change the course on Americandrug policy," said St. Pierre. -END- MORE THAN 10 MILLIONMARIJUANA ARRESTS SINCE 1965 ...

Making The Case For MedicalMarijuana by NORML Publications Director PaulArmentano Marijuana is medicine. Ithas been used for thousands of years to treat a wide variety of ailments. Marijuana was legal in the United States and prominent in thepharmacopoeia until 1937, when possession and use of marijuanawas outlawed by the federal government. Today, eight patients receivemarijuana legally from the government; for all other Americanswho could benefit from its therapeutic value, it remains aforbidden medicine. The passage of Proposition 215 in California,the Medical Marijuana Initiative, would be a first step inamending this grievous and unnecessary crisis. Contrary to popular belief, there have beenhundreds of studies on the medical uses of cannabis since itsintroduction to western medicine in the mid-nineteenthcentury. The best established medical use of smokedmarijuana is as an anti-nauseant for cancer chemotherapy. During the 1980s, smoked marijuana was shown to be an effectiveanti-emetic in six different state-sponsored clinical studiesinvolving nearly 1,000 patients. For the majority of thesepatients, smoked marijuana proved more effective than both conventionalprescription anti-nauseants and oral THC (marketed today as the syntheticpill, Marinol). For example, in a 1988 study by Dr. Vincent Vinciguerrapublished in the New York State Journal of Medicine,78 percent of patients who had shown no improvement with standardanti-emetics responded favorably to marijuana. In addition,29 percent of those patients who did not respond to oral THC didrespond to smoked marijuana. Vinciguerra concluded that theresults of the pilot study "demonstrate that inhalation marijuanais an effective therapy for the treatment of nausea and vomitingdue to cancer chemotherapy."[1] Similar findings were noted in state-sponsoredstudies in New Mexico, Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, and California.[2] Currently, many oncologists are recommending marijuanato their patients despite its prohibition.[3] In addition to its usefulness as ananti-emetic, there exists evidence -- both scientific and anecdotal-- that marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and sufferingfor patients with a variety of other serious ailments, and thatit is less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines for whichit may be substituted. For example, marijuana alleviatesthe nausea, vomiting, and the loss of appetite caused by the AIDSwasting syndrome and by treatment with AZT and other drugs withoutaccelerating the rate at which HIV positive individuals developclinical AIDS or other illnesses. Reportedly, 75 percent of the12,000 members of the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club werePatients With AIDS (PWAs) and a recent survey of HIV-positivepatients in Australia found that one-quarter were using marijuanatherapeutically.[4,5] It is generally accepted -- by the NationalAcademy of Sciences (NAS) and others -- that marijuana reducesintraocular pressure (IOP) in patients suffering from glaucoma,the leading cause of blindness in the United States. Thiswas first shown in a series of experiments by Robert S. Hepler ofUCLA, stemming from research aimed at finding out whethermarijuana dilated pupils. Hepler found a"statistically significant" drop in IOP in 429 subjectstreated with marijuana or THC, 29 of which showed continuedbenefits during 94 days of treatment with no signs of tolerance.[6] Currently, three of the eight patients whoreceive medicinal marijuana legally use it to treat glaucoma. There also exists historical evidence thatmarijuana is effective in treating a variety of spastic conditionssuch as multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, epilepsy, andquadriplegia. In the book, Marijuana: The ForbiddenMedicine, Dr. Lester Grinspoon of Harvard Medical Schooldescribes several case histories of patients suffering frommultiple sclerosis and other disorders whose condition improvedwhile they smoked marijuana and deteriorated after they stopped smoking. In addition, a number of animal studies have supportedmarijuana's ability to suppress convulsions. These studiesspecifically indicate cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive ingredientof marijuana unavailable in Marinol, to be a potentanti-convulsant. This latter fact was recently reaffirmedby the government's premiere marijuana expert, Dr. MahmoudElSohly of the Marijuana Project at the University ofMississippi, who stated during an interview with the Journalof the International Hemp Association that, "CBD[cannabidiol] is famous for [its] anti-convulsantactivity." ElSohly concluded that, "There is noquestion about the use of cannabis for certain conditions. It does have a history. It does have utility."[7] Marijuana is also used to treat those who seekrelief from chronic pain. Historically, marijuana was usedas an analgesic from ancient times through the nineteenthcentury. This usage declined with the introduction offaster acting and more potent, yet sometimes addicting, opiatessuch as morphine. However, anecdotal reports demonstratethat some patients currently receive their most effective painrelief from using marijuana. Limited scientific studies onnearly 100 patients have shown marijuana to be a potentanalgesic.[8] Evidence in support of marijuana's medicalvalue has existed for centuries and has been validated bynumerous studies, researchers, committees, health organizations,and even the Drug Enforcement Agency's Chief Administrative LawJudge, Francis L. Young, who in 1988 declared marijuana to be"one of the safest therapeutically active substances knownto man."[9] Unfortunately, patients who could benefit frommarijuana's therapeutic value have been held hostage by a federalgovernment that continues to treat the issue as a political football. American medical patients deserve better and Proposition 215 is a genuineand encouraging step to address their needs. Citations Vinciguerra, V., Moore T., Brennan, E.

October 24, 1996 American Nurses Association Reviews MedicalMarijuana October 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.: The Congress of Nursing Practice recently approved two motionsregarding the use of marijuana as a medicine. The Congressagreed to: A) "Support education for RNs regarding currentevidence based therapeutic uses of cannabis," and B) "Supportinvestigation of therapeutic efficacy of cannabis in controlledtrials." These recommendations will be included in areport from the Congress to the American Nurses Association (ANA)Board of Directors at their next scheduled meeting. The Congress took up the issue of medical marijuana following apresentation at the Centennial Conference of the American NursesAssociation by two of the eight legal marijuana patients in supportof the drug's therapeutic value. The Congress also revieweda position paper submitted by the Virginia Nurses Associationentitled "Therapeutic Uses of Cannabis," but failed toissue a position statement on that issue. Nevertheless, Mary Lynn Mathre, RN, of Patients Out Of Time saidthat the Congress' twofold motion "is a de facto statementby the ANA that marijuana has medical value; a way of showing supportfor similar resolutions passed by other U.S. health careorganizations; and should be recognized by the U.S. government asa polite way of calling for the denial of marijuana as medicinefor the sick and dying as illogical." Mathre notesthat state nursing associations of Virginia, Mississippi,Colorado, New York, and California have endorsed the use ofmarijuana as a medicine. Patients Out of Time is a non-profit organization comprised offive of the eight legal marijuana patients in the United Statesand various health care professionals.

Iowa Man Faces Prison Term For UsingMarijuana To Ease Pain October 24, 1996, Waterloo, IA: AnIowa man is facing prison for using marijuana to relieve thesymptoms of chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia, a painfulmuscle disorder. On Monday, October 28, the Black HawkCounty District Court will decide whether to revoke his probation forrefusing to stop smoking marijuana. Allen Helmers sustained a broken back in a 1983 car accident andwas injured again in 1994 after being struck by a drunkendriver. Six months before the second accident, policeseized three ounces of marijuana from Helmers' home. He wasplaced on probation for 2 to 5 years under intensive supervisionand fined $1,800. Helmers says that the pain he suffers daily makes it necessarythat he use marijuana. Helmers' doctor, W. H. Verdyne,agrees. "Chronic neurological pain responds well tothe medicinal use of marijuana ... causing much less side effectsthan the standard pain medications," Verdyne said. He notesthat routine medications have been unsuccessful in managingHelmers' pain. "The state of Iowa gave Allen a criminal conviction forpossession of marijuana, and now they want to revoke hisprobation because he refuses to stop smoking it," said CarlOlsen of Iowans for Medical Marijuana, who organized a protest onHelmers' behalf earlier this month. "The state of Iowahas the law on its side. We have love and compassion. The law must change."

Clinton Proposes Drug Testing TeenageApplicants For Driver's Licenses October 19, 1996, Washington, D.C.: President Clinton proposed a new federal mandate on Saturday torequire teenagers to pass a drug test before receiving a driver'slicense. Stating that a driver's license is a "privilege that shouldnot be available to those who fail to demonstrate responsiblebehavior," Clinton directed the Office of National DrugControl Policy to come up with a strategy to implement nationwidedrug testing for all teen applicants. Clinton said that hehoped the "90 percent [of adolescents] who aredrug-free" would participate in the program willingly. "We're already saying to teens if you drink you aren'tallowed to drive. Now we should say that teens should passa drug test as a condition of getting a driver's license. Our message should be simple: No drugs or no driver'slicense." Clinton's announcement drew harsh criticism from civillibertarians. "Once again we see civil liberties being pulverized by thepolitical posturing of the president," charged LibertarianPresidential candidate Harry Browne. "Once again, wesee millions of Americans having to prove their innocence togovernment bureaucrats. ... Once again, we see the 'War onDrugs' being used as an excuse to give the federal governmentmore power." Arthur Spitzer, the legal director of the American CivilLiberties Union's (ACLU) District of Columbia branch, said themove was an example of "this drug mania gonecrazy." He said the organization would considermounting a legal challenge. It is not yet known whether Clinton's proposal, if implemented,would be in violation of Constitutional guarantees againstunreasonable search and seizure. Most recently, the Supreme Courtruled that high school athletes could be randomly drug testedregardless of individualized suspicion. "Mandatory drug testing is an affront to human dignity, andit's making a mockery of the United States Constitution,"said NORML Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. "Clinton's latest proposal is ill conceived and unjustlylabels an entire generation as suspected drug users."

October 17, 1996 DEA Herbicide Under Fire FromHawaii Residents Locals Complain Of Nausea, Other Ailments Due To Spraying October 17, 1996, Hawaii Island, Hawaii: Residents of Hawaii's Big Island are complaining of nausea,headaches, and fatigue and some are pointing fingers at thefederal government. For nearly a decade, Drug Enforcement Agency-coordinatedmarijuana eradication efforts have targeted Hawaii Island, oftenspraying a glyphosate-based herbicide from low-flying helicopters oversuspected marijuana patches. Recently, however, someresidents are claiming that the pesticide, a chemical weed-killersimilar to "Round Up," is killing wildlife and makingsome citizens sick. "You can actually taste it in your mouth," said RogerChristie of the Hawaii Hemp Council, who alleges that diesel fuelis occasionally mixed with the pesticide. Christie claimsthat gusts of wind disperse the pesticide to outlyingcommunities, where it collects in rainwater catchments. Rooftop catchments are a common source of residents' drinkingwater. "In the last two weeks, hundreds of people have come to mewith their complaints and said that's why I'm feeling this waytoo," said Ka'u resident Susan Smith in an interview with KGMB-TVearlier this month. "[Law enforcement] are flying overmy house every other day. ... It's like a war zone outhere." "[Glyphosate] can do a lot of damage to ourbio-diversity," said Noah Berry, vice president of EcoLawInstitute Inc., an Oklahoma organization that works to strengthenenvironmental laws. Berry cited a 1995 Journal ofPesticide Reform report that said glyphosate exposure was the thirdmost commonly reported pesticide illness among agriculturalworkers in California. DEA spokesman Sidney Hayakawa acknowledged the residents' concernand noted that the spraying procedure is currently underevaluation. He told KGMB-TV that the agency will issue an updatedEnvironmental Impact Statement next year. Lenny Terlip of the state Department of Land and NaturalResources (DLNR) told NORML that claims of glyphosateharming the environment and endangering the health of residentswere "erroneous." He denied reports that theherbicide was mixed with any additives and said that the sprayingswere not being conducted near houses or residential areas. The helicopter-mounted spray-guns have "pin-pointaccuracy," he added. For now, however, the battle rages on and many residents remainunconvinced. This is an example of "law enforcementrun amuck," claimed environmental activist and residentJerry Rothstein, who recently attended a town meeting wherenumerous residents complained of health complications such as eyeirritation, itchy throats, and bronchial problems due tospraying. Photographs on display at the meeting documentedorange-sprayed foliage in forests and yards as well as dead birdcarcasses. "From the response of the Ka'u community,th[ese] latest aerial herbicide attack[s] appear to be among theworst yet," noted Rothstein. "Why do we have to wait [until] five years from now [for ananswer?]" asked Smith. "Why do we have to wait... till they tell us, okay, it's toxic and now it'soutlawed?" Currently, only one other state, South Dakota, engages in aerialherbicide spraying.

Drug Tax Ruled Unconstitutional By TexasAppeals Court October 16, 1996, Austin, TX: Astate law meant to penalize drug dealers by making them pay taxeson confiscated drugs violates constitutional guarantees againstdouble jeopardy, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruledWednesday. The decision is similar to a 1995 Arizona rulingthat prohibited an individual who possessed marijuana fromcriminal prosecution "because the tax imposed prior to theprosecution served a punitive purpose." Lawyers involved in the case said the 5-4 decision means thestate can either impose a drug tax or prosecute an individual forillegal activity; it can't do both. "This [ruling]means the state only gets one chance to punish you," saidTom Moran, a Houston attorney representing the defendant. The decision could lead to the review of nearly 1,000 of drugcases in which both criminal penalties and taxes wereassessed. In cases which all or some of the state drug taxhas been paid, this ruling could be "a pretty goodget-out-of-jail-free card," said Dan McCrory, an assistant districtattorney for Harris County. A spokesman for the statecomptroller's office told the Dallas Morning News thatcounties had referred over 9,000 cases to their offices forcollection of the drug tax. In the recent decision, the court found that Texas' $98 tax on anounce of marijuana and $200 per gram of controlled substance wasso high as to conclude, "it ... is a penalty for criminal conduct." Therefore, the court ruled that because the defendant had alreadybeen punished by "imposition and partial collection of atax," further prosecution would violate his Fifth Amendment protectionsagainst double jeopardy. The case had initially been denied by Texas courts, but the U.S.Supreme Court ordered the state courts to reconsider based upon a1994 Supreme Court ruling on double jeopardy. In that case, Departmentof Revenue v. Kurth Ranch, the Supreme Court ruled that tocollect a tax on the possession of drugs from defendants who hadalready been charged, convicted, and sentenced on criminalcharges involving the same drugs was the functional equivalent ofa successive criminal prosecution.

Drug Enforcement Administration AttacksCalifornia Medical Marijuana Measure October 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.: The Drug Enforcement Administration has come out against aCalifornia ballot initiative (Proposition 215) to prevent thestate prosecution of patients who use marijuana for a documentedmedical need. In a press release issued by Thomas Constantine, chiefadministrator, the agency states that it is "firmlyopposed" to the proposal. The agency cites risingadolescent drug use and an alleged lack of evidence regardingmarijuana's therapeutic value as reasons for holding itsposition. "How can we tell American children to refuse to use illegaldrugs when medical practitioners are prescribing marijuana ascasually as they prescribe penicillin or cough syrup?" heasked. "The children of America deserve to live adrug-free life, safe from the effects of drugs, and safe from thecrime and degradation that drug-taking breeds. Proposition215 sends the unequivocal message that we have surrendered to thelegalizers and have relinquished our principles." "This initiative is not about sending messages to kids, it'sabout reality," said Dave Fratello of Californians forMedical Rights. "The reality is that marijuana ishelpful as a medicine." "Marijuana has a 5,000 year medical history and was declaredto be 'one of the safest therapeutically active substances knownto man' in 1988 by the DEA's own Chief Administrative LawJudge," said NORML Deputy Director Allen St.Pierre. "Marijuana's medical utility has been endorsedby such well respected organizations as the American PublicHealth Association, National Academy of Sciences, and Federationof American Scientists. For the DEA to claim otherwise isfallacious." Proposition 215 is currently endorsed by the San FranciscoAcademy of Family Physicians, San Francisco Medical Society,California Nurses Association, and others. It continues tohave strong voter support and leads by 33 percent, according toan October 15 Field Poll.

This figure is an 18 percent increase above the1994 level and pushes the total number of marijuana arrests underthe Clinton administration to a staggering 1,450,751. The1995 yearly arrest total for marijuana violations is the highestever recorded by the FBI. Of the 588,963 arrests made for marijuana in 1995, approximately 86percent (503,350) were for simple "possession." The remaining 14 percent (85,614 arrests) were for "sale/manufacture,"a category that includes all cultivation offenses -- eventhose where the marijuana was being grown for personal use. "This data confirms what NORML has been maintainingall along," states NORML's Deputy National DirectorAllen St. Pierre. "Despite criticism on Capitol Hillthat this present administration is soft on drugs, the raw dataclearly demonstrates that the federal government's war onmarijuana smokers has gotten significantly tougher underClinton's regime. These new FBI statistics indicate thatone marijuana user is arrested every 54 seconds in America." According to annual data collected by the FBI, Clinton's threeyear average of total marijuana arrests (483,548 arrests peryear) is 30 percent higher than the average number of yearlyarrests under the Bush administration (338,998). "These latest figures expose those who claim that Americahas abandoned the drug war under Clinton as the politicalcharlatans they are," states NORML Publication'sDirector Paul Armentano. "The fact that adolescent userates for marijuana are rising at the same time that lawenforcement is arresting record numbers of users affirms NORML'slong-held belief that marijuana prohibition is not an effectivedeterrent to marijuana consumption. Clinton hasn'tabandoned the drug war; the drug war simply isn't working." Additional statistics gathered from the Uniform Crime Reportreveal that law enforcement made 1.5 million arrests for drugabuse violations in 1995, the most ever. This figure isa 7 percent increase above the 1994 level, 41 percent higher thanin 1991, and 65 percent higher than in 1986. The FBI reportfurther discloses that the number of individuals arrested formarijuana possession in 1995 virtually equaled the combinedtotal number of individuals arrested for possessing heroin,cocaine, and/or their derivatives.

NORML Chapter Challenges Harassment OfStudents With Hemp Jewelry October 8, Cleveland, OH: NorthcoastNORML has sent a letter to the Willoughby/Eastlake SchoolDistrict demanding that the school system stop harassing studentsfor wearing jewelry made from hemp fiber. Schools in thedistrict have been sending students to the principle's office andcalling parents to "discourage" students from wearinghemp jewelry, in accordance with a new policy enacted by schoolofficials in September. Spokespeople for the school system claim that the policy isdesigned to promote a drug-free environment and stifle"sympathetic" leanings toward marijuana, but NorthcoastNORML contends that the administrators' intentions do not givethem license to violate the First Amendment. "Legal precedentsmake it clear that students have the right to engage in symbolicspeech," said Northcoast NORML President John Hartman. The letter, written by Attomey William Saks, states that thecourts have consistently ruled that "students' viewpointscannot be constitutionally suppressed even if they can beinterpreted as being pro-drug. Assuming ... that thestudents wearing hemp are expressing sympathy for marijuana use,... the fact that marijuana use is illegal does not invalidatethe First Amendment protection for the students'expression." The letter demands a written promise that the school system willcease all action inhibiting the wearing of hemp in school. "Hemp is a natural, [legal] fiber that is attractive andhip," said Hartman. "A student has a right towear it whether they are promoting the medicinal value ofmarijuana, protesting the laws against it, or just for fun."

Dole Aide Reportedly Used Pot In College October 7, 1996, Hartford, CT: JohnBuckley, communications director for Republican PresidentialCandidate Bob Dole, may have regularly used marijuana while incollege, according to allegations made by former classmates. In a story that first ran in a Boston weekly last month, formerclassmates of Buckley said that they recall him using andoccasionally selling marijuana while he attended HampshireCollege in Amherst, Massachusetts. Most describe Buckley'salleged relationship with marijuana to have been typical for theenvironment. "Yes, he smoked pot. So what? A lot of peoplesmoked pot," said former college roommate Ed Benfey duringan interview with Reuters News Service. "It wassocially acceptable in that place and time to smoke pot." Benfey said that he didn't specifically remember Buckley everselling pot, but a second classmate speaking to the BostonPhoenix anonymously maintained he both smoked and bought marijuanafrom Buckley. Responding to the allegations in a prepared statement, Buckleymaintained that, "Whether I or any member of the Dole orClinton staff used marijuana 20 years ago when in college is nota relevant issue and I'm not going to respond to furtherquestions on the subject." Dole has recently attacked Clinton as being soft on the drugissue and specifically criticized the President for hiring peopleto the White House who had used drugs in the past. Oregon Cannabis Tax Act Aims For 1998Election October 1996, Portland, OR: Aproposed Oregon initiative measure to allow adults to purchasecannabis in state liquor stores has been certified by the stateSupreme Court and activists are already gearing up to place themeasure on the November 1998 state ballot. Although this year's proposal failed to collect the 73,261registered voters' signatures necessary to place the initiativeon the 1996 ballot, organizers are convinced that a future, moreorganized, and better funded campaign will be successful. "The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act (OCTA) made it two-thirds ofthe way to the ballot with less than $10,000," stated apress release from initiative organizers. "That isamazing in this age of dollar driven politics. We [expect]to raise $100,000 to qualify OCTA for the 1998 Oregon ballot[and] we will begin on a volunteer effort now." If passed, OCTA will replace all state and local marijuana lawsexcept for DUI laws and will permit adults to purchase marijuanafrom state liquor stores. The measure would also allow doctorsto prescribe marijuana to patients through pharmacies, allowfarmers to grow marijuana with a license for sales to the state,allow adults to grow marijuana for personal use without a license,and allow for industrial hemp cultivation. Ninety percentof the net proceeds will go to a state general fund, and theremaining 10 percent will be used to fund drug abuse educationand treatment programs. Sale and possession to minors willstill remain strictly prohibited. For more information on OCTA, please contact the Campaign forthe Restoration & Regulation of Hemp @ (503) 235-4606 orwrite to: P.O.

October 3, 1996 Political Cartoonist Supports Proposition215, Angers State Attorney General October 3, 1996, San Francisco, CA: California State Attorney General Dan Lungren thinks that thenationally syndicated comic-strip Doonesbury is going topot, and he isn't amused. Lungren is upset over this week's series of Doonesbury cartoonsfocusing on the police raid on the San Francisco Cannabis BuyersClub and promoting Proposition 215, a state ballot initiative to preventthe state prosecution of patients who use marijuana for adocumented medical need. Lungren was responsible forordering the August 4 raid on the club and is one of the chief opponentsof Proposition 215. He has asked Universal Press Syndicate,which distributes the cartoon, to either pull this week's stripsor include a disclaimer saying the cartoon is inaccurate. UPSis doing neither. "This week's Doonesbury strips clearly advance thewink-and-nod attitude toward drug use that is most responsiblefor the addition of thousands of American kids to the drugged andat risk roster," argued Lungren in a letter to the SanFrancisco Chronicle. Cannabis Buyers' Club Founder Dennis Peron countered that Lungrenwas advocating censorship. "Instead of attackingcharacters in a cartoon, why doesn't he meet me in adebate?" he asked. "This week's Doonesbury strips are bringing nationalexposure to a situation in dire need of widespread attention andreform," said NORML Deputy Director Allen St.Pierre. "National polls indicate that Americansdelineate between marijuana use for recreational purposes and medicalneeds and strongly support the latter. If Doonesbury canhelp further the debate, then it's a positive step." Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau has refused to commentspecifically on Lungren's attacks, but did weigh in on the issueof marijuana prohibition in the September 16 issue of TimeMagazine. "Before we can get any traction on controlling pot, ... thegeneration that popularized the stuff has got to finally comeclean about what made it so alluring in the first place -- andthen square that with current marijuana policy," Trudeauwrote. "A good start might be for every middle-aged publicofficial in America to take the following oath. "... I concede that I once did not view marijuana asdangerous. ... It was only after my appetite forrecreational drugs had abated, and I produced children whom I didnot believe capable of 'handling' marijuana as responsibly as Ihad, that I came to oppose decriminalization. I acknowledgethat it was this fear, and not new medical evidence, that causedme to subsequently support mandatory sentencing for otherpeople's children caught emulating the actions of my generation."

Supreme Court To Rule On Drug Testing OfPolitical Candidates October 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.: The Supreme Court will review the constitutionality of a Georgialaw mandating candidates to pass a drug test before qualifying torun for elected state office. The law is being challenged by attorney and former Libertariancandidate for Lieutenant Governor Walker Chandler. Chandleris appealing a 2-1 decision issued this past January by the 11thCircuit Court of Appeals upholding the law. Chandler saidthat the 11 page dissent in that case made his challengeappealing to the High Court. "I do not believe that the suspicionless search in thesecircumstances serves any special governmental need beyond thenormal need for law enforcement, and, if it did, I believe thatthe candidates' privacy interests outweigh the governmentalinterests," opined dissenting Circuit Judge RosemaryBarkett, raising questions about the U.S. Constitution's FourthAmendment guarantee to be free from unreasonable search andseizure. "We are not merely dealing with the denial ofa job opportunity, but with the denial of the opportunity toparticipate in our democratic form of government." Barkett's dissent also called into question apparent FirstAmendment violations posed by the controversial law. "The majority maintains that the government's purpose [inpassing this legislation] is not suppression of freeexpression. Yet, it supports it by citing the importance of ensuringthat elected officials are 'persons appreciative of the perils ofdrug use' and 'sympathetic to drug interdiction efforts.' Establishing a certain ideology as a 'qualification' for holdingpublic office appears to be a content-based restriction on freeexpression." In taking the case, the Supreme Court will also determine how farthe government may go in requiring people to submit to drug testswhere there is no particular suspicion of individual wrongdoing,reports the Washington Post. NORML's Amicus Curiae Committee will file an amicus briefin the case. The Georgia law does not apply to congressional candidates, whosequalifications are prescribed by the U.S. Constitution andCongress itself.

Critics of the policy argue that the new rule inhibits freedom ofexpression and amounts to nothing more than harassment. "It's extremism on the [anti-drug] issue," saidNorthcoast NORML chapter president John Hartman, who announcedthat he would provide hemp clothing and twine to interestedstudents. "Is the intention to pick out students andharass them or attempt to enforce their drug-free school policy? Either way, [it's] persecuting them for wearing [legal] hempjewelry." According to principle George Spinner, a proponent of the policy,hemp jewelry symbolizes "sympathy" toward marijuana, aview that he believes to be unacceptable in a schoolenvironment. "The truth is, they are wearing itbecause of the relationship of hemp and marijuana." Spinner noted that the jewelry will not be confiscated, butadmits that officials are asking students not to wear it. "By their own admission, school officials are trying tosuppress a political statement about our government's policiestoward marijuana and industrial hemp," said NORMLDeputy Director Allen St. Pierre. "This harassmentclearly infringes upon a student's constitutional guarantee of freedomof expression." Several students have approached Northcoast NORML to complainabout the new policy and some have begun to hand out flierschallenging the rule. Over 1,500 students attend theschool.

September 26, 1996 Government Marijuana Researcher SpeaksFavorably About Marijuana's Medical Utility September 21, 1996: In a recentinterview conducted by the Journal of the International HempAssociation (JIHA) in Amsterdam, Dr. Mahmoud ElSohly -- Directorof the National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA's) MarijuanaProject at the University of Mississippi and one of the federalgovernment's premiere marijuana experts -- spoke openly aboutmarijuana's medical potential. Specifically, ElSohly discussed the possible medical role ofcannabichromene (CBC), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid inmarijuana. He also spoke about the limited effectiveness oforal THC. According to ElSohly, CBC occurs in high portions of certainstrains of marijuana, but has been typically overlooked becauseit is difficult to distinguish from the more familiar property, cannabidiol(CBD), in standard chemical tests. Nonetheless, thepharmaceutical properties of CBC and CBD are quite distinct. "CBD is famous for [its] anti-convulsant activity ... [and]CBC obviously has good anti-inflammatory activity," remarkedElSohly. "Certainly there is the [anecdotal use ofmedical marijuana historically] and every day you look at thecannabinoids and activities in the light of today's science andtoday's pharmacology and so on, and you can really go back andscientifically and legitimately explain the use of cannabis overthe years for so many things. " ... There is no question about the use of cannabis forcertain conditions. It does have a history. It doeshave the utility and so on." Responding to the issue of smoked inhalation of marijuana versusorally consumed THC, ElSohly commented that THC in oralpreparation "doesn't seem to be doing the good job it should." He speculated that this is because oral and smoked THC producedifferent pharmacological profiles in the body. Becauseoral doses are processed by the liver before entering thebloodstream, oral THC produces high levels of the metabolite11-hydroxy-THC, while smoked marijuana does not. Since11-hydroxy-THC is four to five times more psychoactive than regularTHC, this may explain why some users report a high rate ofoverdoses and discomfort with Marinol. "The comments made by Dr. ElSohly indicate that their existsnot only anecdotal, but accepted scientific evidence supportingmarijuana's medicinal properties," said NORML DeputyDirector Allen St. Pierre. "It also specifies thatthere exists chemical properties in marijuana other than THC thathold medical value, further supporting the argument thatmarijuana appears superior to synthetic THC as a medicine."

House Holds Hearing On Adolescent Drug Use September 26, 1996, Washington D.C.: Purporting that adolescent drug use has reached "epidemic"levels, a joint hearing of the House Subcommittee on EarlyChildhood, Youth and Families, and the House Government Reformand Oversight Subcommittee on National Security was held today. Those testifying before the House included Former Administratorof the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Robert Bonner,Executive Vice President of the Parents' Resource Institute forDrug Education (PRIDE) Douglas Hall, Ohio Congressman RobPortman, and others. Hall's appearance before the committees coincided with therelease of a 1996 PRIDE survey indicating rising levels ofadolescent illicit drug use. According to the study, nearly38 percent of high school seniors reported trying marijuana oncewithin the past year. "Drug use by today's teenagersis not just part of growing up, a youthful indiscretion,"said Hall. "More students are using more drugs morefrequently, and their use is more hardcore than we have everseen." "Ladies and gentleman, drugs kill," announced Rep.Randy "Duke" Cunningham, Chairman of the HouseSubcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families. "It is more important than ever to be absolutelyuncompromising about this message." "This hearing was nothing other than a pre-election dog andpony show," said NORML Deputy Director Allen St.Pierre. "Despite claims from both parties thatspending toward anti-drug efforts have been slashed, federalfigures demonstrate that annual federal drug control spending increasedfrom less than five billion in 1988 to more than 15 billion forfiscal year 1997. According to government statistics,illicit drug use during this period of time has remainedvirtually unchanged among adults and actually risen slightlyamong adolescents. We cannot continue to keep throwing moneyat the problem and arresting record numbers of adult users andexpect any sort of tangible results."

September 19, 1996 Los Angeles Cannabis Buyers' Club Busted Third Raid Since August Sparks Outrage Among Cannabis Community September 16, 1996, West Hollywood, CA: Los Angeles county sheriffs raided the Cannabis Buyers' Club inWest Hollywood and took four employees, including two cancerpatients and an AIDS patient, into custody. The fourindividuals were later released on their own recognizance. The raid was conducted behind the backs of city officials, whowere reportedly outraged by the sheriffs' action. WestHollywood is one of several California communities to haveadopted a resolution urging police to refrain from medicalmarijuana arrests. Officers confiscated about one pound of marijuana, pills, somebrownies, and liquid believed to contain THC, said L.A. CountySheriffs Sgt. Robert Stoneman. Witnesses to the raid saidthat items relating to Proposition 215, a ballot initiative thatwould allow Californians to cultivate and possess marijuana formedical purposes, were also seized. This marks the third bust of a cannabis buyers' club since Augustand demonstrates a definite pattern among law enforcement totarget medical marijuana organizations. "This [bustsignifies] a new low in the war on pot," said CaliforniaNORML coordinator Dale Gieringer. "Our marijuana lawsare clearly bankrupt when they let law enforcement authoritiesrun amok arresting people for providing medicine to thesick. The time has come to protect Californians' right tomedicine. According to an article that appeared in the August 9 edition ofthe Philadelphia Inquirer, the club served approximately 1,000members and did not allow smoking to take place at thefacility. Members were screened by club staffers and wereonly accepted if they were referred by local AIDS treatmentorganizations.

(Meanwhile) Alternative Therapies GroupDistributes Medical Marijuana To San Francisco's Sick September 13, 1996, San Francisco, CA: A group that specializes in providing nontraditional remedies toAIDS sufferers worldwide has begun distributing marijuana topatients out of the Metropolitan Community Church in SanFrancisco. "This was not an easy decision," said Curtis Ponzi ofthe Healing Alternatives Foundation (HAF), the organizationresponsible for the distribution. "It was very stormy,very emotional. But we're filling a void." The foundation, founded in the early l980s, provides a variety ofherbal remedies and non-FDA approved drugs at-cost to seriouslyill patients. The organization makes no therapeutic claims aboutits products and urges buyers to discuss therapies with a doctor. Patients purchasing marijuana from the foundation must provide anote from their doctor stating that they have a legitimatemedical need for cannabis. The foundation then doublechecks with the physician, a process that takes about aweek. The verification process is thorough enough to discouragerecreational users from attempting to purchase marijuana, statedPonzi. Community reaction to the program appears positive. "Both Mayor [Willie] Brown and I think this is a soundprogram," said Dean Goodwin, an aide to the San Franciscomayor. "They're concentrating on the people who reallyneed [the marijuana.]" In addition, the San Francisco Police Department seems ready toexercise a policy of benign neglect with regard to the reneweddistribution. "We would only be interested in this ifit became obvious that they were selling [marijuana] to peoplewho weren't sick," said narcotics division Sgt. KurtBruneman. Metropolitan Community Church pastor Jim Mitulski said he isallowing his church to be used for the foundation's marijuanasales because medical cannabis is essential to the well-being ofmany congregation members. The current program is expectedto operate on a weekly basis. "We are not distributing it -- the foundation is,"Mitulski said. He notes that at least three additionalchurches may also participate in medical marijuana distributionin the near future. In the meantime, state law enforcement officials claim they willwatch and wait. "We're looking at it and we're awareof [marijuana being distributed by the HAF,]" said SteveTelliano, press secretary for state Attorney General DanLungren. "We're just keeping an eye on the situationto see what's happening."

Washington State Supreme Court To TackleMedical Marijuana Issue September 19, 1996, Tacoma, WA: Cancer patient and medical marijuana activist Ralph Seeley willargue before the state Supreme Court on September 25 that thestate's constitution requires marijuana to be available as aprescription substance. In 1995, Seeley won a declaratory judgment from trial court JudgeRosanne Buckner that Washington's ban on medical marijuanaviolates the state's constitution's reliance on "fundamental principles." Under guidelines agreed upon by both Seeley and the stateAttorney General's Office before the trial, the losing partywould seek a direct review of the decision in the state Supreme Court. An amicus brief in support of medical marijuana, prepared byAttorney Michael Cutler of Boston, Massachusetts, has been filedby NORML's Amicus Curiae Committee. Additional briefson behalf of Seeley have been filed by the American CivilLiberties Union (ACLU) and The Drug Policy Foundation(DPF). "A positive verdict in this case would furtherbolster the growing public support for access to medicalmarijuana both in Washington state and nationally," said NORMLDeputy Director Allen St. Pierre. St. Pierre noted that onMarch 30, 1996, Washington State Governor Mike Lowry signed intolaw a state budget allocating $130,000 to medicinal marijuanaresearch, including investigating ways of cultivating marijuanato be used for medicinal purposes.

California Polls Show Voters Strongly FavorMedical Marijuana Initiative September 19, 1996, California: Twoseparate California polls released today indicate that votersstrongly favor Proposition 215, a statewide initiative that wouldallow patients with a physician's recommendation to possess andcultivate marijuana for medical purposes. According to the results of a Field Poll reported by the SanJose Mercury News and San Francisco Chronicle, amongthose likely to vote, 62 percent said they would vote forProposition 215 and 29 percent said they would vote against it;nine percent were undecided. Among all registeredCalifornia voters, 61 percent favor the measure and 30 percentare opposed. The survey of 291 respondents has a margin oferror of six percentage points. In a separate telephone poll conducted by the Los AngelesTimes, 53 percent of respondents said they would vote for theproposal and 31 percent said they would vote against it; 16percent were undecided. "This is overwhelming support," said Steve Hopcraft ofCalifornians for Medical Rights. "California voterscannot accept that their doctors can prescribe morphine forcancer, AIDS, and other [serious illnesses] but notmarijuana. This is great news. "These findings, coupled with the results of similar pollsconducted both in California and nationally, demonstrate thatthere is ample support for the legalization of medical marijuanaamong the voting public," said NORML Deputy DirectorAllen St. Pierre. The results of the two recent California polls are the latest ina series of surveys indicating strong support for medicalmarijuana. A 1995 survey conducted by the American CivilLiberties Union (ACLU) demonstrated that 83 percent of theAmerican public agreed that patients who find marijuana aneffective therapeutic agent should be able to use itlegally. In addition, nine state polls have shown that astrong majority of Californians support medical marijuana.

Sheriff May Have Violated Election LawsWhile Opposing NORML Ballot Initiative September 19, 1996, Traverse City, MI: A state Attorney General official said Grand Traverse CountySheriff Harold Barr's decision to allow jail inmates to help putout flyers opposing a NORML ballot initiative todecriminalize marijuana possession in Traverse City may have violatedstate election laws. The assertion comes nearly one monthafter Traverse City NORML President Bill Bustance, who helped tospearhead the initiative, filed a complaint with the secretary ofstate alleging that taxpayers dollars were used to influence apolitical campaign. According to Michigan law, anorganization that knowingly violates campaign finance rules couldbe fined $20,000. Michigan Attorney General spokesman Chris Dewitt said the use ofinmates "certainly would be questionable under Michigan'slaw." Marijuana law isn't any more important than election law and weare appalled that [those against the initiative] had to break thelaw to beat us," said Bustance, who is seeking a new election. "What would have happened if they hadn't used taxpayer'sdollars against the taxpayers?" Voters narrowly rejected the proposal this past August.

September 12, 1996 Califano Attacks Attitudes Of Baby-BoomerParents Regarding Adolescent Mariiuana Use September 9, 1996, New York, NY: Thefact that a growing number of today's teens are experimentingwith marijuana is not seen as a "crisis" by manybaby-boomer parents who tried marijuana during their youth,reported a recent study released by the National Center onAddiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University (CASA). In addition, approximately half of the parents surveyed admIttedto having tried marijuana in their youth and 46 percent said theyexpected their teen to try illegal drugs. "What is infuriating ... is the resignation of so manyparents," said CASA head Joseph Califano. "Thatis not a climate that is sending a clear and loud message to akid: Don't use drugs." Specifically, Califano was alarmed at the attitudes of parentswho had formerly used marijuana. According to the study, 65percent of parents who had tried marijuana believe their ownchildren will use drugs. Also, 42 percent of those parentsdid not perceive use of marijuana by an adolescent under 16 yearsof age as a crisis. Califano argued that many parents need to be aware that themarijuana used by individuals today is far stronger than themarijuana of yesteryear. This claim has been refuted by NORML repeatedly. "There exists absolutely no evidence that marijuana THCcontent has increased significantly over the past twodecades," responded NORML Deputy Director Allen St.Pierre. "This fact is acknowledged by both theNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Department of Healthand Human Services (HHS) and is confirmed by the scientific datafrom the Potency Monitoring Project in Mississippi." The study also indicated that many adolescents have easier accessto marijuana than they do other regulated intoxicants likecigarettes and alcohol. Califano did not believe that thisfinding supported a need to regulate marijuana. "Legalization of marijuana would be a disaster," heresponded on a National Public Radio broadcast. Califanodid not elaborate further. "The fact that children currently have easier access tomarijuana than they do cigarettes or alcohol speaks volumes ofthe need to legalize and regulate marijuana, if only to moreeffectively keep it out of the hands of children," said St.Pierre. The "CASA National Survey of American attitudes on SubstanceAbuse II: Teens and Parents" was conducted during July andAugust by telephone of 1,200 adolescents age 12 through 17 and 1,166parents, all with children of the same age group.

Libertarian Presidential Candidate AttacksDole Proposals To Increase Drug War September 1996, Washington, D.C.:Libertarian Presidential candidate Harry Browne has sharplycriticized proposals by Republican Presidential candidate BobDole to greatly expand the role of the U.S. military, NationalGuard, and Central Intelligence Agency in the fight againstillicit drugs. Browne maintains that increasing the"War on Drugs" will only create more suffering, more crime,and more victims. "Like many other Republican politicians, Dole loves theinsane 'War on Drugs,'" said Brown. "But allfreedom-loving Americans should reject this vision of a nation atwar with its own citizens. "... Government can't keep drugs out of the country, itcan't even keep drugs out of its own prisons. Militarizingthe 'War on Drugs' won't solve the problem; the only realisticsolution is to end the war. Ending the insane 'War onDrugs' will take the criminal profit out of the illicit drug tradeand bring peace to our cities once again."

Those whorefuse to cooperate face a contempt of court charge and jailtime. "If you get caught with a little bit of marijuana, you'retelling us where you got it," said county prosecutor TobyVick, who helped devise the new policy. However, reactionto the measure remains mixed. "It makes great ink, and it makes great film at 11, but inreality I question the effectiveness of such a program, saiddefense attorney David Boone. Boone argued that mostindividuals convicted on drug possession charges have littlefirst-hind knowledge of those who sell them the drugs. "Small time drug dealers are nameless strangers to thepeople with whom they trade," he said. Kent Willis, director of Virginia's American Civil LibertiesUnion (ACLU), noted that Vick and the police have the legalauthority to carry out their plan, but did not believe it wouldbe effective. Anti-Drug Group Returns Donation After NORMLChapter Files Complaint Alleging Campaign Finance Violations September 11, 1996, Traverse City, MI: A local anti-drug group who actively opposed a city ballotinitiative to decriminalize marijuana possession has returned a$1,000 check from the city's narcotics agency over concerns thedonation may have violated state campaign finance laws. TraverseCity NORML President Bill Bustance, who was behind thenarrowly-defeated initiative, recently filed a complaint with theSecretary of State alleging that taxpayer dollars were used to influencea political campaign.

Senate Holds Special Hearing On Teen DrugUse September 4, 1996, Washington, D.C.: In wake of a Department of Health and Human Services reportindicating that monthly use of illicit substances has doubledamong adolescents since 1992, the Senate Judiciary Committeeconvened a special hearing to examine the issue. Speaking before the committee were Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY),Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey, Health and Human Services SecretaryDonna Shalala, and John Walters. All agreed that programsto reverse current trends in teen drug use must focus on 1)tougher drug penalties for adult users; 2) a clear and concisemessage that use of any illicit substance is wrong; and 3) increasedfederal spending on youth education programs such as DARE. "What both the speakers and senators neglected to mention isthat none of these options have been effective in reducing teendrug use," stated NORML Publications Director PaulArmentano, who attended the hearing. "Today'sgraduating seniors are the first generation of adolescents who wereexposed to the most massive, consistent, and expensive federalanti-drug campaign ever launched. They grew up listening toDARE officers in the classroom and public service announcementsfrom the Partnership for a Drug Free America when they came home;yet the statistics indicate that they are using drugs at farhigher rates than were their predecessors just four and fiveyears ago. "In addition, more drug offenders are being arrested andincarcerated for longer periods of time than ever before in ournation's history.

California Re-Enacts Temporary "Smoke AJoint, Lose Your License" Bill September 3, 1996, Sacramento, CA: Minutes before its post-midnight adjournment, the CaliforniaState Senate enacted a temporary, emergency "Smoke a Joint,Lose Your License" bill. The decision surprised manywho noted that the Senate had turned down a similar measureearlier in the day. The legislation was passed at the insistence of Gov. Pete Wilson,a long-time advocate of the federal mandate. The lawrequires a six-month driver's license suspension for all drugoffenses, regardless of whether they are driving-related. State Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer is said to havereluctantly agreed to the measure as a means of guaranteeingfederal highway aid. Under federal law, California must bein compliance as of October 1, 1996 or else lose $100 million inhighway funding. The bill was passed as an emergencymeasure so as to take effect immediately upon the Governor'ssignature. In deference to opponents, the new law is set to expire withinsix months. This will set the stage for another "Smokea Joint, Lose Your License" battle next year. "Gov. Wilson's insistence on this foolish federal mandate isone more costly example of Republican anti-drug hypocrisy,"said California NORML coordinator Dale Gieringer. "It's clearly absurd for the government to take [your]driver's license away for possessing a joint in your home, yetnot for speeding and reckless driving with a bottle in yourcar."

Marijuana Activists Arrested On TrespassingCharges After Being Banned From Attending Public Rally September 1996, Columbus, NC: ANorth Carolina couple were arrested and charged with trespassingby the Polk County Sheriff's Department after attending a publicrally to promote medicinal marijuana in front of the countycourthouse. Although both Steve and Jean Marlowe were involved in organizingthe event, billed as the Second Annual Freedom Rally, Mr. Marlowehad been told by county officials that he was forbidden fromattending because of allegations he smoked marijuana at lastyear's festival. Marlowe was arrested on charges ofmarijuana possession after last year's event, but the case is stillpending. Jean Marlowe argues that the recent arrest was in violation oftheir civil liberties and the couple plans on pursuing legalaction against the county. "County council says theycan set their own rules, but they can't violate yourrights," she said. "They can't forbid you toattend a rally." Philadelphia attorney Lawrence Hirsch has agreed to take the caseon behalf of the Marlowes and called the suit a matter ofprinciple. "To me, every step of the way, [the county]seem to be creating a case that's bound to blow up in thereface," he said. In 1995, NORML and the Southern California American CivilLiberties Union filed a civil rights lawsuit against an Anaheimordinance that prohibited certain prior drug offenders from the rightto use public parks for lawful purposes.

Juror Held In Contempt After Refusing ToConvict Drug Offender September 1996, Gilpin County, CO: Ajuror who maintains that she had "reasonable doubt"regarding the guilt of a drug defendant could face over sixmonths in prison and an unspecified fine after being cited byGilpin County Judge Kenneth Barnhill for contempt of court. Laura Kriho is scheduled to begin a jury trial in late Septemberto defend herself against allegations that she tainted a jury inthe case of a 19 year-old female defendant charged with felony possessionof methamphetamine. According to Barnhill, Kriho allegedlydisobeyed a court order by discussing sentences in herdeliberations. Kriho insisted that she ultimately voted toacquit because she had reasonable doubts as to the defendant'sguilt based on the facts of the case as presented by theprosecution. Barnhill also alleged that Kriho committed perjury by lying underoath to the Judge and the attorneys by failing to volunteerinformation regarding a prior drug conviction from 1984. Kriho argued that she was never specifically asked about hercriminal history and notes that she received a deferred sentencefor the 1984 conviction. "I tried to do my job as a juror well," Krihosaid. "I had never been on a jury before, and the wholeexperience was unique and very stressful. Now I feel I ambeing unfairly singled-out and punished for coming up with the'wrong' verdict." Attorney Paul Grant, who is representing Kriho in this case,warned that the prosecution of his client threatens to underminethe jury system. "Jurors must be able to deliberateindependently of the judge, without the threat of criminalprosecution hanging over their heads," he stated.

August 29, 1996 State Looks Into Filing Tax ViolationsAgainst Marijuana Club Proprietors August 24, 1996, San Francisco, CA: State officials are probing into whether proprietors of the SanFrancisco Cannabis Buyers' Club may have violated federal andstate tax laws by failing to report club revenue to theIRS. Failing to report income, including income generatedthrough illegal activities, is against the law. Theallegation is the latest in a series of accusations made by statelaw enforcement officials since the club was raided on August4. To date, no individuals have been arrested in connectionwith the club, nor have any formal charges been filed. California Bureau of Narcotics Chief Joe Doane said that theissue of possible tax evasion arose because agents found nodocuments related to the withholding of salary for SocialSecurity, state and federal taxes and workers' compensation foremployees of the club. "That indicates [that clubfounder Dennis Peron] was not following state and federal lawsregarding payment of taxes on salaries and benefits," arguedstate attorney general's office spokesman Steve Telliano. Dennis Peron told United Press International that standardbusiness practices were not followed at the club because of theunderground nature of supplying medical marijuana to those whoneeded it. "Until we change the law, you have torealize that what we are doing is illegal. We've had to do thingsa certain way to protect the people whose lives we were trying tohelp." Californians for Compassionate Use treasurer John Entwistlecalled the state's latest allegation "another redherring" and reiterated that all profits were distributedback into the club. "If we had bought big houses, thenwe'd be ashamed," he remarked. "But we didn't;we've all taken vows of poverty. There is no hiddenmoney." Officials report that criminal charges involving both the taxissue as well as other facets of the club's activities may befiled in three to four weeks.

Cincinnati Buyers' Club Founder PleadsGuilty To Reduced Marijuana Charges August 20, 1996, Covington, KY: Richard Evans, founder of the Greater Cincinnati Buyers' Club,plead guilty to a reduced misdemeanor charge of trafficking inmarijuana under eight ounces and was sentenced to serve 29 days incounty jail. Evans will begin his sentence inSeptember. Evans had been facing three felony counts oftrafficking in marijuana within 1,000 yards of a school followinga February raid by law enforcement officers on the club's headquarters. "I was facing a total of 15 years in prison; they wereoffering 29 days in county jail," Evans said after heentered his guilty plea in Kenton Circuit Court. Initially,Evans had considered battling the charges on constitutionalgrounds. Prosecutors agreed to reduce the charges against Evans afterconceding that his actions "were not done as part of acommercial enterprise [or] ... for purposes ofprofit." Evans told NORML that the judge in thecase remarked that she believed that marijuana for medicalpurposes would eventually be legal in America, but noted thatindividuals have to abide by the law. When asked whether he would continue to operate the buyers' clubonce he completes his jail term, Evans responded that it wouldn'tbe "in this country." However, he added that,"There's plenty of people lined up to take over." Evans called the judgment a "partial victory" and told NORMLthat a short stay in jail was a fair price for the large amountof publicity his case generated. NORML Chapter Files Complaint After Voters Strike Down Ballot Proposal To DecriminalizeMarijuana August 16, 1996, Traverse City, MI: Proponents of a city ballot initiative to decriminalize marijuanapossession have filed a complaint with the Secretary of Statealleging that opponents of the measure violated state campaignfinance laws. The proposal was rejected by voters by a 58to 42 percent vote. The complaint, spearheaded by Traverse City NORML President Bill Bustance,maintains that Traverse City Police Chief Ralph Soffredine, ProsecutorDennis LaBelle, and others acted as a political committee butfailed to file any papers with the county clerk as required underthe Michigan Campaign Finance Acts. The complaint alsoalleges that opponents sent out a biased flyer against theproposal using the tax-funded mailing permit of TraverseCity. Bustance is demanding a new election. "We've had two successful initiatory petitions filed and ifthese claims [prove] substantial then we at least deserve onefair election," Bustance said. Traverse City officials admit that the city paid to send out over9,400 flyers in a one-time mailing, but deny that the mailing wasan attempt to influence voters against the ballot proposal. Theflyer was titled "Marijuana: Facts to Consider." According to Michigan law, a person who knowingly violatescampaign finance rules could be punished by up to a year in jailor a $2,000 fine. An organization that does so may receiveup to a $20,000 fine. The road to the ballot had been a rocky one for marijuanaactivists. Chapter organizers' 1994 initiative drive was rejectedby the city commission despite having well over the requirednumber of signatures, because it allegedly conflicted with statelaw. This year's petition was devoid of legal problems, but facedsevere opposition from city commissioners who in December unanimously passeda resolution asking residents not to sign the petition. The commissionlater passed a resolution encouraging voters to vote against the proposal. For more information, please contact Bill Bustance of TraverseCity NORML @ (616) 264-9565. Dutch Cities Get Into The Marijuana Business August 1996, Delfzijl, Netherlands: For two decades, Dutch officials have tolerated the sale ofmarijuana and hashish in coffee shops; now some are going intobusiness for themselves. Authorities in the town of Delfzijl are spending $294,117 to opena coffee shop on September 1, reports the Associated Press. It is modeled on a similar project in the town of Bussum, outside Amsterdam. Profits from the store will fund education campaigns on drug use,and the store will be staffed with counselors and youth workersoffering free health information on drug use. "Of course we don't want people to use drugs, but that's notrealistic," said Delfzijl City Hall spokeswoman MarjonEdzes. "This is a healthier solution." Despite their policy of tolerating the sale of marijuana andhashish, the number of Dutch adolescents who have ever usedmarijuana is far lower than in America. Dutch politiciansmaintain that their policy discourages hard drug use byseparating the illicit drug markets.

Dole Calls For Larger Military Presence InDrug War August 25, Palos Park, Ill: Responding to figures of rising illicit drug use amongadolescents, Republican Presidential nominee Bob Dole vowed togreatly increase the role of the military in combating drugs. "We will make drug interdiction a priority for ourintelligence services, beefing up not just technical operationsbut also human intelligence operations," said Dole during arecent campaign speech. "We will expand the use ofmilitary technology, including reconnaissance and satellites and areasurveillance and listening posts to track drug movements towardour borders." Dole also advocated using the National Guard in domestic druginterdiction efforts. "Working with the governors, wewill create designated National Guard units with appropriatetraining and equipment to provide a rapid responsecapability. If we need the National Guard to move in, they'llhave the training." "Dole's proposals are nothing new," commented NORMLDeputy Director Allen St. Pierre. "Increasing the useof military technology to interdict drugs began under the Bushadministration at the cost of millions of taxpayers' dollars, yetyielded few tangible results. Also, the National Guard hasbeen utilized in domestic drug enforcement -- generally marijuanaeradication -- since Congress authorized its use in 1988 bysidestepping the Posse Comitatus Act of 1879 that forbids the useof federal troops in civilian law enforcement." Dole defended his proposals by alleging that the threat of drugs,like the threat of terrorism from abroad, was an area where themilitary had a proper role.

America's Prison Population More ThanDoubles In A Decade August 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.: There were approximately 1.6 million men and women in thenation's jails and prisons last year, reported the Department ofJustice. This figure is a 113 percent increase since 1985and equates to one out of every 167 U.S. residents in jail orprison. Since 1980 -- when the number of inmates in state or federalprisons or in local jails stood at just over 500,000 --incarceration growth in the United States has ballooned over 200percent. According to federal statistics, the mostsignificant factor for this dramatic increase is drugarrests. Drug offenders now comprise more than 25 percentof all U.S. inmates, up from less than ten percent in themid-1980s. "While Congress and politicians are calling for toughersentencing and tougher judges, they are conveniently neglectingthe fact that America already incarcerates a larger percentage ofits population than any other country; this is a direct result ofthe drug war," said NORML Deputy Director Allen St.Pierre. "Unfortunately, after listening to recentcampaign speeches by both the Dole and Clinton camps, it appearsthis trend is far from over."

August 22, 1996 Latest Edition Of Household Survey FuelsElection Year Fodder NORML Responds To Calls To Escalate The Drug War August 21, 1996: Washington, D.C.: Illicit drug use (defined as use at least once in the past month)among adolescents age 12 to 17 rose 33 percent since last yearand now stands at 10.9 percent, reports the latest annualfindings from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. Theuse of marijuana, the illicit drug used primarily by adolescents,increased from 7.3 percent to 8.2 percent. Not surprisingly, both prohibitionists and politicians are usingthe latest statistics to call for increased anti-drugefforts. "This is nothing short of a nationaltragedy," said Republican nominee Bob Dole. "Starting next January, I'm going to make the drug warpriority No. 1 once again." In light of the recent data, NORML issued the followingstatement. As always, NORML remains committed to thenotion that adolescents grow up drug-free. "The statistics indicating rising levels of teen marijuanause cited by the National Household Survey should be an issue ofconcern for both parents and political leaders alike. However,there is no evidence to demonstrate that increasing penaltiesagainst adult users will amend the problem. In fact,federal statistics indicate that just the opposite is true. "Despite criticism that the Clinton administration hasabandoned the drug war, FBI figures from its annual Uniform CrimeReport illustrate that nearly one-half million Americans werearrested on marijuana charges in 1994 -- more than 83 percent ofthem for simple possession. This inflated figure is aremarkable 42 percent increase over the average yearly total formarijuana arrests under the Bush administration and equates to anarrest every 65 seconds! "Yet, in spite of this significant increase in theenforcement of drug and marijuana laws, recent studies such asthe Household Survey indicate that the use of narcotics andmarijuana is rising in popularity -- especially amongadolescents. Specifically, the fact that the use ofmarijuana is rapidly growing at the same time that lawenforcement officials are arresting record numbers of usersclearly confirms that marijuana prohibition does not effectivelydeter marijuana consumption. "In addition, it must be noted that today's rates ofadolescent drug use are rather moderate when put in historicalperspective. For example, as late as 1988, during theheight of the Reagan/Bush 'Just say 'no' campaign,' the number ofadolescents age 12 to 17 who reported using an illicit substancewithin the past month stood at 9.2 percent, just slightly belowtoday's so-called 'emergency levels.' In addition, today'suse rates -- despite the recent increase -- still remain well belowthe peak levels recorded in the late i970s and early 1980s. "We will probably never know why marijuana use-rates go upand down over time. However, it is worth noting that therecent increase occurred among the same population of youngpeople who had been exposed to a decade-long anti-marijuanacampaign in the schools and the media. That campaign, basedon exaggerations of marijuana's alleged harms and a 'Just say no'ideology has clearly failed."

Study To Determine Whether Marijuana HelpsIndividuals Suffering From AIDS Wasting Syndrome Rejected ByNational Institutes of Health August 7, 1996, San Francisco, CA: Dr. Donald Abrams of UC-San Francisco learned that his proposalto conduct a pilot study into the use of smoked marijuana in thetreatment of the AIDS wasting syndrome was rejected by apeer-review committee of the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases (NIAID). This means the study cannotproceed because the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)arbitrarily required that it pass the NIH peer-review process to qualifyfor receiving marijuana from NIDA. This condition has notbeen previously required of other FDA-approved studies. NIDA retains a monopoly on the legal supply of marijuana for researchpurposes. NIAID will send a letter explaining the reason for the rejectionin six to eight weeks. At that time, Dr. Abrams willevaluate the comments to see if, in his opinion, they arescientifically justified or politically motivated. Adecision regarding the revision and resubmission of the protocolwill be made at that time. NORML board member Rick Doblin of the MultidisciplinaryAssociation for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has been workingclosely with Dr. Abrams for four years to sponsor thisstudy. He noted that this was the second time a specificpilot study proposed by Dr. Abrams to investigate the use ofsmoked marijuana in the treatment of weight loss in patientssuffering from the AIDS wasting syndrome has been rejected byfederal health officials. Although having an initial protocol design extensively reviewed,critiqued, modified, and approved by the both the FDA and theCalifornia Research Advisory panel in 1994, Abrams was deniedreceiving the marijuana necessary for his study by NIDA in Aprilof 1995. After addressing several of NIDA's concerns --including revising the protocol to an all in-patient study --Abrams resubmitted a grant proposal to NIH on May 1, 1996. This latest rejection "delays [us] at least a year, if notpermanently," said Doblin. "In 1992, DEAAdministrator Robert Bonner stated: 'Those who insist thatmarijuana has medical uses would serve society better bypromoting or sponsoring more legitimate scientificresearch.' All we are asking for is simply to conduct thatresearch." "The events of the past weeks in San Francisco make thebankruptcy of the government's policy glaringly evident,"said California NORML Coordinator Dale Gieringer. "Whyis it easier for your kids to get marijuana than for researchers,physicians, and patients?"

Swiss State To Legalize Marijuana August 19, 1996, Zurich, Switzerland: The government of the state of Zurich in Switzerland approved aproposal that could legalize the use of cannabis, reported theReuters news agency. In a 85-40 vote, the state council endorsed a resolution by theliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) that calls for a change inthe narcotics law through a referendum. The FDP argued that using marijuana should no longer remain apunishable offense because 20 years of federal prohibition havenot proved to be an adequate deterrent of either marijuana use or availability. Therefore, the proposal recommends that the sale of cannabis beorganized and regulated by the state in order to insure qualityand eliminate the black market. Board Strikes Down Proposal To Declare Medical Marijuana 'Emergency' For San Francisco's Sick August 16, 1996, San Francisco, CA: A measure to declare a city-wide state of emergency allowingmarijuana to be used for medical purposes has been struck down bySan Francisco city officials. The proposal, spearheaded bycity Board of Supervisors member Tom Ammiano, was introducedfollowing a raid by state narcotics officers on the San FranciscoCannabis Buyers' Club. On the advice of the city's District Attorney Terence Hallinanand Director of Health Sandra Hernandez, a Board of Supervisorscommittee backed off from the declaration. Many officials claimedthat approving such a controversial measure could jeopardize thecity's needle-exchange program that currently operates under anemergency declaration. The decision came one day after MayorWillie Brown withdrew his support for the proposal. "If it were up to me, I would have a state of emergency, butgiven the [advice], it doesn't look a state of emergency is goingto fly," said Ammiano. Brown said that he also felt a declaration of a medical marijuanaemergency could legally endanger the clean needle program. He added that city officials were attempting to work out an agreementwith the state attorney general's office to let anotherorganization distribute marijuana to patients. "If they say that it can't be done [by the San FranciscoCannabis Buyers' Club and] it has to be done [by] some otherorganization that's free of any taint, then we'll do that,"Brown said at his bi-weekly press conference. "My interest is to get [medical marijuana] to anorganization that has no history with legal or illegal use ofmarijuana," added police commissioner Pat Norman. "[This] should not be a political issue; it should beprovided as treatment." Responding to the possibility that city officials may attempt toprocure an outside entity to distribute medical marijuana, SanFrancisco Cannabis Buyers' Club founder Dennis Peron told the SanFrancisco Chronicle that he would support any and all efforts toviably get medical marijuana to the sick.

(Meanwhile) San Francisco Church SponsorsMedical Marijuana Giveaway August 19, 1996, San Francisco, CA: A city church distributed marijuana on Sunday to patients whopossessed a doctor's recommendation in wake of the temporaryinjunction closing the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club. About 25 patients showed up for the giveaway, news of which wasspread through word of mouth. Those possessing validdocumentation were provided with one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana. "I believe the moral stance [in this instance] is to breakthe law to make this marijuana available," said Rev. JimMitulski of the Metropolitan Community Church of SanFrancisco. "Our church's spiritual vitality has alwayscome from a willingness to act where people have been reluctantto act. This is not a bystander church." Allen White, a community activist who helped organize the event,said he had notified Mayor Willie Brown, Assistant Police ChiefEarl Sanders, and District Attomey Terence Hallinan Saturdaynight about the church's plan to distribute marijuana. Organizers said that they knew of no other church that hadconducted such an operation. Mitulski did not specify whether he would hold repeat giveaways,but added that there were no plans to do distribute marijuana ona long-term basis. He said he hoped other churches will becomeactively involved in the issue.

August 15, 1996 Law Enforcement Bust Cannabis Buyers' ClubIn Key West, Florida Founder, One Other Arrested On Felony Marijuana Charges August 14, 1996, Key West, FL: Forthe second time in two weeks, law enforcement officials haveraided and shut down operations of a cannabis buyers' club. Police sparked a wave of citizen outrage when Special Operationsdetectives raided a cannabis buyers' club in Key West andarrested two people, including club founder Zvi Baranoff. Both individuals were charged with possession of felony amountsof marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of drugparaphernalia. The Key West club serviced approximately 90patients and has existed for one year. It is one of anestimated 30 underground clubs throughout the United States thatdistributes marijuana as a medicine to seriously ill patients whopossess a doctor's recommendation. "It seems like shabby treatment of someone who's trying todo something good," said a former Key West city commissionerwho spoke anonymously with the Key West Citizen. "Where's the compassion? These people were dispensingmedicine to people who can't eat, sleep, or hold food in theirstomachs. [The raid is nothing more than an] inhumane witchhunt." Detective John Elmore defended the raid by saying that policehave no choice but to enforce the law. Elmore furtheralleged that marijuana was sold to some individuals who did notsuffer from valid medical illnesses. Local citizens appeared to be strongly supportive of the club andmany club members voiced their discontent to the localmedia. "We're just trying to extend our lives a littlebit," said one HIV-positive club member. "Maybethese officers should attend every funeral, or read the newspaperwhich would be stuffed with obituaries" if we didn't haveunderground access to medical marijuana. The Key West bust comes on the heels of a raid by Californiastate narcotics agents last Sunday on the 11,000 member SanFrancisco Cannabis Buyers' Club. No arrests have yet to be madein connection with the raid, but a temporary injunction has beengranted to keep the club closed. The decision by stateAttorney General Dan Lungren to order the bust has outraged many membersof the San Francisco community -- including Mayor Willie Brown,Sheriff Michael Hennessey, District Attorney Terence Hallinan,former Police Commissioner Jo Daly, and several members of thecity's Board of Supervisors -- and cast harsh criticism uponstate politicians and law enforcement. "With the recent raids of cannabis buyers' clubs inCincinnati, San Francisco, and now Key West, the message isclear: law enforcement is targeting the sick and dying,"said NORML Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. "Our sympathy goes out to the individuals and patientsaffected by these unfortunate incidents." For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre of NORML@ (202) 483-5500. Two State Medical Associations EndorseProposition 215 August 8, 1996, San Francisco, CA: Two statewide medical societies, representing a combined total ofalmost 10,000 physicians, have endorsed a California ballotinitiative to legalize marijuana for medical use (Proposition215). The San Francisco Medical Society (SFMS), which represents about2,200 doctors in San Francisco, announced its support forProposition 215 just four days after state law enforcement officersraided and closed down San Francisco's Cannabis Buyers'Club. They were joined in their endorsement by theCalifornia Academy of Family Physicians (CAFP), which represents approximately7,500 physicians statewide. San Francisco Medical Society President Dr. Toni J. Brayer saidthat the society based its decision on the results of an opinionpoll of doctors who treat MDS and cancer patients as well as drugaddicts. The doctors surveyed reportedly told the societythat they believed legalizing marijuana for medical purposes wasa good idea because it has therapeutic value to many seriously illpatients. "This initiative is an important one. ... It willprotect our patients," Bayer said. "What we want todo as physicians is to relieve pain and suffering." The society also recommends clinical testing of marijuana as amedicine so that scientific data may be generated on itseffectiveness in treating patients.

(Meanwhile) Judge Orders Changes in"Misleading" Ballot Argument Against Proposition 215 August 9, 1996, Sacramento, CA: Organizers of a campaign against a California ballot proposal tolegalize marijuana for medical use (Proposition 215) took one onthe chin as Sacramento Superior Court Judge William Ridgewaycalled part of the campaign's prohibitionist argument"misleading" and ordered changes. Advocates forthe medical marijuana initiative applauded Ridgeway's ruling andremarked that the statements in question were "yet anotherin a series of deceptions" waged by opponents of Proposition215. The judge's action was sparked by an American Cancer Society(ACS) petition. The ACS asked to have two references to theorganization by opponents, collectively known as "No on 215,"dropped or changed before publication in the ballot pamphletdistributed by the secretary of state. The pamphlets wentto press this week. The original "No on 215" rebuttal argument portrayedthe ACS as vocal opponents of the medical marijuanainitiative. In truth, ACS attorney George Waters maintainedthat the organization neither supports nor opposes themeasure. Therefore, Judge Ridgeway ordered that "No on215" alter their chief rebuttal argument: "AmericanCancer Society says no." In addition, the judgeordered that a second reference to the Society's opinion onmarijuana be removed entirely. Ballot initiative proponents also note that the rebuttal falselyclaims that "no major doctor's organization supportsProposition 215" when, in fact, both the San FranciscoMedical Society (SFMS) and the California Academy of FamilyPhysicians (CAFP) -- together representing nearly 10,000physicians -- have already endorsed the initiative. "Perhaps the reason 'No on 215' keeps stretching the truthis [because] the campaign has no choice," suggested DaveFratello of Californians for Medical Rights. "Theentire campaign is predicated on a falsehood -- the notion thatmarijuana has no medical value. This is proved wrong by theexperience[s] of tens of thousands of patients, nurses, anddoctors across California, many of whom support Proposition215."

Michigan City Residents Vote "No"To Local Measure To Decriminalize Marijuana August 7, 1996: Traverse City, MI: Local residents rejected a city ballot proposal that would havemade possession, use, or sale of less than one ounce of marijuanain Traverse City punishable by a maximum penalty of $100 and upto ten hours community service for a first-time offender by a 58to 42 percent vote. The measure had been introduced by thelocal chapter of NORML. Despite the outcome, Traverse City NORML President Bill Bustanceremained optimistic. "The 42 percent [in favor ofdecriminalization] was better than anyone ever expected us todo," explained Bustance. "Forty two percent ofTraverse City residents were ready to repent for the sins ofAmerica's drug war." Bustance further added that he believes the city government usedfederal finds to sway Traverse City voters' decisions on theinitiative, a felony offense in Michigan. Bustance told NORMLthat he will file a complaint with the secretary of state inhopes of getting the initiative back on the city ballot. Prior to the August 6 primary, the Traverse City Commission hadunanimously passed a resolution encouraging residents to voteagainst the initiative.

Scottish Senior Judge Says CannabisDecriminalization Should Be Considered August 1996, Scotland: One ofScotland's most senior judges, Lord McLuskey, has sharply criticizeda federal "white paper" calling for enhanced anti-drugpenalties. In addition, the former solicitor general statedthat there needs to be an open debate on the issue ofdecriminalizing cannabis. "The people who advocate the decriminalization of cannabisneed to be listened to and not condemned," he said. "Open debate is not only healthy, it is essential." In a nine page response to the June "white paper,"McLuskey maintained that current prohibition ostracizes a largepercentage of the younger generation and encourages disrespectfor the law overall. "A particular problem for thecriminal justice system is that, if the law continues to treatall use of scheduled drugs [other than on prescription] ascriminal abuse, it will further alienate and criminalize largenumbers of younger people who regard the use of certain drugs insensible quantities and settings as providing enjoyment withoutsignificantly threatening their health," McLuskeywrote. "Alienating large numbers of people by makingthem into undetected offenders against criminal law greatlyweakens the criminal justice system." McLuskey also argued that marijuana has medicinal value andcontested the prohibitionist belief that any use of an illicitsubstance "must be an abuse." "The sentiments and concerns of Lord McLuskey greatly echothose of NORML and the testimony we presented this yearbefore Congress," stated NORML Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. McLuskey has sat in the House of Lords for 20 years. Small Town Mayor Indicted On MarijuanaCharges After Allegedly Growing Marijuana For "Educational"Purposes August, 1996, Copperhill, TN: Copperhill Mayor Janelle Kimsey has been indicted by a grand juryon marijuana possession charges after police discovered 10marijuana plants growing on the deck of her home. Kimseyturned herself in to authorities following her arraignment andwas later released on $500 cash bond. Kimsey's legal problems began last June when 10 marijuana plantswere found growing on her front porch. At the time, Kimseyalleged that she was growing the marijuana for"educational" purposes. "We made a drug busta couple of months ago, and citizens wanted to know what [marijuana]looked like," she explained shortly after theincident. "Dumb me, I didn't know I couldn't doit. I know ignorance is no excuse, but in my case, it wasignorance." Authorities are not buying the mayor's claim and have set a trialdate for September 20. However, some citizens are criticalthat Kimsey is only being charged with simple possession -- a misdemeanor-- rather than cultivation. According to Shari Taylor, assistant district attorney for the10th Judicial District, the 10 plants possessed by Kimsey"came to less than one-half ounce" (14 grams) whenweighed all together and did not merit felony charges. However, according to federal sentencing guidelines, one marijuanaplant is presumed to weigh 100 grams. "Apparently,there exists one set of marijuana plant-weight ratios forpoliticians and another set for the rest of America,"commented NORML Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. Kimsey is due back in court on September 16 for a status hearing. -END- MORE THAN 10 MILLIONMARIJUANA ARRESTS SINCE 1965 ... ANOTHER EVERY 65 SECONDS!

August 8, 1996 San Francisco Buyers' Club Raided, Closed ByState Authorities August 5, 1996, San Francisco, CA: San Francisco Superior Court Judge William Cahill granted atemporary injunction on August 5 to close down the San FranciscoCannabis Buyers' Club. The club -- the largest ofapproximately 30 underground clubs located across the nation that suppliesmarijuana as a therapeutic agent to patients who possess adoctor's recommendation -- provided relief for an estimated11,000 seriously ill patients throughout the bay area. The injunction was granted following a raid by state narcoticsagents one day earlier. The early morning raid -- whichoccurred without the cooperation of local law enforcement orDistrict Attorney Terence Hallinan -- was ordered by stateAttorney General Dan Lungren, an outspoken opponent of thisyear's state ballot initiative to legalize marijuana for medicaluse (Proposition 215). According to newspaper andeye-witness accounts, the raid took place at 7:30 a.m., a time whenthe club was not serving clients. Armed with a searchwarrant, nearly 100 gun-toting agents broke down the club's frontdoor and seized medical records, at least two computers, 40pounds of marijuana, some documents pertaining to Proposition215, and an undisclosed amount of cash. In addition, fiveother locations associated with the club personnel wereraided. A spokesman for the state Justice Department, SteveTelliano, said that no arrests were made during the morning sweeps,but acknowledged that charges may be filed against some of theclub's organizers at a later date. Many San Francisco leaders expressed both shock and outrage atthe actions of the state narcotics officers. DistrictAttorney Hallinan denounced the raid as a political act byLungren, who has been mentioned as a Republican candidate forVice-President. San Francisco Sheriff Michael Hennessy saidthat he will refuse to enforce the injunction and Mayor WillieBrown stated that he was "dismayed by the Gestapo tacticsdisplayed by [the attorney general.]" In addition,several members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, led byTom Ammiano, expressed support for the legalization of medicinalmarijuana and requested hearings into the raid. Also, theboard passed a resolution calling on the Department of Health todraw up a public health state of emergency declaration formedical marijuana. Some proponents believe that thismeasure could eventually pave the way for the suspension of lawsagainst medical marijuana in San Francisco. "I feel really angry at the way [the attorney general'soffice] did it," Ammiano told the San FranciscoChronicle. "It's the worst kind of politicalopportunism. We could have worked with them. Instead,they chose these storm-trooper tactics." The decision to close the San Francisco Buyers' Club was grantedby Judge Cahill based on affidavits from narcotics officials thatthe club had sold marijuana for non-medical purposes to undercoveragents. In a tape released to the media, club founderDennis Peron was shown selling a quantity of marijuana to anundercover agent for what were alleged to be non-medicalpurposes. The agent was posing as an AIDS patient whowished to provide marijuana to fellow patients in a neighboringcounty. Evidence substantiating additional allegations ofmisconduct against the club, such as the charge that clubstaffers sometimes sold marijuana in excess of that required for personaluse, was not presented during the hearing. "Judge Cahill ordered the club closed, but you cannot closethe spirit of the club," announced Dennis Peron to a crowdof approximately 800 demonstrators who attended a candlelightmarch later that evening. "We'll stay open as [the]headquarters for Proposition 215." The big question now looming for activists on both sides of themedical marijuana issue is how the raid and subsequent shut-downof the Cannabis Buyers' Club will effect California voter's sentimentsin November. While some Californians speculate that thetiming of the raid may have been motivated by political reasons,many marijuana activists forsee the raid as potentially being a catalystto inspire voters to support Proposition 215. "The[actions of the attorney general] prove the need to passProposition 215," said California NORML Coordinator, DaleGieringer, Ph.D. "[He] has made it plain that he notonly opposes the medical use of marijuana, but is also intent on wastingtaxpayer's money enforcing laws against it."

Buyers' Club Raid Spurs Resolution ToDeclare Medical Marijuana Emergency Issue To Be Examined At August 15 Hearing August 5, 1996, San Francisco, CA: In the wake of a state raid on the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers'Club, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors -- led by TomAmmiano -- has passed a resolution asking city health officialsto declare a medical emergency allowing for patients to usemarijuana as a medicine. Ammiano and others believe thatstate laws forbidding the use of marijuana may be circumvented bydeclaring an emergency. San Francisco already has such a programin place regarding needle exchange. The city attorney's office told the San Francisco Chronicle thatit has no legal opinion on the resolution at this time and SandraR. Hernandez, the city's director of health, remained noncommital. State Justice Department spokesman Steve Telliano alleged thatcounty supervisors lack the authority to declare medicalemergencies with the intention of circumventing the law. He explainedthat the needle exchange program is "illegal" despitebeing sanctioned by the city. The San Francisco Department of Health and the city attorney areset to examine the issue at an August 15 hearing.

August 1, 1996 Massachusetts Medical Marijuana ResearchProgram May Breathe New Life From Assembly Measure July 30, 1996: Boston, Massachusetts: A bill (H. 2170) introduced by Rep. Patricia Jehlen (D-Somerville)that would reinvigorate the state marijuana therapeutic researchprogram and eventually provide for a medical necessity legaldefense has passed the Massachusetts state assembly and nowawaits the signature of Gov. William Weld. Sources close toGov. Weld indicate that he will sign the bill into law. As amended by the state legislature, H. 2170 will direct theMassachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to pass rules andregulations within 180 days for the establishment of a marijuanamedical research program. Like many states, Massachusettshad previously adopted legislation allowing for such a program,but had never addressed the issues of funding, regulations, orviable sources for marijuana. "The new law does not solve the problem of the federalgovernment's denial of access to legal marijuana, but it putsMassachusetts on the record as aggressively researching theissues of treatment and supply," said NORML LegalCommittee member Michael Cutler, Esq. "[It] creates pressure for a legal source to becreated," added an aid from Rep. Jehlen's office. "[Itis] a step in the right direction." The measure also provides patients who are certified toparticipate in the program a legal defense against marijuanacharges. This provision was a concession from thelegislation's original intent which would have allowed anypatient with a physician's pre-trial diagnosis of medical necessityto use the defense. Weld expressed concern that the bill~soriginal language was overly broad. The governor has 10 days to either sign or veto the measure. "By enacting this law, [Gov. Weld] will allow attention tothe medicinal needs of patients, whose access to treatment isblocked by the identity of their necessary medicine rather thanby conduct which they can control," summarized Cutler. "For many patients, their use of marijuana enables them tosupport themselves and their families rather than being totallydisabled and publicly supported. For these patients, whorisk arrest and prosecution every day for the crime of desiring anordinary quality of life, this law provides hope for a rationalfuture of doctor-patient therapies free from governmentalinterference."

Update: Welfare Reform Bill AmendmentAltered To Deny Federal Benefits To Those Convicted On Felony DrugCharges Only August 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.: Most recreationalmarijuana smokers will be exempted from the provisions of a lastminute amendment (Samdt. 4935) introduced by Sen. Phil Gram (R-Texas)that denies for life federal assistance-based benefits to allindividuals convicted on felony drug charges. The amendmentis part of Congress' overall welfare reform package. In the measure's original form, the law additionally denied"means-tested" federal benefits for five years foranyone convicted of a marijuana misdemeanor. Possession ofa small amount marijuana is generally treated as a misdemeanor inall 50 states. The initial language was overwhelminglyapproved by the Senate. Gramm's amendment was altered during recent debate in conferencecommittee. As the amendment stands now, it will only applyto future felony drug convictions and states will be able to optout of the program if they enact legislation to do so. President Bill Clinton has agreed to sign the welfare reformpackage into law. "The conference committee has provided relief for somemarijuana smokers by altering Gramm's amendment; however, thisbill still unfairly and inappropriately targets drug users,"noted NORML Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.

California Law Enforcement Must Procure AWarrant Before Using Heat Scanning Devices July 26, 1996, Sacramento, CA: TheCalifornia Supreme Court has let stand a 1st District AppellateCourt decision mandating that state law enforcement officialsmust procure a warrant before conducting thermal imaging searchesof private residences where they suspect drug cultivation may betaking place. The lower court ruling is now binding ontrial courts statewide. Only Justices Marvin Baxter and Ming Chin voted to grant ahearing on the prosecution appeal; four votes are required for ahearing by the seven-member court. "The use of thermal imaging devices can give law enforcementinformation regarding activities taking place inside a residencethat they would not otherwise be privy to without procuring a searchwarrant and entering the house," stated NORML DeputyDirector Allen St. Pierre. "By its very nature, it isan intrusive practice that constitutes an unreasonable searchwithin the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United StatesConstitution. Therefore, it should require a warrant. NORMLapplauds the actions of the California court." In its decision this April, the 1st District Court of Appealslikened the use of thermal imaging to that of electronicallytracking the movement of chemicals inside a home by using abeeper. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1984 (U.S. v.Karo) that a warrant must be attained before law enforcementcan use a beeper. "Like the beeper signal ... the thermal imaging scan of[the] residence told the police something about activities withinthe house which they could not otherwise have learned withoutobtaining a warrant," opined Justice Marc Poche. "PreciseIy because the thermal imaging is indiscriminate in registeringsources of heat, it is an intrusive tool which tells much aboutthe activities inside the home which may be quite unrelated toany illicit activity." "... [Therefore,] we find that society recognizes asreasonable an expectation that the heat generated from within aprivate residence may not be measured by the government without a warrantpermitting such a search."

Update: Partnership For A Drug Free America Agrees To Modify Ad Criticized As "Patently Homophobic" July 29, 1996, New York City, NY: The Partnership for a Drug Free America has agreed to re-edit aseries of anti-heroin public service announcements that had drawnsharp criticism from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance AgainstDefamation (GLAAD). The ad in question featured a teenager named David whose lifeplummets downhill because of an addiction to heroin. The adconcluded with the narrator saying: "And now I have sex withmen for money to support my habit. ... I wish I didn't haveto be like this." GLAAD first voiced opposition to the spot early this monthalleging that the ad "had the potential to exacerbatehigher-than-average risks gay and lesbian youths face forsubstance abuse and suicide by implying that being gay is worsethan being addicted to heroin." At that time, PDFA PresidentRichard Bonette refused GLAAD's request to pull the ad. Recently, however, Bonette has experienced a change ofheart. He now says that the spots will be re-edited to omitthe references to prostitution. "A perception ofoffense, however unintended, [may] dilute or interfere our basicmessage" of keeping adolescents drug free, Bonette recently explainedin a letter to GLAAD. Alan Klein, news media director at GLAAD said, "We're verymuch pleased that the Partnership has taken the concerns of thegay and lesbian community serious."

July 25, 1996 Conservative California Readership StronglySupports Medical Marijuana Initiative July 22, 1996, Sacramento, CA: ACalifornia ballot initiative (Proposition 215) that would permitpatients who have the approval of a licensed physician to usemarijuana for medical purposes received a strong vote ofconfidence from the results of a recent poll conducted by the OrangeCounty Register. Responding to the question: "Doyou think marijuana should be legalized for medicinal use?"readers answered "yes" by nearly a three to onemargin. In all, over 1,100 Californians participated in thepoll, with 73 percent responding that they approved of the use ofmedical marijuana. "The results of the Orange County Register poll arequite significant because of the widely acknowledged conservativepolitical slant of the paper's readership," announced NORMLDeputy Director Allen St. Pierre. "These findings,coupled with the results of similar polls conducted both inCalifornia and nationally, demonstrate that there is amplesupport for the legalization of medical marijuana among bothpolitical conservatives and the general public." The results of the Orange County Register poll are thelatest in a series of polls indicating strong support for medicalmarijuana. A 1995 survey conducted by the American CivilLiberties Union (ACLU) demonstrated that 83 percent of theAmerican public agreed that patients who find marijuana aneffective therapeutic agent should be able to use itlegally. In addition, six California polls -- including oneconducted by the Binder Research Group -- have shown that astrong majority of Californians support medical marijuana.

Welfare Reform Bill Amended To DenyConvicted Drug Users Federal Benefits July 22, 1996, Washington, D.C.: Anamendment introduced by Senator Phil Gramm (R-Texas) that woulddeny federal assistance-based benefits to those individualsconvicted of drug offenses -- including marijuana misdemeanors --has been overwhelmingly approved by the Senate. Theamendment is part of an overall welfare reform package (S. 1956)that is currently in conference committee and is expected to besent to the president's desk shortly. It is not yet knownif Clinton will sign the bill. The amendment proposed by Gramm would deny for five years all"means-tested" federal benefits, including programssuch as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps, and student loans, to any individualwho is found guilty of a minor drug offense. Those foundguilty of drug felonies would be ineligible for life. "If we're serious about our [anti-]drug laws, we ought notto give people welfare benefits who are violating the nation'sdrug laws," said Gramm. Gramm's amendment struck a chord with some congressmen, includingSen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) who voiced strong opposition to themeasure. "Under this amendment, if you are a murderer, arapist, or a robber, you can get federal funds; but if you areconvicted even for possession of marijuana, you cannot," hesaid. "[This amendment] would undermine the whole notionof providing drug treatment as an alternative sentence to afirst-time drug offender if the individual requires federalassistance to obtain the treatment. ... It is overly broadand is strongly opposed by [both] the [Conference of] Mayors andthe National League of Cities." "Over 10 million individuals have been arrested onmarijuana-related charges since 1965 with nearly one-half millionarrested in 1994 alone," stated NORML Deputy Director AllenSt. Pierre. "This amendment could potentially makemillions of otherwise law abiding Americans ineligible for federalbenefits and is yet one more example of how our nation's alleged'War on Drugs' is nothing more than a war on marijuanasmokers." The amendment passed by a 75 to 25 vote. For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre of NORML@ (202) 483-5500. Thousands Expected To Gather On WashingtonState Capitol In Support Of Marijuana Legalization July 1996, Olympia, WA: Washingtonstate marijuana law reform proponents are anticipating a crowd ofthousands to gather on the front steps of the Washington statecapitol for the first ever Hemp Education Day on August 5. In past years, marijuana reform events such as the SeattleHempfest have drawn crowds in excess of 20,000 people. Organizersof the upcoming festival are hoping to harness the popularity ofpast gatherings and transform the Washington hemp reform movementinto a strong political force. "We are aware that in the current political climate, youcan't even discuss [the] issue [of marijuana law reform] publiclyor privately without being singled out in the media as ...'pro-drug,'" stated event organizer Gideon Israel. "We must use this opportunity to open up a forum for truth andfree expression on this matter. ... Hemp Education Day willprovide a soapbox for the people of Washington state, lawmakers,and other citizens to educate and be educated [about]marijuana." Activists scheduled to speak at the rally include NORML LegalCommittee member Jeffrey Steinborn, Esq., Hemp BC owner MarcEmery, author Jack Herer, Don Wirtshafter of the Ohio Hempery,medical marijuana patient Ralph Seeley, and others. Thegathering is planned to take place from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information on Hemp Education Day, please call (360)459-9107. Anti-Drug Ad Called Homophobic By GayWatchdog Group July 1996, New York, NY: A recentpublic service announcement produced by the Partnership for aDrug Free America (PDFA) has been branded homophobic by the Gayand Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), a media watchdogorganization based in New York City. The ad, scheduled to air nationwide this month, depicts ateenager named David whose life plummets downhill because of anaddiction to heroin. The ad concludes with the narratorsaying, "And now I have sex with men for money, to supportmy habit. ... I wish I didn't have to be like this." According to GLAAD, the ad suggests that drug use ultimatelyleads males to engage in homosexual sex and portrayshomosexuality as a social ill more severe than drug use. "The spot sends a misguided message to America's youngpeople and specifically to lesbian and gay youth," statedGLAAD managing director William Waybourn. "The ad hasthe potential to exacerbate higher-than-average risks gay andlesbian youths face for substance abuse and suicide by implyingthat being gay is worse than being addicted to heroin." Although GLAAD has voiced their objections about the PSA to thePartnership, PDFA President Richard Bonette responded that hewill not pull the ad. "While I appreciate your concerns, I simply disagree withyour perspective and, therefore, cannot honor your request toremove 'David' from distribution," said Bonette. -END- MORE THAN 10 MILLIONMARIJUANA ARRESTS SINCE 1965 ...

The endorsementstemmed from a USA Today editorial entitled"Anti-drug focus keeps marijuana from the ill" and camejust two days after the newspaper featured a major article on aCalifornia ballot initiative that would allow seriously ill patientsto use marijuana as a therapeutic agent with a doctor'srecommendation. Calling marijuana "one of the least toxic medical compoundsin the world," the editorial cited both marijuana's relativesafety when compared to other legal drugs and medicines anddecades of scientific and anecdotal research maintaining itsmedical efficacy. "It is entirely possible to fight the drug war withoutharming innocent civilians in the process," concluded the USAToday. "But lawmakers must be careful to choose theright battles. Therapeutic marijuana isn't one ofthem." "The statements made by USA Today in support ofmedical access to therapeutic marijuana should have a positiveimpact on America's views toward this issue and may translateinto a significant number of votes among California citizens infavor of the Medical Marijuana Initiative," stated NORMLDeputy Director Allen St. Pierre.

NORML Chapter Places Advertising BillboardsOn Buses July 11, 1996, Cleveland, OH: Several buses of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authoritywill start promoting marijuana law reform thanks to the work ofdedicated local activists. After a year long struggle, theNorthcoast NORML chapter has paid for a three month advertising campaignto run on the inside and outside of RTA buses. Northcoast NORML first approached the RTA with their advertisingcampaign in 1995 at which time the RTA denied the chapter'srequest because they claimed the public service announcementswould promote the illegal use of marijuana. NorthcoastNORML refused to accept the RTA's reasoning and brought the issueto the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ofOhio. After several correspondences between the ACLU andRTA's legal staff, the RTA conceded that NORML's ad was notpromoting marijuana use and was political in nature. According to Northcoast NORML president John Hartman, thechapter's billboards carry two basic messages. Theannouncement appearing on the tailgate of buses emphasizes the 10 million-plusmarijuana arrests that have occurred since 1965 while thebillboard displayed on the inside reads: "If you don't careabout the people sent to prison for smoking marijuana, at least considerwho gets released to make room for them." Hartman addsthat the RTA will soon begin displaying prohibitionist billboardsto counter Northcoast NORML's message. Northcoast NORML's billboards began running on area buses thisweek.

Man Sentenced To Probation After Killing Individual He Suspected Sold His Son Marijuana July 1996, Hartsville, TN: A fatherwas given three year's probation after pleading guilty to killingthe man he suspected of selling marijuana to his teenageson. The defendant, Dennis Denham, had been indicted forsecond degree murder. Emotions ran high for participants on both sides of thecase. At one point, the shooting victim's mother told thecourt that the defendant could see his children, but added that,"[She has] to go to the cemetery to see [hers.]" Denham apparently blamed the man for injuries his son sustainedin an auto accident while allegedly driving under the influenceof marijuana. "Have we demonized marijuana consumers in this country tosuch a point that we allow citizens to murder them and get awaywith it?" questioned NORML Deputy Director Allen St.Pierre. Law That Allows Citizens To Sue Drug DealersFor Damages Moves Forward In California July 1996, Sacramento, CA: TheCalifornia state Senate has unanimously approved a sweeping bill(S.B. 1754) that would allow private parties to sue drug dealersfor damages even if the defendant had nothing to do with thespecific drugs or incident that caused the damage. Under the Drug Dealer Liability Act, introduced by Sen. CharlesCalderon (D-Whittier) and co-sponsored by Attorney General DanLungren, drug dealers could be sued in civil court for any damagescaused by the same kind of drug elsewhere in the same city orcounty, regardless of who actually furnished it, using a radical,new "market participation" liability doctrine. For example, under the provisions of a similar law in Michigan,dealers who can be shown to have sold 650 grams of a controlledsubstance are liable for injuries throughout the state, whilethose who sold less than 50 grams can be held liable for injuriesin the county where the sales occurred. Those allowed to sue under the California proposal would include:parents or family members of users; employers of users; medicalfacilities, insurers, or other institutions that fund drug treatmentprograms; individuals exposed in utero to an illegal substance;and persons injured as a result of the willful, reckless, ornegligent actions of an individual substance user. "It's a way of fighting [drug dealers] by hitting them rightin the pocket," said actor Carroll O'Connor, who has lobbiedfor the measure. Defendants could be sued if they (1) provided the drug or (2) had"as a pattern" participated in the market for that drugwithin the same city or county. The latter is defined tomean that they provided the same illicit drug on at least twoinstances, with at least one conviction. Cultivation of under25 marijuana plants would not count as an offense. "When is enough enough?" asked Mark Kappelhoff,legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)in Washington, D.C., in a recent Wall Street Journalarticle. Kappelhoff maintained that adding civil judgmentsto criminal prosecution and civil forfeiture could be tantamountto constitutionally cruel or unusual punishment or doublejeopardy. The California state assembly is expected to approve the measureby the end of August. For more information, please contact Dale Gieringer ofCalifornia NORML @ (415) 563-5858.

July 11, 1996 Update: Teacher Under Fire For HempPresentation July 2, 1996, Simpsonville, KY: Donna Cockrel, the fifth grade school teacher who brought Hollywoodactor and hemp businessman Woody Harrelson to her class todiscuss industrial hemp approximately one month ago, is underfire from both parents and school officials who have voiced strongopposition to her actions. Recently, the award-winningteacher was informed by the Simpsonville Elementary School Boardthat she is being investigated because of complaints that followedHarrelson's visit. Audrey Yeager, the DARE officer for the Shelby County Sheriff'sOffice, was one of Cockrel's most outspoken critics. "Everybody says hemp and marijuana are not the same thing,but they are; they're both illegal and it was being promoted to10 and 11-year-old kids," she told camera crews from thetelevision show "American Journal." "I amterribly against it." Despite the criticism, Cockrel adamantly defended her actions andmaintained that Harrelson's presentation related directly to hercurriculum. "I still believe what I did in theclassroom was positive," said Cockrel who participates in astate program known as Environment in the Classroom. Shesaid that industrial hemp, as well as kenaf, soybeans and otheralternatives to growing tobacco are frequently discussed in herclass. "I believe in myself. My students believein me. If I'm not allowed to teach the truth to students,I'd rather quit teaching." Cockrel further added that she believed Harrelson -- who wasadorned in hemp clothing for the occasion -- was just"showing what a product could be, not promoting it." Shelby County School Superintendent Leon Mooneyhand acknowledgedthat Cockrel is being investigated, but failed to indicate howlong the investigation may take. "I am looking intothe matter as I would follow up on any matter that got this levelof concern by staff, parents, and community." Mooneyhand was reluctant to speculate about what sanctions, ifany, may be taken against Cockrel, but said that her job was notin jeopardy. In the past, Cockrel has been recognized and awarded forenthusiasm in the classroom. In a 1992 magazine article,The New York Times called her "a dynamo [with] ...boundless energy who's geared toward change." Harrelson, who is an ardent proponent of industrial hemp and ispart owner of a California company that specializes in hemp-basedclothing, was in town to speak at an international conference onindustrial hemp in Lexington. He was arrested in Kentuckytwo days after speaking to Cockrel's class for planting fourseeds of industrial hemp in an orchestrated protest to bring attentionto the differences between hemp and marijuana.

High Court Strikes Down Pennsylvania Rulings Requiring 'Exigent Circumstances' To Justify Warrantless SearchesOf Automobiles July 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.: In adecision that has drawn criticism from civil libertarians, theUnited States Supreme Court has ruled in a Per Curiamdecision that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was incorrect inrequiring police to obtain a warrant before searching an automobileunless "exigent circumstances" were present. In two separate cases, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court suppressedevidence uncovered in warrantless automotive searches because the"Commonwealth's jurisprudence of the automobile exceptionhas long required both the existence of probable cause and thepresence of exigent circumstances to justify a warrantlesssearch." The court maintained that the police hadsufficient time in both cases to secure a warrant. Therefore, they held that, "The warrantless search of [a] stationaryvehicle violated constitutional guarantees." The United States Supreme Court concluded that Pennsylvania'sinterpretation of the "automobile exception of the FourthAmendment's warrant requirement" was incorrect. Thecourt maintains that an automobile's "ready mobility"is a sufficient circumstance to excuse failure to obtain a searchwarrant once probable cause has been established. Inaddition, "the individual [has a] reduced expectation ofprivacy in an automobile, owing to its pervasiveregulation." Therefore, the court affirmed that,"If a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists tobelieve it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment thus permitspolice to search a vehicle without more." "Essentially, the court has stripped Pennsylvanians of theirstate constitutional guarantees that provide local citizens withgreater protections against warrantless searches of theirautomobiles unless both probable cause and unforeseencircumstances are present," said NORML Deputy DirectorAllen St. Pierre. "In it's never-ending fight toassist in the 'War on Drugs,' the Supreme Court has trampled overcivil liberties mandated by Pennsylvania's own stateconstitution." Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Ginsburg dissented on thebasis that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction over the twocases. "A fair reading of [both cases] demonstratesthat the [Pennsylvania Supreme Court's] judgement almostcertainly rested upon [an] ... independent consideration of itsown Constitution," Stevens wrote. Consequently,"there is no reason for this court to disturb the statecourt's findings." The cases are cited as Pennsylvania v. Edwin Labron andPennsylvania v Randy Lee Kilgore. Washington Activists Gear Up For NovemberElection July 1996, Seattle WA: Organizers ofthe annual Seattle HempFest -- one of the largest marijuana lawreform rallies in the country -- have announced plans to embarkon a mission to transform the Washington state hemp movement intoa political force.

July 3, 1996 License Suspension In Drug Cases Upheld ByOhio Supreme Court July 1996, Columbus, OH: Ohio'shighest court upheld legislation that imposes a mandatory licensesuspension against individuals convicted of drug crimes,regardless of whether the offense is driving related. In a unanimous opinion, the Ohio Supreme Court declared that thepenalty did not violate the due process or equal protectionamendments of the Ohio or United States constitutions. Writing the opinion for the court, Justice Francis Sweeneydeclared: "All drug offenders are treated equally underthese statutes. The laws simply impose a penalty on personswho have been convicted of a drug crime." "... These laws serve to punish drug offenders, to deter thefuture use of drugs, and to protect the health and welfare ofsociety." The opinion upheld the 2nd District Ohio Court of Appeals in 33cases which were consolidated after a lower court refused tosuspend licenses. "Laws passed by virtue of police power will be upheld ifthey bear a real and substantial relation to the objective soughtto be obtained, namely the health, safety, morals or generalwelfare of the public, and are not arbitrary, discriminatory,capricious or unreasonable," the court summarized. The court did not address the question of whether the suspensionconstituted "double jeopardy" because it was a secondpunishment for a single criminal action. Earlier this year,the Iowa Supreme Court struck down similar license suspensionlegislation because it found "no direct connection betweenthe possession of controlled substances, driving, and publicsafety." Therefore, the court ruled that, "Theamended statute authorizing ... license revocation was aimed essentiallyat enhancing punishment for controlled substancepossession."

American Farm Bureau Pens Article In SupportOf Hemp June 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.: Callingit "one of the most promising crops in half a century,"a recent issue of Farm Bureau News sings the praises of the hempplant. The publication is the weekly newspaper of theAmerican Farm Bureau Federation -- the largest farming organizationin the United States. Written by Debora Hood, the article declares that,"Legislation is needed to establish a recognized researcharea for [hemp,] according to local, state and federalregulations." It explores the potential economicviability domestic hemp cultivation holds for the Americanfarmers and criticizes the Drug Enforcement Administration's rolein killing a Colorado bill that would have allowed the state togrow test plots for research purposes. The essay alsorecounts hemp's long and prosperous history as an agriculturalcommodity. Also included is an editorial by Bob Winter, president of theWeld County Farm Bureau in Colorado. Winter worked closelywith hemp activists earlier this year and offered five acres ofhis land for the proposed state test plot. "Industrialhemp provides a window of opportunity for U.S. agriculturalproducers to take advantage of a highly profitable fiber crop[with] many uses ...," he writes. "International trade agreements (e.g., GATT and NAFTA)recognize the designation of 0.3 percent ... THC as thedistinction between industrial hemp and marijuana. [Yet,]current U.S. law[s] do not differentiate between hemp andmarijuana. Thanks to these laws, the United States lags behindother world powers in hemp production and must import raw hemppulp for manufacture here. [In addition,] U.S. farmers areprohibited from growing a highly profitable crop without governmentsubsidy." The American Farm Bureau Federation passed a resolution at itsannual convention in January calling for research into theviability of economic potential of industrial hemp production inthe United States.

If passed, the bill would allow doctors toprescribe marijuana to individuals suffering from "glaucoma,AIDS wasting syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spasticdisorders including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, andquadriplegia, or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapyor radiology." Presently, only eight patients areallowed to receive marijuana legally from the federal government. The effectiveness of medicinal marijuana has been endorsed by anumber of scientific and medical associations including theAmerican Public Health Association, the Federation of American Scientists,the Australian Commonwealth Department of Human Services andHealth, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National NursesSociety on Addiction.

June 27, 1996 American Medical Association Shelves ReportDrafted By NORML Board Member 'Harm Reduction' Placed On Back Burner For Now June 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.: Areport drafted by NORML board member and New York MedicalSchool Professor John P. Morgan, M.D. for the American MedicalAssociation has been put on hold after objections were raised byseveral prominent medical groups regarding the paper'scontent. Specifically, certain doctors were uncomfortablewith Morgan's recommendations that marijuana be legalized andthat "use, possession and low- level sales of allpsycho-active drugs should be a subject of police action onlywhen these activities are associated with a disruption of publicorder." Dr. John Ambre, director of the AMA's Office of MedicalInformation Services, told reporters that he recruited Morgan todraft a report for the AMA, but would not divulge any information regardingthe paper's contents or prospects. Morgan said that he was contacted by the AMA's House of Delegatesrequesting a report on the subject of "harm reduction"-- a policy commonly defined as helping drug users minimize the dangersto themselves without mandating that they stop using drugs. "It struck most of us that the biggest harm reduction wecould see would be to stop putting people in jail [for druguse,]" Morgan explained. Morgan was assisted by fellow NORMLboard member Lynn Zimmer, Ph.D. of Queens College in New York,and Ethan Nadelmann, Ph.D. of the Lindesmith Center. Although Morgan maintains that the reaction within the AMA to hisproposals was largely favorable, the issue of harm reduction wasabsent from the association's agenda during it's annual meetingin Chicago. Mark Stuart, a spokesman for the AMA told reporters that heexpected a revised version of the report to be submitted at theorganization's interim meeting in December.

Canadian Marijuana Reform Debate Yields FewResults June 24, 1996, Ottawa, Canada: Ongoing debates regarding the possibility of marijuana decriminalizationin Canada yielded few tangible results as the Standing SenateCommittee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended nosignificant changes be made to the Controlled Drugs andSubstances Act (bill C-8). This legislation is intended toreplace the Narcotic Control Act and, according to many Canadianactivists, will greatly expand the reach of Canada's illicit druglaws. Bill C-8 will become law when an Order in Council ispassed later this year. The Senate Committee's recommendation shocked many who noted thatseveral of its members had publicly stated that they supportedthe decriminalization of marijuana. In attempt to explainthe Senate's last minute flip-flop, Committee Chair SenatorSharon Carstairs told the Montreal Gazette that thecommittee members were serious about decriminalization, but feltthat such a recommendation would be politically futile at thispoint. "The majority of the Senators -- and I was withthem -- felt all the evidence indicated decriminalization forsimple possession [of marijuana] is the way we should begoing," she reaffirmed. However, Carstairs said thatmany committee members believed such a proposal would violateseveral international treaties that Canada has signed and wouldhave been struck down by the House of Commons. If there is to be any relief for the cannabis community after thelatest round of political debate, it may come by way of anapproved amendment by Liberal Senator Lorna Milne that exempts "maturehemp stock" from the definition of marijuana. Althoughhemp industry proponents note that the passage of the amendmentdoes little to open the door to allow for the widespread cultivationof hemp for commercial purposes, it does remove some of theregulatory restraints (e.g., licensing) that are currently inplace regarding hemp fiber and products. "For Canadato develop hemp as an agricultural crop, the mature hemp stalkand the valuable fibre (sic) acquired from it must be free fromover-regulation," Milne explained. "Without theamendment, the stalks, fibre (sic) and fibre (sic) productsderived from them such as paper, would continue to be treated as thoughthey were narcotic substances, simply due to the definition ofthe bill." A staff member for Senator Milne informed NORML that hebelieves the Canadian government intends to draft a proposal toallow farmers to grow hemp for commercial purposes, but manyCanadian activists feel that such legislation is still a long wayoff. Currently, tests plots of industrial hemp are grown inCanada under strict regulation for research purposes.

Supreme Court Upholds Civil Forfeiture InDrug Cases June 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.: TheUnited States Supreme Court ruled that the government may bothprosecute individuals on drug charges for criminal violations andseize their property without violating constitutional protectionsagainst double jeopardy. Writing the decision for the court, Justice William Rehnquistwrote that, "We hold that these ... civil forfeitures areneither punishment nor criminal for the purposes of doublejeopardy." Rather, Rehnquist defined forfeitures asremedial civil sanctions. Ironically, the high court hasruled in earlier cases that fines and tax stamps on illicit drugsmay, in some circumstances, constitute punishment under the lawand are applicable to double jeopardy. The court further maintained that Congress had intendedforfeiture to be a civil act and noted that, "Requiring theforfeiture of property ... ensures that [owners] will not permitthat property to be used for illegal purposes." Theopinion added that the court has a long history of upholding forfeitureas constitutional, although many of the cases cited involvedeither contraband (e.g., unlicensed firearms, pirated goods,etc.) or property that was integrally involved in the commission ofa crime. This latter point led lone dissenting Justice JohnPaul Stevens to write, "There is simply no rational basisfor characterizing the seizure of [a] ... home as anything otherthan punishment for [a] crime. The house was neitherproceeds nor contraband and its value had no relation to the government'sauthority to seize it." "During oral arguments [during which I was present,] severaljustices found the government's argument intellectuallyincoherent," explained NORML Legal Committee MemberJeffrey Steinborn. "In the opinion, they accept thegovernment's theory. [Therefore,] we can expect the SupremeCourt to continue to indulge the government and we can expect thegovernment to indulge in runaway forfeiture." According to government statistics, the Justice Departmentcollected nearly $550 million in assets from civil forfeiture in1994. Approximately $235 million went directly to state andlocal law enforcement agencies.

Entitled "RealityCheck," the campaign is being launched primarily in responseto recent evidence of rising teen marijuana use. "Today, too many teenagers think marijuana won't harm theirhealth or ruin their lives," HHS Secretary Donna Shalalatold the crowd at the 100th Annual National PTA Convention in Washington,D.C. "We want to help [parents] send a clear messageto their children that drugs are illegal, dangerous andwrong." At the focus of the campaign are two publications that explain toparents the best way to speak with their children about illicitsubstances and encourage them to remain drug free. One section of thebooklet Keeping Youth Drug Free even advises parents howto answer questions from their children regarding their past useof marijuana. "Many people my age ... tried marijuana,... but we didn't know as much about it as we do now," thepamphlet recommends parents explain. "I tried it [a]couple times because friends of mine were doing it. Andthen I stopped because I decided it just wasn't a good thing todo." "As long as the federal government continues to lump thealleged dangers of marijuana alongside the harm caused by otherillicit drugs such as crack and heroin, any campaign hoping to 'educate'children about the risks of using marijuana will be onlyminimally effective," stated NORML Deputy DirectorAllen St. Pierre. NORML maintains that cannabisconsumption should be limited to adults only. For a free copy of the "Reality Check" kit, pleasecall SAMSHA Center for Substance Abuse Prevention @ (800)767-0117. California High Court Rules That Judges Are Not Mandated To Impose 'Three Strikes' Law June 20, 1996, San Francisco, CA: Ina ruling that may affect an estimated 16,000 inmates, theCalifornia Supreme Court decided that judges are not required toimpose mandatory prison sentences of 25 years to life on repeatoffenders if they feel such a sentence is overly cruel. The unanimousdecision, which has drawn praise from many civil libertarians andharsh criticism from Governor Pete Wilson, is retroactive andcould potentially reduce the sentences of individuals who weregiven stiffer prison terms under the 1994 "threestrikes" law. "The mindless and inexorable demand for a life sentence forminor offenses has become a bit more mindful," said VincentSchiraldi, executive director of the Center on Juvenile andCriminal Justice. "Because this decision was unanimous and from a conservativecourt, other courts [across the nation] may look to this opinionas challenges arise to their own laws," added Eric Sterlingof the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation. The court's decision stemmed from a San Diego case in which arepeat offender was charged with possessing a small amount ofcocaine. Feeling that the mandatory sentence was an unfit punishmentfor the crime, the judge moved to strike the defendant's previousconvictions so he could plea bargain. The prosecutor in thecase objected, maintaining that under the "threestrikes" legislation, the judge lacked the right. The ruling maintained that denying judges their traditionaldiscretion over sentencing violates the separation of powersguaranteed in the state Constitution. The court assertedthat their decision did not spell the end of "threestrikes" law, but merely returned the customary power ofjudicial discretion back to the judges. Following the court's decision, Gov. Wilson -- an ardentproponent of mandatory sentencing -- pledged to find a way tobypass the court's ruling with either a referendum or byintroducing similar legislation. However, legal scholarsbelieve that the court will strike these measures down as well. "Those who repeatedly assault our citizens ... must pay asever price for their crimes," Wilson said. "Iintend to keep faith with the people of California who have everyright to demand protection against career criminals andpredators."

Florida To Adopt Standards Regarding HairTesting June 1996, Tallahassee, FL: A bill(SB 518) amending drug testing laws to specifically establishstandards and procedures regarding the use of hair specimens indrug testing has become law in Florida. The measure passedwithout the governor's signature and makes Florida the first statein the nation to explicitly address and endorse the use of hairsamples to test for illegal drug use. Proponents of the measure argue that the testing procedure offerssignificant advantages over urinalysis. Specifically,backers of the procedure maintain that hair testing givesemployers a longer window of detection -- commonly allowingemployers to determine drug use that took place several monthsearlier. Proponents also maintain that hair tests are muchmore difficult to beat than is urinalysis. However, critics of the use of hair specimens in drug testingassert that the procedure has major flaws. For one, recentstudies indicate that the hair of African-American males maycollect nearly eight times as much drugs as either femaleAfrican-Americans or Caucasians. These findings indicatethe potential for racial and sexual bias in hair testing, criticswarn. In addition, hair testing remains a new technologythat many feel is still in need of further scientific evaluation."Hair analysis for the presence of drugs is unproven [and]unsupported by scientific literature or controlled trials," saidFood and Drug Administration (FDA) spokeswoman Sharon Snider in a1995 Providence Journal interview. Despite the procedures recent recognition in Florida, hairtesting on a national basis has yet to receive the same level oftechnical and legal acceptance that has been accorded tourinalysis drug testing and many courts will not accept thefindings of hair testing alone as a positive indication of druguse.

June 20, 1996 University Of MississippiDenies Assertion Of California Narcotics Officers Researcher Calls Claim Of Over 10,000 Studies Documenting TheHarmful Effects Of Marijuana Groundless June 12, 1996, University of Mississippi: A recent claim made by The California Narcotics OfficersAssociation (CNOA) that there are over 10,000 studies documentingthe harmfulness of marijuana has been flatly denied by Universityof Mississippi Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences. For the past 25 years, the Research Institute of PharmaceuticalSciences has been collecting national and international technicalresearch papers on marijuana. The organization is regardedas the most comprehensive federal source of such informationavailable. The CNOA allegation recently appeared in a positionpaper denouncing the use of marijuana as a medicine and has beenespoused by various other prohibitionist organizations. However, in response to an inquiry by Harvard Professor and NORMLboard member Lester Grinspoon, M.D., Research Associate BeverlyUrbanek said that the University of Mississippi "is totallyin the dark as to where the statement that there are 10,000studies showing the negative impact of marijuana could have originated." Urbanek attests that the Research Institute does possess abibliography which includes over 12,000 citations to marijuana,but notes that the total number also includes "papers on the chemistryand botany of the Cannabis plant, cultivation, epidemiologicalsurveys, legal aspects, eradication studies, detection, storage,economic aspects and a whole spectrum of others that do notmention positive or negative effects." In conclusion, Urbanek states the following: "We arefrequently contacted by various individuals and groups requestingthe current number of publications that we have listed in themarijuana bibliography, and we readily give out thatinformation. ... However, we have never broken down thatfigure into positive/negative papers, and I would not evenventure a guess as to what that number would be."

DEA Agent Specializes In Stopping MedicalMarijuana Efforts June 1996, Reading, MA: DEA agentSteve Morealle says his current duty is "...to travel the countryto stop proposed state-level medical marijuanalegislation...," according to statements made in the Marchedition of Libertarian Party News. Morealle is the sameagent who fell under fire last winter from civil rightsproponents for his participation in a rally held outside theoffices of Boston radio station WBCN to protest the airplay ofthe NORML benefit CD, Hempilation. In response to Morealle's self-proclaimed job description,Mass/Cann President Bill Downing sent letters to MassachusettsAttorney General Scott Harshbarger, the Massachusetts ACLU, and CongressmanBarney Frank addressing the potential improper use of federalmoney and authority. Frank has previously engaged incorrespondence with United States Attorney General Janet Reno andDEA Administrator Thomas Constantine over Morealle's actionsduring the Hempilation protest. "The fact that the DEA is using America's tax dollars tofund efforts to effectively suppress any public discourseregarding medical marijuana that differs from their belief thatmarijuana has no acceptable medical use is highly offensive, ifnot illegal," stated NORML Deputy Director Allen St.Pierre. Morealle also stated that he is employed to appear at publicforums to counter individuals and organizations that the DEAconsiders to be leading advocates of marijuanadecriminalization. Morealle said that NORML is themain force his organization must counter. "I'm touched that the DEA feels they must employ specialagents to counter NORML's position," said St.Pierre.

Conference Gathers Experts To ExploreMarijuana's Medicinal Value June 16, 1996, Dennis, Massachusetts: Scientists and medical experts from around the world recentlygathered at a conference to learn more about marijuana's variousmedicinal properties. It is the belief of the attendeesthat chemical compounds found in marijuana promise to ease thesymptoms of glaucoma, the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS,spastic disorders, the nausea associated with cancerchemotherapy, arthritis -- and most dramatically -- severe brain injury. While both NORML and a variety of scientific researchershave endorsed cannabis' therapeutic properties for several years,the possibility that marijuana may have medical utility in the treatmentof head trauma is a relatively new concept. Esther Shohami, a senior lecturer in the department ofpharmacology at Hebrew University in Israel, stated that animaland other tests of a synthetic compound called Dexanabinol seemto reduce the impact of brain trauma, such as that suffered incar accidents. Shohami said that less paralysis and memorydamage occurs if patients are administered the cannabinoidcompound. The patient's improvement is "notmarginal. It's significant," she asserted. Conference speakers also addressed the effectiveness of Marinol-- a THC-based synthetic drug occasionally prescribed for easingnausea in cancer patients. Many researchers noted that wholecannabis could be more effective than Marinol because thereexists many medicinal properties in cannabis other than THC. Two members of NORML's Board of Directors, Dr. John P.Morgan of CUNY Medical School and Dr. Lynn Zimmer of QueensCollege in New York attended the symposium.

June 13, 1996 Medical Marijuana Initiative Qualifies ForNovember Ballot June 6, 1996, Sacramento, CA: California's Medical Marijuana Initiative has qualified for the Novembergeneral election. The Secretary of State's office inSacramento certified the initiative measure which will allowCalifornia voters the opportunity to legalize marijuana formedical use. The initiative, which gathered 775,000 signatures to qualify forballot access, provides that "patients or definedcaregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medicaltreatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from generalprovisions of law which otherwise prohibit possession orcultivation of marijuana." It also provides that"physicians shall not be punished or denied any right orprivilege for recommending marijuana to a patient for medicalpurposes." This measure will not legalize or otherwise change existing lawagainst use, sale, or possession of marijuana for recreationaluse, proponents note. It will prevent the criminalprosecution of those patients who have a legitimate medical needto use marijuana. Although more research is needed, it is clear from both availablestudies and rapidly accumulating anecdotal evidence thatmarijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and suffering for patientswith a number of serious ailments including cancer, spasticdisorders, glaucoma, and the appetite loss associated with thewasting syndrome of AIDS. "This proposition would not have been necessary if Gov.[Pete] Wilson had not vetoed S.B. 1364 in 1994 and A.B. 1529 in1995," said longtime marijuana activist Dennis Peron,referring to two prior medical marijuana bills that were passedby the California legislature. "This whole issue ismore about compassion than marijuana. I think it's time tolet doctor's decide, not politicians."

Victorian Politicians Reject MarijuanaDecriminalization June 12, 1996, Victoria, Australia: Victorian politicians failed to endorse one of the chief recommendationsof Professor David Pennington -- head of Premiere Jeff Kennett'sadvisory council on drug reform -- who concluded that thedecriminalization of marijuana for cultivation and personal usewould be an effective step in steering individuals away from harddrugs. Just prior to the Kennett Government's decision,Pennington had warned Parliament that the implementation of thecouncil's findings without marijuana decriminalization would be"very much a second-best answer." "The government firmly believes that before thedecriminalization of marijuana is considered further, a bettercoordinated, better resources, more innovative and carefullyfocused education, treatment, and law enforcement strategy shouldbe given a chance to work," stated a press release from theVictorian Cabinet. "The Premier's 'firm belief' ... is laughable,"responded Jamnes Danenberg of HEMP SA, spokesman for a leadingAustralian cannabis law reform lobby group. "Just howmany more people need to be convicted [under prohibition] beforethe right signal is sent?" For months Victorian politicians had been debating over whetherto implement many of the 72 major drug reforms suggested by theDrug Advisory Council report, the most controversial being marijuanadecriminalization. In all, the Kennett government approveda majority of the report's policies, including shifting the stateanti-drug focus to education rather than enforcement, but rejectedtaking any steps toward decriminalizing marijuana. Thegovernment did conclude, however, that it "will reviewpenalties applying to the use and possession of drugs ofdependence to ensure that users are treated as having a healthproblem first and as criminal offenders second and thattreatment, rather than punishment, is the priority." "The fact that the subject of marijuana decriminalization isa serious topic of debate among Australian politicians is apositive note for drug-reform advocates everywhere," notedNORML Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. "On the otherhand, it indicates just how far behind the United States islagging compared to other western nations when it comes toaddressing the issue of alternative drug policies. Certainly, our own politicians would be well advised to heed the recommendationsthe Pennington Report."

Authorities argue thatthe spraying will deter people from cultivating, selling, andsmoking marijuana, but environmentalists are concerned that thechemicals could pose potential heath hazards to both theenvironment and the population. Approximately 15 to 30 narcotics agents will begin sprayinguncultivated marijuana plants with glyphosate, a chemical weedkiller commonly marketed under the brand name"Round-Up." State officials claim that sprayingis the most effective way to eradicate uncultivated marijuana. "The herbicide has been tested, found to be safe and has avery low toxicity to wildlife," said Oklahoma Bureau ofNarcotics and Dangerous Drugs spokesman Mark Woodward to theTulsa World News. To enforce his position, Woodward noted a1986 U.S. Department of Justice study that showed an individualcould smoke 139 marijuana cigarettes treated with glyphosate aday and still be under the safe level in regard to thechemical. However, some area environmental activists arenot convinced. "[Glyphosate] can do a lot of damage to our bio-diversity;this can wreak damage on our wildflower population,"contested Noah Berry, vice president of EcoLaw Institute Inc., astate organization that works to strengthen environmentallaws. Berry also cited a Journal of Pesticide Reform reportfrom last year that claimed glyphosate exposure was the thirdmost commonly reported of pesticide illness among agriculturalworkers in California. "Maybe the state should get into the dandelion eradicationbusiness, if it's busy work they want," Berry suggested. This will mark the third year the bureau has sprayed uncultivatedmarijuana crops.

Supreme Court Rules On Traffic Stops June 11, 1996, Washington, D.C.: Minor traffic stops can be used as justification for detainingmotorists and searching their vehicles for drugs, ruled theSupreme Court in an unanimous decision. Critics argue thatthe ruling will encourage police to use phony pretexts to invadethe privacy of motorists -- particularly minorities -- whileproponents maintain that it provides law enforcement with anadditional weapon to combat illicit drugs. "This is an opinion that essentially allows police to do anend run around the Fourth Amendment," said Steven R. Shapiroof the American Civil Liberties Union. He warned that the judgmentwill most likely subject motorists to arbitrary stops. "The Supreme Court has announced to the world, 'We don'tcare what the method is, so long as the search can be justifiedin hindsight,'" agreed Natman Schaye, a Tucson Arizonalawyer who filed an amicus brief for the defendants on behalf ofthe National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. "Officers are still bound by the same rules that they werebound by yesterday," countered Jim Pasco, executive directorof the Fraternal Order of Police, who applauded thedecision. "I think it's an affirmation of the mannerin which good and innovative police officers are alreadyconducting themselves." Writing the opinion for the court, Justice Anton Scalia affirmedthat ulterior motives do not strip officers of theirjustification for a stop as long as a traffic violation hasoccurred. "For the run of the mine case, ... [theCourt] think[s] there is no alternative to the traditional commonlaw rule that probable cause justifies a search andseizure." The case is Whren v. United States.

June 6, 1996 "Cheers" StarPlants Hemp In Kentucky ... And Pays The Price Harrelson Hopes To Challenge Federal Law By Act Of CivilDisobedience June 1, 1996, Lexington, KY: Hempactivist and noted Hollywood actor Woody Harrelson was arrestedand charged with cultivation of fewer than five marijuana plantsafter he brazenly planted four seeds of industrial hemp in fullview of Lee County Sheriff William Kilburn. The plantingand subsequent arrest are part of an orchestrated protest byHarrelson to challenge the continued prohibition of industrialhemp. Harrelson expects to be found guilty of themisdemeanor charge and intends to appeal because current lawmakes no distinction between marijuana and industrial hemp. "The [law prohibiting hemp cultivation] is overlybroad," explained Burl McCoy, a Lexington attorney who wason hand to represent the actor. "There is no rationalbasis for the statute." In a June 5 press release, the famed actor of both television andfilm explained his actions. "I am not one to go out of my way to get arrested. Butin this case, I thought it was important for me to take that stepin order to demonstrate the difference between industrial hempand marijuana. "Industrial hemp, like the four certified seeds I planted,was first grown in Kentucky two hundred and fifty yearsago. It is currently grown in other countries across theglobe, including France, England, Canada, Australia, China,Hungary, and the Ukraine. Industrial hemp has very littleTHC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. [Therefore,] itcannot be used as a drug. None of the countries that allowindustrial hemp production have experienced any problems relatingto the crop. "Industrial hemp is very clean and easy to grow. It isone of the most environmentally sound sources of industrial fiberin the world. ... Environmentally friendly detergents,plastics, paints, varnishes, cosmetics, and textiles are alreadybeing made from it in Europe. ... Industrial hemp can meetour fiber needs while also revitalizing our struggling ruraleconomies. "Congress never intended to make legitimate industrial hempfarming the same as marijuana cultivation. I plantedindustrial hemp and got arrested because someone must highlightthis difference and in order to truly know the law, one must testthe law. I think it is time for all of us to make a stand... for environmentally friendly, rural economicdevelopment. If the people lead the leaders willfollow." Harrelson, who is part owner of The Hempstead Company -- one ofthe largest hemp clothing companies in the nation -- notes thathe intends to plant hemp in additional states to further challengethe laws.

"Police Chiefs want to see a balanced approach," PoliceFoundation President Hubert Williams recently told the LawEnforcement News in response to the report. "Theyrecognize that a narrow strategy directed down a single corridorwill not work." More than 300 police chiefs from aroundthe country participated in the study. The report's key findings are as follows: * Only 15 percent of the police chiefs polled say punishmentwould be more effective than education, interdiction, ortreatment in controlling drug problems; only 10 percent of chiefswho have served in a narcotics division choose punishment overthe other options. * Nearly three-fourths say that mandatory minimum sentences fordrug possession have been only somewhat effective or not reallythe answer to drug trafficking in their communities; only 21 percentsay mandatory sentences have been very or fairly effective. * Only 28 percent regard low conviction rates, either for dealersor users, as key limitations in their ability to deal with drugsin their communities. * By two to one, police chiefs say that putting drug users incourt-supervised treatment programs (59 percent) is moreeffective than prison or jail time (28 percent). * Only three percent believe that current efforts by lawenforcement have been very successful in reducing the drugproblem in the United States. "The findings of the Police Foundation and Drug Strategiesdemonstrate that the majority of our nation's police chiefs whoare on the front lines of the 'War on Drugs' do not favor the'get-tough' approaches against drug users that are so oftenheralded by our political leaders and supported by the Americanpublic," said NORML Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.

Small Town Mayor Claims She Was Unaware ThatGrowing Marijuana Was Illegal May 29, 1996, Copperhill, TN: Copperhill Mayor Janelle Kimsey admits that she grew marijuana,but argues that she was unaware that growing marijuana for"educational purposes" was illegal. Therural-town mayor was recently found growing ten marijuana plantson her porch and may be indicted on charges of marijuanacultivation. "There may be a perfectly good explanation for this, but atthis point we haven't found it," stated Polk County SheriffBill Davis. In her defense, the two-term mayor claims she was guilty ofnothing more than ignorance. "We made a drug bust acouple of months ago, and the citizens wanted to know what[marijuana] looked like," said the mayor, adding that sheplanned to take the full grown plants to the police department tobe used as a display. "I didn't know it was illegal togrow it for educational purposes." Kimsey also maintains that she intended to use the plants totrain the city's drug sniffing dog to sniff out cannabis. When asked why she was growing so many plants, the mayorresponded that she thought several plants were needed so that shecould choose the best quality. "I know ignorance is no excuse, but in my case, it wasignorance," she remarked. Although Kimsey has not been arrested, her case will be takenbefore the Polk County grand jury on July 1. The 10marijuana plants were confiscated by police.

May 30,1996 Marijuana Reform Debate In Full Force InCanadian Federal Government May 1996, Ottawa, Canada: Debateover Canada's federal policies regarding both the widespreadcultivation of industrial hemp and the legalization of smallamounts of marijuana for recreational use are currently in fullswing in the Canadian Senate. Hearings have been ongoing regarding the future of proposedgovernment bill C-8, a measure currently before the Senate thatwill effectively replace the Narcotic Control Act with the ControlledSubstances and Abuse Act. Currently, the measure retainsthe existing penalties for marijuana: a potential $1,000 fine orsix months in jail. However, a growing group of vocal senatorsfrom both major parties feel that the time for decriminalizationof marijuana has come and the federal law must reflect that. "I am in favor of decriminalizing marijuana," saidLiberal Senator Rose-Marie Losier-Cool, one of five senators whosit on the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committeewho have publicly endorsed decriminalization. "We mustlook at this very seriously. The approach we have now iscriminal, it's punitive. Maybe it's a health approach weshould be taking a serious look at. The punitive approachhas not worked and the problem is still there." "Cannabis is much less lethal than cigarettes andalcohol," added Quebec Progressive Conservative SenatorPierre-Claude Nolin. "Are we into prohibition becauseit's somewhat of a dogma that we don't question and [because]everybody else is doing it?" "Senators [are] much more interested in a harm reductionmodel of drug control in this country than they [are] in apunishment model," confirmed Liberal Senator SharonCarstairs, Chairwoman for the senate committee. "Thatis where almost all of the senators are coming from." In addition to the growing movement regarding the use ofrecreational marijuana, support for policies legalizing thewidescale growing of industrial hemp is also gatheringsupport. According to a staff-member for Liberal SenatorLorna Milne, the senator will soon be introducing an amendment toC-8 that will make it legal to cultivate hemp by adding"mature hemp stock" to a list of approvedsubstances. The staffer reports that Milne's office doesnot anticipate "any difficulty" regarding the passageof the amendment and adds that the proposal has the support ofHealth Minister David Dingwall. "[Hemp cultivation] seems to me to be a sensible thing todo," Milne said recently. Bill C-8 is currently undergoing it's second committee review inthe Senate and the overall bill is expected to be amended andreturned to the House of Commons. Sources who have spokento NORML anticipate that any measures regarding hempcultivation should pass both the Senate and House withoutcomplications, but warn that proposals regarding thedecriminalization of recreational marijuana will most likely beopposed by the House.

Black Motorists Subject To Stops AndSearches On I-95 More Often Than Whites May 1996, Perryville, MD: Blackmotorists are stopped and searched for drugs at least four timesmore often than whites by a special Maryland highway drug unitthat patrols stretches of Interstate 95, according to a recentreport from the Associated Press. Although state police spokesmen have flatly denied using racialprofiles, findings from an AP computer analysis of carsearches indicate that more than 75 percent of all drivers whosecars were searched by the special drug squad through the firstnine months of 1995 were black. In all, the Special TrafficInterdiction Force (STIF), whose six officers are white, searched145 of the motorists it stopped along a 50 mile stretch of I-95between the Delaware border and the Baltimore County line; ofthese, 110 motorists were listed as black, 24 white, sixHispanic, and five "other" minorities. Marylandpolice maintain that the findings are a coincidence. Maryland state troopers, like those in many states, are forbiddento use racial profiles in traffic stops. In addition,Maryland troopers are mandated to provide records on highwaysearches to the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland underterms of a legal settlement reached in 1994. According to at least one attorney from the ACLU who spoke withthe AP, a future class-action lawsuit may be consideredif the data eventually proves a pattern of discrimination. At least one private discrimination lawsuit has already beenfiled against three STIF troopers. For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre of NORML@ (202) 483-5500. Repeat Felony Marijuana Possession PenaltiesReduced In Missouri May 1996, Jefferson City, MO: Thanksin large part to the efforts of Missouri NORML Coordinator DanViets, Gov. Mel Carnahan signed into law Senate Bill 830 whichsignificantly reduces the range of punishment for second andthird offense felony marijuana possession. SB 830 was filed after Viets contacted Sen. Joe Moseley(D-Columbia) late last year and alerted him that under theMissouri prior and persistent drug offender statute, anindividual who merely possessed more than one and one quarterounces of marijuana on two occasions would be eligible for apunishment ranging from 10 years to life in prison. One whohad committed three such offenses would be subject to 10 years tolife in prison without the possibility of probation or parole. The passage of SB 830 changes the law to specify that simplemarijuana possession offenses will no longer be punishable underthe prior and persistent drug offender statute. Therefore,a second offense of felony marijuana possession which formerlyhad a sentencing range of 10 years to life now has a sentencingrange of zero to seven years. Furthermore, regardless ofhow many drug offenses of any nature one has, no simplepossession offense will ever carry a punishment of more thanseven years and the defendant will remain eligible for probationand parole. "Senator Moseley ... [is] one of the most effectiveadvocates for rational reform of the criminal laws generally withwhom I have ever had the privilege of working," statedViets.

May 23, 1996 Federal Representative Continues Probe IntoPotential Misuse Of Federal Power At Anti-NORML Demonstration May 1996, Washington, D.C.: Rep.Barney Frank (D-Mass.) continues to make federal waves inresponse to a December 1995 rally held outside the offices ofBoston radio station WBCN to protest the airplay of the NORMLbenefit CD, Hempilation. Having previously written to Attorney General Janet Reno thiswinter both condemning the actions of rally organizers, theGovernors Alliance Against Drugs, and requesting an inquiry into whetherfederal law enforcement officials were involved, Frank is againpressuring the Attorney General to take action. "I'mwriting to express my severe disappointment in the response I received[from DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine] to a letter I sentyou in December about the conduct of the Drug EnforcementAdministration in an effort by officials of the state and federal governmentto put inappropriate pressure on a radio station, and to do so inan inappropriate manner," Frank asserts. "Theresponse confirmed my fear that the Drng Enforcement Administrationdoes not have the respect for free expression which ought toexist in the federal government, especially the Department ofJustice, charged as it is with the protection of constitutionalrights." According to eye-witness accounts, the Massachusetts basedanti-drug group, in cooperation with representatives from the DEAand local law enforcement, organized and participated in a protestoutside the offices of WBCN Boston to voice their disapproval ofthe station "giving airtime" to the NORMLbenefit CD, Hempilation. Witnesses note that protestersarrived in state vehicles, attendees were encouraged to"bring their squad cars," and that an individualidentified as the Boston liaison to the DEA accompanied GeorgetteWatson, Executive Director of the G.A.A.D, as she entered thestation. This action prompted Bill Downing, president ofMass Cann NORML, to charge that "Th[is] sort of [behavior],when performed by government agents, [is] specifically[prohibited] by law. "It is one thing for government officials to express theiropinions as to what is appropriate behavior by radiostations," writes Frank in his follow-up letter to Ms.Reno. "It is quite another for a law enforcementofficial to arrive in these circumstances and participate in whatis clearly an effort to pressure them on the spot. ... Weare talking here about a situation where a law enforcementofficer - I assume armed with both a weapon and with the power ofarrest -- enters a radio station in the company of a stateofficial who has organized a demonstration and joins with her --indeed at her specific request -- in trying to persuade people atthe station to stop playing certain music. "My impression is that we do not have enough law enforcementofficials available to do actual law enforcement. Divertingone of them to spend his time seeking to pressure radio stationsinto changing their selections is it seems to me both a misuse ofscarce resources as well as a misuse of the authority of lawenforcement officials where people's first amendment rights areinvolved. I therefore must ask that you promulgate policieswhich prohibit law enforcement officials from engaging in thissort of activity."

Modified Hemp Measure Becomes Law In Vermont May 14, 1996, Montpelier, VT: A bill(H. 783) that could signal the first step in the establishment ofa domestic hemp industry in Vermont became law without thesignature of Gov. Howard Dean. However, hemp proponentsmaintain that the approved measure falls short of the bill'sinitial expectations and acknowledge that any chance for localindustrial hemp cultivation still remains far away. Similar to a resolution recentiy approved in Hawaii, the revisedVermont legislation allows for research to be conducted into thefeasibility of industrial hemp production, but removed language thatwould have authorized the state university to grow test plots inorder to assess optimum soils and other growing conditions. The bill is a "compromise," admits Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney),one of the chief backers of the original bill. Maslacknotes that Gov. Dean would have vetoed any legislation thatallowed for the growing of hemp. "It's a start," stated NORML Deputy DirectorAllen St. Pierre. "But it's also an indicator of justhow far we have to go." In sum, the approved measure maintains that: "The commissionof agriculture, food and markets and the University of Vermontare requested to undertake research, of a minimum of two years in duration,of industrial hemp production in the state. [This research]shall include: (1) Analysis of market economic conditionsaffecting the development of an industrial hemp industry in thestate of Vermont; (2) Analysis of whether Vermont soils andgrowing conditions are appropriate for economic levels ofindustrial hemp production; (3) Analysis of research undertakenelsewhere in the world regarding minimum THC levels of industrialhemp production; and (4) Analysis of possible law enforcementaspects of industrial hemp production in Vermont."

South Australia's Director Of PublicProsecutions Recommends The State Grow Cannabis May 1996, South Australia, Australia: The Director of Public Prosecutions in South Australia wants theState government to grow and regulate the sale of cannabis,according to statements he recently made in an exclusiveinterview with the Australian publication, The Advertiser. "We never really had a chance [in trying to stop druguse]," Director Paul Rofe, QC, stated. "We'vejust got to do something drastic." Rofe maintains that criminal involvement in the cannabis tradewould be cut dramatically if the government were to either begingrowing the drug or issue licenses for its manufacture. Rofe suggested implementing a regulatory system similar to thosealready in place for the sale of alcohol and tobacco wherebyindividuals could purchase marijuana over the counter. Sucha move would both eliminate illegal profits from the black-marketsale of the drug and would cut down on the "underground"attraction of smoking cannabis, Rofe remarked.

May 16, 1996 Hawaii State Legislature Passes HempResolution May 1996, Honolulu, Hawaii: For thefirst time in its history, the Hawaii State Legislature haspassed a resolution to conduct a study on the economic potentialof growing industrial hemp as an agricultural product. House Resolution 71 and House Concurrent Resolution 63 describethe study as a fact-finding and information-gathering forum thatwould examine the following aspects of industrial hemp: 1) the commodityvalue, 2) economic potential and other benefits, 3) comparison ofthe economic potential with that of similar crops, 4) interest ofHawaii landowners, businesses, and other parties in growingindustrial hemp, 5) federal procedures for obtaining a permit togrow hemp, and 6) the barriers that prohibit the growing of hemp. "Thousands of acres of former sugar plantation land stillawait the arrival of a viable alternative crop," stated Rep.David Tarnas (D-6th District), a chief backer of themeasure. "Industrial hemp should be allowed to proveitself as a successful commodity here in Hawaii -- as it is doingin other places around the world." The joint Senate Committees on Agriculture, Labor, and Employmentand Ways and Means stated in their committee report that"given the State's current economic crisis, the viability of alternativecash crops should be explored to the fullest extentpossible." The Hawaii Agribusiness Development Corporation will beinitiating the research project at the University of Hawaii,College of Tropical Agriculture. Earlier this year, Rep. Tarnas introduced legislation to amendthe state law to authorize the production, possession, andcommerce of non-psychoactive industrial hemp in Hawaii. However, the House Agriculture Committee voted to postponedeciding on that bill until next year. For more information, please contact Rep. David Tarnas @ (808)586-8510. California Secretary Of State Issues RawCount For Medical Marijuana Petition May 15, 1996, Santa Monica: A rawcount by the California Secretary of State demonstrates that astate-wide initiative to legalize marijuana for medical use haswell over the necessary number of signatures to appear on theNovember 1996 state ballot. Although the total number ofsignatures will not be certified by the State for another six orseven weeks, the Secretary of Sate announced that raw countfigures indicate that more than 758,000 signatures were collected-- well over the 433,269 required to qualify the initiative forthe 1996 ballot. California's medical marijuana initiative came about in responseto Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation passed bythe California Legislature in 1995 that would have allowed forthe controlled compassionate use of marijuana for those diagnosedby a physician to be suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer,glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis. The 1996 initiative maintainsthat patients or defined caregivers who possess or cultivatemarijuana for medical treatment recommended by a physician areexempt from the general provisions of law which otherwiseprohibit possession or cultivation of marijuana. Inaddition, the initiative declares that physicians shall not bepunished or denied any right or privilege for recommendingmarijuana to a patient for medical purposes. If the initiative is passed by California voters this fall, themeasure will become law immediately and cannot be vetoed.

Headed by local NORML activists and the Political ActionCommittee Pay for Schools by Regulating Cannabis (PSRC), aproposal to comprehensively reform marijuana laws in the state hasgathered in excess of 65,000 signatures -- more than threequarters of the number needed to place the initiative on theballot. The PSRC must gather at least 73,261 registeredOregon voters' signatures by July 5, 1996 to qualify. Known as the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act (OCTA), the PSRC proposalwould tax and regulate the sale of marijuana to adults, licensefarmers to cultivate the drug for sale to the state, permit physiciansto prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent to seriously illpatients, and allow farmers to grow industrial hemp for fiber,oil, and protein production. The OCTA would authorize the sale of marijuana to take place instate-run liquor stores where the age limit of 21 can be strictlyenforced. The PSRC estimates that the profits generatedfrom the regulated sale of marijuana could amount to $500 milliona year or 20 percent of Oregon's total state budget. TheOCTA would direct 65 percent of that money toward funding primaryand secondary education. In addition, 30 percent of therevenue would go to state and community colleges, four percentwould go to fund drug abuse treatment programs, and the remainingone percent would be used to implement realistic drug educationprograms in the schools. According to Chief Petitioner Paul Stanford, the pending Oregonlegislation is drafted to effectively stand up to the barrage ofcourt challenges that it will presumably face. The OCTA is writtenin compliance with the restrictions imposed by severalinternational anti-drug treaties and the bill provides numerousconstitutional protections in its comprehensive preamble toensure that the act will be upheld in court. Moreover, theOCTA even provides funding for the inevitable legal battles thatawait it by collecting revenue through the issuing of cannabislicense fees, Stanford notes. Preliminary surveys indicate that the OCTA has a realistic chanceof passing. School funding is a very urgent issue in Oregonand a poll conducted by the state's largest television station, KATU-TV,showed that 55 percent of the respondents answered yes whenasked, "Should marijuana be sold in liquor stores to fundeducation?" "The war on drugs is the issue on which the future offreedom in America swings," stated Stanford. "Families and individuals are being destroyed by thismisguided civil war. The war on drugs is not about drugs,it's about money and the continued centralization of economic and politicalcontrol. The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act is the first big steptoward a solution."

The FRA data shows that prior to the introduction of randomdrug testing in 1990, the number of accidents due to human errordeclined steadily, from 3.8 per million rail miles in 1978 to 1.4in 1986. Since then, however, the accident rate has held steadyat around 1.4 to 1.8. "This data calls into question the supposed safety benefitsof random drug testing," said California NORML coordinatorDale Gieringer. Unlike alcohol tests, drug urinalysis testscannot detect actual impairment, but only whether a drug was usedin the past. In the case of marijuana -- the drug detectedin the overwhelming majority of positive tests -- urine tests canregister positive for days or weeks after last use, long afterthe euphoric affects of the drug have faded. Random drug testing was imposed on the nation's railway workersin the wake of a highly publicized 1987 Amtrak-Conrail collisionin which the crew were determined to have smoked marijuana. The responsibility of marijuana for the accident was neverclearly determined, however. An investigation by theNational Transportation Safety Board determined that better equipmentand personnel management would have prevented the accident, butdid not recommend drug testing. Nonetheless, Congresspromptly rushed to require drug testing for all of the nation's transportationworkers following the accident. "The effectiveness of this regulation has never beenscientifically proven," states Gieringer. "Whileproponents say that testing has reduced the number oftransportation workers testing positive for drugs, there is noindication this has had any [significant] safety benefits. Poblems include: substitution of alcohol and other untested drugsfor tested drugs such as marijuana; unreliability of tests indiscriminating drug abuse; cheating and evasion by drug abusingworkers; and lack of relation between test result and jobperformance."

"Could more money be used on international and interdictionprograms? There is no question," McCaffrey told aHouse Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. McCaffrey's remarks were made despite the fact that Clinton'sbudget request allocates nearly $10 billion to be used in 1997solely for law enforcement here and abroad. "How much is enough," questioned NORML's DeputyDirector Allen St. Pierre. "Twenty billion, 30billion, when will it end? Despite claims that this new,anti-drug strategy focuses on youth prevention and education, theOffice of National Drug Control Policy will spend a record high$10 billion dollars on law enforcement -- a figure that the DrugCzar now claims to be too little. "Since 1988, federal spending on anti-drug programs hasincreased more than 300 percent, yet according to governmentstatistics illicit drug use has remained virtually unchangedamong adults and has actually increased among adolescents. We cannot continue to keep throwing money at the problem andexpect any sort of positive results."

Dealers Caught Close To Churches To FaceStiffer Penalties May 7, 1996, Springfield, IL: Legislation that will stiffen penalties for those convicted of sellingmarijuana or other illicit drugs within 1,000 feet of a place ofreligious worship will take effect in 1997 under a measure signedby Gov. Jim Edgar. "This legislation takes our efforts to take drug dealers offthe street a step further by creating another safe zone wherethose dealers know they will pay an even bigger price for theircrimes," Edgar said. The measure, sponsored by Rep. John Jones (R-Mount Vernon) andSen. William O'Daniel (D-Mount Vernon), increases the penalty byone level for selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a place ofreligious worship. The legislation is similar to currentlaws providing enhanced penalties for those convicted of sellingdrugs on the grounds of schools, public parks, and publichousing, or within 1,000 feet of them. -END- MORE THAN 10 MILLIONMARIJUANA ARRESTS SINCE 1965 ...
