UTMSI is ideally located to allow easy access to a variety ofmarine-influenced environments including the Aransas Pass channel,an extensive bay and estuarine system, the hypersaline LagunaMadre, and the Gulf of Mexico. Both temperate and tropical floraand fauna can be found on the broad continental shelf, on surfsweptsand beaches and barrier islands, in sand and mudbottomed bays,seagrass meadows, mangrove islands, oyster reefs and rock jetties. Facilities available for visiting class use include airconditioneddormitories, a pier lab and access to the research vessels. Visitor's Center Interest in marine science is also promoted by the Visitor Center,open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Seven aquariashow typical Texas coastal habitats and the organisms that livein them, including Spartinablack mangrove marsh, oyster reef,open bay bottom, rockjetty and offshore artificial reefs. Filmsand video presentations are regularly shown in the auditoriumto groups of visitors. Other displays in the main building highlightcurrent and past research projects and feature representativespecimens or photographs of local plants and animals. Over 40,000visitors have toured the facility annually. Group tours are availableif a request is made in writing at least two weeks before thedesired date. Tour groups are limited to 30 people unless specialpermission is obtained. Teacher Workshops The third major activity of the MES program involves the developmentof a series of weekend teacher workshops. These are aimed at upgradingthe proficiency of classroom teachers at all levels by the introductionof marine science topics and techniques into the curriculum ofall subjects, from science to art and history. Students of allages are fascinated by the oceans and once you have focused theirattention, whether it is on an aquarium, a shell or a photo ofearth from space, you can teach almost any subject using marinescience as the medium. Getting the student's attention and makingthe subject exciting is half the battle in classroom educationtoday. By participating in the weekend workshops teachers willgain practical experience with shipboard collecting gear, as wellas exposure to current research problems and methods and techniquesused by researchers to gain a better understanding of the marineenvironment. The teachers will then be able to transfer to theirstudents the knowledge and experience gained through workshopparticipation, thus enabling them to become more effective educators. Workshop topics this year will feature Coastal Birds, Marine Aquariumsand WHALENET: An Internet computer workshop, as well as a varietyof field trip experiences. The Coastal Studies Laboratory workshopslast all day Saturday and the UTMSI workshops last all day Saturdaywith an evening lab and end at noon on Sunday. There is a completelisting of the workshops offered this year in the brochure. Mustang Island Elderhostel In 1993, Marine Education Services assumed sponsorship of the Mustang Island ELDERHOSTEL Program, formerly sponsored by the Community Presbyterian Church. Rick Tinnin is the program director and Judy Reynolds is the on-site coordinator. The program has since grown into an ELDERHOSTEL Super-Site, sponsoring 23 programs each year. ELDERHOSTEL programs are open to anyone over 55 and typically run 6 days and 5 nights, beginning on Sunday. We run 18 programs out of Beachhead Condominiums, including three intergenerational programs in the summer. Roland and Pat Boulanger are gracious hosts, providing office space and use of their large meeting room. Most programs host 44 participants and a host couple who stay at the condo and serve as a valuable part of the program staff. We also run two intensive studies and two service programs, housing the participants on campus in the dorms. These programs host 24 participants and a host couple. Fifteen of the regular programs and a Rockport program focus on coastal marine habitats, specifically Whooping Cranes and other winter and spring migrants. Typical activities include a research cruise aboard the R/V KATY, scavenger hunts on the beach, a bus and walking tour of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and a Whooping Crane boat trip, trips to the Texas State Aquarium and the Los Barcos and Treasure Ship exhibits at the Corpus Christi Museum. The three intergenerational programs host 20 grandparents who can each bring one grandchild between 10-13 years old. The programs are active and fun and provide an opportunity for the grandparents to spend good quality time with their grandchildren. This program includes beach and marsh field trips, a KATY trip, and trips to San Jose Island, the Texas State Aquarium, Los Barcos and the LEXINGTON. MES staff provide field trip naturalist expertise and educational programs and tours are scheduled at the other sites. A hot dog cookout on the beach one evening is a real hit with this group. The Intensive Studies programs have an entirely different focus from the regular programs. There are only 24 participants and they are housed on-site in the dorms. These programs focus on a single theme for the week and participants are required to complete a project of their choice which might be a research paper or report, a presentation to the group on some aspect of the week's work, art work, a collection of some sort, etc. Participants are sent a reading list and reference articles that they are expected to review before they come to the program so they will be better prepared to focus on the topic that is presented. These programs provide a more in-depth educational experience with specific demands being made of the participants. We host the ONLY marine, intensive studies program in the United States. The two programs this year include Preserving Texas Coastal Habitats in February '97 and Songbirds On The Move: Migration on the Texas Coast in April '97. The February program focuses on endangered species of the area, specifically Whooping Cranes, Piping Plovers and other threatened migrants, their habitat and man's impact on it. The April program, offered for the first time, will focus on spring migrants from the Gulf Beach to inland sites at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and on the King Ranch. In October, we will launch a new program - two service Projects on Shamrock Island in cooperation with the Texas Nature Conservancy (TNC). The TNC purchased Shamrock Island, a 110 acre shell and sand island sheltered behind Mustang Island, which is an important bird rookery for the area, home of hundreds of Roseate Spoonbills, egrets, herons, ibis, gulls, terns and other shore birds year round. The Nature Conservancy wants to build, at some time in the future, an observation tower and possibly boardwalks on the island in support of the Texas Birding Trail and to heighten public awareness and conservation of the island and its resources. The ELDERHOSTEL Service Programs provide an excellent vehicle to assist communities, researchers and conservation groups with willing volunteers who are eager to take an active, working role in research or conservation projects. Existing Service Projects include assisting researchers collecting data on Howler Monkeys in Costa Rica, participating in archaeological digs in Arizona and banding migrating birds in East Texas, to name a few. Our project participants will conduct surveys of the plants and animals living on the island and in the shallow Seagrass beds adjacent to the island. They will set up survey lines, measure and map changes in elevation and sample and record changes in vegetation along the transect lines across the island. Our goal is to create a detailed topographic, vegetation and faunal map of the island. This will aid TNC in developing a formal plan for allowing public access to the island during non-nesting periods of the year. It is an ambitious project and will take several years to complete. Other groups will assist in the mapping project, including the Port Aransas High School Marine Science class and members of the Texas Marine Education Association during their winter meeting in January 1997. This program provides some interesting logistical problems. The island can only be reached by boat. Also, there is no shade and no facilities on the island. We will transport the 26 participants and 5 MES program staff to the island aboard the DUKE from adjacent Wilson's Cut. The DUKE will remain docked on-site to provide shade and rest room facilities for the group. The Conservancy is providing a large, portable awning for shade on the island. Future projects will include revegetating several bare, washover areas with Salt Marsh Cord Grass, building boardwalks and a bird census. A positive spinoff of the ELDERHOSTEL programs is the good will and positive image they promote within the community. Participants pay a program fee and much of that fee is returned to the community. Participants in these programs are treated to dinner at a different local restaurant each night. Breakfast and lunch are provided on site with lunches catered each day. Local transportation is provided through a cooperative agreement with the local school district. Local boats are chartered for birding trips and trips to San Jose Island. On average, each program week puts about $10,000 into the local economy to pay for housing, meals and trips. In addition, proceeds from the programs pay half the salary of an employee in the UTMSI fiscal office. This person is responsible for processing the mounds of paperwork each week that pays the bills generated by such a large program. The University of Texas-Mustang Island ELDERHOSTEL Programs are academically strong and challenging programs, hosting over 900 participants each year. The Marine Education Services Program and its staff, including Linda Fuiman and Bob Huntington, play a vital role in the success of these programs. In addition, the excellent support facilities available at The University of Texas Marine Science Institute are showcased during each program and also contribute to their overall success. Our weekly evaluations by the participants are outstanding and we host many returning ELDERHOSTELer's through our varied program offerings. Participants also enjoy field trips to the Texas State Aquarium, the Lexington, a WWII aircraft carrier and Los Barcos, the Columbus Fleet on permanent display at the Corpus Christi Museum of Science.

After a modest beginning as a series of wooden structures,The University of Texas at Austin has invested steadily in thefacility including major modern steel-and-concrete laboratoryconstruction phases in 1961, 1973, and 1974. The latest buildingcomplex, completed in 1983, comprises an auditorium, library,and visitor's center. The construction of a new research pierin 1994 provides air-conditioned laboratory space over the AransasPass tidal inlet. The pier is only a short walk from the mainlaboratory buildings. The Institute is located in Port Aransas, Texas at the north endof a barrier island and adjacent to the Aransas Pass tidal inlet,which connects the Gulf of Mexico with a vast system of estuaries.Within easy reach of the Institute are diverse marine and estuarineenvironments of interest to researchers in many fields of scientificendeavor. These environments include the open Gulf of Mexico beyondthe slope/shelf break, the shallow waters of the continental shelfand the bays and lagoons behind the barrier islands. The Instituteis within a few hundred meters of both the Gulf beach and an extensiveestuarine/lagoon system. Within this estuarine system is a widevariety of accessible habitats including Spartina and mangrovemarshes, oyster reefs, shallow mud-bottom bays and the most extensiveseagrass meadows in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. In addition,the regions to the north and south comprise one of the largestlagoon systems in the world. They span a range of rainfall thatproduces a salinity gradient from nearly fresh at the Louisianaborder to extremely hypersaline near the Mexican border. The regionis also the center of economically important fisheries, gas andoil production, and marine-related tourism. Research Programs Active research programs in marine science disciplines includingthe physiology, biochemistry and ecology of marine plants andanimals; biological, chemical and physical oceanography; geochemistry;mariculture; biochemical toxicology; and environmental monitoring,have been established at the Institute for many years. Field orientedprojects focus on both the local environment and diverse sitesaround the world. The Marine Science Institute staff totals 120individuals including faculty, research scientists and associates,postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and technical and supportstaff. The Department of Marine Science is the academic arm ofthe Marine Science Institute with 14 faculty members and 5 ProfessorsEmeritus. Courses are taught primarily at the Institute in boththe summer session and the long term. Graduate research is concentratedat the Institute. Physical facilities The Institute's 83,000 sq. ft. central complex is located on 72acres of beach-front land and consists of a series of interconnectedbuildings containing laboratories, classrooms, televideo instructionroom, offices, a library, museum, exhibit halls, visitor's center,auditorium, seminar rooms, and workshops. A 10,000 sq. ft. wet-laboratoryis supplied with filtered running seawater. Other structures onthe grounds of the Institute include 9,500 sq. ft. of dormitories,a cafeteria, physical plant complex, garages, greenhouses, walk-infreezers, and several outdoor pool/habitat tanks. The five-acreboat basin provides quick access for our research vessels to boththe bay systems and the Gulf of Mexico. A new research pier allowsdirect access for research projects in the Aransas Pass tidalinlet connecting the Gulf with the bays. This 300 foot pier hasa 1200 sq. ft. lab at its base and a 150 sq. ft. instrument roomon the end. The terminus of the pier and instrument room housea weather station, tide gauge, current meter, and sensors forwater temperature and salinity, all of which are transmitted toreal time data displays in the Visitor's Center and main laboratory.The pier also has an electric winch for deploying sampling equipmentsuch as plankton nets and large-mesh tide traps to study fluxesof biota through the inlet. A mile west of the main building complex,the Fisheries and Mariculture Laboratory (FAML) occupies 26,000sq. ft. of buildings on 10 acres adjacent to the ship channel.This facility includes four large laboratories which provide fortemperature and photoperiod control. The FAML complex providesfacilities for research on spawning and rearing of marine finfishand crustaceans and affords unique opportunities for researchutilizing captive animals. Both the main laboratories and theFAML facility have office and laboratory space available for visitingscientists. The Marine Science Library(MSL) is a branch library of the General Libraries and has morethan 50,000 volumes and is the primary source of marine relatedinformation on the Gulf of Mexico. The fields covered include:aquaculture/mariculture, biological and physical oceanography,ichthyology, marine botany, marine chemistry, marine biochemistryand geochemistry, marine ecology, marine geology, marine microbiology,marine toxicology, respiratory and reproductive physiology ofmarine animals, and the new field of marine viruses. MSL is particularlystrong in holdings of unpublished documents and reports on Texascoastal resources. University faculty, staff, and students (UTID required) have access to interlibrary services, to on-linebibliographic and abstracting services, and to UT-Austin AcademicComputing and Instructional Technology Services' mainframe computersystems via remote-job-entry terminals. Persons not affiliatedwith the University have acccess to the library's collectionsvia on-site visits, interlibrary services, and telephone reference. The R/V LONGHORN is the largest ofthe Institute's research vessels. The ship was modified in a majorrefit in 1986 to give her an overall length of 105 ft. and isequipped to carry out extensive offshore research. The LONGHORNis currently a UNOLS vessel and is used in numerous NSF sponsoredprojects throughout the Gulf of Mexico. The R/V KATY isa 57 ft. fiberglass trawler used in bay operations and is augmentedby a fleet of eleven 16-34 ft. research vessels used primarilyfor estuarine studies. Four wheel drive and other vehicles areavailable to provide access to coastal habitats. Research and education The Marine Science Institute is an organized research unit ofThe University of Texas at Austin. The Institute's director reportsto the Provost of the University through the Dean of the Collegeof Natural Sciences. The Institute receives an operating budgetannually that is based on a two-year advanced budget approvalby the state legislature. Most research funds are based on grantand contract research. Institute scientists have been awarded133 research grants totaling over $11.8 million since 1990. Theseawards have come from over 40 agencies and institutions including$2.5 million from various NSF programs and have resulted in over330 publications in refereed journals and numerous other articlesand reports. Institute scientists are engaged in both multi-investigator,multi-disciplinary studies and individual research projects inthe local area and throughout the world. Many of these projectsare combinations of field and laboratory investigations. Fundingsources are acknowledged in all publications which appear in bothscientific journals and magazine and newspaper articles. Whilethe name of the University or the Institute cannot be used inadvertising, the funding agency or company can list and describefunded projects in annual reports and other publications Public outreach In addition to research usage, the Institute serves as a marineeducational center for the region. Upper-level undergraduate andgraduate courses are taught in residence during the summer sessions,typically involving 35-50 students from Texas and other states.The Institute typically offers three courses during each of thetwo summer sessions. The Department of Marine Science began offeringadvanced degrees in 1991. Since then, enrollment has increasedby 6-8 students per year to the current enrollment of 34 students.Enrollment in the Department is expected to continue increasingover the next two years to about 40, a target that has been establishedas an ideal "carrying capacity" for the Department.The recent increase in graduate student enrollment in the departmenthas allowed Institute faculty to begin offering courses on-siteduring the fall and spring semesters. Graduate students residein Port Aransas for thesis and dissertation research, supervisedby one or more of the resident staff, sometimes in collaborationwith other UT Austin faculty members on the main campus. In addition,the Institute was designated as a site for NSF's "ResearchExperiences for Undergraduates" program in 1994. The programsupports 10 undergraduates each summer, with an emphasis on minoritystudents. As part of the Marine Education Services program, theInstitute serves a large number of outside groups, primarily highschool and college classes, who visit the Institute during theyear. Hands-on teacher workshops are also provided. The totalnumber of visitors to take advantage of the Marine Education Servicesprogram now exceeds 10,000 teachers and students annually.

Other locations will soonbe available. Predictions are based on a one-year series of measurements made in1973-1974 at the Army Corps of Engineers stilling well tower which is locatedoff the South Jetty of the Aransas Pass just east of the University of TexasMarine Science Institute's facility in Port Aransas. From the series, 37harmonic constituents of the astronomical tide were calculated and used in amodification of the standard National Ocean Survey tidal prediction program tomake hourly water level predictions and the times of the highs and lows for eachday. The water level is adjusted to mean sea level rather than the Gulf CoastDatum. Consequently, the annual and semi-annual variation in sea level can beclearly seen in the position of the daily tide fluctuations relative to the zeromean sea level line (Compare January when low tides prevail with October whenthe opposite is true). Each hour is indicated by a vertical line connecting thecurve with the zero line. In general, slack water will be at the times which thecurve intersects the zero axis, but when the curve is offset as in January andOctober, some interpolation may be necessary. Flood and ebb tidal currents willbe at a maximum at the times of high and low water respectively. Thisastronomical tide is often radically changed by strong winds before and duringthe passages of cold fronts and during extra tropical depressions. Theastronomical signal will still be found "riding" on top of themeteorological surges. Past history has shown that the predicted times are quiteaccurate, although the range of the tides in the predictions is somewhatexaggerated. The author is working on new predictions based on a multi-yeartidal series measured at the UTMSI pier (since 1985). Local times of the highs and lows are listed beneath each daily box (allheights are given in feet and all times are local). They are listed in "orderof appearance"; if the first tide extreme is a low then the time and heightwill be preceded by L1, for the Low 1. Heights here are given in feet andinches. The next tide will be H1 for High 1, etc. These numbers may be difficultto read on some VGA screens. Note: the English units are given here because itis the system most commonly used by the general public. The shaded areas eachday show the hours of darkness. Phases of the moon are shown for each day withthe New Moon (NM), First quarter (FQ), Full Moon (FM), and Last Quarter (LQ)marked on the moon symbol where appropriate. The relative size and shape of themoon will be quite close to reality each day, but the moon's orientation isalways vertical on the calendar. The author is working on a method of depictingthe moon as it appears to the observer. The symbols appear on the night of theday closest to when the phase occurs, e.g. If full moon is at 1215 (24-hourclock) on the 25th of a month, then the symbol will appear straddling midnightof the 25th. Should it occur at 1145 then the symbol will appear on the 24th ofthe month. The local time zone in use is given at the top of each monthly chart. WhenDaylight Savings Time comes into effect in April and reverts to standard time inOctober is depicted by either a shorter or longer day and the symbol "CDT"for Central Daylight Time, or "CST" for Central Standard Time on theday these changes take place. Notice how it messes up a perfectly good calendar.This was one of the more difficult aspects of the calendar to program.

Team Holt (S.) Team Thomas Ongoing Projects - Team Arnold/Davis (Staff: D. Allen, L. Johnston, J. P. Lazo, M. Li, J. Munoz, E. Thoman) Maturation Laboratory: This laboratory utilizes temperatureand photoperiod manipulations to induce spawning on a year roundbasis. The primary function of this laboratory is to evaluatespawning conditions for new species and to provide a year-roundsupply of eggs for a wide variety of research projects. Current parents: Red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) Yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus) Future parents: Red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) Grey snapper (Lutjanus griseus) Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus) Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) Nutrition laboratories: These laboratories are primarilyutilized to elucidate nutritional requirements and evaluate practicalfeed ingredients for use in commercial feeds. Development of low pollution feeds: This researchseeks to optimize feed formulations to reduce waste products producedby the culture animal. 1) Development of nutrient dense diets: This research hasconcentrated on evaluating the effects of dietary manipulationson growth and nutrient retention of red drum as well as changesin water quality parameters in closed systems. Additionally, theeffects of medium chain triglycerides on growth and body compositionare being evaluated as a mechanism to reduce fat stores in culturedfish. 2) Evaluation of feed supplements: a) Enzymatic supplements: Utilizing red drum and pacificwhite shrimp as test species, the effects of a dietary proteasesupplement is currently being evaluated for its effects on apparentprotein digestion. b) Feed grade phosphorus sources: Utilizing the pacificwhite shrimp as the test species, several inorganic phosphorussources are being tested to determine if differences in biologicalvalue can be identified in practical feeds. Semi- and closed recirculation systems: These systemsare primarily used to development and demonstrate closed recirculationtechnologies for the production of marine species. Work is currentlyunderway to refine techniques for the mass production of foodsize shrimp and the production of marine species of commercialvalues. Ongoing Projects - Team Fuiman (Staff: C. Faulk, K. Poling, M. Smith) Comparative Anatomical and Functional Development of SensorySystems in Three Sciaenid Fishes: Kirsten Poling is documentingthe developmental changes in the end-organs of visual and mechanosensorysystems of red drum, spotted seatrout, and Atlantic croaker. Sheis measuring developmental changes in the performance of thesesystems in order to understand the relationship of form to function.She will use all of this information to draw some conclusionsabout the role of sensory system development in ontogenetic nicheshifts of the three species. Biomarkers of Larval Fitness in Croaker Exposed to Pesticides:This is Team Fuiman's portion of a joint project with Peter Thomas'lab. Cindy Faulk is using a collection of behavioral assays todetermine whether parental exposure to a model pesticide (DDT)has ecologically significant sublethal effects on the larvae theyproduce. The assays measure burst and routine swimming as wellas the performance of the visual and auditory systems. Presence, Ontogeny, and Function of Two Types of Neuromastsin the Lateral Line System of Red Drum: This collaborationwith Jiakun Song (University of Maryland and Smithsonian Institution)is based on the recent discovery that aminoglycoside antibioticsdamage lateral line canal neuromasts but not superficial neuromasts.Our work on larval red drum addresses questions on the developmentand differential function of these potentially very differentsensory endorgans. Predation Mortality of Larval Fishes: Peril of the Unfit orthe Unfortunate?: This collaboration with Jim Cowan (DauphinIsland Sea Lab, Alabama) is examining the question of whetherpredation mortality during early life is the result of chanceencounters with predators or the predator evasion skills of thelarvae. Laboratory assays measure survival skills of individuallarvae to determine whether some individuals excel in severalskills (born athletes). Laboratory results will be incorporatedinto an individual-based model and simulations will be performedto predict the survival of athletes and non-athletes. These predictionswill then be tested in mesocosm trials. Physical and Physiological Effects of Temperature on LarvalFish Swimming: This collaboration with Bob Batty (DunstaffnageMarine Laboratory, Scotland) is measuring the importance of naturalvariations in water viscosity to the swimming performance andkinematics of Atlantic herring larvae. Both routine (slow, aerobic)and burst (fast, anaerobic) swimming modes are being studied. Effects of Temperature and Salinity on the Interaction betweenRed Drum Larvae and a Piscine Predator: Locomotor and physiologicalperformance of both predator and prey may be influenced by differencesin temperature and salinity, but the magnitude of the effectsmay differ for larvae and larger fishes. This project examinesthe responsiveness and response effectiveness of red drum larvae,and the capture success of larger pinfish under 12 combinationsof temperature and salinity to determine relative importance ofthese two natural environmental variables to the predatory-preyinteraction. Ongoing Projects - Team Holt (J.) (Staff: P. Douillet, C. Fernandez, P. Pickering, J. Rooker) Larviculture and high density grow-out studies of marine speciesin closed systems aimed at developing a mariculture approach tothe conservation of natural resources. 1. Mariculture development throughout the world is hampered bythe lack of reliable rearing systems and practical diets for thelarvae. For example, high yields of red drum depend upon feedingthe larvae live prey for one to several weeks. In order to reducethe requirement for live prey, feeding and nutrition studies hereare focused on understanding the developing digestive systemand nutrient requirements for larval sciaenids. The goal isto determine essential nutrients for larvae and the best meansfor supplying those nutrients. 2. Role of microbial ecology in larval fish culture and nutritionhas been investigated by Philippe Douillet. Initially the studyaimed to develop a scheme for managing the composition of themicrobial community in intensive, closed culture for red drumlarvae. The second phase was to identify and culture beneficialmicrobes to add to the larva cultures. Currently we are exploringthe possibility of using enzyme producing gut- bacteria to enhancethe utilization of artificial diets. 3. Culture of tropical reef fish and shrimp would functionto conserve natural reef resources by offering alternatives towild capture. Over the past we have successfully spawned sevenreef species and reared the larvae of three: cubbyu (Equetusumbrosus), yellow-tail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus)and a cleaner shrimp (Lysmata wurdemanni). Using the techniqueswe developed for rearing the larvae, together with micro-zooplanktonculture it is possible that many coral reef species can be grownin culture. Biochemical measures of fish growth and condition to evaluatethe condition or growth potential of lab cultured or natural populationsof fish larvae. 1. Several biochemical measures are under investigation includingRNA-DNA ratio, lipids, and MPF (Mitosis Promoting Factor).The RNA-DNA ratio has been examined in larvae raised in the laboratoryunder various feeding, salinity and temperature conditions, andin natural population of red drum. The measure is a good indicatorof recent history of feeding and perhaps temperature conditions.Studies by Claire Fernandez and others are investigating furtherthe effect of temperature history on the RNA-DNA ratio. 2. In a collaborative project with Mark Westerman, the usefulnessof cyclin-dependent kinase activity, predominantlyMitosis Promoting Factor, in assessing how biological and environmentalinputs affect growth of teleost larvae is being investigated.Classes of lipids (ie.. tags, steroles, etc.) varydepending on the nutritional state of larvae; this will be examinedwhen we get access to an Iatroscan possibly later this year (automatedthin layer chromatograph with a flame ionization detector). Bothmethods will be compared to the RNA-DNA ratio in larvae with differentgrowth histories. Larval fish studies to determine the role of biological andphysical factors in growth and survival of natural populationsof estuarine dependent fishes. 1. Overall the salinity tolerance of spotted seatrout is broadbut we have shown that early life stages have reduced tolerancewith 3 day old larvae being the most sensitive. Egg size variesinversely with salinity in natural spawning populations and therange of tolerance in pre-feeding larvae is directly related tospawning salinity. Furthermore changing the salinity on adultsbrought into the lab during the spawning season has detrimentaleffects on the development of eggs and larvae. Possible hypothesesto explain the data we have accumulated thus far are (1) long-termacclimation by adults to salinity regulates the pattern of salinitytolerance found in young larvae, (2) non-genetic, possible irreversibleadaptation of the embryo or larva regulates salinity toleranceat the population level, or (3) stocks or populations of spottedseatrout are genetically adapted to the prevailing salinity regimeof a bay system. 2. In a collaborative study with S. Holt we are trying to identifycritical periods during the transport of red drum and othersciaenids from spawning sites to estuarine nursery grounds.The role of physical factors and vertical positioning on transportof eggs and larvae through the Aransas Pass has been examinedin several studies. We found that larval sciaenids could use modifiedtidal stream transport to reach estuarine nursery areas, by stayingin near- bottom water in the pass on ebb tide and moving up onflood tide. Vertical movement was not associated with feedingsince larvae feed only during daylight hours and flood and ebbcycles do not follow a strict diurnal pattern. The objectivesof an ongoing study are to determine the temporal pattern of spawning,estimate density of larvae, and determine birthdate distributionof young fish that successfully recruit to the sea grass bedswith the goal of quantifying physical and biological conditionsthat result in high survival. 3. Studies by Jay Rooker and Andy Soto are examining howfeeding, growth and condition of larvae in the sea grass bedsare affected by habitat and competition. They will presenttheir research at a brown bag seminar in the near future. Ongoing Projects - Team Holt (S.) (Staff: K. Binney, C. Pratt, A. Soto) The central theme of research in Scott Holt's lab is fish ecology,with emphasis on larval and juvenile life history stages. Virtuallyall the studies are field oriented and are comparative, using"natural" experiments, rather than manipulative. Recent projects include: Studies of the temporal and spatial distribution of fish larvaein the Laguna Madre and the impact of the brown tide onthose larvae. We have seen a dramatic decline in the density ofall early-stage fish larvae (incl. spotted seatrout and blackdrum) in areas of high brown tide concentrations. Joan has labdata showing high mortality of eggs and nonfeeding larvae andreductions in feeding success of older larvae. Our field datareflect those impacts. Studies of the utilization of different seagrass habitats bylarvae in the Laguna Madre. Jim Tolan recently completed aMS at TAMUCC looking at the occurrence of fish larvae and earlyjuveniles in Halodule, Syringodium and adjacentbare bottom in the lower Laguna Madre. He found that highest densitiesof juveniles of most species was in Halodule with littledifference between Syringodium and bare bottom. Early larvalstages were found in all habitats but specific distributions variedby species. In general, early larvae of species which spawn inthe open bay or inshore Gulf, (ie. spotted seatrout and red drum)were found primarily over unvegetated habitat whereas those specieswhich spawn in structured habitat, especially those with demersaleggs (i.e., gobies and silversides), were more common over seagrasses. The primary focus of the rest of our research over the past 6-8years has been the migration of fish larvae from offshore spawninggrounds to estuarine nursery areas with emphasis on transportprocesses involved in ingress through the tidal inlet. Our focushas been on red drum but we have accumulated similar data forall other sciaenids in the collections and a few other speciesas well. Much of this research has been done in cooperation withJoan Holt and several of her students. We have looked at the temporal and spatial (both horizontal andvertical) distribution of larvae over several tidal cycles andfound them most abundant in offshore water, as it pulses in andout of the estuary with each tidal cycle. Densities in estuarinewater are only 10-20% of those in offshore water and those larvaeare generally of the largest size classes we see in the plankton.The larvae change their vertical position in the water columnsuch that they are concentrated near then bottom during the dayand on ebb tide (especially those in estuarine water), and throughout(we think) the water column during the night and on flood tide.Flood tides are generally at night during red drum spawning time,complicating the tidal/diel migration pattern. Larvae also appearto be concentrated at the boundary of the tidal front separatingestuarine water from offshore water. We examined the daily ingress of red drum larvae (and other sciaenidsoccurring in the same samples) over the entire spawning season.We found that the temporal occurrence of larvae was highly pulsed,with much higher densities of larvae occurring in 2-3 day pulseswhich were seen every 10-15 days over the immigration period.Preliminary analysis indicates that the pulses were correlatedwith wind events. Larvae of most other sciaenids occurring atthe same time also showed the same pulsed occurrence, furtherstrengthening the implication of physical control of the distributionpattern. Chris Drescher looked at RNA/DNA in these larvae forher thesis work (details are given in Joan Holt's section) These studies of larval immigration have extended to the nurseryareas where we are looking at post-settlement processes. We haveexamined the spatial and temporal distribution of newly settledred drum larvae throughout the potential nursery area. The larvaewere occasionally found in all sites examined but were much moreabundant and persistent in some sites than others. We suspectthe differences are driven largely by hydrodynamic processes andthat issue is ripe for future research. Jay Rooker has lookedat differences in condition and growth rates among sites and betweenseagrass habitats. Red drum larvae and early juveniles are muchmore abundant in Halodule than Thalassia seagrass but conditionwas not different between those habitats. Andy Soto is lookingat food habitats of red drum and Atlantic croaker in those habitats.We are currently determining mortality rates of red drum larvaeand early juveniles in those habitats but are still working onthe data. A study of predation rates in both habitats in the works. In almost all of these studies we have used the analysis of otolithmicrostructure (ie growth rings) in some way. Our lab is set upto determine both annual age in adults and daily age of larvae.The primary information obtained is age of the individual fishwhich provides an estimate of overall growth rate and the hatchdate of each larva. Jay Rooker has also used the width of theouter most rings to determine recent growth for comparison ofhabitats effects. We previously looked at pinfish growth ratesbetween Halodule and Syringodium habitats in theLaguna (using overall growth rates) and found no difference ingrowth. Otolith analysis is also being used to determine growthrates of adult black drum in the Laguna Madre. Another line of research we are developing, but which has notyet culminated in a funded project, is the study of soundsmade by spawning adult fishes, primarily sciaenids. We havethe hydrophone and sound analysis software and have recorded spawningactivity of several species. Interaction wit other worked in thisfield is encouraging and hopefully leading to funded research. Ongoing Projects - Team Thomas (Staff: C. Detweiler, B. Hawkins, I. Khan, K. Rogowski, T. Sperry,Y. Zhu) Demonstration of a progestin (20-beta-S) receptor on spermmembranes and its characterization in testes is one of thehot (cool!) projects in Thomas' lab. 20-beta-S is the maturationinducing steroid in sciaenids which has been shown to be involvedin final oocyte maturation in Atlantic croaker and spotted seatrout.Regulation of the membrane receptor in testes and sperm membranepreparations is being investigated. Search is on to find a physiologicalfunction of the membrane receptor in the testis and on sperms. Charles Detweiler is currently working on hormonal regulationof sperm motility in Atlantic croaker and spotted seatrout. He is alsoinvestigating possible involvement of calcium channels in sperm motility in croaker. Todd Sperry has characterized androgen receptors in the brainand ovary of croaker. The ovarian androgen receptor(s) hasdifferent characteristics from those of the brain androgen receptor.Once these initial characterizations are completed we will beginto attempt to understand the physiological roles of multiple androgenreceptors in Atlantic croaker. Karen Rogowski's project involves examining the role of prolactinand growth hormone in osmoregulation and reproduction of reddrum and croaker. Her work includes isolation and purificationof the two hormones from pituitary glands, raising of the antibodiesto these hormones, and development and validation of radioimmunoassaysfor the measurement of these hormones. One of Yong Zhu's project is to determine physiological function(s)of somatolactin, a recently discovered hormone in fish. Somatolactinappears to be involved in adaptation of the fish to backgroundand illuminations. A collaborative project with Prof. KatsumiAida's group at the Tokyo University, is underway to constructred drum somatolactin cDNA library and to develop molecular probesfor future studies on somatolactin gene expression. In addition,he is working on the purification of 20-beta-Smembrane receptor from seatrout ovaries. Izhar Khan is involved in the projects on multifactorial neuroendocrine control of gonadotropin secretion in Atlantic croaker. Role of the monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gonadal steroids in the control of gonadotropin release from the pituitary is being investigated. Collaborative work with Prof. Yonathan Zohar's group at the Center of Marine Biotechnology, University of Maryland, Baltimore is in progress to develop molecular probes for the localization and quantification of gonadotropin-releasing hormone mRNAs in croaker brain. Development of a comprehensive marine fish model of neuroendocrine control of gonadotropin release provides the basic framework for our neuroendocrine toxicology program. Beth Hawkins has cloned and sequenced the estrogen and progesteronereceptor genes. She has developed molecular probes to localizeand quantify estrogen receptor mRNA by in situ hybridization.These molecular tools will help us understand the GnRH and estrogenreceptor function in discrete brain areas that are involved inthe control of reproduction in croaker. Interactions of environmental chemicals with the 20-beta-Smembrane receptor. A variety of chemicals have been shownto bind to the membrane receptor. Attempts are being made to purifythis receptor. A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments areplanned to test whether the binding of the chemicals to this receptorcan alter normal receptor functions including final oocyte maturation,ovulation and spawning success. Investigation of life history stages of croaker susceptible toenvironmental endocrine disruptors. This project proposesto study the mechanisms of reproductive impairment by a varietyof chemicals including xenoestrogens and heavy metals during differentstages of gonadal cycle as well as teratogenic effects of thechemicals due to parental exposure. Another major project in reproductive toxicology is on the interactionsof xenoestrogens with androgen and other steroid receptorsusing croaker as a model species.

The graph covers a 14-day period starting 30 September 1996 during whichhigh tides from Tropical Storm Josephine caused considerable coastalflooding and beach erosion. The peak high came at 0158 CDT 07 October1996 with a level of 3' 1" above Mean Sea Level (MSL). At that timeJosephine still bore the ignominious name "Tropical Depression #10", buteven so, erosion from this storm produced the most beach erosion onMustang Island since Hurricane Allen in August 1980, slightly greater thanSeptember 1988's Hurricane Gilbert erosion. The tides are referenced to MSL. Note that almost all of October's tidesare above MSL. October has the highest astronomical tides of theyear. Note also that the storm-elevated water level remained highfor nearly a week and that it fortunately arrived as theastronomical tides were in a diminishing period. One week earlieror later and an additional foot of water would have done evengreater damage.

There were between1000 and 1500 visitors to the Institute that day. Most were treatedto many tours of the facilities, including the popular Fisheriesand Mariculture Laboratory. About 120 people were lucky enoughto win a 2-hour science cruise aboard the R/V KATY, during whichthey sampled the water to discover new and exciting things aboutcreatures that live in the bay. The community of Port Aransas gave strong support to our 50thanniversary celebration. The local newspaper, the South Jetty,ran several stories about the Institute and the Open House forweeks prior to the event. Many local merchants, the Chamber ofCommerce, and the Library gladly allowed us to post announcementsfor the Open House at their locations. The Mayor of Port Aransashonored us by proclaiming May 25th as "University of TexasMarine Science Institute Day." Many civic groups, includingthe Rotary Club, Lions Club, VFW, American Legion, Keep Port AransasBeautiful, and EMS Auxiliary, provided food and drinkfor our guests. EMS personnel were on hand all day. And most ofall, a huge number of residents came out to visit the Institute.

Selections will be made by 1 May 1996. Faculty Research Profiles The opportunities for experiences in various laboratories and researchprograms of faculty and staff in the Marine Science Institute and the Departmentof Marine Science are described below. Each section is written by a facultymember who had active undergraduate participation in the past. They describethe thrust of their programs and specific experience. Marine Chemistry - Dr. E. Ingall The flux of constituents to and from marine sediments exerts a strongcontrol on the composition of the oceans. These fluxes are largely determinedby the chemical, physical and biological transformations that occur in sedimentsshortly after deposition of a particle at the sediment-water interface. Myresearch focuses on understanding these transformations by looking at trends insediment pore water and solid phase chemistry and by directly measuring sedimentfluxes. An undergraduate student working in my lab would be exposed to thevarious analytical techniques needed to characterize the chemistry of marinesediments and waters. The student will then apply these techniques to a smallresearch project where they will gather and interpret the data and present theresults. For example, the REU student, who worked in my lab last year,completed a project on the burial and preservation of the important nutrientphosphorus in sediments from the Black Sea. This work resulted in thepublication of an abstract for 1994 Fall American Geophysical Union meeting. Nutrient Chemistry and Phytoplankton Ecology - Dr. T. Whitledge Research experience for undergraduate students in my laboratory and fieldstudies concern the interaction of nutrient distributions and dynamics withphytoplankton in Texas bays and estuaries and the Gulf of Mexico shelf. These studies investigate the effect of freshwater inflow on the nutrient availability and phytoplankton production in Texas estuaries. This is a continuing project which was started in 1986 that is investigating the biological effects of nutrient inputs from the rivers in terms of phytoplankton production andnutrient regeneration processes. Monthly surveys and biological productivitymeasurements have been conducted for the past six years during periods ofvariable natural inflows and freshwater releases from dams. Extensiveopportunities exist for students to participate in both field and laboratorywork. Other research opportunities will be the effect of a persistent browntide bloom in Laguna Madre. This project is investigating the hydrographic,nutrient and phytoplankton growth relationships which prevail to maintain adense bloom of brown algae sp. in the Laguna Madre for the past three years. Monthly surveys and phytoplankton productivity studies have investigated therole of nutrient enrichment processes in the maintenance of the phytoplanktonbloom conditions throughout the seasonal and annual cycles. Marine Botany - Dr. K. Dunton Undergraduate students have participated in a variety of projects in Dr.Dunton's laboratory for the past six years. Research activities are related tofield and laboratory studies on seagrasses, emergent vascular plants and marinealgae. The students are often paired with either a post-doctoral or graduatestudent under Dr. Dunton's supervision. This provides the student anopportunity to work alongside another young researcher and develop the projecthe/she wishes to pursue. Students are expected to develop their project toaddress a particular question or hypothesis and are encouraged to participatedirectly in the collection of samples and their analysis. Specific techniquesthat students have learned in my laboratory include the measurement ofphotosynthesis in marine plants using oxygen electrodes to construct models ofplant production. These measurements employ a variety of equipment, since theapproach involves both laboratory and field incubations. Other projects aremore field oriented and involve making measurements related to the productionecology of seagrasses or marsh vegetation (growth, biomass, sediment and watercolumn nutrient concentrations, etc.). Still others have included work witharctic kelp to examine nutrient effects on growth, nutrient uptake rates, etc. The diversity of on-going studies have always provided a stimulating atmospherefor undergraduate students in this lab. Zooplankton Ecology - Dr. E. Buskey Research experiences for undergraduates in my laboratory would includelearning techniques for culturing marine phytoplankton and zooplankton, andstudying aspects of their feeding, growth and in the case of some dinoflagellatespecies, their bioluminescence. We keep approximately 20 species ofphytoplankton in continuous culture, and use these species for culturing avariety of protozoan and metazoan zooplankton species, including heterotrophicdinoflagellates, ciliates and copepods. Protozoan species are isolated fromlocal waters and brought into continuous culture for study. We study theirfeeding and growth under controlled laboratory conditions, and employ modernstaining techniques and epifluorescent microscopy for sample enumeration.Studies presently underway include investigation of the effects of a nuisancealgal bloom on the growth and feeding of zooplankton. This small chrysophyte hasbeen present in local waters for the past 3.5 years at population densitiesexceeding 106 cells ml-1, and has caused a major shift in zooplankton communitystructure.Most species of zooplankton seem to grow and feed poorly on thischrysophyte, especially at the high concentrations found in nature. Anotherstudy involves an examination of the relationship between nutrition andbioluminescence in heterotrophic dinoflagellate species. Most otherbioluminescent zooplankton seem to vary little in the brightness of theirbioluminescence, but the bioluminescence of heterotrophic dinoflagellates seemsto vary greatly with their nutritional state and growth rate. This research ispart of a larger effort to produce a model to predict the distribution ofbioluminescence in the sea. Another major thrust of research in my laboratoryis studies of behavior of marine zooplankton, especially predator-preyinteractions. Studies involved in these studies would learn state-of-the-artvideo-computer techniques for image and motion analysis. We have equipmentavailable for videotaping marine zooplankton in situ, and quantifying theirswimming behavior using a computerized motion analysis system. Studies presentlyunderway in my laboratory include a study of swarming behavior in marinecopepods and its role in avoiding predation by fish. This research includesfield work on mangrove-associated tropical copepods at the Smithsonian fieldstation at Carrie Bow Cay. We also are involved in studies of the factorsinfluencing selective feeding of larval fish on microzooplankton. We quantifythe behavior (including escape responses) and visual contrast ofmicrozooplankton prey to determine the factors influencing feeding selectivityat the encounter, attack and capture phases of predatory behavior. Benthic Ecology and Invertebrate Zoology - Dr. P. Montagna Special emphases are being placed on meiofaunal and macrofaunal communitystructure and population biology, and environmental studies. Currently, mylaboratory is very active. I have two Ph.D. students, one masters student, aPostdoc and three technicians. So, there are lot's of people to interact with. There are three programs in which undergraduates can participate. The goal ofone project is to determine the importance of freshwater inflow to Texasestuaries. This is part of a multi-year, interdisciplinary program to determinethe affect of freshwater inflow on secondary productivity in Texas estuaries. The current focus is on the long-term climatic effects on inflow and nutrients,which influence macrofaunal community structure and biomass. The goal ofanother project is to determine the effect of a persistent brown tide bloom inthe Laguna Madre. This is an interdisciplinary effort to determine how browntide has effected the ecosystem. Due to the persistent brown tide, turbidity isnow high, and we are concerned that the seagrass habitat is endangered. Currentstudies focus on how diversity and secondary production are effected and how thefood web has been altered by the presence of the brown tide organism. Inparticular, we are trying to understand the interactions between filter-feedingorganisms and the brown tide algae. The goal of the third project is todetermine sublethal responses to contaminant exposure. This is also a largeinterdisciplinary program to determine if there are long-term consequences ofoil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. The concern is that there may besublethal responses to production that have not been detected. Our studyfocuses on the response of meiofaunal community structure, harpacticoidreproduction, genetics, and life history patterns, and meiofaunal toxicityresponses that are a result of environmental perturbations. Ecology of Developing Fishes - Dr. L. Fuiman Research projects in Dr. Lee A. Fuiman's laboratory focus on the ecology ofdeveloping fishes. Most of these studies require rearing of various fishspecies from eggs, through larvae, to juveniles. Undergraduate experiences herewill begin with the methods of small-scale fish culture, including cultivationof algae, rotifers, and crustaceans. This will expose students to a variety oflaboratory practices (preparation of sterile media, water-quality testing,routine maintenance of cultures, data recording). In the process of rearing thefish, the undergraduate student will become acquainted with the life cycle ofthe food organisms (algae, rotifers, crustaceans) as well as the development ofthe fish. Beyond fish culture duties, the student will participate in one ormore ongoing research projects on the ecology of developing fishes. These arelikely to include tests of the development of sensory system function in fishes(including the visual and mechanosensory systems), measurements of swimmingperformance, and analyses anti-predator responses. The student will work withDr. Fuiman and his graduate students in data acquisition and analysis. Theseresearch projects usually involve video recordings of experiments. Data areacquired from the video tapes by a computerized interface. Thus, students maygain experience in image analysis (including morphometry) and motion analysis(frame-by-frame digitization) in the process of data acquisition. Furthercomputing experience will come during data analysis. There may also be anopportunity for field research on the ecology of fishes. This may includesurvey research (collections of specimens at various sites) or experimentalfield work. Experiences here might include work with plankton nets, seines,trawls, and experimental enclosures. Larval Fish Ecology and Larval Fishes - Dr. J. Holt Opportunities for research in larval fish ecology and aquaculture areavailable in G. Joan Holt's labs at the Fisheries and Mariculture facility ofthe Marine Science Institute. At present there are four students, twotechnicians and a postdoc studying many aspects of marine fish larvae who wouldbe available to interact with undergraduates working in the lab. Areas ofongoing research in which students may participate include: Studies of the effects of changing salinity on spawning, egg and larvadevelopment of spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus. Investigations into the requirements for spawning and raising tropical reeffishes of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Evaluation of the role of microbial ecology in larval fish nutrition. Biochemical measures of fish growth including RNA/DNA for assessment ofhabitat quality and nutritional status. Field studies focusing on the importance of seagrass beds as nursery habitatfor larval and juvenile fish. Larval fish feeding studies including the effects of prey behavior anddensity on food selectivity by larval fish. Many undergraduates have worked in my lab during the summer and have gone onto graduate studies in biology or marine biology. Students are allowed to beactive participants in research projects and are encouraged to take part indiscussions about the results and planning for future studies. Theseopportunities allow undergraduate students to explore their latent curiosity inmarine science and to amplify this interest into defined career goals. Reproductive Fish Physiology - Dr. P. Thomas Students would receive broad training in reproductive fish physiology withan emphasis on the terminal stages of the reproductive cycle, final oocytematuration and spawning. The proposed project draws on previous experience withtraining two undergraduate students, Toshma Thomas (Jackson College, 1990) andClaire Fernandez (Texas A&M University, 1991). The spotted seatrout(Cynoscion nebulosus), a well established model of reproductive endocrinology,will be used for the experimental work. Students would receive theoretical andpractical instruction in all aspects of the project and then gradually assumegreater responsibility for conducting their own research. Adult seatrout withfully grown gonads will be collected on their spawning grounds and acclimated tolaboratory conditions. Training on the effective and humane care of wild fishfor research purposes will be prioritized. Several methods to sex fish will beevaluated. Earlier in the reproductive season vitellogenin, a female specificyolk protein precursor, and 11 ketotestosterone, the male sex steroid hormonewill be measured in the blood. The sex and stage of gametogenesis will bedetermined by intragonadal catheterization once the gonads have begun torecrudesce. Fish will be induced to spawn by the administration ofluteinizing-hormone releasing hormone analog. Spawning success, fecundity andfertilization success will be determined and the fertilized eggs will be exposedto various environmental factors until 4 days after hatching when the larvaebegin feeding. Environmental factors such as salinity, temperature, ammonialevels and UV radiation would be investigated and biological endpoints such ashatching success, percent deformities and survival could be measured. Studentswould be expected to develop their own research projects on reproductivesuccess. A separate series of experiments would investigate the hormonalcontrol of final oocyte maturation using an in vitro germinal vesicle breakdownbioassay technique. Initially students would repeat structure-activity steroidswith hormones to learn the morphological changes associated with final oocytematuration and the concepts of hormone specificity at the receptor level. Afterwards students would be encouraged to develop their own research projectson subjects such as the role of "priming" with gonadotropin on hormoneresponsiveness, role of gap junctions, protein and RNA synthesis and ionchannels. Well designed studies on the regulation of this process would be ofconsiderable scientific interest and publishable. Finally, students wouldobtain broader perspective on reproductive physiology by attending the weeklyjournal club/research meetings in Thomas' laboratory and by learning about adozen different projects being conducted by students and postdoctoral fellows inthe laboratory. Fisheries and Mariculture - Dr. C. Arnold In the Fisheries and Mariculture Program there are several professionalbiologists and graduate students which the students will spend some part of thesummer working with. This will give the students a chance to participate in thevarious areas of research. As one of the state's most diversified mariculturefacilities, students are given a unique opportunity to be cross-trained invarious aspects of the culture of marine species which include: Culture of unicellular microalgae Mass culture of marine algae and rotifers Maturation and reproduction of marine fish Production and care of larval and juvenile fish and shrimp Maintenance of marine species in intensive culture systems Fish and shrimp disease diagnostics UTMSI offers exposure to a wide variety of scientific and culture expertiseallowing exposure to a broad area of the marine science as well as experiencethat is applicable to the commercial mariculture industry.

Theexact program will be determined by the student's interest, the research fieldof his supervisor and the required courses. At present, faculty work in thebasic and applied aspects of the four marine science subdisciplines: marinebiology/ecology, marine chemistry, marine geology and physical oceanography.Marine science is the study of the marine environment including marineorganisms, processes, and systems so each student's program will involve directcontact with the sea, its plants and animals and/or the physical and chemicalforces which drive it. Facilities for graduate work in marine science are based in Austin and at theshore-side laboratory of the Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas, Texas.The Institute is located on the Aransas Pass ship channel among the dunes at thetip of Mustang Island, with easy access to bays, beaches, and the Gulf ofMexico. Environmental systems nearby include the hypersaline Laguna Madre,seagrass meadows, fresh and salt water marshes, and the continental shelf. ThePort Aransas facility offers research vessels, a specialized library,classrooms, laboratories, and flowing seawater system. Course work taken in Austin often includes supporting work in other naturalscience departments. At least one academic year is normally spent on the maincampus. Most students then reside in Port Aransas while they undertake thesis ordissertation research at the Marine Science Institute. These students also takeadditional courses there, including the majority of their core courses, otherorganized courses, seminars, and training cruises. Graduate student apartmentsare available at the Institute. Admission requirements: The student's undergraduate training should includetwenty four semester hours in one of the life or physical sciences. At leasttwelve of these hours must be in upper-division work. Adequate preparation inmathematics is expected of all students.

The student's program must include at least one core course in threeof the marine science subdisciplines mentioned above. Core courses are listed inthe Graduate Catalog and in the list attached to this document. A minor, whichis obligatory in every Masters degree program, consists of a minimum of sixhours in supporting work outside the major program. The relative number of hoursin the major or minor fields, as well as the nature of the supporting work, isdetermined in consultation with the graduate advisor. A thesis is required andwill account for six hours of the total program. The Masters thesis shall be theproduct of original research. Doctor of Philosophy Degree Program Four to six years of graduate study, which will include original research andpractical experience as a Teaching Assistant, are required to complete the Ph.D.in Marine Science. The Doctoral program should contain no fewer than 18 hours ofacceptable graduate work in marine science and no less than 9 hours insupporting areas, in addition to dissertation and supervised teaching. Of thisminimal requirement of 18 hours, 12 hours of core courses must be completed,including at least one core course in each of the marine science subdisciplinesmentioned above. Core courses are listed in the Graduate Catalog and in the listattached to this document. Supporting work from outside the major program (areof specialty) may include courses taken at another institution. To be eligiblefor admission to candidacy, all doctoral students must complete their corecourses and pass a qualifying examination in their area of specialization. Thisexamination will also confirm that students are competent in the other threesubdisciplines. Candidacy requirements should be completed by February of thesecond year of a student's program if they hold a Master's degree and byFebruary of the third year if they entered the program with a Bachelor's degree.All doctoral candidates write a dissertation based on the results of theiroriginal research, and make a formal oral defense of the document to completethe degree requirements. Area of Speciality Each graduate student will normally select one of the four subdisciplines as anarea of specialization. Based on the present faculty potential, marine biology,marine chemistry, and marine geology would be the Department's strongest areasof specialization for students. As an example, a doctoral student might base themajority of his/her corse work and dissertation topic in marine biology. Thedissertation research would frequently integrate one or more of the othersubdisciplines studied. Students opting for a major thrust in marine chemistryor marine geology would follow a similar program with chemistry or geologyforming the major part of their curriculum. Similarly, masters students wouldspecialize in one subdiscipline.

Amos (more information) Research Associate, The University of Texas at Austin, Marine ScienceInstitute. Physical Oceanography Tony Amos has been with The University of Texas Marine Science Institute inPort Aransas for the past 20 years. His oceanographic career has spanned 34years with research expeditions to all the world's oceans and many of its seas,including 30 cruises to the Antarctic and five to the Arctic. He is a holder ofthe US Antarctic Service Medal. In Texas he has studied several aspects ofnear-shore and bay and estuarine processes (circulation, currents, hydrography,and tides) and has conducted a long-term study of the barrier island beacheswhich is now in its 19th year. To date 2,535 separate surveys have beenconducted, counting birds, people, marine debris, and measuring beach widths,dune erosion/accretion, sea temperature and salinity. In addition, over 300separate surveys have been made specifically to assess the marine debrisproblem. Amos has served on a National Academy of Sciences/National ResearchCouncil Marine Board Committee on Shipborne Waste, and various EPA, MMS, andother committees on the marine debris problem. He is a member of the New YorkAcademy of Science, the American Geophysical Union, The American OrnithologicalUnion, the Texas Marine Mammal Stranding Network, the Sea Turtle Stranding andSalvage Network, and an Honorary Lifetime Member of the Texas Marine EducatorsAssociation. He is the Port Aransas Cooperative Weather Observer for theNational Weather Service, and writes for the Port Aransas South Jetty, TheCorpus Christi Caller-Times, and the South Texas Fishing News papers. Recentlyhe was selected as one of the "Texas Twenty" by Texas Monthly magazinefor his work on the environment. Research Interests Current research interests include the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources(AMLR) program, now entering its eighth year of field study. Amos' contributionto AMLR is a survey of the physical oceanography of the Elephant Island region,which is a major area of krill (Euphausia superba) concentration, andsupports a krill fishery with potential to expand and target other species.Because krill supports numerous predators (seals, whales, penguins, and flyingseabirds), the multidisciplinary AMLR project seeks to understand therelationship between krill and its predators and the physical, chemical, andbiological environment. Work on the Texas beaches continues and now includes a weekly survey of aremote barrier island to search for nesting and stranded sea turtles and a studyof the standing stock of marine debris on an undisturbed beach.

Fisheries and Mariculture Natural spawning of marine finfish and shrimp, high density water reusesystems, larval fish ecology. Research Interest To understand the life histories of marine fish and shrimp; involvesthe study of the various stages in the life cycle. Research into the parameterswhich regulate the natural spawning of the adults is important to the studyof all other life stages. It is also important that the spawning requirementsbe well defined for each species being considered as an aquaculture species.The high cost of land suitable for aquaculture and the environmental problemsof pond culture dictates the development of high density water reuse systems.The development of low cost, low maintenance systems is of special researchinterest. The study of larval finfish in the shallow water grass flatsand factors which affect their distribution and survival is part of theoverall goal of understanding the life cycle of marine organisms.

Microbial Ecology/Biogeochemistry Microbial food webs; carbon and nitrogen cycling; bacterial growth andmetabolism; diagenesis of organic matter Research Interests Microorganisms have a profound impact on the composition of the Earth'satmosphere, waters and soils, and thereby influence all life processes. Microbesplay key roles in the cycling of bioactive elements, such as C and N, in aquaticecosystems and in the transfer of these elements and energy into complex foodwebs. Bacterial growth and activity in these systems is supported primarily bynon-living organic matter in both dissolved and particulate form. In the oceans,dissolved organic matter (DOM) is by far the most abundant form of organiccarbon whereas in rivers and estuaries particulate organic matter (POM) is alsoan important substrate supporting bacterial growth. DOM and POM are chemicallycomplex and are derived from a variety of sources. A primary research objectiveis to characterize the compositions, sources, microbial transformations, andfates of DOM and POM. In the open oceans, carbohydrates are major reactivecomponents of the DOM and ongoing studies are investigating rates of bacterialutilization of carbohydrates and the factors controling bacterial growth andrespiration. Research on DOM and POM in the Amazon and Mississippi Riversindicates that it is derived from decaying vascular plant material in soils. TheDOM and POM in the rivers is rich in aromatic components, such as tannins andlignins, and is highly resistant to bacterial oxidation. Bacterial growth inthese systems is relatively inefficient and is limited by the availability oforganic carbon. Selected Publications Benner, R., S. Opsahl, G. Chin-Leo, J.E. Richey, and B.R.

Much of this research makes use of videomicrocinematography and automated video-computer methods for image and motionanalysis. I am particularly interested in the role of photoreception inmediating potential predator-prey interactions within the plankton, includingthe role of bioluminescence in nocturnal predator-prey interactions, the role ofvision in the feeding of larval fish on zooplankton and the role of sunlight invertical migration of oceanic plankton to avoid visual predators. I am presentlyinvolved in studies of behavior and sensory perception in heterotrophicdinoflagellates, and in studies of the adaptive value of swarming and schoolingbehavior to zooplankton living in mangrove habitats in Belize. I am alsointerested in the role of planktonic grazers in harmful algal bloom dynamics;several ongoing studies suggest that a breakdown in grazer controls and changesin the planktonic food web have contributed to the unprecedented persistenceof the brown tide' algal bloom in Laguna Madre.

Ph.D., University of Alaska (1985), M.S., Western WashingtonUniversity (1977), B.S., University of Maine-Orono (1975). Marine Botany/Plant Physiological Ecology/Aquatic Food Webs Physiological ecology of seagrasses and macroalgae; photosynthesis in marineplants; biology of high latitude kelps; biogeography of arctic marine flora andfauna; use of stable isotopes in the elucidation of carbon flow in aquatic foodwebs. Research Interests Marine plants, whether they include the kelp of the Polar Ocean or theseagrasses of the subtropical Gulf of Mexico, are extremely valuable resourcesto coastal ecosystems. They also possess amazingly similar seasonal patterns ofgrowth, exhibit circannual rhythms, and use stored carbon reserves in theinitiation of new tissue growth. In the Arctic, kelp display uniquephysiological adaptations to life in a light-limited environment. Some of theseare just now being described; others, such as the phenomenon of dark carbonfixation, remain somewhat of an enigma and are the focus of new research.Estuarine seagrasses face similar problems with respect to degradation of theirlight environment that result from decreases in water transparency due toindustrial activities and municipal development. New funded projects include,in the Arctic, the effects of UV radiation on kelp photosynthesis, in the Antarctic,physiological mechanisms of cold temperature tolerance in polar macroalgae; inTexas, the development of models to predict seagrass productivity and plant carbonbalance as a function of the in situ light environment and the effect offreshwater inflows onthe production ecology of a local subtropical estuarine marsh.Our work on the role of marine macrophytes inaquatic food webs using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes is also continuing,and is currently focused on the Antarctic Peninsula and in south Texas.

Research Interests The past two decades have seen the biology of fish larvae blossom intoan exciting field of research. These tiny, usually transparent early lifestages had been neglected because of the difficulties in collecting, identifying,and maintaining them. With many of these problems solved, field and laboratorystudies are leading to an understanding of how processes affecting larvalfishes may have serious consequences for populations of adult fishes. Survivalthrough the larval phase is, of course, necessary if populations are tocontinue. Like adult fishes, larvae must find food and avoid predators.However, unlike adults, they must do so during a period when their abilitiesvary due to morphological, physiological, and behavioral changes that accrueduring development. Recent and ongoing investigations involve both laboratory and fieldexperiments on the importance of predation in the life of fish larvae.Behavioral experiments, recorded on video tape for subsequent frame-by-framemotion analysis, provide details of the interaction between predators andfish larvae as prey. Changes in responsiveness and response effectivenessof larvae attacked by various predators are studied throughout the developmentalperiod. Parallel studies of sensory and locomotor development help determinehow behavior might be constrained by morphology. Variations in environmentalconditions (e.g., temperature, salinity, and pollutants) are also investigatedfor their influence on larva behavior. Field experiments are used to formecological interpretations for the laboratory results. Selected Publications Fuiman, L.A. 1994.

Water Chemistry/Ecosystem Dynamics Nitrogen dynamics in water column and sediments, nutrient-organism interactions in coastal ecosystems. Research Interest Nitrogen cycling is important in coastal and estuarine ecosystems because nitrogen is extensively transformed to a variety of forms, by autotrophic and heterotrophic processes in the water and sediments, and is a nutrient that often limits the growth of phytoplankton and other plants in these relatively shallow systems. Internal regeneration is a dominant process providing nitrogen to plants whereas denitrification causes available nitrogen to be lost from estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Major goals are to understand and quantify the biotic mechanisms and rates of nitrogen remineralization and the fate of the remineralized products in the water and at the sediment-water interface. This information is needed to understand nitrogen biogeochemistry and also to quantify the relative importance of internal nitrogen regeneration compared to inputs from other sources in these highly productive ecosystems. Nitrogen regeneration and transformation rates in the water and at the sediment-water interface are measured with 15-N as a tracer. Ammonium concentrations and isotope ratios are measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Denitrification rates will be determined using a Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometer. Nitrogen cycling studies will be conducted in Laguna Madre and other coastal ecosystems. Selected Publications Gardner, W.S., R. Benner, R.M.W. Amon, J.B. Cotner, Jr., J.F. Cavaletto, and J.R.

Larval Fish Ecology/Marine Aquaculture Feeding dynamics, nutrition, ichthyoplankton transport and recruitment, earlylife history of reef fishes, RNA-DNA ratio, condition indices, osmoregulation. Research Interest Many physical, chemical and biological factors can potentially affect growth andsurvival rates during the larval and juvenile stages of marine fish. My researchfocuses on biological and physical factors that limit or alter larval fishgrowth and development. This information is critical for understanding variablesurvival in natural populations and for maximizing production in aquaculturesystems. Current research using this approach includes several studies designedto decipher trophic interactions of larval fish, identify ontogenic changes innutritional requirements, and explore biochemical techniques useful fordetermining physiological condition. Specific research projects include investigations of: 1) the influence ofsalinity on feeding rates, development of osmoregulatory ability, and thesignificance of free amino acids during osmotic adjustment, 2) the role ofmicrobial ecology in culture systems and microbes as a source of exogenousenzymes for larval digestion, 3) lipid requirements with specific interest inlong chain fatty acids, 4) reproduction, larval growth, transport andrecruitment of Caribbean coral-reef fish, and 5) dynamics of larval fish visualpredation on zooplankton.

Research Interests The flux of constituents to and from marine sediments exerts a strong control onthe composition of the oceans. These fluxes are largely determined by thechemical, physical and biological transformations that occur in sedimentsshortly after deposition of a particle at the sediment-water interface. Myresearch focuses on understanding these transformations by looking at trends insediment pore water and solid phase chemistry and by directly measuring sedimentfluxes. Current research includes: 1) determining the effect of bottom wateranoxia on the burial and preservation of reactive phosphorus in marinesediments, 2) identifying the specific types of organic phosphorus compoundspresent in marine sediments, 3) developing realistic computer simulations ofsediment chemistry, 4) characterizing the processes at the sediment-waterinterface in sediments of the Gulf of Mexico and the Peru Shelf in order tounderstand phosphorite formation and organic matter diagenesis.

Benthic Ecology Population and community ecology, trophic dynamics and environmental studies. Research Interests There are three size classes of bottom dwelling organisms: microbes, meiofauna,and macrofauna. These benthic organisms modify or influence most geological,chemical, and physical properties of shallow marine ecosystems. Researchprograms are structured to study the relationships between the three groups oforganisms and the environment. This includes studies of invertebrate-microbialinteractions, benthic metabolism and nutrient recycling, population andcommunity ecology and energy flow within the benthos. The projects range fromestuarine to oceanic research. The estuarine work is focusing on the importanceof freshwater inflow in structuring benthic communities and maintaining benthicproductivity. This research also addresses questions about the utilization ofbenthos and benthic habitats by living resources. The oceanic research addressesquestions about long-term sublethal effects on benthic populations due tochronic low-level contamination. Recent Publications Mannino, A., and P.A. Montagna. 1996.

Fish Reproductive Physiology/Marine Toxicology Purification and molecular actions of hormones and their receptors,environmental endocrinology, applications of endocrinology to fish culture;biochemical and environmental toxicology of marine fishes, especially reproductiveand endocrine toxicology. Research Interests Most of the complex series of morphological, physiological, behavioraland developmental changes that occur during the teleost reproductive cycleare thought to be under endocrine control. However, the hormonal regulationof many reproductive processes remains poorly understood, especially inmarine perciform fish, which represent the largest order of extant vertebrates.Extensive research on Atlantic croaker and spotted seatrout in our laboratoryhas identified several novel features of the endocrine control of reproductionin these marine perciform fish, particularly during final oocyte maturationand spawning. Research is being conducted on the purification and biologicalactions of pituitary hormones and steroid hormone receptors, the cloning,sequencing and expression of their mRNAs, the neuroendocrine control ofgonadotropin secretion, the biosynthesis and molecular actions of steroidhormones, the physiological regulation of steroid hormone receptors, theendocrine control of egg growth, spermatogenesis and meiotic maturation,and applications of endocrinology to fish culture. The goal of this researchis to develop a comprehensive model of the endocrine control of reproductionfor representatives of this important vertebrate group. The release of toxic chemicals into marine and estuarine environmentshas increased dramatically as a result of rapid industrialization in manyregions of the world, but the long-term ecological consequences of increasedenvironmental contamination are not known. The development of early-warningbiomarkers of pollutant exposure may enable deleterious changes in theenvironment to be detected early enough so that remedial actions can betaken. Our research emphasis has been on the development of endocrine biomarkersof impaired reproductive function in marine fish because relatively lowpollutant concentrations can disrupt fish reproduction with serious consequencesfor the long-term survival of the entire population. The mechanisms ofchemical interference with reproductive endocrine function, the physiologicalfunctions of ovarian and hepatic metal-binding proteins, and the role ofmaternal transfer in the embryotoxicity of chemicals are under investigation.In addition, reproductive biomarkers are being evaluated in fish collectedfrom contaminated sites in Texas and California.

Marine Chemistry/Chemical Oceanography Nutrient chemistry; nitrogen cycle; biogeochemical processes; dynamics ofcoastal ocean and estuaries; eutrophication and oxygen depletion; nutrientuptake and regeneration; harmful algal blooms. Research Interests § The variation of freshwater inflow into South Texas bays and estuaries isbeing examined to document the effects upon the biological communities. Monthlymeasurements of hydrography, nutrients and primary productivity are collected inthe Nueces/Corpus Christi Estuary to estimate the enhancement of biologicalproductivity created by freshwater releases. § The appearance of a "brown tide" algal bloom that has persistedfor almost six years changed the clear waters of Laguna Madre to a darkbrown color. Samples are collected in upper and lower Laguna Madre tomonitor the severity of the bloom conditions and to relate the distribution ofthe organism to physical, chemical and biological processes. The appearance ofpersistent algal blooms have become more common in the U.S. and internationallyduring the past ten years. We are working with the National Assessment ofNutrient Enrichment (NANE) and Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) programs of NOAA tobetter understand why these blooms are fouling coastal and estuarine waters,contaminating sea food and killing marine fish and mammals. § More than 50% of the area of the U.S. drains into theMississippi/Atchafalaya River which has a greatly increased organic and nutrientload as a result of human population increases and widespread use offertilizers. The resulting nutrient overenrichment of the river has createdareas of low oxygen near the bottom on the Gulf of Mexico continental shelf.We are studying thedistribution of nutrients and their uptake by phytoplankton near the river deltaand their later regeneration in the zone of low oxygen. § The Chukchi Sea north of Bering Strait receives northward flowing waterfrom the North Pacific Ocean after transiting the Bering Sea. These waterscontain large quantities of nutrients which promote very high primary productionrates and ultimately feed the large populations of seals, whales and walrus.However, these coastal waters of Alaska are undergoing dramatic changes withrespect to contamination and over-harvesting and are important in assessing theextent of greenhouse warming and climate change. The atmospheric transport ofpesticides and other chemicals into the Arctic accumulates in ice and later inorganisms as they progress up the food chain. Russian and American scientistsare cooperating in programs to investigate the ecology of the Bering/ChukchiSeas and to determine the changes that may be occurring due to human activities.

Marine Geology High-resolution and multichannel seismic reflection data acquisition,processing, and interpretation; continental slope, sedimentology. Research Interest The history of the development of continental margins is containedin their sediments. The study of continental slope sedimentaryrecords includes direct sampling and observation of water columnphysical and chemical parameters, sediment mineralogy, texture,and structures, micropaleontological content, geochemical andisotopic composition, and acoustic characteristics. Remote sensing(marine geophysics) is used to observe sediment thicknesses, stratigraphicrelationships of sedimentary units, structural context and style,and acoustic characteristics related to diagenetic phenomena.From a combination of remote sensing and ground truth data (cores),research projects are designed to interpret the history of depositional,diagenetic, tectonic, and environmental conditions and processesthat have created the existing features of continental margins.The same tools of sediment sampling and analysis, and seismicreflection profiling apply to the study of the history of deeperoceanic as well as shallower coastal environments.

Ecosystem Function The dynamics of individual organisms, species populations, andecosystems, and on the ecosystem structure resulting from thesedynamics. Research Interests Most of my work is on the dynamics of individual organisms, speciespopulations, and ecosystems, and on the ecosystem structure resultingfrom these dynamics (and, in turn, the effects of the ecosystem'sstructure on its dynamics). Primarily, this is being done on coralreefs, and especially on the causes and patterns of coral colorchange, including bleaching, and the effects of such changes oncoral colony dynamics and thereby on reef dynamics. Data showingchange in coral color (including bleaching) have been gatheredduring several seasons over the last 4 years using a techniquewhich I have developed (and continue to elaborate and improve).Observed color change patterns are being compared to patternsof change of several environmental factors which are possiblecauses of these changes in color. Growth rate of coral is knownto decrease when the extreme color change referred to as bleachingoccurs. Also, I have developed stereo techniques to evaluate thegrowth rates of coral colonies, and am working on the correlationsbetween coral change patterns and the growth rates of the corals. Some of my ecosystem work also involves experimental use of aquaticcommunities and their dynamics when small samples, along witha variety of levels of possibly important resources, are sealedin glass and allowed to exchange only energy with the rest ofthe world (mostly light in and heat out). Finally, I am also working on knowledge based multimedia to beused as information resources and for educational purposes inwith respect to biological concepts and dynamics.

Amos' research in 1995/1996 was centered in two main areas; the Texas coastal zone and Antarctica. Locally, he completed the Corpus Christi Bay National Estuary Program (CCBNEP) project researching the history and trends of the incidence of bay/marine (anthropogenic) debris, continued the NOAA-sponsored program to monitor remote San Jose Island for sea-turtle stranding and nesting, and continued to survey the Mustang Island Gulf beach and monitor tides, currents, and weather at the UTMSI Pier Laboratory with real-time displays at the Visitor�s Center and the UTMSI Office. In Antarctica he participated in year 7 or the NOAA/NMFS program Antarctic Living Marine Resources (AMLR) aboard the R/V YUZHMORGEOLOGIYA. Dr. Connie R. Arnold's research has emphasized the developmentof sustainable mariculture through responsible stewardship ofmarine resources and the development of culture technologies.Closed system research has included the evaluation of the interactionof feeds and closed system dynamics, the demonstration of recirculationsystems technologies for the production of Penaeus vannamei,and the development of large scale larval rearing protocols forSciaenops ocellatus and Ocyurus chrysurus. Nutritionresearch has emphasized the continued development and testingof "low pollution" feeds for marine species such asSciaenops ocellatus and Penaeus vannamei. Work onearly life history of fishes continued with an active field programinvolving studies of larval transport and nursery area utilizationby red drum and other sciaenids. Results suggest that events duringthe pelagic larval stage are quite important in regulating recruitmentto the nursery and ultimately population size in red drum. Additionalanalysis of these data is currently underway. Work with cobia(ling) is continuing with efforts to capture and transport additionaladults to enhance the population for spawning. Dr. Ronald H. Benner's research group investigated various aspects of the carbon and nitrogen cycles in the oceans, estuaries, and rivers. A new conceptual model, the Size-Reactivity Continuum Model, of the cycling of organic matter in aquatic environmental was developed. Studies of the microbial utilization and chemical composition of organic matter of varying sizes revealed that macromolecular material is more reactive and less diagenetically altered than smaller molecules. These findings are contrary to the common notions that small molecules cycle rapidly while macromolecular material is recalcitrant. Dr. Edward J. Buskey's research group has completed studiesof swarming behavior of copepods in the mangrove prop root environmentin Belize. By forming these aggregations, the copepods are protectedfrom predators, avoid being dispersed into unfavorable habitatsand increase their opportunities for mating. They have also continuedstudies of protozooplankton in the Gulf of Mexico, including laboratorystudies of sensory perception and feeding behavior of heterotrophicdinoflagellates. Dr. Kenneth H. Dunton's lab is currently focused on a variety of projects ranging from the High Arctic to the Antarctic. These projects include collaborators from several institutions and have resulted in the development of new approaches and techniques for measuring marine primary productivity in aquatic plants. In the Arctic, Dr. Dunton is collaborating with Dr. Pat Neale from the Smithsonian on support from NSF to evaluate the response of kelp to UV radiation, the project incorporates in situ (under ice) measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence to examine UV effects as well as experimental manipulations of the plants in the laboratory. In the Antarctic, Dr. Dunton is collaborating with Dr. Val Gerard (SUNY of Stony Brook) and Dr. Ian Davison (Univ. Maine) on the adaptations made by polar seaweeds to maintain high rates of production at cold temperatures. On this NSF funded project, Dr. Dunton has developed a new approach for measurement of photosynthesis using the stable isotope, carbon -13. In Texas, Dr. Dunton�s work on seagrasses has expanded to include the development of integrative model to estimate seagrass productivity in the Laguna Madre. This work is being conducted with colleagues from Texas Parks and Wildlife and Texas A&M University under funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Dr. Lee A. Fuiman's laboratory expanded its work on the implications of morphological development for ecological interactions of fish larvae by studying the effects of a model pesticide. In collaboration with Dr. Peter Thomas� laboratory, they measured significant changes in the sensory and locomotor abilities of Atlantic croaker larvae whose parents had been exposed to very low levels of the pesticide. These sublethal effects could be ultimately lethal in an ecological sense because they compromise the ability of larvae to find sufficient food to survive and to escape from predators they encounter. Dr. G. Joan Holt's research group developed methodologyfor rearing two coral reef species Lysmata wurdemani andEquetus umbrosus. A manuscript describing larval developmentin E. umbrosus compared to the closely related speciesE. acuminatus will show definitive differences in larvaldevelopment in the two species, resolving a taxonomic dilemma.A major component of this year's research was a red drum transportand recruitment study with Scott Holt. Spawning periodicity andlarval abundances provide the first data for the entire spawningevent. Forty-two percent of planktonic larvae were experiencingsome degree of food depravation, but only two percent were starvedor in poor condition. Variation in the biochemical condition oflarvae collected in estuarine seagrass was due to fish size andwater temperature, but not to differences in seagrass species. Dr. Ellery D. Ingall's research has focused on the cyclingof nutrients in the ocean. Recent studies have demonstrated thatoxygen depleted bottom waters greatly enhance phosphorus regenerationfrom sediments. Based on these observations a positive feedbackbetween water column anoxia, enhanced benthic phosphorus regeneration,and marine productivity has been proposed and incorporated intoa large scale mathematical model of the ocean. The feedback effecthelps explain the widespread accumulation of organic-rich marinesediments deposited from anoxic waters that are observed in thegeologic record. Dr. Paul A. Montagna's research focuses on the importanceof benthic invertebrates in the ecology of the coastal zone. Thisyear, he has proved that grazing by meiofauna, the smallest invertebrates,can control the rates of many microbial processes in natural anddisturbed sediments. He has also shown that small clams and snailsare good indicators of the importance of freshwater inflow tomaintain productivity in Texas estuaries. Dr. Curtis A. Suttle's group has developed a number ofnew approaches for investigating the roles of viruses in marineecosystems. These include a protocol for staining viruses so thatthey can be visualized by epifluorescence microscopy, using fluorescentlytagged viruses to identify and quantify specific types of cellsthat are susceptible to viral infection, and developing oligonucleotideprimers for virus DNA polymerase genes that allow the DNA fromknown and unknown viruses to be amplified from seawater and identified.These methods have helped to investigate the dynamics of hostand virus populations in nature, and to determine the existenceof previously unknown viruses in seawater. Richard K. Tinnin heads the Marine Education Services Program.MES hosts over 10,000 students each year who stay in the dormsand participate in research vessel cruises and field trips tothe surrounding marine habitats. One thousand teachers last yearparticipated in 17 weekend teacher workshops. The Visitors Centerhosted over 40,000 visitors who enjoyed seven marine aquariums,watched videos in the auditorium and toured the main laboratorydisplays. MES is in the 2nd year of a 3 year pilot program foran elementary education project, Marine Activities, Resourcesand Education (MARE) in cooperation with The Lawrence Hall ofScience, UC Berkeley. Six Texas schools are pilot testing thehabitat oriented curriculum and writing Gulf coast activitiesto be included in this exciting teacher training project. TheMARE curriculum uses the ocean as a central theme to link alltraditional subject matter in an interdisciplinary approach. Dr. Peter Thomas' group has recently identified a steroidreceptor on croaker sperm. Steroid binding activity was previouslyfound in the sperm of humans and other mammals, but the bindinghas not been characterized. Thomas' group have fully characterizedthe steroid receptor in croaker sperm, the first extensive characterizationof such a receptor in any vertebrate species. The function ofthis receptor is unknown at present, but may be associated withsperm activation. Previous studies had indicated that somatolactin,a pituitary hormone recently discovered in fish, is involved inbackground adaptation. Further research has demonstrated thatpurified somatolactin can act directly on chromatophores in fishscales to cause melanin aggregation. These results suggest thatsomatolactin enables fish to adapt to different backgrounds byaltering chromatophore function and hence body pigmentation. Dr. Terry E. Whitledge's work has focused on the relationshipof nutrient availability and growth of the Texas brown tide inthe upper and lower Laguna Madre. Experimental ponds were usedto determine how different types of nitrogen fertilizers affectrelative species composition, biomass and growth rates of thebrown tide and other phytoplankton as a potential means of biologicalcontrol. Research was also continued on the enhanced productivityand ecological effects of proposed freshwater and wastewater diversionsinto Nueces Bay and Rincon Delta.

The graph covers a 14-day period starting 30 September 1996 during whichhigh tides from Tropical Storm Josephine caused considerable coastalflooding and beach erosion. The peak high came at 0158 CDT 07 October1996 with a level of 3' 1" above Mean Sea Level (MSL). At that timeJosephine still bore the ignominious name "Tropical Depression #10", buteven so, erosion from this storm produced the most beach erosion onMustang Island since Hurricane Allen in August 1980, slightly greater thanSeptember 1988's Hurricane Gilbert erosion. The tides are referenced to MSL. Note that almost all of October's tidesare above MSL. October has the highest astronomical tides of theyear. Note also that the storm-elevated water level remained highfor nearly a week and that it fortunately arrived as theastronomical tides were in a diminishing period. One week earlieror later and an additional foot of water would have done evengreater damage.

Corvallis Disposal is dedicated to the concept and practice of environmental preservation. We are constantly seeking new technologies and services which will not only preserve our environment, but provide more efficient and economical collection, recycling, and disposal of waste materials. By recycling, less energy is required than when using virgin resources, both in the initial extraction of resources and in manufacturing new products. Recycling conserves valuable natural resources and saves millions of dollars of valuable materials that would otherwise be buried in landfills. For the environment, processing recyclables into new goods produces far less air, water and land pollution. Recycling costs money, but it is still a good investment. The revenue derived by selling your recyclable materials offsets about 20% of the costs of offering the service. These short-termed costs are offset by long-term gains of saving resources, energy and landfill space. By changing our destructive habits we will begin to sustain a healthier environment and preserve our finite resources for future generations. This is why Corvallis Disposal has made a commitment to recycling. Please become a part of this growing endeavor. Yard Debris | Paper Products | Glass | Metals | Motor Oil | Plastics | Recycling Locations HOME |RECYCLING |COMPOSTING |SERVICES | ASK USCOMMUNITY INFORMATION|REQUEST SERVICES Yard Debris Recycling &Composters City residents of Corvallis, Philomath, and Adair Village: If youchoose, a yard debris container can be delivered to regular garbageservice customers, by request. These containers will be emptied everyother week on your regular garbage day. Containers must be placed atcurbside to be emptied. If you prefer tocompost your own yard debris, we willsupply you with a composter instead. YardDebris - Defined as: Lawn clippings, brush, limbs, tree trimmings,prunings. Not acceptable: Dirt/gravel, paper/ plastic trash, metal orrubber objects, stumps / logs, rocks / bricks. SUBURBAN residents: Wehave composters available.BACK TO THE TOP Newspapers Anything that comes in your newspaper can be recycled with yournewspaper. Stack in easily handled untied stacks. Please do not mixnewspaper with magazines, cardboard or paper bags. Corrugated (3-layer) Cardboard & Brown Paperbags Flatten, and place at curbside. Remove all wire and plastic. Waxedcardboard cannot be recycled. Recycle brown paper bags with yourcardboard. Recycle cereal boxes and shoe boxes with your mixed paper(see below). Mixed Paper consists of: These three can be mixed in one brown paper bag. Sorted Household Mail White and pastel colored paper, envelopes, window envelopes,pamphlets and brochures. Staples are okay. NO construction paper, tissuepaper, books, paper towels, tape, food or gum wrappers. Paperboard (Flatten) Cereal type boxes (remove liners), shoe boxes, 6 & 12 packbeverage boxes, paper egg cartons, paper tubes ( i.e. paper towel). Please do not include: ice cream boxes, milk cartons, foil-linedboxes, coffee cups, any container from the frozen or refrigeratedfood sections. Magazines Shiny coated magazines and catalogs. BACK TOTHE TOP Pour motor oil into non-breakable containers with tight fittingscrew-on caps (bleach or milk jugs). No paint thinner, gas orother hazardous liquids. BACK TO THETOP Sorted by color (clear, green, brown) in separate bags. Bottles andjars only (please rinse). Labels do not need to be removed. Recyclethe lids from jars with your tin. No window glass, lightbulbs, pyrex or ceramics. BACK TO THETOP Tin Cans/Aluminum Remove label, top and bottom. Rinse clean and flatten wheneverpossible. Rounded end cans do not need to be flattened. Foil, TVdinner trays and beverage cans are all accepted. Noappliances or scrap metal. BACK TO THETOP Bottle and tub shaped rigid plastic containers only Why can we only recycle bottle & tub shaped plastics? TheGarten Foundation in Salem (where we take our plastics), has a newPlastics Recovery Facility (PRF) which is the first in the world ableto sort plastic bottles and tubs with all seven plastic resin codenumbers. Previously, the only way to recycle plastics was to keepeach resin code number separate from the time it's picked up to thetime it goes to market. This PRF can not only take all 7 resin codenumbers but can take them mingled together! But only if they arebottle or tub shaped. The system that separates the plastics by resincode can only "see" these shapes. Bags, trays, etc. are impossiblefor this system to sort. Examples of Recyclable Plastic Containers Kitchen Milk Soda Water Juice Yogurt & Margarine Ketchup & Syrup Cooking Oils Bathroom Shampoo Conditioner Lotions Household Cleaners Dish Detergent Window Cleaner Kitchen & Bath Cleaner Automotive Windshield Washer Antifreeze Laundry Liquid Detergent Fabric Softener Bleach BACK TO THE TOP Do Not Put These Items In The Recycling Bin (Even a Small Amount of Contaminants Can Ruin anEntire Shipment of Recyclable Plastics) Lids, Caps and Spray Pumps Bags or Wraps Pails (Ice cream) Food Storage, Freezer Containers (Tupperware) Containers - 5 Gallons or Larger Flower Pots and Garden Plastics Trays, Microwave Dishes Hazardous Waste containers (Pesticides, Herbicides, Solvents, Motor Oil, Paints, Adhesives) Styrofoam (Please enclose in a bag and put in trash). If In Doubt, Throw It Out... Unrecyclables Will Be Left In Your Recycle Bins! Why do I need to sort my recycling? Separating each commodity in your bin is important becauseeach commodity needs to go into a separate compartment on our trucks.When the truck is full, each compartment is emptied into large boxesat our site and are then hauled to markets where they are recycled.Our drivers cannot sort everyone's bin because that would requirespending extra time at each stop which would mean we would need toquadruple (or more) the number of recycling drivers we have! And thatwould mean higher rates for our customers. Corvallis Disposal 's recycling program has experienced strong growthduring the past 5 years, as indicated by this graph: The large increase from 1992 to 1993 can be attributed to the startof mixed paper recycling and curbside yard debris recycling.

Food waste and yard debris make up about 25% of our garbage. Grass clippings and leaves can take years to decompose in the landfill. Uses For Compost Compost contains nutrients and holds nutrients in the soil until plants can use them, but is not a substitute for fertilizers. As A Soil Amendment Mix compost into vegetable and flower gardens each year before planting As A Potting Mixture Add one part compost to two parts commercial potting soil, or make your own mixture by using equal parts of compost and sand or perlite. BACK TO THE TOP What To Compost Grass clippings Leaves Flowers Old plants Twigs Old potting soil BACK TO THE TOP What NOT To Compost Diseased plants Weeds with seeds Invasive weeds like quack grass or morning glory Pet feces Dead animals Meat or fish parts Dairy products such as milk, butter, or cheese Grease, cooking oil, or oily foods BACK TO THE TOP How To Compost Soil Saver HOT COMPOSTING (Compost Turning) Rich compost is created when you alternate layers of organic waste. It is easiest to estimate this ratio by alternating layers of "green stuff" and "brown stuff" as the compost pile is built. Example: A layer of grass clippings ("green stuff") twice as thick as a layer of brown leaves ("brown stuff") is a good ratio. Keep the material as moist as a squeezed-out sponge. Occasional watering may be required to moisten the pile if it becomes too dry. Turn the material (at least 4-5 times during the summer) with a pitchfork, shovel or compost turner so it's well aerated. You can turn the pile once a week but more frequent turning will inhibit composting. Your compost is ready to use when it is a dark brown or black color, crumbly, humus-rich top soil, with the sweet aroma of the good earth. Gedye Bin CLOSED-AIR COMPOSTING Closed-air composting uses bins, sometimes called digesters, that have solid sides and tight-fitting lids to conserve moisture and hold in any unpleasant odors. This type of holding bin is good for composting vegetable or fruit scraps. Place bin in a sunny location if possible. Fork the ground underneath the bin so earthworms and soil organisms can begin their work. Don't turn the contents. If they dry out, add more water. If they become soggy, add dry ingredients. Spread a thin layer of dry leaves or soil over every 6 to 8 inches of waste to control odors and ensure an adequate bacteria supply. Your compost is ready to use when it is a dark brown or black color, crumbly, humus-rich top soil, with the sweet aroma of the good earth. A link for more information: Composting BACK TO THE TOP Problems Will my composter attract flies? Not if you dig your food scraps into the compost or cover any food scraps or "green stuff" with a layer of soil or "brown stuff." Will my composter attract animals or rodents? To prevent the attraction of animals, do not add meat products, dairy products, fat or fish to your composter. Again, cover food scraps with soil or "brown stuff." Lay a sheet of hardware cloth or rabbit cage wire on the ground beneath your composter to keep rodents out. Why does my composter smell like ammonia? You have too much "green stuff." Add more"brown stuff." Why does my composter smell rotten? There is too much moisture in the composter. Turn the pile and add porous material such as leaves or sawdust.

Leaf Collectionon City Streets Corvallis Disposal's annual leaf collection program has begun, andwill continue through January 3. Corvallis: During this time, residents within the citylimits of Corvallis can place their leaves in curbed streets forpick-up each week on garbage collection day. In order to prevent blockage of bike lanes, we plan to collectleaves every week-day from those streets in the central part of thecity that have major bike paths. Please try to avoid putting yourleaves directly in the bike lanes. Philomath: In Philomath, leaves will be collected from allstreets within the city limits on one day only - Thursday, December5. Please have your leaves in the street by 7:00 in the morning. Tangent & Adair Village: For those of you who live inTangent or Adair Village, remember to use your yard-debris cart orcomposter for leaf disposal. This service is provided free with yourweekly garbage service. Please give us a call if you don't have oneyet. Other Areas: Many of you who live outside of the aboveareas will likely use your leaves for mulching, composting orburning. If you want to though, you can take them to the Processingand Recovery Center. They charge two dollars per cubic yard of leavesthat you drop off. Please give them a call at 745-2018 if you have any questions.TOP Leaf piles that are placed in the street are scooped up by Corvallis Disposal's tractor... ...then dropped into a truck, to be taken to the recycling center. Tips to Make Sure your Leaves are Collected Place leaves in the gutter at least 14 inches from the curb (this allows drainage along your street, and gives the equipment enough room to collect all the leaves). Place you leaves in a spot that will not be blocked by parked vehicles (10 ft. from the nearest vehicle). Leaves only please - branches and other yard debris cannot go into this pile. Please have your leaves in the street by 7:00 a.m. on your garbage day. TOP Get a Load ofLeaves If you would like to have a truck-load of leavesdelivered to your home or business, simply call our office with yourname and address. There is no charge. Please remember: We deliver full loads of leaves only (enough to fill a single-car garage) and cannot guarantee the types of leaves you will receive. The leaves come off the ground and out of yards, so there may be some yard-type debris mixed in. We try to deliver in the most efficient manner possible, so it may be several days before your leaves are delivered. TOP Holiday Schedule If your regular garbage pick-up day is on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, you will be affected by this year's Holiday Schedule. Our drivers take off only three holidays per year: Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years Day. We will be working on Saturdays during these weeks to get those of you who are usually serviced on Friday. For the Week of If your regular pick-up day is... This week it will be picked up on...

CDC drivers deliver truck loads of leaves and yard debris to theProcessing and Recovery Center (PRC) located off Highway 99 about tenmiles north of Corvallis. Here, the leaves are stacked in piles and left untouched for aboutfour months. The mixed yard debris is spread out in long rows, thencovered with tarps to reduce leaching of nutrients by rainwater. Next spring, the leaves from this fall will be mixed together withfresh yard debris and run through a shredder. The mixed ratio is 20%leaves to 80% green yard debris. This shredded mixture is put in piles and turned twice weekly.After about 100 days - with the help of nature's decomposers(bacteria, fungi, insects, etc.) - the pile turns into a richcompost. It is high in carbon which provides energy for organisms, and innitrogen which is necessary for cell development. Compost also helpsloosen clay soils, aides in moisture retention, and generallyprovides a healthy growing environment for plants. The PRC's compost can be purchased for $8 per cubic yard.(745-2018) TOP Corvallis Disposal expectsto recycle 600 cubic yards of Christmas trees this year. That's about 200 pickuptruck loads. HolidayRecycling Wrapping paper & cards can be recycled with your paperboard& household mail mix (NO foil, plastic or tissue paperplease). Christmas trees will be picked up on your garbage day fromDecember 30 through January 10. If your tree is clean of allflocking, tinsel, etc. and you put it at the curb, we will recycleit. Otherwise, we will throw it away as garbage free of charge. LeafCollection |Leaf CollectionTips |Get a Load ofLeaves |HolidaySchedule |LeafCompost Back issues ofRecycle It!

Sixteen years ago, Corvallis and Philomathresidents demonstrated their commitment to reduce the amount ofgarbage going to the landfill by participating in the state's firstcurbside recycling program. Since that time, Tangent and Monroe residents have also joined theranks of curbside recyclers. Whether recycling at curbside orbringing materials to a recycling center, residents throughout thecounty have sorted their recyclables with such vigor that BentonCounty continues to have one of the highest recovery rates in thestate (35%) - second only to Portland (39%). How We Got Here In January 1990, Corvallis Disposal distributed more than 10,000red recycling bins. By the end of the year, 40% more people wererecycling, and the amount of recyclables collected was almost twicethat of the previous year. This huge increase in recycling resultedin a 10% decrease in the amount of garbage dumped into the landfill. Each time a new item is added to the list of recyclables, agreater amount of waste is recovered for recycling. The large increase in 1993 (see graph) is due to the addition ofmixed paper and yard debris recycling. These two items make up themajority of household waste, and therefore, offer great potential forrecycling. Curbside Recycling Program May 1980 Curbside recycling began in Corvallis & Philomath (glass, tin, cardboard, newspaper, motor oil and aluminum) January 1990 Plastics (#1 and 2) recycling began October 1990 Magazine recycling began February 1993 Mixed paper added to curbside recycling April 1993 Yard debris recycling and composting February 1995 Mixed plastics (all bottles or tubs) Where We're Going In 1991, the Oregon Legislature established waste recovery goalsfor each county. Benton County's goal was to recycle 30% of its wasteby 1995. We reached this mark in 1993-two years early. We are now aiming for the statewide goal of recycling half of ourgarbage by the year 2000. To reach this goal, we need to continueadding to the list of acceptable items, but, more importantly, weneed to make recycling easier to do. Corvallis Disposal staff areevaluating a number of different collection systems that might makeit easier for all to recycle a larger percentage of their waste. We are also working with businesses to enhance their recyclingprograms. In his new role as business resource person, Clint Hiltonwill help businesses reach their optimal level of garbage andrecycling service. Pam Wald continues to coordinate the recyclingeducation program for schools and community groups. If you have any comments or questions on recycling, you can eithersend us a note, call our office, or E-mail us atmail@disposal.com The Plastic Loop After your recyclable plastic bottles and tubs are picked up atthe curb, they are taken to Source Recycling in Albany. Source Recycling bales an average of 60,000 pounds of used plasticcontainers every month. Once baled, the plastics are sent to theGarten Foundation in Salem, where they're sorted via a high-techcomputerized system. It quickly and effectively sorts plastic bottlesand tubs according to resin type and color. However, because of the system's design, lids and containerssmaller than six ounces will simply fall through the cracks_andplastic bags will clog up the sorter's gears. Also, bags, styrofoamand clam shell containers are made of a type of plastic that ourmarkets are not currently interested in buying. For these reasons, weare not taking lids, bags, clam shells, styrofoam and very smallcontainers. Manufacturers purchase the sorted, used plastics to make recycledproducts, such as non-food containers, plastic lumber and clothing. It's OK to Mix Your Plastics Bottle-shaped containers larger than six ounces (please remove the lids) Round food tubs up to two gallons (please remove the lids) NO motor-oil and pesticide containers, for health and safety reasons Automated CartUpdate Many Corvallis and Philomath residents have made the switch tousing a new automated garbage cart instead of a can. If you wouldlike to join them, please give us a call. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Two Sizes Available: 35 or 90 gallon. 35 gallon cart costs the same as one-can service; 90 gallon cart is $17.20 per month. Carts must be at the street by 7:00 a.m. on your garbage day. This service is currently offered on most Corvallis and Philomath streets, and will be introduced into many suburban areas over the next six months. Yard Debris Recycling If you are a busy gardener this summer, one yard debris cart maynot seem like enough to hold all the lawn clippings and shrubtrimmings that your yard is producing. While we can not lessen your work load, a second yard cart maysolve your disposal problem. The cost is $4 per month. And, be sure to let us know if you would like another yard-debriscalendar to help you keep track of your pick-up days. The total amount of yard debris collected byCorvallis Disposal since 1993 is enough to cover 17 football fieldsthree feet deep.

Is the Second Best Treatment Good Enough for You? If the President Had Cancer... by Gary Schine If the president were diagnosed with cancer... ...Doctors and researchers would search for the latest information available on treatments that could save him. Top experts would be summoned to the White House. The president would be treated with the best and latest available. He would be given the best opportunity to defeat that cancer, to survive, and to return to good health. For the rest of us it's chancy. You may get the best available or you may not. While teams of physicians and researchers would search the literature to make sure a president or a senator got the best there is, the same would not be done for you or for me. Most of us assume that our doctor is up-to-date on the latest treatments. However, the facts are that this assumption is as naive as it is comfortable. There is a very real chance that a potentially lifesaving treatment exists that your doctor does not know about. You simply don't know unless you have the latest information on your illness. Computers: Pipeline to Better Treatment Not too many years ago, searching for medical developments required a major medical library, volumes of heavy directories, and weeks of time. Today it is possible to search thousands of medical journals in minutes, using online medical databases. Through database searching, anyone can learn about the latest developments in treatment for any illness --and you may learn about it months before your doctor does. It is hardly an exaggeration to say your life may be saved by finding the latest information. The information contained in these databases is not accessible from the World Wide Web; they are subscription-only, government databases which are far from user-friendly. However, the researchers at Schine On-Line Services have been trained to navigate these databases in search of this potentially life-saving information. Don't leave a stone unturned; let the professionals at Schine On-Line Services help you find all your treatment options! Is the Second Best Treatment Good Enough for You? An Overview of Schine On-Line Services Schine On-Line Services, Inc., founded by cancer survivor Gary Schine, author of Cancer Cure, gathers information on any and all types of cancer or other illness directly for clients. Our researchers have extensive on-line experience, training from the National Library of Medicine, and other medical database training. We can search the databases for you and provide a report of the current developments in treatment and clinical trials of your particular illness. "Can Information Cure Cancer?" by Gary Schine I was 38 years old when I learned I had a rare form of leukemia. The cancer would kill me, my oncologist warned, because there simply was no cure. He tried to persuade me to take comfort in the fact that it would probably progress slowly; but all I could think about were my two small kids who I'd be leaving behind, and my wife who would have to bring them up alone. Today, over five years later, I am cancer free. I expect to stay that way, and the oncologists familiar with my condition expect the same. I owe my cure to my own efforts in researching and finding the latest information on treating my illness --a newly developed treatment that my doctor knew nothing about.

Clinical Trials: New Hope for Persons with Cancer 77 New Clinical Trials Announced in December Be sure to check this site for monthly updates on recently announced clinical trials. Many of us view clinical trials as the use of human guinea pigs in medical experimentation with more for harm than good. The reality is that far more people are helped than hurt by U.S. clinical trials, and all participants must by fully informed of their prospects and risks. Clinical trials in this country are divided into three phases: Phase I. In this first phase, drugs (or other treatments) that have been comprehensively tested on animals are first administered to humans. Because the drug is new and unproved, it is only offered to people who have no other reasonable options; that is, nothing to lose. Phase II. A drug that has been phase I tested and shows clear signs of effectiveness without undue risk is admitted to this phase. It is offered to a broader group of patients to better establish its value as a new treatment. Phase III. Here, a new treatment is compared to existing treatments, or to no treatment at all. In phase III, some patients receive the new treatment, while others receive a more conventional treatment or a placebo (which is not a treatment, but appears to be one). If a treatment is clearly safer and more effective than the alternatives, the FDA will sometimes allow this phase of testing to be ommitted, putting the treatment on the fast track to full approval. By nature, clinical trials are at the cutting edge of medicine. Tomorrow's standard treatments are found in today's trials. While not all clinical trials lead to improvement in one's illness, many do.

Cancer Cure: How to find and get the best there is. by Gary Schine "A fine guide and reference source from someone who has lived the experience and learned how to teach others. -Bernie Siegel, M.D. "An important resource for anyone facing the cancer challenge." -Judy Gerner, Director, The Anderson Network MD Anderson Cancer Center "I shudder to think what would happen if I didn't read If the President Had Cancer. My father owes however many years he has left to this book." -Jill Bortman, Lincoln, RI Medical science has come a long way in treating cancer. Developments and discoveries continue to come very rapidly. Research and experimentation is constantly taking place at hundreds of hospitals, clinics, and universities throughout the country and the world. However, people in need often don't get the best care because they are ignorant about their disease and its treatment alternatives. Too many patients assume that their doctor is fully abreast of all the latest information about their condition and its treatment. Further, too many patients are afraid to challenge their doctor's knowledge or his status as the undisputed decision maker. Because developments come so rapidly, it is simply naive to assume that every doctor is up-to-date on every kind of cancer and treatment. When your life is at stake, the fear of challenging or even insulting the doctor by questioning his knowledge or recommendations simply must be overcome. You must get the best information available and assert your right to make decisions that will impact upon your survival and your quality of life. This book will show you how to find the information you need to have, how to use it to your advantage, and how to deal with a medical establishment that does not encourage patients to exercise their rights to learn and decide. Specifically, this book will show you how to: Access the Latest Information, both on and off the World Wide Web Ask Your Doctor the Right Questions Get a Second Opinion Find Out about Clinical Trials Use Contacts Find Out a Doctor's Qualifications and Abilities Anticipate and Overcome Obstacles Table of Contents 1.

Selected References.........................171Index.....................................................175 This book is not meant to be an indictment of doctors. Many of the criticisms lodged at physicians may result from the expectations that we as patients have for those who are advising and treating us. Too often we expect them to have all the answers and solutions. We demand not only technical expertise in medicine, but also flawless interpersonal and communications skills, a sophisticated understanding of psychology, unlimited availability, and a potpourri of superhuman abilities. Sometimes, when doctors behave in ways that we consider arrogant, they are merely reflecting the image that patients have demanded they fulfill. Furthermore, this book does not advocate so-called alternatives like foreign treatments of dubious scientific merit, cure by miracle diet, or cure by positive thinking. Indeed, Gary Schine was treated and apparently cured by traditionally trained physicians with the skill to administer the latest drugs that were developed by traditional medical research.

I had no idea what that meant, and the doctor knew it. He was just beginning to break the news to me gently and I guess that was the approach that worked best for him. As the story unfolded it became clear that my depressed iron level noted at a recent blood drive had nothing to do with poor diet as I had naively surmised. I won't pretend to remember everything that Dr. Telder* said at that meeting but I clearly remember a few words like malignancy and leukemia and a few phrases of advice like "make sure your health insurance and life insurance policies are paid up." Mostly I remember thinking about my two year old daughter and my seven year old son growing up without a father and about my wife having to support them, raise them, and explain what happened to daddy all by herself. "This can't be real," I thought. "I'm only 38; how can I have cancer?" It was very real indeed. The doctor had a little encouraging news by our next meeting two weeks later. He had completed his diagnostic tests and explained that I had hairy cell leukemia, a rare form of the disease. It could have been worse, in that HCL progresses relatively slowly. "Why I've seen people with HCL live for ten years," he told me. To keep me alive would require major surgery, a splenectomy. That might buy me a few years of relatively trouble free life. Then I might start on a drug called interferon which would manage the illness but not cure it. Interferon comes with side effects such as periodic flu-like symptoms and loss of mental concentration abilities. "There is no cure," the doctor cautioned. "What we want to do is lessen the severity and slow down the progress of the leukemia." In the meantime my already compromised immune system would deteriorate further, my constant fatigue would get worse, and I might eventually be susceptible to spontaneous external and internal bleeding. That was eighteen months ago. Things are different now. This morning I braved the 26 degree cold and ran 2 1/2 miles as I do on most mornings. Back then, I had difficulty walking two flights of stairs. I'm working full 8 hour days now. I could easily work more but I don't because I want to spend time with my kids. One thing my experience taught me is how important it is to spend time with them. Last year I could hardly stay awake for eight hours without a nap. My immune system is as capable as it ever was, and spontaneous bleeding is no longer a threat. There is simply no evidence of cancer to be found in my body. You see, despite Dr. Telder's predictions, I am, by all indications cured of my incurable disease. The doctor simply was unaware of the latest developments in the treatment of HCL. He did not know about two recent treatments that were much more effective than his antiquated treatment proposal of splenectomy followed by interferon. The treatment that I chose was developed and administered at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, California. The treatment, a chemotherapy agent called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA), involved a seven day intravenous infusion. While the drug had short term side effects like nausea, fever, and flu-like symptoms, there are no known long term side effects. Two weeks after the treatment I returned from California to my home in Rhode Island able to carry on my life, albeit on an abbreviated schedule. Two months after my return I was working full time, exercising for the first time in years, and feeling like a new person. While I have no guarantees, I have been given every reason to believe I will neither suffer a relapse nor later side effects from the treatment. Once I independently set out to learn about my illness, finding this treatment was not difficult. Through a call to the local chapter of the Leukemia Society of America, I learned that there was a treatment for HCL in clinical trial. A bit of simple research uncovered a technical report about 2-CDA in the venerable New England Journal of Medicine and a lay-person summary of the technical report in the equally venerable Wall Street Journal. Both articles appeared three months previous to my diagnosis. Had I not set out to find information on my own, had I not been assertive in seeking and getting the best treatment available, the prognosis offered by Dr. Telder would have been fulfilled. Every person with a serious illness has the responsibility to be informed about that illness and its treatment options. The seriously ill patient must take responsibility for doing all he can to prolong his life and to strive for the best quality of life possible. As my experience shows, relying solely on one's doctor will not always be adequate. It takes some research and study and some assertiveness to assure that you know what the choices are and to make those choices based on the best information possible. Clearly my own efforts resulted in a home run; I found a cure for an illness that was supposed to be debilitating and fatal. In my case (at least in retrospect) it was all black and white, there was a bad choice and a much better choice. Not every cancer sufferer will be so fortunate or have choices so clearly contrasted as I did. However, many patients will have choices as to how to battle the formidable enemy called cancer. To know how to make the best choices, indeed to know what the choices are, you need to become informed. You need also to use that information to derive the power you will need to give yourself the best chance possible. *The name "Dr. Telder" is fictitious. Any resemblance to any person's actual name is unintended and coincidental.

Can I Get All the Information About My Illness on the Web? (Why Do I Need You?) The Web offers a great deal of information for just about any type of illness. However, it does not offer access to the key databases for up-to-date medical developments in cancer treatment. The National Library of Medicine's Cancerlit and Medline databases are available only to subscribers who pay usage fees. The National Cancer Institute's Clinical Trials database too, is not accessible via the World Wide Web. However, the PDQ overview sections (for patients and for medical professionals) are available on the Web by accessing Cancernet. Someday, the National Library of Medicine may develop user friendly software and make their databases free to use on the Net. Someday, the PDQ Clinical database may be free to use. However, as of today both databases require subscriptions and user fees, and the former also requires knowledge of an esoteric command language for effective searching. The promise of the Net is real to be sure. However, it is not yet the omnipotent information gathering tool that it is cracked up to be. It can be very useful for finding medical information as long as one understands its current pitfalls and its limitations: Searching Capabilities From Cancer Cure by Gary Schine Key benefits of the sophisticated medical databases (like Medline and Cancerlit) include their deliberate and meticulous indexing. Medical librarians dissect articles categorizing them by controlled vocabulary terms-- sometimes twenty or thirty such terms for one article. This indexing makes it possible to search with reasonable precision. If I wanted to find articles on, for example, multiple myeloma treatment, published in 1995 through 1996, involving the use of radiation therapy, I could easily limit to these parameters (as well as to many others). The database would dutifully provide exactly the information that I requested. The Internet has no such trained indexers. No Net indexing to date can hold a candle to the indexing done by the staffs of Medline, Cancerlit or by other controlled databases. The Internet, particularly the World Wide Web, does offer search engines that utilize keyword search capabilities. That means a Web user can ask one of the search engines for information on "multiple myeloma". Such a request would pull up hundreds of retrievals. However, their usability and relevance would be hit or miss, in that they might include items on the treatment of multiple myeloma as well as reviews of novels where a character within suffers from the illness, to the obituary of people who succumbed to the illness. While such a search might well produce a host of false hits, or items that match the technical search criteria but do not match the search goals, it might very well miss important information that does not meet the keyword criteria. For example, multiple myeloma is a type of a plasma cell neoplasm. An article on treatment of all plasma cell neoplasms that does not specifically mention multiple myeloma would be missed by a keyword-based search engine. The Internet is to controlled medical databases what a book flea market is to a research library. You may find some wonderful bits of information, but you cannot assume that you have done a systematic search merely by surfing the Net using your illness as a key word search term. Further, evaluating information found--sifting the quackery from the legitimate science-- can be as difficult as it is important. Uncontrolled Access to the Internet A key advantage of the Internet in general is a key drawback, when it comes to seeking out information as important as treatment of a serious illness. The Net is essentially an electronic democracy where anyone can post and present to the public pretty much whatever he or she would like. No one acts as editor or review committee. If I want to announce on the World Wide Web that a new brand of grape juice cures colon cancer, I can easily do so, as can anyone else with Net access. What's more, my posting on grape juice would be on apparently equal footing with postings from the world's most venerable medical journals. In point of fact, there are quacks selling all sorts of snake oil on the Net, further increasing its perils as an information gathering tool. The general public, however, is not able to add to the controlled medical databases. Entries are controlled by strict parameters, essentially limited to medical and scientific journals, and related publications and documents. Further, source and reference information which adheres to scientific and academic documentation standards is included in the medical databases. Virtually all the medical information in medical databases is referenced and documented such that a user can readily know where that information came from and who provided it. If such reference information is provided with items found on the Internet it is for the most part voluntary and unverified. The Net can be quite useful for finding anecdotal information, for finding emotional support from those who have been there, and for pointing one in the direction of available resources. Currently, it is not a great resource for systematically searching out documented scientific studies or legitimate clinical trials.

Reliance upon any information within, is at the user�s own risk.  Again, for medical advice, diagnoses, or treatment, consult a competent and licensed physician.INTRODUCTION TO REPORTNOTE: This is the actual introduction to the reportThis report contains information on the latest treatments and on related current findings for Renal Cell Carcinoma, particularly (but not exclusively) recurred RCC.  It was gathered from a number of computer databases.  It is divided into sections as described below.SECTION 1a. Outline of  Renal Cell CarcinomaThis section is a strait-forward summary of Renal Cell Carcinoma in lay person language.  It includes a general introduction that will help you understand your condition as well as information on staging , and prognosis.  This section  is from the National Cancer Institute�s Physician�s Data Query (PDQ) database.SECTION 1b. Technical Outline of  Renal Cell CarcinomaThis section, also from PDQ, is a more technical and more detailed summary of Renal Cell Carcinoma.  It is designed for physicians and other medical professionals.  While non-physicians will probably not be able to understand this section in its entirety, much of the information can be understood by a lay person prepared to read it carefully.  A good medical dictionary might be helpful for this section and for most of the following sections.SECTION 2. Current and Recent Clinical TrialsThis section contains specific details on current clinical trials for Renal Cell Carcinoma.  There are well over 1000 clinical trials taking place in the United States at any given time.  Reputable clinical trials take place in other nation's throughout the world as well.  In this and in virtually all other nations, a new treatment must be extensively tested and evaluated in laboratories and then on animals, before it is used for humans.  This sections begins with a brief explanation of clinical trials.SECTION 3. Latest Findings from Cancerlit, Renal Cell CarcinomaThis section contains references and summary information from recent studies involving Renal Cell Carcinoma.  This information can be useful to:a. examine the reported effectiveness of clinical trials (such as those found in section II. of this report)b. evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment or treatments that your doctor is proposing.  For example, it is one thing to be told by your doctor that your chances for complete remission are pretty good with treatment XYZ but another to read that a in recent study of 50 people with Renal Cell Carcinoma who were treated with XYZ, 75% achieved complete remission at 6 months.c. compare effectiveness and risk of one treatment option to another.  This is useful in deciding whether the treatment that your doctor is proposing is more or less effective than other standard treatments or treatments in clinical trial that may be available.Note that the final line on each summary (starting with AD) indicates the institution where that particular report came from.  Cancerlit includes information from the USA and the entire world.SECTION 4. Information on Alternative and Non-Traditional Medicine in Regards to Renal Cell Carcinoma.This section, from the Cancerlit Database, includes  research findings  available specifically for non-traditional treatments and related reports dealing with Renal Cell Carcinoma or related cancers.  The following types of medicine were searched (by National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings and text word where no MESH heading was available).Alternative Medicine			Medicine, HerbalMedicine, African Traditional		Medicine, Oriental TraditionalMedicine, Arabic			Medicine, AyurvedicHomeopathy				drugs, Chinese HerbalChiropractic				antineoplaston (S Burzynski)bovine cartilage			shark cartilageNote that only items specifically indexed under one of these heading will be retrieved as part of this section.   Also, we do not limit our search to human treatment and clinical experimentation here as we do in the previous sections because people often want to know about early stage (pre-human trial) alternative medicine experimentation.  Other treatment reports that fall under the domain of alternative or non-traditional may be included in one of the previous sections.SECTION 5. Information from National Organization of Rare Disorders (NORD)NORD is a non-profit organization dedicated to identifying, controlling, and curing rare or Orphan Diseases.  The information it offers includes overviews, new treatments, and sources of further information for many rare (and some not-so-rare) cancers.  The organization is largely supported by pharmaceutical companies so not surprisingly, most of the treatments are drug based.  If we found Renal Cell Carcinoma in the NORD database, their information is included in this section.SECTION 6. Medical Libraries In Your AreaThere are many medical libraries and general libraries with medical sections.  Some of these libraries in your area and their addresses  are listed in this section.Medical libraries are designed more for medical professionals than for patients.  Their policies on use by the public vary so it is worth checking before taking a long trip only to be denied access.  Medical libraries are the best place to search for the full text of articles that are included in this report in summary (abstract) fashion.  The libraries listed here work with the National Library of Medicine�s system of sharing resources.  This means that any one of them should be able to track down any journal referenced by the NLM (Cancerlit section of this report).  Whether they will use their sharing capabilities for you depends on the libraries policies..c2.  THE BEST DOCTORPeople with cancer often ask, "Who is the best doctor for my illness?"  Unfortunately, there is no easy answer to this question.  However, it is fair to reason that a doctor whose name comes up several times in this report is well versed and up to date on Renal Cell Carcinoma.  That is, if Dr. John Doe is participating in several clinical trials (section 2 and/or has published several articles on this illness (section 3 or 4), Dr. Doe is very likely to be an expert on the treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma.  The clinical trials listings include the names, addresses, and phone numbers for listed participants..c2.If The President Had Cancer...If The President Had Cancer  is a step by step guide for patients who want to make sure they get the best care available and who want to take more control of their care.  It includes information on finding information, getting a second opinion from top specialists in your type of cancer, questions to ask your doctor, and more.  For further information, see the enclosed brochure. 1a. OUTLINE OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA                         DESCRIPTION-- What is renal cell cancer? --Renal cell cancer (also called cancer of the kidney or renal adenocarcinoma) isa disease in which cancer (malignant) cells are found in certain tissues of thekidney.  Renal cell cancer is one of the less common kinds of cancer.  Itoccurs more often in men than in women....In an actual report, thisoverview continues for several pages.  1b. TECHNICAL OUTLINE OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA DIAGNOSIS #1 OF 1                      10/19/95 12:0                                                      RENAL CELL CANCER                                   PROGNOSISRenal cell cancer, also called renal adenocarcinoma, or hypernephroma, can often be cured if it is diagnosed and treated when still localized to the kidney and to immediately surrounding tissue.  The probability of cure is directly related to the stage or degree of tumor dissemination.  Even when regional lymphatics or blood vessels are involved with tumor, a significant number of patients can achieve prolonged survival and probable cure.....  In an actual report, this technical overview continues for several pages.  .c.2a. CURRENT CLINICAL TRIALS (from PDQ)  .c2.  HOW CLINICAL TRIALS WORKVirtually all U.S. clinical trials are performed only with the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and according to strict FDA guidelines.  Also, most clinical trials must first be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the institution where the trial is to take place.  The IRB, which is composed of physicians, scientists, and others reviews the study to assure that it is well designed and that it includes appropriate safeguards for the patients, and that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.  Clinical trials are carefully reviewed for medical ethics, patient safety, and scientific merit by the organization that is sponsoring the research.  As with the practice of medicine in general, a key ethical tenant must be observed: nothing shall be done to a patient that will knowingly do any harm that is not outweighed by a greater benefit.A clinical trial must have a clear and potentially helpful purpose with clear evaluation criteria and clear steps in its administration.  In many instances effectiveness in destroying or abating cancer relative to standard therapies is being tested.  In some cases effectiveness of two or more drugs has been proven to be similar but relative toxicities need to be evaluated.While the heavy scrutiny that a clinical trial receives does not guarantee that every trial is absolutely safe, it is at least very significant protection against carelessness and undue risk under the circumstances.  In all cases you will receive information about the potential benefits and hazards and you will not be admitted to a clinical trial until and unless you consent in writing to be part of that trial.  Even with your written consent, you can leave the clinical trial at any time and for any reason or for no reason at all.CLINICAL TRIAL PHASESTrials in cancer research in this country are designed in 4 phases with each phase building upon what was learned in the previous phase.  Not all trials make it through all 4 phases if the value is called into question by early data.  Also, some clinical trials are allowed to forego phases 3 if earlier results are particularly promising.  Each clinical trial listed in this report lists which phase it is currently in.  The phases are outlined as follows:Phase IIn this phase a new drug is first administered to humans.  Because the drug is new to humans, risks are highest here.  Part of the researchers job is to determine the best way to administer the drug, appropriate dosage, and of course to carefully monitor side effects.  Only people with advanced disease who could not be helped by other known treatment are typically allowed to participate in this potentially perilous phase.Phase IIIn this phase, access is opened up to more patients.  Patients with related forms of cancer may be admitted into trials that have successfully passed through phase I without undue side effects.Phase IIIThe key to this phase is comparison of the new treatment with other treatments.  The group getting the new treatment is called the treatment group and the group getting the standard treatment is called the control group.  Where there is no existing treatment, some patients get the treatment and the control group gets no treatment at all.  This is typically done through randomization  meaning patients are randomly assigned to the treatment or control group. While this is good science it unfortunately means some patients get a treatment that may not be as good as other patients are getting.  For this reason, the FDA sometimes permits this phase to be skipped if there is clear evidence that the investigational treatment is better than the existing alternatives (or lack thereof).Phase IVA treatment that makes it into phase IV has pretty much proven its value.  Although the FDA continues to monitor its benefits and toxicity,  it becomes a standard treatment option until and unless new data uncovers unforeseen problems.  Sometimes it is used in conjunction with other proven drugs, and sometimes it is initially approved for use if established treatments have not been effective with a particular patient.Before a drug is approved by the FDA as a standard treatment, that agency  reviews all the clinical trial data.  This is a lengthy process taking at least a year and sometimes much more.  In fact, it can easily take 5 to 10 years from the point where an investigational drug is first administered to a patient to the time it is fully approved by the FDA.NCI GROUP C TREATMENT PROTOCOLSGroup C treatments are drugs provided to physicians by the NCI for treatment of individual patients.  Drugs in this category have been FDA approved for treatment of specific cancers.  They have passed through extensive clinical trials (at lease through phase II.) and show considerable promise.  If all goes according to expectation, these drugs will soon be approved for commercialization.INFORMATION ON EACH TRIALEach trial description contains the following information:-name of institution(s) where trial is taking place-name of at least one researcher (participant) involved in the study-address of participant(s)  and institution including the lead organization in all cases.  Also, the names and addresses of participants in your state and nearby states are included in a separate list following the first listing.-entry criteria (physical characteristics such as age, condition, gender, etc. for eligibility to participate as a patient)-status- all clinical trials listed here are active-Objectives- The medical objectives are detailed in each summary contained in the report.  Note that these are the objectives from a research point-of-view, not for your point of view as a person with cancer.  Your objective is clearer and simpler-- to either fully or partially cure your illness.  Don�t be put off by the cold scientific language of the description of the objective.  The improvement of quality of life for the patient is understood as the human objective and does not need stating in the scientific summary of objectives.-Summary-  Finally, each trial listed has a summary that describes the trial itself in a few paragraphs.  Again, this is written for medical professionals but it will give you an idea of what you will go through if you enter any of the trials listed. FOREIGN CLINICAL TRIALSIt is possible that one or more current clinical trials are not included in the PDQ database and therefore are not listed in this section.  This is especially likely for clinical trials taking place outside the U.S, even though a number of foreign trials are included. GETTING MORE INFORMATION ON CLINICAL TRIALSDon�t hesitate to ask your doctor to  call or write one of the researchers (listed as participants in each description) for further information about the trial and about your own eligibility for participating.  If your doctor is hesitant, by all means contact the researchers yourself.Section III.  (Latest Findings From Cancerlit) of this report contains information on recent studies involving Renal Cell Carcinoma.  Some of that information may include results of the clinical trials mentioned in the PDQ list of trials.If the President Had Cancer (available through Schine On-line Services) contains more details on clinical trials.note: This listing contains clinical trials taking place worldwide.  Following this listing, those clinical trials from this complete list that are available in your state and nearby states are listed separately with the names of local participants.2b.

Latest Findings From Cancerlit/MedlineNote: This section contains very recent studies and reports on the treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma.  This important information can help you evaluate different  treatment options and make treatment choices based upon hard scientific  information (i.e. which treatment seems to offer a higher possibility of full  cure, which has the lowest risk of adverse effects, etc.).  Also, if there have been recent breakthroughs in the treatment of your illness, this section  is likely to contain that late-breaking information.  It is not easy for a lay person to understand this information, but it can increase your chances of long  term survival.  We advise clients to read through the studies and circle those that look promising.  With the appropriate items circled, take the report to your doctor for help in determining which of the items are worth following up on.  One of fifty-five treatment reports is included in this sample.  This information is not available through Cancernet, Oncolink or any other free on-line services.SAMPLE 1 of 77 treatment reports1UI  - 95382620AU  - Wada TAU  - Nishiyama KAU  - Maeda MAU  - Hara SAU  - Tanaka NAU  - Yasutomi MAU  - Kurita TTI  - Combined chemoendocrine treatment with tegafur and tamoxifen for advanced renal cell carcinoma.AB  - Ten patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma were given combined chemoendocrine treatment with tegafur and tamoxifen.      Patients were orally administered 800 mg/body tegafur and 20 mg/body tamoxifen daily. One patient was assessed as CR, three as PR, two as NC and four as PD. One out of two patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors and three out of four patients with ER-negative tumors responded favorably to this treatment.  Side effects observed during treatment included nausea and vomiting (Grade I in three patients and Grade II in five), leukopenia (Grade II in four patients and Grade III in two), Grade II liver dysfunction in two patients, and slight pigmentation in two patients.  This treatment can be considered efficacious for renal cell carcinoma.

Information on Alternative and Non-Traditional Medicine in Regards to Renal Cell CarcinomaNote that only items specifically indexed under one of the headings noted in the introduction for section 4, will be retrieved as part of this section.  Also, we do not limit our search to human treatment and clinical experimentation here as we do in the previous sections because people often want to know about early stage (pre-human trial) alternative medicine experimentation.  Other treatment reports that fall under the domain of alternative or non-traditional may be included in one of the previous sections.SAMPLE 1 of 6 reports of non-traditional treatment for this illness.1SI  - MEDL/95111534AU  - Lau BHAU  - Ruckle HCAU  - Botolazzo TAU  - Lui PDTI  - Chinese medicinal herbs inhibit growth of murine renal cell      carcinoma.SO  - Cancer Biother; 9(2):153-61 1994AB  - Tumors are known to produce factors suppressing immune functions.  We previously showed that a murine renal cell carcinoma (Renca) suppressed macrophage function in vitro and that this suppression was abolished by co-incubation with extracts of two Chinese medicinal herbs.  We now report that these phytochemicals are capable of inhibiting growth of Renca in vivo.  BALB/c mice were transplanted intraperitoneally (IP) with 1-2 x 10(5) Renca cells.  One day after tumor transplant, mice were randomized into two groups.  One group was treated IP, daily for 10 days, with 100 microliters of phytochemicals containing 500 micrograms each of Astragalus membranaceus and Ligustrum lucidum, while the other group received saline as controls.  A cure rate of 57% was obtained with these phytochemicals when the initial tumor load was 2 x 10(5), and 100% when the initial tumor load was 1 x 10(5).  Additional experiments were performed to investigate the mechanisms involved in this protection.  Splenic macrophages from tumor-bearing mice were shown to have depressed chemiluminescent oxidative burst activity, and this depression was restored with phytochemical treatment.  Splenocytes from mice transplanted with Renca responded less favorably to interleukin-2 (IL-2) in generating lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells; again this depression was restored with phytochemical treatment.  Our data suggest that these phytochemicals may have exerted their antitumor effects via augmentation of phagocyte and LAK cell activities.AD  - Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Loma Linda University, California 92350.5.

Getting a Second Opinion: Why a Second Opinion is Necessary A Physician Can't Be Up-to-Date on Every Development. Medicine is very much a high-technology field. As with any high-tech field, evolutionary and revolutionary developments are constantly surfacing. It is not fair to expect any practitioner to be up to date on every current development. A doctor who is busy practicing medicine just doesn't have time to closely watch the ever changing field of medical research on behalf of every patient. An article in the March 1992 issue of Consumer Reports cites a study by sociologist David Phillips of the University of California at San Diego that found most physicians initially get their information on new medical developments from the newspaper. Only a few developments make it into the daily paper right away; many never do at all. It is quite possible that there is a better treatment available or in development about which your doctor simply does not know. One possible way to find out if this is so in your case is simply to go to another doctor. Where to Get Your Second Opinion The National Cancer Institute is the federal organization charged with the responsibility of coordinating government efforts toward fighting cancer. With its nearly two billion dollar annual budget, the NCI sponsors research and clinical trials, collects and distributes cancer information, and sponsors other programs and activities to battle cancer. Much of the research sponsored is carried out by other public and private organizations but with financial help from the NCI. The NCI has designated twenty-eight hospitals and clinics as comprehensive cancer centers and thirteen as clinical cancer centers. These centers have been recognized for their excellence in cancer treatment by the NCI. To be designated as a comprehensive cancer center, an institution must meet the following criteria: must pass rigorous peer review must have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields must have a record of innovative clinical research studies must have a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice must maintain strong participation in NCI designated high-priority clinical trials must maintain significant levels of cancer prevention and control research must initiate outreach and educational activities must maintain cancer information services for patients and health professionals The clinical cancer centers focus on both basic research and clinical research within each institution. They frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs. If you possibly can, get a second opinion from a designated comprehensive cancer center. Failing that, a clinical cancer center would also be a good bet for a state of the art second opinion. The designated centers are required to keep up to date on the latest information about cancer and to participate in cancer research and clinical trials. Also, their staffs include research physicians as well as full time practitioners. Research physicians tend to be up on the latest developments and the pros and cons of different treatment alternatives. Also, researchers at NCI-designated facilities are more likely to seek out the latest information on a particular illness because they see that as part of their professional responsibility. Practitioners, on the other hand, may tend to put a lower priority on keeping current with the latest research developments. Finally, it is important to note that there are many other excellent cancer treatment facilities that do not have the NCI recognition as either a comprehensive or clinical cancer center. Other groups offer their own lists of quality cancer treatment institutions. For example, a magazine for cancer survivors and patients called Coping, publishes an annual listing of what it considers to be the top one hundred institutions for cancer treatment in this country.

Science Versus Supposition An excerpt from Cancer Cure, by Gary Schine "Not long ago I was listening to the car radio on a long drive home. A gentleman was being interviewed on a talk show about how he cured himself of colon cancer. This gentleman claimed he refused all medical treatment and instead went on a macrobiotic diet which completely eradicated his cancer. Further, he was sure that most cancer sufferers could cure their disease through following his diet. "Was his cancer really cured through his macrobiotic diet? Maybe yes and maybe no. If his cancer really did disappear, there could have been any number of factors that independently or in combination with other factors were responsible for his reversal of fortune. "While it is entirely possible that the claimed disappearance of his cancer occurred concurrently with his macrobiotic diet, this in and of itself does not prove that his diet was the cause. Likewise, one person being treated with a drug and having his cancer disappear concurrently with that treatment does not prove the drug was the cause. "The key to proving or at least indicating a viable cause and effect relationship lies in the scientific method of inquiry. This first step of the scientific method involves isolating the substance or practice that is suspected of causing the outcome. That is isoloating the variable --in this case the macrobiotic diet or the drug-- from all other variables that might be alternative causes of the outcome. The scientific method also demands that results be duplicated several times before any reasonable cause and effect conclusions can be drawn. "Some phenomena are easy to prove scientifically. A healthy person's broken bone, if set properly, will heal. Likewise an otherwise healthy person with any of several kinds of bacterial infections can be cured with antibiotics. The value of these treatments are easy to prove because they are nearly 100% effective. That is, if the appropriate antibiotic was administered to 1,000 otherwise healthy people with pneumococcal pneumonia foe example, nearly all of them would have their pneumonia quickly eradicated. If another 1,000 people with pneumococcal pneumonia received no antibiotic, many of them would not recover. "What's more, the effect of an antibiotic on various types of bacteria can be easily tested. The drug will either kill or not kill the bacteria. "With most cancer treatments though, the results are not nearly as clear. It is not at all unusual for a treatment to be partially effective for some patients, completely effective for others, and ineffective for others still. This makes the scientific proof much more complex than in a simple yes or no, all or nothing situation. "For any treatment claims to be considered valid, the same or similar results have to be achieved over and over again. If 10 people with colon cancer switched to the same macrobiotic diet, received no other treatment, and 9 of the 10 saw their cancer disappear, that would be a reasonable indication the the diet was at least partly responsible. If 1,000 people with colon cancer switched to the same macrobiotic diet and 900 of them saw their cancer disappear, that would be an even better indication that the diet was responsible. "All reputable science relies on the scientific method. Whether the research is measuring the effectiveness of a new cancer treatment, the prospects of a political candidate, or consumer reaction to a new breakfast cereal, the principles of scientific inquiry remain the same. While the methods differ, the underlying theory of research is quite straightforward."

Is the Second Best Treatment Good Enough for You? If the President Had Cancer... by Gary Schine If the president were diagnosed with cancer... ...Doctors and researchers would search for the latest information available on treatments that could save him. Top experts would be summoned to the White House. The president would be treated with the best and latest available. He would be given the best opportunity to defeat that cancer, to survive, and to return to good health. For the rest of us it's chancy. You may get the best available or you may not. While teams of physicians and researchers would search the literature to make sure a president or a senator got the best there is, the same would not be done for you or for me. Most of us assume that our doctor is up-to-date on the latest treatments. However, the facts are that this assumption is as naive as it is comfortable. There is a very real chance that a potentially lifesaving treatment exists that your doctor does not know about. You simply don't know unless you have the latest information on your illness. Computers: Pipeline to Better Treatment Not too many years ago, searching for medical developments required a major medical library, volumes of heavy directories, and weeks of time. Today it is possible to search thousands of medical journals in minutes, using online medical databases. Through database searching, anyone can learn about the latest developments in treatment for any illness --and you may learn about it months before your doctor does. It is hardly an exaggeration to say your life may be saved by finding the latest information. The information contained in these databases is not accessible from the World Wide Web; they are subscription-only, government databases which are far from user-friendly. However, the researchers at Schine On-Line Services have been trained to navigate these databases in search of this potentially life-saving information. Don't leave a stone unturned; let the professionals at Schine On-Line Services help you find all your treatment options! Is the Second Best Treatment Good Enough for You? An Overview of Schine On-Line Services Schine On-Line Services, Inc., founded by cancer survivor Gary Schine, author of Cancer Cure, gathers information on any and all types of cancer or other illness directly for clients. Our researchers have extensive on-line experience, training from the National Library of Medicine, and other medical database training.

"Can Information Cure Cancer?" by Gary Schine I was 38 years old when I learned I had a rare form of leukemia. The cancer would kill me, my oncologist warned, because there simply was no cure. He tried to persuade me to take comfort in the fact that it would probably progress slowly; but all I could think about were my two small kids who I'd be leaving behind, and my wife who would have to bring them up alone. Today, over five years later, I am cancer free. I expect to stay that way, and the oncologists familiar with my condition expect the same. I owe my cure to my own efforts in researching and finding the latest information on treating my illness --a newly developed treatment that my doctor knew nothing about.

The service, known as HEED (a Health Economic Evaluations Database), is a database that contains information on health economics articles, in particular studies of cost-effectiveness (and other forms of economic evaluation), with objective analysis of key articles. HEED now has more than 6,000 bibliographic references and 2,200 reviewed articles, building up through monthly updates to contain a comprehensive bibliography of all published economic literature. Topics Content Searching the Database Formatted Reports Academic Panel Organisation More Information and Contact Content A monthly search of clinical and economic on-line databases is undertaken, combined with hand searching of the leading journals containing evaluation literature. Working papers from academic institutions and references from reviewed and other papers are also included. Reviews are undertaken of the selected key literature by researchers in academic institutions according to a structured format. In addition to providing an overview of the paper, they also provide additional information, such as ICD-9 and ATC Codes, type of economic evaluation, and type of data source for events and resources used. These categories can be searched on using the CD-ROM software. Searching the Database HEED is very easy to use, even for beginners. There are no complex commands to learn and nearly all operations are simply 'point and click'. You will find that HEED has been designed for easy reference and frequent use. With 54 fields to choose from, you can search the database by tailoring your search criteria to pick up only data of relevance to you. The search criteria are grouped into a number of subject groupings. Each subject grouping contains specific search criteria, which you can specify in any combination (in addition to wild card and Boolean functions) to search the database. You can modify and refine your search criteria to quickly access your search results in manageable quantities. The subject groupings include: Bibliographical details Study definitions Analysis and results Keywords You will be able to search HEED using keywords or any combination of the search criteria that includes: Author name Book/Journal name Countries applicable Publication dates Publication status Study dates ATC classifications Data Sources Drug names ICD-9 classifications Non-drug technologies Technology assessed Type of article Type of economic evaluation Costs included Discounting Patient groups Sensitivity analysis Sources of clinical and economic information Sponsor You will be able to save your search criteria for use at a later date. Formatted Reports The HEED CD-ROM reports will present the results of your search in a clear easy-to-read format. There are four default report formats: Search Report Summary Report Brief Report Detailed Report The reports will present the results of your search at increasing levels of detail. The Detailed Report will additionally provide details of the study question, key results and, providing Copyright permission has been given by the article publisher, the article abstract in full. Hypertext links are available so that you can access the ICD-9 and ATC sub-reports. You can also design report formats for your own specific requirements. The results of your search can be directed to a printer at varying levels of detail. You can also export your search results to floppy disc in report or ASCII formats. Academic Panel A panel of academic advisors is providing guidance on the search and review processes. The panel comprises Martin Buxton, Mike Drummond, Bernie O'Brien, Kevin Schulman, Bengt Jonsson, Frans Rutten, Joan Rovira and Akinori Hisashige.

With pharmaceutical exports standing at nearly £5 billion,the positive balance of trade in medicines was £2,133 million- 25 per cent higher than the previous year, when it stood at£1,700 million. The figures push pharmaceuticals above power-generatingmachinery into second place as a top earner for Britain. The figures show that exports of pharmaceuticals in 1995 wereworth £4,935 million, compared with £4,004 million theprevious year, while imports stood at £2,802 million (£2,304million in 1994). The results support the recent prediction by the Secretary ofState for Health, Mr Stephen Dorrell, that pharmaceuticals willbe as important for Britain in the next century as they have beenin recent years. "These figures reflect the strength of the British-basedpharmaceutical industry," said Dr Trevor Jones, Director-Generalof the ABPI. "They show the enormous contribution it makestowards the wealth - as well as the health - of the nation whengiven the scope to develop the long-term strategies essentialin a research-based industry. The benefit to Britain's economyin jobs, foreign earnings and tax revenues is also worth £2billion a year. "Nevertheless, despite the undoubted success reflected inthe balance of trade surplus, imports of medicines are growingalmost as fast as exports. While there are clearly pressures onfunding healthcare in the UK, it is vital that any Government,of whatever persuasion, continues to provide a stable environmentwhich looks to the long-term future of the industry." Two of the biggest increases in the pharmaceutical balance oftrade surplus are to European Union countries and to the USA.Exports to the EU rose to £2,592 million in 1995 - a jumpof 38 per cent on 1994 when they were £1,883 million - givinga trade surplus of £553 million, up 33 per cent from £418million. There was a 57 per cent jump in the trade surplus withthe USA, with the 1994 figure of £212 million increasingto £333 million in 1995. This was due to a 46 per cent risein exports (£619 million in 1995 from £426 million in1994). Of other countries, the most dramatic rise is in the trade surpluswith Australia, where it more than doubled from 1994's £57million to reach £117 million in 1995. This was largely dueto a 68 per cent rise in exports.

But the UK is near the bottom of the league table in terms ofthe number of prescriptions written and their cost per head tothe NHS - an average of nine prescriptions a year at an averagecost of less than £9. Publishing its annual review, the ABPI predicted that the UK industrywould break the £2 billion mark in terms of trade surplusin medicines for 1995 - a record surplus with exports of morethan £4 billion, making medicines one of the top three exportearners for Britain. Latest figures for expenditure on UK research and developmentby the pharmaceutical industry show that in 1995 it also reacheda record £2 billion - more than £5 million every day- and represented about 20 per cent of the UK's total investmentin R&D. An analysis of the R&D record of all major Britishcompanies over a four-year period put five pharmaceutical companiesin the top 15. "While we continue to make an enormous investment in thefight against disease - the UK-based pharmaceutical industry isoffering real value for money, to the benefit of the NHS, patientsand taxpayers," said Dr Trevor Jones, Director-General ofthe ABPI at the launch of the association's Annual Review. "However, these figures do pose the question, are we makingthe most of our medicines?," said Dr Jones. "Cheap prescribingis by no means always good prescribing, and it is important thatthe benefit of medicines, and not solely their cost, are takeninto account when deciding how best to treat patients. "There is no doubt that major advances in medicines wouldbe adopted more quickly if there were a shift towards evidence-basedanalysis of health treatments, supported by firm, scientific proofof their effectiveness, and we support moves towards this. Medicinesare a real winner." INTERNATIONAL SUCCESS The role played by the pharmaceutical industry in attracting inwardinvestment to Britain is also highlighted by the report. During1995, the merger of two British firms, Glaxo and Wellcome, createdthe world's largest pharmaceutical company by sales and Britain'slargest company by market capitalisation. Sweden's Pharmacia and the American company Upjohn also mergedand decided to base their international headquarters in Britain."Their decision emphasised confidence in the UK as the locationof choice for many pharmaceutical companies," said the ABPI's immediate past President, Dr Till Medinger. "Many overseas companies are seeking to increase their investmentin the UK, which has long been regarded as a centre of excellencein the pharmaceutical world. The future opportunities for theindustry, linked to the spectacular advance of scientific knowledgein biotechnology and genomics, are more exciting than ever." Several overseas companies increased their investment in the UK,as the process of rationalisation in the industry continued. Rhône-PoulencRorer acquired Fisons, after Astra had strengthened its UK researchbase through the purchase of Fisons' research division, and BASFtook over Boots' prescription medicines manufacturing and researchbusiness. There was a number of other mergers and acquisitionsin the industry. PATIENT EMPOWERMENT The industry's developing relationship with patients is reportedby the Review. To enable patients to take their rightful placein the decision-making process for their own healthcare, the ABPIand pharmaceutical companies recognise that they need to haveaccess to a full range of health information. As well as the introduction of patient packs for prescription-onlymedicines, complete with full patient information leaflets - athree-year rolling programme began at the end of 1995 - the ABPIalso announced a new, voluntary scheme for its member companiesto make available more information to the public when a medicineis licensed. From January, companies have been opening up to the public forthe first time summaries of new licensing data submitted to theGovernment as part of the medicines approval process, includinginformation on safety, side effects and the scientific basis onwhich a medicine is approved. "For too long, the patient's voice has been disregarded andI am delighted that the moves the ABPI has made to involve themin the communication process have been greeted with such enthusiasmby the patient groups," said Dr Medinger.

Scientific studies show that, between 1950 and 1960, only 30 percent of people with epilepsy were seizure-free for a two-yearperiod, states the booklet, Target Epilepsy. Thirty yearslater, this has risen to 60 per cent. "As a medical problem, epilepsy is on a par with diabetes- but funding remains one-twelfth that for diabetes, and specialistclinics dealing with the disease have not been widely introduced,"said Dr Trevor Jones, Director-General of the ABPI, speaking atthe London launch of Target Epilepsy. "Partly as aresponse to this, many pharmaceutical companies working in thisfield are providing a wide range of services for doctors, nursesand people with epilepsy. "The UK-based pharmaceutical industry spends more than £5million a day on researching and developing new medicines, yetits contribution to the fight against disease stretches well beyondthis. Working in co-operation with healthcare professionals andwith patients themselves are key elements in the industry's overallstrategy." The second in a series of booklets designed to inform the generalpublic of the contribution being made by the UK-based pharmaceuticalindustry towards treating healthcare, Target Epilepsy examinesthe different forms the disease can take, what effect it has onpeople, and some of the available treatments, especially anti-epilepticmedicines. The search for such medicines has proved long and difficult. Thereasons for this include: No real indication as to the underlying causes of most casesof epilepsy. Insufficient understanding of brain function. The realisation that epilepsy is not a single condition, buta group of complex disorders. Target Epilepsy shows that the increase in the number ofpeople going two years or more without a seizure has come aboutthrough better advice, improvements in the way medicines are usedand better population studies, as well as improved medication. "In those cases in which control has been achieved over severalyears, a physician may gradually reduce and eventually discontinuemedication, and many such individuals will remain seizure-freefor the rest of their lives," the booklet says. The booklet acknowledges that there are still more than 70,000people with epilepsy in the UK who do not respond adequately toavailable medicines, and much remains to be done. Nevertheless,the overall message is optimistic, because about two-thirds ofpeople have their seizures controlled through the use of a singlemedicine, and even more achieve control through a combinationof therapies. The booklet goes on to describe the development of medicines overthe years, and explains how these work, addressing some difficultchallenges faced by scientists, such as how to get medicines intothe brain - a relatively inaccessible part of the body. And itgoes on to look at future developments. "There has recently been a notable growth of activity inthe field of epilepsy research, and much dedicated work over thepast 25 years has now come to fruition," the booklet says."The result has been the introduction of new agents for partialor generalised seizures or for those whose seizures are not adequatelycontrolled by traditional medicines," says the booklet. Fourentirely new medicines have been introduced in the past six years. And the booklet adds: "Other new products are in the pipeline,but it is too soon to say whether they will represent major clinicalprogress... But in the past few years, new medicines have madehuge progress in the treatment of epilepsy and the search forthe medicines of the future continues."

The booklet, Target Cancer, describes some of the research andclinical contributions to the anticancer battle currently beingmade by British-based pharmaceutical companies. Some 160,000 people die of cancer each year in the UK alone, andthe pharmaceutical industry plays a vital role in investigatingthe disease. More money is invested into researching how cancerworks and how to treat it by the industry - which spends a totalof £4 million a day on research and developing new medicines- than the Government and charities combined, the booklet pointsout. "The UK pharmaceutical industry has a worldwide reputationfor its research and development into cancers, as it does in manyother disease areas," said Dr Trevor Jones, Director-Generalof the ABPI, who chaired the launch of the booklet. "Yetwe are not in competition with the basic work of Government-fundedand charity-based scientists - rather we are working in full co-operationand collaboration with them." Nearly 50 new potential compounds in UK clinical trials for cancertreatment or diagnosis are listed in the booklet, including morethan 30 non-biological treatments - the others are biologicalproducts resulting from research in molecular biology. The firstcategory incorporates medicines to fight cancer in a variety ofareas, including breast cancer (six new medicines); large intestine(six); prostate (five); lung (five); and leukaemias (three). The rest are in other areas, including cancers of the ovaries,pancreas, kidney, testes, stomach, head/neck, liver, and tumoursin various nervous tissue locations. Among the biological productsare stimulators of blood cell production in the bone marrow, bonemarrow protectors, immune stimulators and vaccine-type agents.There are also three agents designed to break the resistance thatsome tumours develop to medicines. Target Cancer explains that one of the most serious problems facingclinicians in the treatment of cancer is the development of resistanceto the medicines used. Studies in the USA have suggested that90 per cent of the 1,400 people who die from cancer each day havedeveloped resistance at the time of their death. Anti-cancer medicines need to accumulate inside cells to work.Many cells that become resistant develop a mechanism for pumpingout anti-cancer medicines. Much research has therefore been directedtowards the discovery of compounds to prevent or reverse thisprocess, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of current medicines.If this proves possible, one of the major problems facing physiciansis overcome. Scientists have now identified many of the altered outer constituentsof cancer cells, raising the possibility that anti-cancer vaccinescan be made. New types of anti-cancer vaccine have been producedand some are in early trials for solid tumours such as breast,pancreas, large intestine, lung, prostate and skin cancer (melanoma). However, the booklet suggests these products are more likely tocomplement available therapies and boost other therapeutic measuresrather than replace them. Among more conventional approaches, advances are being made inareas, including: In breast cancer research, particular attention has been paidto dealing with 'steroid-dependent' tumours, whose growth dependson 'stimulation' by oestrogen. Developments are also being madewith an agent originally isolated from the bark of the Pacificyew tree, but which can now be made synthetically. Recent developments have resulted in improved survival ratesfor patients in the advanced stages of ovarian cancer. A new classof anti-cancer medicines has shown effectiveness in patients whohave not responded to some forms of conventional therapy. Prostate cancer and prostate enlargement - which often precedescancerous transformation - are a massive potential medical problem.In Europe, there are some 19 million cases, with only about twomillion receiving treatment. Several companies are developingtherapies to deal with both conditions. Affecting both men and women, cancer of the large intestineis one of the most frequent causes of death and is a tumour thatspreads easily, especially to the liver. Several companies havemade this a high-priority objective. Established lung cancer is among the most difficult of allcancers to treat. In an attempt to improve therapy, several companiesare investigating medicines aimed at targeting the tumours moreeffectively. The booklet examines progress in the research into cancer beingmade by the British-based industry in four main areas, althoughthe unique expertise of the industry lies in designing, synthesisingand testing new molecules. "Some companies are British owned,while others are subsidiaries of multinational organisations whichrecognise the reputation of British medicine by basing their researchand development or clinical research facilities here," statesthe booklet. The booklet stresses there is clearly much more to be done inthe fight against cancer, and that many companies intend applyinggene therapy to many forms of cancer. "If this happens, itcould herald the dawn of a new era of cancer treatment,"the booklet states. The overall message of Target Cancer is encouraging. Increasingly,there is greater openness about the causes and treatment of cancerwhich will help to take the mystery out of the disease and removesome of the fear still attached to it. "In the meantime, those who develop cancer should be awareof the great progress that has been made - many tumours can becured and for those where this remains impossible, the durationand quality of their lives can often be greatly increased,"the booklet says. Target Cancer has been produced to inform the general public ofthe contribution being made by the UK-based pharmaceutical industrytowards diagnosing and treating cancer. Researched and writtenby Dr Mike Hall, a well-respected medical writer, the bookletis available free from the ABPI, 12 Whitehall, London, SWIA 2DY, United Kingdom.

Chapters in the book cover the following: The inverse care and the targeting of GP health promotion resources. Dr Peter Toon (GP, Hackney and London Implementation Group) discusses the difficulties arising from the inequalities of access to GP care highlighted by a study of the patient health checks (introduced in 1990) which was conducted in Hackney. It was found that those most in need of care were least likely toreceive it and that such generalised health promotion campaigns fail to make a significant impact on risk factors (Smoking, diet, weight, alcohol consumption) and hence on morbidity, but simultaneously have a negative effect on quality of life of those who do take part by raising their anxiety. He argues that health promotion is to a large extent `the art of the possible' and, therefore, to set a health promotion agenda on the basis of the importance of various risk factors rather than their susceptibility to change is misguided. The implications of marketing medicinal products to consumers. Using the example of Zovirax and its switch from being a prescription only medicine to pharmacy sale, Noel Hall (formerly of Wellcome UK) finds that there are a number of lessons to be learned for all concerned: Manufacturers who are predominantly involved with the marketing of prescription only medicines have to continually remember that when they switch a product the customer is no longer the health professional but a consumer; the Pharmacy profession should carry out a major campaign to explain their role to consumers which might in turn lead consumers to recognise the value of information provided by pharmacists; and consumers need to take greater responsibility for understanding their own health problems, to read the patient information supplied with their medicine and to know where to go to obtain further information if necessary. Medicines and the role of Patient Information Leaflets.Dr Sharon Gibbs (Freelance Researcher and Writer) discusses the results of her research into patients knowledge about their medicines and the impact of patient information leaflets on their level of knowledge. She also reflects on the difficulties that pharmaceutical companies face when writing patient information leaflets in ensuring that the leaflets reach their target audience whilst at the same time containing sufficient information to comply with current legislation; The legal implications of the provision of health information. Diana Brahams (Practising Barrister and medico-legal correspondent, The Lancet) considers the legal implications for pharmacists and general practitioners in providing health information. Both doctors and pharmacists owe their patients a duty to act with reasonable skill and care but whilst under their new contracts GPs are required to provide information to promote a healthy lifestyle there is no such requirement in contracts for community pharmacists. Using the examples of real cases, Mrs Brahams discusses the legal relationship between the consumer and both professional groups and the possible pitfalls that might occur. The role of pharmacists in the provision of health information to the consumer. This chapter takes the form of four papers by Dr Philip Brown (Publisher of SCRIP World Pharmaceutical News), Linda Stone (Community Pharmacist and a Past President of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society), Derek Prentice (Consumers' Association) and Dr Felicity Smith (Lecturer in Pharmacy Practice). From their different perspectives, the authors discuss whether pharmacists have a role in providing information to consumers and if so, are they currently fulfilling this responsibility in a way which meets the consumers needs. At the conference, this subject was then opened up to the audience to continue the debate and some of the discussion is included. Patient's rights - a middle class phenomenon? Rabbi Julia Neuberger (Chair of Camden and Islington Community Health Services NHS Trust) suggests that if the way in which health services were analysed it would be seen that most are provided to meet the needs of the professions providing the services rather than the patients who have to use them. She argues that the rise ofthe patient's right movement was to some extent a response to this situation. Whilst for a variety of historical and sociological reasons this movement started off as a middle class phenomenon it could no longer be said that it was confined to any one section of society. DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE This OHE report by Nick Marchant, published in September 1995, argued that a national screening programme for prostate cancer in men is not yet practicable. Prostate cancer is a significant cause of illness and death amongst men. However, neither radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy, the two main treatments used for early stage prostate cancer, have had any significant effect on either life expectancy or quality of life. Indeed, no clinical trial has yet demonstrated increased survival for patients as a result of treatment. Because of this, the author believes there is little point in a national screening programme being introduced. About 10 per cent of all malignant male cancers diagnosed in the UK each year are prostate cancer - only lung cancer has a higher rate. And the figure is rising. In 1992, there were 8,735 deaths attributable to prostate cancer, more than double the 4,313 in 1974. The burden of prostate cancer falls mainly on the elderly - only 206 of the deaths in 1992 occurred in men under 60. Withthe numbers of older people in the country rising, the report points out that the number of deaths caused by prostate cancer is likely to rise - perhaps to as many as 18,500 by 2031. The booklet also deals with all other forms of prostatic disease, especially benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Symptoms include the desire to urinate during sleep, more often than normal, and pain during urination. There are about 78,000 new sufferers from BPH in the UK each year. Because symptoms build up gradually, many men accept BPH as part of the ageing process and suffer unnecessarily. The past two decades have seen the development of a number of therapies for the treatment of BPH. Medicines and minimally-invasive therapies, as well as watchful waiting, are increasingly being regarded as realistic options to surgery. With effective treatment now available unnecessary suffering - especially in patients with milder forms of the disease - could be averted by increasing publicawareness. VALUE OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO THE UK ECONOMY The "Value of the Pharmaceutical Industry to the UK Economy", published by the OHE in the summer of 1995, sets out how the UK economy benefits from having resources employed in the UK based pharmaceutical industry rather than in other industry sectors.Wherever possible these benefits are estimated. The overall conclusion is that the value of the pharmaceutical industry to the UK economy in 1992 was around £2 billion. How does the UK economy benefit ? Benefits to patients - Patients receive improved and more timely medicines as a result of medicines being developed in the UK. R&D spinoffs - Other industries, the NHS and universities, are able to produce better products and services, and/or lower unit costs as a result of improvements in the science knowledgebase derived from high levels of pharmaceutical R&D. Export profits - Higher profits from exported medicines benefit the UK economy in 2 ways: higher net profits to UK owners; higher corporation tax revenues to the UK Exchequer. Employees' Wages - Higher wages paid in the industry, compared with other sectors, benefit the economy through: higher net earnings by UK workers; higher income tax revenues to the UK Exchequer. Competitive Advantage in the global market drives better terms of trade, helping the UK trade balance. How were these benefits measured ? The estimates provided assume that no research or production facilities, nor corporate headquarters of pharmaceutical companies remain in the UK. The resources "freed up" are assumed to beutilised in other sectors. The paper focuses on the long term effects which would persist even after these resources could be re-employed, and so excludes any adjustment costs of retraining personnel or obsolescence ofassets. The estimates also exclude payments between parties inside the UK (transfers). Only income increasing the purchasing power of the UK is included. In its simplest form this is income from abroad which adds to the wealth of the UK. INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY This book, edited by Adrian Towse, brings together the proceedings of the Symposium held by the OHE in June 1994. It examines the practice of industrial policy in relation to the pharmaceuticalindustry in Europe, Japan, and the USA, and elements of policy - supporting the science base, good purchasing, and attracting inward investment. George Yarrow, of Hertford College, Oxford, examining the European Commission's Industrial Policy document argues a trade-off between innovative and price competition had to be recognised. More price competition meant less innovative competition. It is the dynamic gains, from innovation, that are the source of real gain to society, hence the need for society to place the balancebetween the two in the right place. He noted the conflict between national government pricing policies and the creation of a single market through the free movement of product. This could lead to an export of price control. Paralleltrade would push prices down to those of the lowest priced Member State. Innovation would fall. He argued that uniform prices are not the outcome of single markets. Prices take account of factors such as volume and other customer characteristics. The way to improve the trade-off between innovative and price competition was to allow price differentials within a single market, through more sophisticated pricing mechanisms. If this required some competition policy exemptions then theyshould be negotiated. Professor Ian Neary of the Contemporary Japan Centre, University of Essex, argued that the Japanese MHW had no industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry. The fortunes of the industrywere a low priority for the MHW which had kept the pro-industrial policy MITI out of policy making. However, some of the top tier of Japanese companies would be internationally successful, in spite of lack of government sponsorship. Professor Scherer of Harvard University noted that although there had been nothing in the USA that could be called an industrial policy, some Federal level policies were of significant benefit,notably NIH spending of nearly $5bn per annum on research, and the Orphan Drug Act. Professor Trevor Jones, Director-General of the ABPI noted that the UK had been a fruitful source of new pharmaceutical products because of the strong foundation of basic science upon which biomedical research is based, together with a long tradition of clinical science and practice in world renowned university hospitals, and the NHS. To maintain excellence in drug discovery and development, the UK needed policies to retain a strong science and medical base. This had to be matched with adequate funding, not only of research grants but of the fabric of university and institutelaboratories, many of which now showed marked signs of deterioration. The restructuring of the Research Councils and the Technology Foresight exercise provided new impetus for further investment in biomedical R&D. It would be important that it was not diluted in the competition for funds, and that building on strengths was a feature of allocation. Professor Henry Grabowski of Duke University set out evidence from his work on the costs of R&D and the returns or profitability of NCEs coming to market, commenting on the implications for policy makers wanting to use price control to keep purchasing costs down. His 1991 study with DiMasi, Hansen, and Lasagna, produced a best estimate of $231m (in 1987 dollar) and 12 years to discover and develop a new drug. But whereas R&D investment costs have been increasing further since then, product life cycles have been getting shorter as a result of faster follow-on from competing drugs, and increased generic competition when patents expire. In his most recent study with Vernon, he found large variations in returns across NCEs. Whilst the top ten per cent of products earn more than five times the capitalised value of average R&Dcosts, only the top 30 per cent cover average R&D costs (see Figure). The remaining 70 per cent will not typically cover any of the common discovery costs or the costs of failures. Hence blockbuster drugs motivate the R&D process. As healthcare costs escalate, there is a risk that all countries will try to obtain the most innovative new pharmaceuticals at breakeven prices and try to leave the payments for drug R&D to other countries. Left unchecked, these developments could result in a drastic curtailment of global R&D investment for new medicines, despite the exciting potential for scientific advances that now exist. Jeremy Holmes, Managing Director of EAG, and Professor John Dunning looking at factors influencing the location of multinational investment decisions in the pharmaceutical industry. Of the four factors that influenced R&D location, resource factors were most important for European firms, followed by market factors, drug and general regulatory factors. For US firms, market factorswere more important than resource factors. The most important resource factor for R&D investment was the quality of a country's tertiary education system. It was difficult to overstate the importance f government policies in developing and upgrading the human capital base. Governments seeking to attract R&D had to adopt "holistic" policies towards industrial competitiveness that recognised the links between policy on education, technology, industry tax andemployment. Other contributors were Lois Quam, Vice President of Public Services at United Health Care (an edited version of her paper was included in OHE News 2) and Adrian Towse, OHE Director, of the Value of the UK-based pharmaceutical industry. Handling Uncertainty in the Results of Economic Evaluation This Briefing, by Andrew Briggs of Brunel University HERG, discusses how sensitivity analysis and other techniques for handling uncertainty can be used to give decision makers confidence in the robustness (or otherwise) of the results of an health economic evaluation of a medicine or other treatment. He identifies four types of uncertainty, relating to: the data requirements of the study; the extrapolation of data or end points; the generalisability of results; and the choice of analytic method.Although the use of statistical analysis to represent uncertainty is usual in clinical evaluation, it is not yet the method of choice for economic evaluations. The Briefing discusses four main types of sensitivity analysis (simple sensitivity analysis, extreme sensitivity analysis, threshold analysis, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis) and sets out guidelines for the choice of and presentation of sensitivity analysis. THE ECONOMICS OF HEALTH CARE A booklet designed to help teachers and students apply economics to health care and to the challenges facing Britain's National Health Service has been distributed free to all secondary schools and colleges with A-level or equivalent courses in economics. Additional copies have been supplied at a price of £1. To date more than 6500 copies have been sent out. The booklet, produced by the Office of Health Economics (OHE) and sponsored by the charities committee of Glaxo Wellcome, is entitled "The Economics of Health Care". It supportsthe new A-level syllabuses which place particular emphasis on the application of basic economic techniques to particular sectors of the economy. The 50-page booklet comprises five units which examine: The problem of health care; How a free market approach to health care would work; The case against a free market; Health care in the UK; Some further questions. As well as text, pictures and graph, the booklet contains activity boxes - suggesting related and follow-up projects which could be undertaken - as well as posing questions for the student toconsider. It comes with a full set of teachers' notes. Hypothecated Health Taxes - An evaluation of recent proposals This report, by Andrew Jones and Alan Duncan of the University of York, examines the arguments put forward for the special tax which, its advocates claim, could increase the money available to the NHS while reducing political interference. Such ideas have been put forward for discussion by organisations including the Institute of Economic Affairs, the British Medical Association and the Liberal Democrats. The report notes that in 1993-94, £36 billion was spent on the NHS - about £630 per head or £1,500 per income tax payer. This would be equivalent to a "health tax" rate of 16p in the pound, cutting the present general income tax rate from 25p to 9p. The criteria outlined in the report against which the proposed tax is measured are: efficiency; equity; stable but growing revenue base; transparency; responsiveness; flexibility; autonomy and accountability. The main challenge is to create a genuine link between the separate tax and the NHS expenditure, the report concludes. Creating a separate NHS fund would help, but governments mighttry to shift other expenditure on to the NHS so the fund would pay for that, too. Supporters of the earmarking would also need to set out the political mechanism by which the annual tax ratewould be set. These two issues will be examined in a future OHE report by the authors. Health Care As A Handicraft Industry The second annual OHE lecture was given by one of the worlds leading economists, Professor W J Baumol. In the lecture publication he states that Britain can and should spend more on the NHS. He says that "a major source of the health care cost disease can be traced to the differences in the productivity growth rates of the various parts of the typical developed economy. It is hardlysurprising that, while overall productivity in the industrial world has been growing rapidly, the pace of growth in different sectors has varied substantially." He argues that health care is a "handicraft" industry. It "cannot be fully automated and liberated from the requirement of a substantial residue of personal skill and attention".There has been some rise in productivity but over longer periods it has been, and will be, far slower than the rate of productivity increase of the economy as a whole. That is why the share of GDPdevoted to health care will rise, irrespective of the impact of the aging of the population. Professor Baumol argues that straight forward arithmetic suggests that over the next 50 years medical outlays may more than double their share of GDP. In the US health care expenditure could risefrom 12 per cent of GDP to 35 per cent. The UK currently spends 6.8 per cent of its GDP on health, a doubling would increase it to 14 per cent of GDP. This may mean tax increases are necessary to pay for increases in NHS spending over time. It is a fiscal illusion that underlies the view that consumers as a group cannot afford to pay the risingcosts of health care. Economic growth means that we can afford more of everything - private and public consumption. However if taxes do not rise, the choice is to design a privately financedystem that provides high quality universal coverage, (he sets out eight goals to be achieved in such a design), or to allow a publicly funded service to be steadily eroded. Financing Health Care in the UK: A Discussion of NERA'sPrototype Model to Replace the NHS This report, edited by Adrian Towse, is the result 0f an OHE symposium held in 1993 to discuss a major report Financing Health Care by the specialist economics consultancy NERA which included a prototype model for health care reform, which, in the UK, woud replace the NHS with a guaranteed health care package available to all, funded by compulsory income based contributions to a central insurance fund, with consumers then choosing which private insurer to use (the private insurer would be given a fixed sum by the central insurance fund), paying extra for services outside the guaranteedhealth care package. Professor A J Culyer argues that proposals to replace the NHS are fundamentally flawed. One of the UK's leading health economists, he argues that a private sector insurance scheme will raise administration costs, restrict access to services for those with chronic illnesses or low incomes, and is "frankly naive about the workings of competitive insurance." The NERA proposals are supported by William Laing in his contribution to the publication. He argues that consumers can exercise choice in health care, and that competition to provide a guaranteed healthcare package will generate enormous improvements in the quality and efficiency of health care in the UK. He concludes that it is "quite possible to imagine the ideas [the proposals] being part of the mainstream health policy debate in the UK in 5 to 10 years time ... the greatest attraction of the NERA proposals is the possibility that regulated competition might stimulate the emergence of radically new and more efficient health care delivery systems as part of the "discovery" process associated with competitive markets." Section 2 Forthcoming Publications STIMULATING R&D INTO NEW MEDICINES FOR LESS DEVELOPEDCOUNTRIES In December 1994 the OHE co-hosted a discussion meeting entitled "Stimulating R&D into new medicines for Less Developed Countries". This highly productive meeting was a joint venture with a Working Party of the WHO Ad Hoc Committee on Health Research Relating to Future Intervention Options headed by Prof. R. Feachem, now of the World Bank. The central aim of the meeting was to bring together a group individuals with industry backgrounds, along with appropriate academics and public policy makers to identify any barriers which were perceived to exist to the expeditious development of many new medicines needed in the poorer nations of the world. The discussions raised a number of interesting points, including the following: Intellectual property protection may still be insufficient in many developing countries because of delayed implementation of GATT / TRIPS arrangements. Effective demand in developing countries may be too low to generate a positive return on investment in which case subsidies of some form are likely to be necessary from the developed world. Orphan Drug legislation could be used as a model on which to base intervention. There may be a role for an international purchasing agency, set up and funded, partly, by developed countries Companies already receive assistance with the set up and conduct of clinical trials in developing country environments. The pattern of disease is changing and there will be greater convergence between developing and developing countries. These issues and others relating to the problem, in particular the potential role for Orphan Drug type legislation, are addressed in detail in a forthcoming OHE publication. DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS AND PULMONARY EMBOLISM In a report by Jane Griffin which looked at the problems caused by deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism it was noted that approximately 10 per cent of all hospital deaths were due to pulmonary embolism (most fatal emboli arise from a deep vein thrombosis in the lower limb). DVT is preventable, and the report highlights the point that the most efficient way to prevent both fatal andnon-fatal thromboembolism is to use routine prophylaxis for moderate to high risk hospital patients. The report argues that not only would this course of action save lives but would also be cost-effectivein preventing non-fatal symptomatic thromboembolism, which requires investigation and treatment. The report questions why, in the light of all the supporting evidence, effective routine prophylaxisis still not being used routinely. Copies of the report will be available from late spring/summer 1996 Section 3 PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HEALTH ECONOMICS GROUP The PIHEG met on September 19th to discuss "Delivering Health Economics Information to NHS Decision Takers" Professor John Gabbay, Wessex Institute of Public Health, spoke from an NHS perspective on the use of cost-effectiveness evidence. He explained that with health-care spending increasing in every developed country the need for cost-effectiveness based evidence for clinical decision-making was becoming greater. Professor Gabbay focused upon the local initiative in which he is involved at the Wessex Institute of Public Health. This consists of a series of rapid research reviews, taking 2-3 months to complete, detailing various health technologies, each aimed at achieving an approximate90% accuracy level. Each report is used to inform Wessex's Development Evaluation Committee about which health technologies to recommend to Health Commissions and Trusts in the Wessex region for use in contract setting. Health technologies are recommended for adoption or non-adoption on the basis of cost utility and the strength of evidence on which the cost utility was calculated. Derek Smith, Chief Executive of Kings College Hospital, discussed his reasons for being sceptical over the role of health economics in NHS decision making. He viewed the absence of structures toenable rigorous economic review as particularly significant. A variety of factors were cited as responsible for this situation: independence traditionally sought by NHS consultants focus of purchasing in single year boxes limited numbers of public health doctors poor information and information flows pressure to rationalise is not as strong in UK as in the US despite purchaser/provider split Despite the problems highlighted Derek Smith believes the changing health environment is likely to force change as a result of pressures on policy makers (ageing population/higher utilisation rates/diminishing government revenues/rising public expectations) and the system growing. Health economics seems sure to become a necessary and integral part of decision making. Adrian Towse presented the results of a University of York survey of 90 GPs, "Will GPs use evidence on cost-effectiveness". The survey dealt with the need to identify and understand thefactors which determine whether or not an economic evaluation will impact upon a target audience. The target audience investigated in this case was GPs, both fundholders (FHGPs) and non-fundholders (NFHGPs). Results from the study indicated that the credibility that GPs attach to a study is dependent upon certain key criteria: SPONSOR - Industry sponsored studies have low credibility amongst GPs, whereas GP funded studies through BMA/RCGP have most credibility. DECISION-MAKER INVOLVEMENT - A large increase in credibility would result with GP involvement. FHGPs rated this as more important than NFHGPs. STUDY INVESTIGATOR - University Research Centres are seen as the most appropriate investigators and Patient Support Groups as the least appropriate. MEDIUM OF DISSEMINATION - GPs rely heavily on journal reputation, with the Medical Journal / BMJ / Lancet carrying most credibility. Drug company mailings and drug representative visits carry the least. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY - Credibility increases if studies comply with an acceptable methodological framework. The survey suggests that economic evaluations will have an impact upon GPs, even when only modest economic consequences are identified. GPs appear to be a receptive and positive audience with a reasonable level of understanding. A lesson from the survey is that the impact of an economic evaluation can be maximised by tailoring the structure and dissemination of the study to the particular requirements and comprehension level of the target audience. Section 4 1996 OHE ANNUAL LECTURE David Sackett calls for Evidence-Based Medicine and Cost-Utility to Ration Care in the NHS The 1996 Annual lecture was given by Professor David Sackett of the University of Oxford and the NHS R&D Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, on February 13 at the Royal College of Physicians. The title of Professor Sackett's presentation was "Evidence-Based Medicine, Cost Utility and the Physician ". He discussed from a physician's point of view, the relationship between economics, with its concepts of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility, evidence -based medicine and the care of individual patients. The lecture was attended by approximately 250 people. A paper based on the presentation will be published later this year as part of the OHE Annual Lecture monograph series. Professor David Sackett is the Director of the NHS R&D Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and Chair in Clinical Epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Medicines, University of Oxford.Prior to moving, to Oxford, in 1994, he worked at McMaster University in Canada, where he founded the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and served in turn, as Hospital Physician-in-Chief and University Head of the Division of Internal Medicine. Evidence-Based Medicine Professor Sackett began by defining "evidence-based medicine" as "the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of the current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients". The practice of evidence-based medicine requires the fusion of two different sorts of things. The first, the individual clinical expertise that gets better and better; second the best available external clinical evidence, access to which becomes worse and worse. By individual expertise we mean the increasing proficiency and judgement that individual clinicians acquire through clinical experience and clinical practice. It is not "cook-book medicine". External guidelines have to be integrated with individual clinical expertise in deciding whether and how it matches the patient's clinical state, predicamentand preferences, and thus whether it should be applied. E-BM is not Cost Cutting Evidence-based medicine is not cost-cutting medicine. There is afoot in many of the health professions a concern that evidence-based medicine will be hi-jacked by purchasers and managers, merely to cut the cost of health care for individual patients. This of course is a misunderstanding of what EBM is about because, if indeed it is directed toward the benefit of individual patients,evidence-based medicine identifies and applies the most efficacious interventions to maximise their function, quantity and quality of life, and may raise rather than lower the cost of their care. There is also a myth that most medicine is not evidence-based and huge savings can be made by cutting out this care, not to mention avoiding harm to patients. In one month we admitted 121patients; we diagnosed 109; and discovered that the pundits had it upside down: that evidence-based care was provided to 82 per cent of our patients - slightly more than half on the basis of randomised trials, another third on the basis of convincing non-experimental evidence, and only about 18 per cent without substantial evidence. Tackling Conflicts Conflicts that exist arise because I am striving to offer and provide manoeuvres that maximise my patient's utility. But in doing so I run the risk of using resources that ought to be going to optimising the mean cost utility to society. The opportunity cost of serving my patient's need may be to dis-serve some other patient's needs in a broader social context. The issue again is one of having to recognise that and sort out how to minimise it and what to do about it. Individual clinicians comply with restrictions on access when they are judged to be valid for the patient in question and judged to be ethical in their construction. This requires disclosure to patients that "yes, indeed, there is a manoeuvre" and "yes, on average it would improve your quality of life" but that, given the rationing which has arguably existed ever since the first shaman found the first skull back in Palaeolithic times, a decision has been made by the health care system, by the public, by society, to restrict this; that that would be disclosed and, again, an offer made to link them to some other source. This would apply to manoeuvres which, although they would maximise my patient's utility, would conflict with distributive justice, and that I am a willing party to that group decision. How can we minimise these areas of conflict? First, we can go after, and generate if we do not have it, more valid evidence to identify the ineffective manoeuvres now in use. The governmental papers suggest that perhaps 5 per cent of the £20 million which was being spent in surgical services might be unnecessary. Stopping that sort of activity frees up those resources for reallocation, more benefits both to the group and the individual patient, minimising the impacts of those differing points of view - minimising the conflict by increasing public confidence in an evidence-based and just health system. With more and more valid cost utility information for use in policy-making, to identify the marginal cost per unit of health gain for the other manoeuvres, society can then decide whether to ration in an ordered fashion and draw a line or, through some other consensus development method, sort out which resources should or should not be made available. Section 5 Primary Care led purchasing in the NHS: Fundholding and other models PROFESSOR C HAM, Director, Health Services Management Centre, University of Birmingham In recent years there has been a shift of power within the Health Service. We have seen purchasers refocusing their activities, from the management of health care institutions and hospitals to thinking about the population, its health needs and how best they can use their resources to respond to those needs. In addition, dialogue has opened between health authorities and general practitioners,combining a public health agenda with an interest in primary care. A consequence of this shift in the balance of power has been to put specialists and secondary care providers in a more accountableposition, and to give purchasers, including GP fundholders, a greater capacity to exert leverage over how services are delivered This policy has been reinforced with recent measures to develop a primary care-led NHS. There are two key components in this policy. One is the extension of fundholding; with three new options on the table, including "total purchasing" for a number of practices. The secondis the move to integrate district health authorities and Family Health Services Authorities in England and Wales from April 1996, bringing these two countries into line with Scotland and Northern Ireland where integration has existed for some time. These integrated authorities, will be expected to give priority to primary care, strengthening primary care provision and ensuring that all GPs,not just fundholders, have influence over planning, purchasing and the commissioning of health care. Starting with the two original models of purchasing: the population-centred approach, focused on the work of health authorities, and the more patient-oriented fundholding, what we have seen in practice is the rapid development of a range of mixed or hybrid models. Fundholding has gone off into different directions with community fundholding, total purchasing, and the spontaneous emergence of multi-funds, with a new association which has been set up to bringtogether the work of those multi-funds. Starting from the population-centred model, we see health authorities developing a range of locality-based approaches to commissioning, trying to devolve and de-centralise their decision-making. Wesee interest in practice-sensitive purchasing as health authorities try to get alongside individual practices, often developing notional budgets in the process. More strategically, we see the development of joint commissioning between health authorities and their local authority partners. This innovation and experimentation has not been driven from the centre but has evolved from the bottom up. Managers, doctors and others have taken the opportunity to see how far they can test out these different approaches. What does the evidence, such as it is, tell us about the likely effectiveness of these alternative purchasing models? The Effectiveness of Fundholding Fundholding has had a number of effects. The UK experience certainly suggests that if you change the incentive structure facing primary care physicians they will change their clinical practices, not on the basis of good research evidence but because the way in which they are paid has changed. This is an important conclusion to draw, not just from fundholding but also from the 1990 GP contract and the impact that this had on health promotion, prevention work and other aspects of GPs' clinical activity. What fundholding has done in particular is: Change in prescribing behaviour, producing more cost-effective prescribing, and increasing the use of generic drugs. GPs in fundholding practices have consequently often made savings in their drugs budgets. Reduce waiting times for hospital appointments, both outpatient and inpatient, for the patients registered with fundholding practices. There has also been improved communication between general practitioners and their specialist colleagues. For example, improved discharge information getting back more quickly to GPs - a common complaint over many years. Increase the range of services being delivered within primary care. Often the savings GPs have made, in prescribing budgets, for example, are redeployed to pay counsellors, physiotherapists,and dieticians, to deliver care in the practice rather than referring patients to hospital to receive those services. Equally important, it should be acknowledged that the adverse effects of fundholding that I and many other people predicted do not seem to have materialised so far. The main danger anticipated was that fundholding would create an incentive for GPs to select patients. This does not appear to have happened, although the absence of research does not helpus make that judgement. The reason that risk selection has not materialised is that despite the intention in Working for Patients to establish budgets on a capitation basis, they have been seton an historical basis, looking at what GPs have done in the past and therefore they have been relatively generous without creating a strong incentive to introduce risk selection. The literature indicates that management and transaction costs appear to be relatively high in relation to fundholding, as compared with other models of purchasing. This is not just because of themanagement allowances paid to fundholders, but more especially because of the additional workload for the NHS trusts in having to negotiate tailor-made contracts with a large number of smallpurchasers. The survey evidence appears to suggest that one of the main complaints GPs have about fundholding is the workload. This is unsurprising, given that taking on a budget will involve additional responsibilities. How long that can be sustained is an important question which needs to be addressed. The achievements of fundholders which I have mentioned have been thrown into sharper relief, by the fact that on the whole health authorities, following the population-centred purchasing model,were much slower to develop their role as purchasers. One reason for that is they were not encouraged to be very entrepreneurial in the early days. The emphasis was on steady state; the political line was to progress rather slowly. Over time their impact has increased. They are now working with GPs in localities and through all sorts of other mechanisms. In the process, they are re-focusing their attention away from simplythe management of health care services to the public health agenda set out in The Health of the Nation. The emphasis is now on evidence-based medicine, ensuring cost-effectiveness in theuse of resources, and also the policy of a primary care-led NHS. The innovation we have seen in primary care has not been confined to GP fundholding. We are also seeing some very important developments in primary care provision and commissioning in non-fundholding practices. For example, the Lyme Community Care Unit in Dorset is achieving many of the same benefits that fundholding has done without actually going down that route. Assessing Models of Purchasing What sense can we make of all of this, given incomplete evidence, a rapidly moving picture, and differential developments of the alternative models? We need to find a way of combining populationcentred and patient-focused purchasing. The simple question who is the better purchaser, the health authority or the fundholder, is the wrong question to ask. The evidence suggests that health authorities are better at some aspects of purchasing, assessing community health care needs and working strategically with their partners in local authorities and in the voluntary sector. Equally,GPs in fundholding and, to some extent, in non-fundholding practices are better at other aspects of purchasing. They are much closer to their patients. They have more direct experience of the qualityof care. They can respond to demands in a way which it will always be difficult to do for those who staff health authorities. The challenge is to combine the leverage of health authorities and the bite of fundholders to see if we can get the best of both of these different models of purchasing. There is no guarantee that the sum of multiple purchasing decisions will add up to an appropriate pattern of service provision for people who are living in a given health district. Indeed, puttingit more forcibly and more bluntly, if we do not co-ordinate and synchronise purchasing decisions by health authorities on the one hand and fundholders on the other there is a real risk of instability and fragmentation. The ability to ensure good local access to comprehensive services will no longer be there because there is not the capacity in the service to plan and co-ordinate in the way we have become accustomed over the last 45 to 50 years. So there needs to be "synchronised purchasing" in the new NHS. How that is to be achieved has never really been specified. Turning to the future, fundholding is now seen as the preferred option for GPs but not the only option. There has been a shift in policy. It is quite likely, that fundholding will expand to cover perhaps 50 per cent of the population in England by next year, and maybe 60 per cent beyond that. It will be difficult to get beyond the 60 per cent figure because some GPs remain opposed to fundholding. Other options will therefore be needed. Let us also recognise that, as the financial constraints in the health service tighten we may find not only further practices going into the scheme, but also some exits from fundholding. If the Government is serious about moving away from the current budget-setting method towards the capitation approach to fundholding, then over time that could mean some significant shifts for individual practices - both up and down. Under that system, the financial attractions to the losers of remaining as fundholders will diminish. It would also not be at all surprising if some practices felt that they had achieved what they wanted in two or three years of fundholding and decided to leave the scheme after that; especially if health authorities become better purchasers and they become more sensitive to GPs. The relative advantage of the different models may then change. Despite the support and the momentum behind fundholding, it is probable that health authorities will continue to have an important role themselves as the direct purchasers. Whilst, they will also take on the more strategic, enabling role that has been prescribed for them, we are a long way from the position where health authorities will give up holding a budget and buying some services directlyfor the populations they serve. At the present time the proportion of the hospital and community health services' budget controlled by fundholders, and the proportion of the population covered by fundholders is relatively small comparedwith the vast amount of resources still under the control of health authorities. The question is how will that change and how rapidly. Speculating about two years down the track it might look somethinglike Figure 2. Total purchasers are in the left-hand column, GPs buying all services for their patients, covering perhaps 10 to 15 per cent of the population in England. Standard fundholding will expand because of the extensions to the services that GPs are purchasing, and we know that more practices will come in. Then we have the community fund holding option right at the end. This is clearly not a precise scientific prediction. However, it does suggest that there will still be a considerable amountof resources under the control of health authorities as direct purchasers. So for some time to come there will continue to be a role for health authorities, even with the current emphasis placed on the expansion and the development of GP fundholding. What about a change of Government? Let me be bold here and suggest that it may not make that much difference. First of all, I do not think fundholding will be abolished overnight. If you area future Labour Secretary of State, it is unlikely that you would wish to antagonise a large number of GPs with a unilateral decision to get rid of fundholding. It is more likely that the policy will be geared towards encouraging GPs to leave fundholding of their own freewill and to participate in alternative GP commissioning models. There would seem to be increasing convergence between the political parties. Labour's GP-commissioning model does not appear to be that different from the current policy, ie a primary care-led NHS. GPs who are already commissioning, under the umbrella of an integrated health authority seem to be operating in a way which would be rather similar to how they would function if there wasa change of Government in the next two years. The Labour Party has shifted its thinking. It is prepared to be discriminating in its response to present policies. To summarise and conclude, what I am suggesting here is a convergence taking place; that there are some outstanding differences, but if you cut behind the smoke-screen of the political debate youdiscover quite a lot of common ground now emerging, as both political parties begin perhaps to move towards a new consensus. There are some key challenges, however, which emerge whatever the political future may hold. There is a need to strengthen management capacity still further in primary care,. If we are expecting even more to happen in a primary care-led NHS, not only commissioning but also servicedelivery and service provision, this will require a further investment in the management skills of all primary care staff, not just Gps. We will have to find the resources to make that happen. There is a serious problem of morale and motivation amongst GPs. We need to recognise this and find some ingenious ways of addressing this issue There is a challenge for the new health authorities. The history and tradition of district health authorities has, until very recently, been in relation to secondary care and specialist services. Thereis a risk that the Family Health Services Authority contribution will be swamped as the new appointments are made and as the new health authorities are established. We must avoid that and wemust ensure that there is a genuine primary care focus, not only in what health authorities say and in the plans they produce but in how they allocate resources. If we can meet these challenges then the idea of a primary care-led NHS will become a reality. If we cannot, then it is simply another of those nice phrases which we should dispose of in the dustbinof political rhetoric. Section 6 The Future of Primary Care PROFESSOR MARTIN ROLAND Director, National Primary Care Research and Development Centre, University of Manchester General practice is the dominant discipline within UK primary care. The majority of primary care is delivered by general practice-based teams. Indeed, the role of general practice as the core primarycare discipline has been strengthened by the 1991 reforms, which have increasingly given purchasing power to GPs. In this article I comment on the future of general practice as the core primary care discipline, discussing two threats which are currently facing the generalist - from fragmentation within general practice itself and from the growing body of specialists working from within thecommunity. I discuss the challenge to general practice to define and assure the quality of care offered, and how finally set out a vision for the future of primary care in the UK. Risk of Fragmentation The threat that primary care will become fragmented, making it more difficult to provide care of high quality relates to three current issues. How important is 24-hour responsibility to general practice? Those with a pessimistic view of the future regard a separate night-time contract as the start of an inexorable chipping away at general practice, which will leave it unrecognisable as a distinct discipline. I do not share these fears. The experience of one comparable health care system, Denmark, is that splitting the out-of-hours contract from the day-time contract has proved a success. Personal continuity of the 5 per cent of care which occurs out of hours is not necessary for a high-quality primary health care service. Defining a core of general practitioner services. The General Medical Services Committee of the BMA has this year produced a consultation document defining these. Although there may be a need to define the core of general practice, there is also a danger. We may lose sight of the fact that a large part of the case for the generalist is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. A definition of a core range of services may expose general practice to precisely the threats from which it is intended to protect it. There are pressures for purchasers to look at sections ofgeneral practice care and towards specific service contracts,i.e. contracting from general practice. These are clearly goingto be a feature of primary care in the future. We should not be fearful of these developments. They mark the end of an era where general practice is an amorphous blob of care in which quality can be neither assessed nor assured. Back in 1983, the RCGP policy statement on quality said that each general practitioner should be able to say what services his practice provides for his patients, and each general practitioner should "define specific objectives for the care of his patients and should monitor the extent to which these objectives are met." Such service standards are not easy to set or to meet, but a profession which can lead with this sort of approach to the provision of care should have nothing to fear from contracts which define objectivesto be delivered for particular patient groups. If we are thinking about defining a core of general practice and thinking about contracting for elements of general practitioner care, one additional argument which needs to come into the discussion is whether the independent contractor status has outlived its value. An increasing number of younger GPs appear to be interested in a salaried service.This is an issue which needs debate. Risk of Specialisation A second possible threat to generalist care, is the risk of specialisation. I want to talk both about the risks of specialisation within general practice and the growth in community-based specialist care. 1) Specialisation within general practice comes in two forms. a) The first is the employment of health professionals within the primary care team to carry out specific specialised tasks. The most obvious example here is the growth of the practice nurse.Much has been written about this, especially on the other side of the Atlantic. Estimates range from 4 per cent to 85 per cent as the proportion of the generalist's work which could be done by nurses. I do not wish to defend the methodology of these studies, but there is at least the basis for a debate. Indeed, in the UK many of the achievements within general practice in the past 10 years have been related to developments in practice nursing. The last two practices that I worked in practice nurses trained as specialists in asthma and diabetes. I did not find my role as a general practitioner threatened. Indeed, I think that the greater threat to primary care comes from those who believe generalism means that the GP must be all things to all people. b) The second form of specialisation within general practice, is the extent to which GPs themselves should become specialised within practices. This is an area where there has been very little public or professional debate. The fear within general practice is that once GPs start to become specialised this will mean the start of an inexorable slide, where the benefits of generalist care may be lost. The most obvious and perhaps least threatening areas for specialisation are those where particular technicalskills are required. So, for example, the capacity of a group practice to provide high-quality care may be enhanced if only one or two partners can use a slip lamp, insert an IUCD or carry out minor surgery. This is a crucial debate for the profession to have, and it will be particularly important to evaluate innovative models of practice. 2) I now want to discuss the possible threat from the growth in community-based specialist care. An RCGP discussion paper describes a core general practice team of doctors, nurses and managers, sometimes including district nurses and health visitors. But what is the role of the other health professionals who are increasingly based in the community? I believe the ever-increasing capacity for sub-specialist care to deliver effective interventions in community settings is one of the strongest reasons to protect the role of the generalist. Theodore Fox put it well over 30 years ago, saying: "The more complex medicine becomes, the stronger the reasons why everyone should have a personal doctor who will take continuous responsibility for him, protecting him from the zealous specialist." The plethora of community-based specialists requires the coordinating function of a small core primary health care team. That, within the UK context, is the general practice-based team. What is unclear, however, is which of the other professional groups should provide direct access to patients. Few would argue that patients should not have direct access to dentists and pharmacists. However, itis right, within the UK context, that access to community-based medical specialists continue to be by referral from GPs. Of course there are blurred edges. How should a specialist paediatric asthma clinic run by specialist asthma nurses interface with general practice? There are unresolved issues which need debate. I now want to go on to discuss two challenges relating to the need to define and assure the quality of care offered The Need to Define Quality There are a wide range of dimensions of quality. In relation to 20th century primary health care I would like to suggest six. Access. One of the major strengths of the UK health care system is the fact that almost the entire population is registered with a general practitioner. In the move towards market orientation in the health service, it is extremely important that we guard against erosion of this principle, ensuring for example that fund-holding arrangements do not impair access to care for difficult or expensivepatients. A second element to access is ensuring you actually get to see the doctor. Equity. On the whole, the NHS does not have a bad record of at least trying to distribute resources to where they are needed. One of the least attractive aspects of fund-holding has been thatit has led in some cases to a two-tier service. Sometimes this may result in an overall improvement in service, but we need to ensure that equity remains a fundamental principle in planning our health service. Clinical care and performance. If there are threats to primary care disciplines from encroaching specialists, then primary care professionals need to be able to demonstrate that they have betterdiagnostic skills, especially for undifferentiated, ill-structured problems, better management skills, especially for minor and moderately serious conditions and those with important psychosocial components, and provide better preventive care. Much time is spent thinking about the interface between primary and secondary care and the role of GPs in purchasing secondary care. It is very important that we do not neglect the core aspects of clinical care within general practice itself. Much is written about the role of the GP as gatekeeper, but we must not forget that the main job of the general practitioner is to look after his garden and not just to mind the gate. In looking at the quality of clinical care, we must not neglect important dimensions of quality because they are hard to measure. Haigh, Smith and Armstrong carried out work on large groups of patients, trying to identify the elements of quality which patients felt to be important. Top of the list was "a doctor who listens". This ties in with concepts developed within general practice over the past 30 years that it is the quality of the individual consultation which is a key element of quality of care. An increasing amount of work from groups at St Thomas's, from John Howie's group in Edinburgh, shows that time is an essential element to quality of care. Good clinical care cannot be delivered in five minutes per patient. We must not forget that the quality of the individual clinical encounter is at the heart of medicine, and that primary care must be structured to allow sufficient time for the consultation. General practice must not choose performance indicators which are easily measured but ignore those which are key to good medical practice. The range of services provided. There is a generally shared view that it would be desirable for a wide range of services to be provided cost-effectively from a base which is fairly close to the patient's home. Anticipatory care. This is a weak link in primary care at present. Stott and Davies identify continuing care as one of the potential parts of all primary care consultations. The service is very demand-led, however, and practices are often not all that good at planning long-term care of chronic disease. Diabetes is perhaps the example to show that it can be done. Tudor-Hart wrote in 1983 that "Organised personal responsibility is the key to improved outcome". Long-term management of chronic disease is often poorly coordinated, with communication between specialists and GPs that has changed little in the last 40 years, despite huge changes in the way in which care is provided. New ways of organising care for chronic illness are needed for the changing needs of our patient population. Continuity of care. One of the questions about primary care in the future is whether the loss of continuity which results from working in larger teams is outweighed by the benefits that result. I do not think that continuity of care is always essential. However, there are occasions when personal care from one's own doctor becomes extremely important. We need to be able to describe those situations where continuity of care makes a real difference to outcome. Some of the developments I have described make personal continuity of care look seriously endangered. My belief is that personal continuity is a feature of NHS care that is worth vigorously defending. The Need to Assure Quality I move on from definitions of quality to assuring quality. As the emphasis on purchasing effective care in the NHS increases and as we start to experience health commissions purchasing care from the primary sector, quality assurance will become increasingly important. Audit is on the way out, being replaced by purchasing for quality - or some other suitable slogan. The message to the profession is clear: if they do not lead on this issue then they will be led, whether they like it or not. In the area where I work a novel collaboration between the local medical committee and the health authority has developed a range of quality standards to which the majority of Manchester practices working towards. There is a real opportunity over the next few years for professionals to work with Government and health authorities to define the important elements of quality and to determine how they can be delivered and assured. A Vision for the Future I conclude with seven points which are my vision for a future which preserves the strengths of British primary care. A model of primary care based around the general practice team has served Britain well. It is a model which other countries are now seeking to emulate. This basic feature of the NHS does not need fixing. It is difficult to operate a well-functioning team where there are more than 12 or so doctors and nurses. If care continues, as I believe it should, to be centred around a core general practice team, the team needs to find new ways of interacting and communicating with the increasing number of other professionals who, quite appropriately, are providing care from a community base. The relationship between the health professional and his or her patient is key to providing high-quality patient care. Personal continuity is not always important but it is sometimes very important.I am not suggesting that general practice should return to the days of Dr Finlay and Tannochbrae, but if we allow general practice to become like a department store then our patients will be the losers. We must remember this when developing quality indicators for general practice and, in particular, protect the time needed for the encounter between the doctor or nurse and his or her patient. There are opportunities which are at present poorly realised for individual doctors or nurses within practices to develop specific skills. Specialisation within practices offers the opportunity to increase the range of services available. The amount of referral that occurs within practices could be increased. Fear that these developments will lead to a mini-specialoid service are probably overplayed. The profession must seize the opportunity to define quality standards. There is a window of opportunity in the next few years that must be grasped. Where expert advice is needed we need much better ways of communication. The growth in IT offers great opportunity for desktop decision support for GPs, which may enable them with confidenceto undertake the increasing amounts of care being asked of them. Telemedicine may offer opportunities for rapid access to brief specialist advice, which is notably lacking in the NHS at themoment. Finally, however models of purchasing develop in the NHS, I am sure that GPs need an important voice in the services provided for their patients. I am less convinced that GPs, whose main interest is personal care, are the best people to plan the health care of populations. I do not agree with those who believe that the future of public health medicine is somehow to become hybridised with general practice. Both disciplines have distinct contributions to make. The Government has correctly recognised the potential of a primary care-led NHS and the potential for general practice to take a leading role in that change. Yet as we have heard, perversely, at a time when general practice should be riding high, morale is lower than for many years. This is for many reasons, some of which we have heard, one of which is that a transfer of work to the primary sector has taken place without a comparable transfer of resources. Morale and resourcing need to be tackled. Adequately resourced, properly motivated, British primary care has the potential to become the envy of the world. Section 7 HEALTH ECONOMICS DATABASE LAUNCHED BY OHE AND IFPMA A specialised data service using CD-ROM to help identify economic evaluations in health care was launched by the Office of Health Economics (OHE) and the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA) in April 1995. The service, known as HEED (a Health Economic Evaluations Database), is a database that contains information on health economics articles, in particular studies of cost-effectiveness (and other forms of economic evaluation), with objective analysis of key articles. HEED now has more than 5,600 bibliographic references and 2,400 reviewed articles, building up through monthly updates to contain a comprehensive bibliography of all published economic literature. Content A monthly search of clinical and economic on-line databases is undertaken, combined with hand searching of the leading journals containing evaluation literature. Working papers from academicinstitutions and references from reviewed and other papers are also included. Reviews are undertaken of the selected key literature by researchers in academic institutions according to a structured format. In addition to providing an overview of the paper, they also provide additional information, such as ICD-9 and ATC Codes, type of economic evaluation, and type of data source for events and resources used. These categories can be searched on using the CD-ROM software. Searching the Database HEED is very easy to use, even for beginners. There are no complex commands to learn and nearly all operations are simply 'point and click'. HEED has been designed for easy reference and frequent use. With 54 fields to choose from, the database can be searched by selecting only those search criteria of relevance. The search criteria are grouped into a number of subject groupings. Each subject grouping contains specific search criteria, which can be specified in any combination (in addition to wild card and Boolean functions) to search the database. The search criteria can be modified and refined to quickly access search results in manageable quantities. The subject groupings include: Bibliographical details Study definitions Analysis and results Keywords. It is also possible to search HEED using keywords or any combination of the search criteria that includes: Author name Book/Journal name Countries applicable Publication dates Publication status Study dates ATC classifications Data Sources Drug names ICD-9 classifications Non-drug technologies Technology assessed Type of article Type of economic evaluation Costs included Discounting Outcomes Patient groups Sensitivity analysis Sources of clinical and economic information Sponsor Search criteria can be saved for use at a later date. Formatted Reports The HEED CD-ROM reports will present the results of searches in a clear easy-to-read format. There are four default report formats: Search Report Summary Report Brief Report Detailed Report. The reports will present the results of searches at increasing levels of detail. The Detailed Report will additionally provide details of the study question, key results and, providing copyright permission has been given by the article publisher, the article abstract in full. Hypertext links are available so that the ICD-9 and ATC sub-reports can be accessed. Academic Panel A panel of academic advisors is providing guidance on the search and review processes. The panel comprises Martin Buxton, Mike Drummond, Bernie O'Brien, Kevin Schulman, Bengt Jonsson, FransRutten, Joan Rovira and Akinori Hisashige. Organisation HEED has been set up with finance from more than 20 companies in the USA, Europe and Japan, who comprise the Steering Group for the project. New industry subscribers will be included ina user group designed to ensure the service develops in accordance with industry needs.

NHS purchasers are under pressure to consult the public about NHS priorities, and hospitals want to know what matters to patients. This report proposes the use of a technique known as conjoint analysis which is commonly used in the private sector and in otherparts of the public sector. It can be used to ask the real questions facing hard-pressed doctors and managers, and provide a genuinepublic input into NHS decision-making. Conjoint analysis provides this information by asking individuals to make choices betweendifferent aspects of service and types of service. By structuring the questions carefully, the strength of preferences can be established across a wide range of different services. Crucially, people have to indicate what they will give up to have more of something else. The report criticises public opinion surveys and patient satisfaction surveys as too general to enable NHS purchasers to incorporateinto their everyday decision-making. The views of the author are supported in an earlier study for the Treasury by a team ofacademics from the University of Brunel, who argued for this technique to be widely used in the public sector.

Using five examples of (suitably anonymised) encounterswith patients, in some of which he has personally faced ethicaldilemmas, he concludes by setting out six strategies that theNHS can follow to minimise conflict. These are: eliminating useless or harmful clinical manoeuvres,by expanding patient-centred research and applying the results; expanding effective, cost-saving clinical manoeuvres,notably preventing illnesses that are expensive to treat; use equally effective but less expensive alternative clinicalmanoeuvres, for example by prescribing cheaper but equallyeffective "generic" drugs; determine and apply the cost-utility properties of clinicalmanoeuvres. Reliable evidence of cost-effectiveness is essentialfor setting group priorities for treatment; inform the public. People should be informed that NHScare can be evidence-based. A well informed public may want morehealth spending on an NHS delivering effective care; be explicit about the presence and nature of conflicts.By recognising that genuine ethical dilemmas will arise, cliniciansand managers can tackle them openly (respecting patient confidentiality)in a problem solving mode.

This estimate does not include thecosts incurred by the patients and their families. Indeed, if all the patients at high risk of developing a post-surgical DVT(ie. those aged over 45 years and undergoing an operation associated with a high incidence of thrombosis) had received adequate prophylaxis the NHS would have made a cost saving of between £35 and £85 million and the number of deaths due to post surgical pulmonary embolism would probably have been reduced by more than 400, according to this analysis.Yet, despite the fact that the major risk factors for DVT of age, immobility and certain forms of surgery are well knownamong the medical profession and have been recognised for many years, less than half (46 per cent) of high risk surgical patientsappear to be receiving any form of prophylaxis. For some patients, particularly those undergoing brain surgery, it is possible thatthe risks of using thrombolytic prophylaxis, such as excessive bleeding, outweigh the benefits of preventing deep vein thrombosis.However, there are other non-pharmaceutical methods of prophylaxis such as elasticated stockings and according to the sample quotedin the National Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths (CEPOD, 1995), only 17 per cent of neurosurgery patients weregiven these.The use of thrombolytic prophylaxis for the prevention of DVT provides a classic example of clinical and cost-effectivenessevidence about a therapy not being put into practice. At a time when evidence-based medicine is receiving considerable emphasisin the NHS, it would appear from this research, that much could be achieved in terms of cost savings and health gain if prophylacticmeasures were implemented for surgical patients at high risk of developing a DVT.

Its purpose was not only to try to explain this fascinating paradox between political influence and job satisfaction, but to look to the future. We are about to witness a watershed in the history of primary health care in the UK and perhaps elsewhere. The pressures on a socialist health care system from consumer expectation and public spending constraint are not reversible.There is no way back to the country practice of Dr Finlay. General practice has been elevated to centre stage to deal with thesepressures, and if it is to survive, it must move forward and seize its opportunity. The contributors to the conference were from overseas as well as from the UK. They were asked to give their view on the wayforward for general practice from an international perspective. They dealt with an impressive range of issues from comparisonof the effect of primary care on the performance of national health care systems to the importance of continuity of care to the individualpatient. They presented an impressive array of information on the organisation and funding of primary care systems in Europeand North America. In the book Professor Starfield discusses the characteristics of a strong primary care system, which, she argues, are accessibility,continuity of care, comprehensiveness, and coordination. Dr Makela, Professor van der Zee and Professor Light look at the systemswhich have arisen in Finland, the Netherlands and the United States, respectively. Other important issues addressed are the futureof fundholding by Professor Ham and the causes of and solutions to low GP morale, by Professor Mant and Mr Towse. In the finalchapter, Professor Roland sets out his vision as to how the dangers of fragmentation and the challenges to define and assure qualityof care can be met.

The foundation isparticularly concerned that consumers and low-incomeconstituents be represented in this process. Power generation by electric utilities in the UnitedStates takes a severe toll on the environment. U.S.power plants discharge two-thirds of the country'ssulfur dioxide emissions, one-third of its carbondioxide emissions, one-third of its nitrogen oxideemissions, and half of its nuclear waste. To compoundthese problems, rising use of electricity, up 3 percentin 1994, is creating demand for new fossil-fuel plants. Energy-efficient alternatives in this sector areparticularly compelling. The Electric Power ResearchInstitute estimates that 23 percent of all U.S.electricity consumption could be saved for less than 3cents per kilowatt-hour-less than the cost of generatingthat electricity. Over time, between a third and a halfof U.S. electricity consumption could be saved throughenergy efficiency. Electric utilities, given properincentives, could finance these improvements forindustrial, commercial, and residential consumers. In New England, New York, California, Wisconsin, and thePacific Northwest, pioneering reforms in utilityregulation have made it profitable for utility companiesto meet electricity demand through energy efficiencyrather than through power plant construction. Bothconsumers and utilities benefit from these investments,establishing a 'win-win' collaboration among utilities,businesses, consumers, and environmentalists.

The foundation is particularly interested in efforts to improve building codes and ensure compliance, in the development of financing mechanisms and incentives, and in efforts to ensure that architects make energy integral to building design. Large savings in energy can be realized through improvements in the insulation, heating, cooling, and lighting of residential and commercial buildings. More than one-third of U.S. energy is used to heat, cool, and light our living and working spaces. If these buildings were built and operated with off-the-shelf, cost-effective, high-efficiency technologies, energy consumption could be cut by 50 to 80 percent. Studies at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory suggest that it costs little more to build an efficient office building than an inefficient one. These potential benefits are rarely realized. Most people and corporations fail to consider the benefits of energy-efficiency improvements over the life of the technology and thus are discouraged by their higher initial costs. The best window now on the market, for example, insulates four times as well as its double-paned predecessor. Because it costs 30 percent more, its benefits are routinely ignored. Landlords and developers make structural energy decisions, but they are not directly affected by the higher energy bills paid by renters and buyers. Architects and builders have difficulty keeping up-to-date with new efficiency technologies.

The foundation will explore policy options that promote alternatives to increased single-occupancy vehicle use and to new highway construction. The foundation will also support analysis and advocacy to promote increased vehicle fuel efficiency. Transportation accounts for a third of all energy use in the United States and is responsible for nearly 30 percent of total U.S. carbon emissions. Cars and trucks alone consume 63 percent of all petroleum in the country. To make matters worse, the number of vehicle miles traveled in the U.S. is climbing at twice the rate of population growth. Yet the transportation sector has tremendous potential for efficiency gains. The average fuel efficiency of new cars sold in the U.S. doubled between 1973 and 1987, largely due to federal standards. New automobile models have been developed that are more than three times as fuel-efficient as today's average. Advanced vehicle propulsion technologies are progressing, spurred especially by innovative policy in California. New transportation planning approaches also show promise. Public transit, improved bicycle facilities, high-occupancy vehicle lanes, pedestrian-oriented design, and an expanding array of transportation-control measures provide mobility while reducing environmental damage. The 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) gives states unprecedented flexibility in how they allocate more than $150 billion in federal transportation dollars. Coupled with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which require state transportation plans to show compliance with federal air quality standards, ISTEA now allows metropolitan regions to harness substantial funding for alternatives to new highway construction.

The foundation is especially interested in regional initiatives to encourage utility investments in renewable energy through scenario-building, regulatory work, and advocacy. The foundation may also support research and education to build the analytic base for new federal and state policies. Renewable energy technologies-wind, solar-thermal, photovoltaics, and biomass-made major advances in the past decade. With forward-looking policies they could play a strong role in meeting future U.S. energy needs. Renewable energy costs have dropped several-fold while reliability and performance have improved dramatically. The cost of wind-generated electricity in the U.S. dropped from 25 cents per kilowatt-hour in 1980 to 5 cents per kilowatt-hour in 1994, which is cheaper than coal and competitive with natural gas. The cost curves for utility-scale solar-thermal and photovoltaic plants show similar downward trends. Increased production would further reduce costs. A few states have taken the lead in removing regulatory and financial barriers to renewable energy development. In 1994, Minnesota called on utilities to build over 800 megawatts - equivalent to a coal plant - of renewable energy projects, to ensure, in part, that a stronger renewable energy industry will develop. Utilities in Texas, California, Oregon, Massachusetts, and New York have committed to renewable energy projects. In each case, policy-makers realized that renewable energy is a viable source of power whose future availability depends on today's support.

The foundation will support development and implementation of federal, state, and regional policies that remove barriers to energy efficiency and renewable energy. The foundation will also work to see that changes in energy policy do not hurt those who are traditionally underrepresented in policy-making. While energy efficiency and renewable energy are typically addressed within particular sectors of energy use-e.g., transportation, buildings, utilities-many aspects of the energy problem demand a broader perspective. Understanding and correcting the market failures that prevent society from capturing the benefits of energy efficiency requires insight into economics and finance: How can we build economic systems that recognize the depletable nature of natural resources and the environment? What are the financial barriers embedded in federal and state tax codes that slow energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy? Social and institutional questions, too, loom large: What kind of impacts do energy policies have on low-income and minority communities? How can we ensure that energy policy is not regressive or undemocratic? Thinking about the long-term energy future of the nation also demands an integrated perspective. How far can energy efficiency and renewable energy take this country? What are the employment impacts of different energy policies?

That oldGM slogan is not so much a sales pitch as a truereflection of our national culture. The American loveaffair with the automobile is so pervasive and thecar is such an integral part of our economy, it has cometo shape our productivity, our social lives, ourlandscape, and even our self-esteem. Americans have more than one car per licensed driver. Wedrive those cars more than ever-2.23 trillion miles peryear-and the number of miles the average car travels peryear is growing twice as fast as the population. And no wonder. The car offers greater mobility than anyother sort of transport, in a culture where mobility isincreasingly mandatory. It also offers a large measureof comfort, safety, power, and style. We can go where wewant, when we want, without exposing ourselves to theharsh elements of nature or the criminal elements ofsociety. These are crucial amenities. But the love affair with the car, like all obsessions,has its costs. Any knuckle-biting commuter, stuck in herthousandth traffic jam, can testify about the automobilepopulation crisis. All those hours spent in traffic costus economically and emotionally: They assess amultibillion-dollar toll on our productivity, and theysteal time we might otherwise spend enjoying otheraspects of life, like family and friends. Our cities, especially younger cities, are given over tothe car (two-thirds of Los Angeles is paved!). Dads andmoms who must spend hours chauffeuring their kids to andfrom school, sports, and friends' houses can readilyunderstand how the very mobility of the car hasrestricted access and choice for those who cannot drive.Of course it is children, the elderly, and the poor whoknow this trapped feeling most poignantly. And the environment--from the smoggy air in L.A. to theoil-fouled shores of Prince William Sound, from thetoxic earth around Louisiana's refineries to the noisethat is so much a part of New York City'sambience--continues to bear the brunt of the auto.Perhaps the ultimate sacrifice is our kids' lungs, whichnow operate at a 15 percent diminished capacity in LosAngeles and which are increasingly susceptible todisease. Even our national security is at stake. The last twodecades have brought us two oil crises and one oil war,but the nation's appetite for oil still grows. Close tohalf the oil this nation consumes is imported fromabroad, the largest proportion ever. These problems are getting worse. This graph suggeststhat the next oil crisis is only a matter of time and,as we all know, decisions made in crisis are usually notthe wisest. What can be done? Is there no way to keep the benefitsof the car without jeopardizing our cities, our health,our national security, and our peace of mind? Do we haveto choose between a healthy downtown and a prosperousDetroit, between decent neighborhoods for our kids andmobility for ourselves, between breathing clean air andgetting to work? This essay argues that the transportation crisis issolvable, that it is possible to build livable citiesand functioning transportation systems that do notsacrifice individual mobility.The ideas that follow are collected from innovativethinkers around the world. Many of these ideasconstitute a fundamental departure from past policiesand mechanisms of governance, but without such changes,we will simply drive ourselves from one crisis to thenext. The Energy Foundation'stransportation program is designed to test andpromote these solutions. Our grants have two broad aims:To refocus spending on our transportation infrastructureso that more economically efficient and environmentallybenign choices are made, and to spur innovation of andmarkets for cleaner vehicle technologies. We are underno illusion that either task will be easy, but webelieve that, together, such policies will create moretransportation choices, fewer environmental problems,and more livable towns and cities. The graphic that guides readers through this essayillustrates the range of solutions proposed for theseproblems. Each policy has some potential, buteach has profound limitations. Consider, for example,the position of people who focus their energies onraising fuel economy. Raising automobile fuel mileagehas already doubled the efficiency of new cars(see figure 2). Why not doubleit again, and skip the hard work of trying to stemvehicle miles traveled? Figure 2: U.S. Auto Fleet and CAFE standards People who labor in the transportationfield tend to become fixated on one or another favoredpolicy. Automakers argue that market signals shouldsteer their decisions. Safety and environmentaladvocates counter that regulations have successfully ledto safer and cleaner cars. Transit authorities despairof the $300 billion in costs that private autos imposeon society while railroads, subways, and buses languishfor lack of funding. And those who care about the formof traditional towns--the village square, theneighborhood shop, and streets safe for children--railagainst sprawl and Wal-Marts and strip malls. Why not? Because the extraordinary rise in thedistances we drive and the number of trips we take hasabsorbed all the gains we have made in fuel efficiencyduring the last 15 years (seefigures 3 and 4). Only if the growth in milestraveled can be stemmed will raising fuel efficiencystandards and moving to ultra-clean, ultra-efficientcars render major improvements. Figure 3 The answer lies in these graphs. The extraordinary rise in the distances wedrive and the number of trips we take hasabsorbed all the gains we have made in fuel efficiencyduring the last 15 years. Figure 4 Only if the growth in milestraveled can be stemmed will raisingfuel-efficiency standards and moving to ultra-clean,ultra-efficient cars render major improvements. The real potential for change, then, lies in integratingsolutions. This essay looks, in turn, at improvements tothe auto, changes in fuels, changing land-use patterns,and new approaches to building and running thetransportation infrastructure.

During the 1973 oil crisis, policy-makers took a hardlook at the nation's energy appetite and found thattransportation consumed more than half the nation's oil.New cars averaged only 13 miles per gallon. Despiteprotests from automakers, Congress passed the CorporateAverage Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which requiredautomakers to improve that figure to 27.5 miles pergallon by 1988. This policy--which doubled new car-fueleconomy--ultimately resulted in less industrydislocation than Detroit assumed; indeed, it is creditedin many quarters with spurring the technologicalrevitalization of the U.S. auto industry. The CAFE lawalso marks the only success so far in addressing energyuse in U.S. automobiles. What is the potential for extending CAFE standardsagain, to 55 mpg by 2005? Many independent engineerspoint to cars on the road that get 50 mpg, and indeedmost automakers have built prototype cars that get morethan 100 mpg, without sacrificing performance. Doublingthe fuel economy of the nation's fleet would halve itsconsumption of oil, all but eliminating the need for oilimports. Automakers have vigorously, and so far successfully,resisted such legislation. They argue that customerswant larger cars with more powerful engines, and,barring a boost in gasoline prices, fuel efficiency isjust not what customers are looking for. Becauselegislators are sensitive to the economic importance ofthe auto industry and wary of interventions in themarket, it is probably fair to say that in the absenceof another oil crisis, auto fuel-efficiency standardswill stagnate. CAFE worked once, but there is littlechance it will be tried again in the near future. One team of analysts, Amory and Hunter Lovins of RockyMountain Institute, argues that a complete reinventionof the automobile is in order, and that only such athorough redesign can push us beyond the CAFE debate (see "Moving toward the'hypercar'"). Their concepts should lead to carsthat get more than 100 mpg, with drastically reducedpollution, noise, and required maintenance. If such"hypercars" were developed, their non-fuelattributes--safety, reliability, nimbleness, and lowercost--could induce customer demand. The fuel savingswould be a free byproduct.

Enough with the car. What about the cities and suburbswhere the car is driven? No amount of new autotechnology or cleaner fuels will relieve congestion,make towns more accessible to those without cars,encourage people to interact with their neighbors,rebuild communities, or preserve open space andagricultural land. The pattern of U.S. metropolitangrowth needs to be examined--and the further oneprojects ahead, the more important that pattern becomes. American communities are in the middle of a revolution.In the first part of this century, the nation moved frombeing an agricultural society, in which most peoplelived on farms, to one in which the population was splitbetween farms and cities. In the second half of thecentury, there was a vast migration from both the urbanareas and rural areas to the suburbs. The United Statesis now primarily a suburban economy, with more than halfthe population living in suburbs. The automobile made suburbs possible, and the autocontinues to dominate the suburban form. The averageAmerican household makes more than 10 car trips per day.It is the norm for American families to do theirshopping, go to school or work, enjoy sports, andcommune with friends and families in a 40-mile radius oftheir home. (Note that a 40-mile circle contains 1,200square miles!) This easy access to remote destinationsmeans that it is commensurably less important to havefriends or shops or schools or work nearby. The auto hasmade it possible to pay little attention to the qualityof local resources, since substitutes can be found a 15-or 30-minute drive away. Access has been decoupled fromlocation. That decoupling has both good and bad consequences. Thebenefits of a broader base of options include access tobetter jobs, better or cheaper homes, more schools, moresports facilities, and more shopping. The downside isthat local resources are neglected. Why pay taxes tosupport a local park when you can drive to a state park?Why strive to protect downtown jobs when you don't workdowntown or shop downtown? The car also makes the idea of the "common good" moreabstract and remote. A village square or a local schoolis the only option in a car-less world; everyone has aninterest in keeping that square clean and that schoolhealthy. The auto makes the square just one of dozens ofoptions for public space, and because that square issupported by local taxes, it often seems to be the mostexpensive of the lot. The country is thus in the midstof abandoning the "public sphere"--parks, publicschools, and even public services like policeprotection--in favor of the "private sphere," withgated suburbs, private recreation clubs, privateschools, and private security forces. Some of the most creative thinkers--conservative andliberal--argue that it is time to reinvent the suburband rethink the urban core. Town planners, architects,and economists are converging around a practical andpositive vision of the metropolis. Three themes dominatetheir work: The destinies of suburbs and urban cores cannotbe separated; policies must be developed that serve thegreater metropolis. The most successful cities are those where localvalues and local commitment are manifest. Good policiesmake it easier for citizens to contribute to theircommunities. Land-use patterns-the physical form of aneighborhood-have a profound (and underappreciated)impact on social interactions, neighborliness, and senseof community. These ideas can easily be made tangible and practical.For example, 20 years ago, Oregon required every city todevelop an "urban growth boundary" to contain and focusfuture development. As a result, cities such as Portlandhave managed to avoid much of the sprawl and relatedurban blight that characterize so many cities. Thesimple act of drawing a boundary around the metropolishas united the downtown and suburban concerns, and ithas preserved farmland, reduced demands for auto travel,and made transit systems viable. Downtown businessesknow that the boundary keeps them within a reasonablerange of the region's shoppers and workers. Mostdevelopers happily trade geographic limitations for thecertainty of knowing where they can build and where theycannot. Suburbanites appreciate the relative lack ofcongestion, since they are not immediately surrounded bysuburbs even farther out. Growth is directed to landinside the boundary: this "infill" development meansthat light rail is fast becoming a viable option forPortland commuters. Not every city has the political impetus to draw aboundary around itself, but other measures can have asimilar impact. Lowering regulatory barriers fordevelopment within metropolitan boundaries, whileraising them for development beyond, can funnel mostdevelopment to where it should occur. If cities andsuburbs were to collaborate on tax policies-or evenestablish tax-base sharing, as Minneapolis-St. Paul hasdone-they could avoid the ultimately debilitating gameof bidding for development with lower taxes. Byrethinking and coordinating development and taxpolicies, a city and its suburbs can both emerge aswinners, rather than one prospering only at the other'sexpense. An urban-growth boundary implies infill development andmixed use, which can themselves be a boon. Space andquiet are the great virtues of suburbia, but these oftencome at the cost of easy access to stores, restaurants,and schools. By mixing these uses with housing, suburbsbecome communities. If streets are laid out well anddestinations are nearby, kids can walk or bike to thestore or school. Families can walk to a park instead ofdriving. A number of regions have started this repairwork, including the city of Pasadena and San DiegoCounty. Good infill and mixed-use development get at the heartof the transportation dilemma. Two California suburbsillustrate how such changes lead to dramaticallydifferent automobile use. Rockridge is a traditionalsuburb near Berkeley, with a grid-street layout and amix of shops, schools, parks, and houses. Danville, inContra Costa County, is composed of arterials, feeders,and culs-de-sac, and has only housing. Danvillehouseholds put twice as many miles on their cars astheir Rockridge counterparts. The policy question, then,is: Do we build more Danvilles on more farmland, or dowe fill in, and in the process make current suburbs morelivable? Infill has another great bonus. Transit systems likelight rail require a certain minimum housing density tobe useful-they become cost-effective only when there areenough potential riders along each stretch of the route.Transit will become feasible in many of today's suburbswith judicious infill. Finally, the topography of our cities and suburbsmatters a great deal. Old housing projects-modernistglass and concrete towers surrounded by parking lots-aredehumanizing; it is no surprise that so many are reducedto shambles in a few years. Strip malls and shoppingcenters can have a similar dehumanizing effect. There isno way to walk to most malls--they tend to be removedfrom neighborhoods and surrounded by wide, busy streetsand highways--or to browse on a strip mall. The autobecomes the only way to get to and from these centers. By taking great care with the relationships amonghouses, streets, parks, schools, and commercial centers,town planners and developers can reverse or reduce suchcar dependency. Good walkable or bikeable connectionsbetween houses and schools are cheap and obvious ways tobreathe life into a town even as they reduce auto use.Some towns are turning to "pedestrian-orienteddevelopment" and "transit-oriented development" toreintroduce people into a town's fabric. To make a townpedestrian friendly, planners use "traffic calming,"which is the generic term for narrowing streets,building speed bumps, giving predominance to pedestrians inintersections, and similar measures. Parking lots aretucked behind shops, instead of vice versa.Transit-friendly developments incorporate the sameconcepts, but they are clustered developments--withgreater density-located near transit stops. In Chicago'sWest Side, for example, the Center for NeighborhoodTechnology is helping redevelop an urban area as atransit-oriented development (see "Reclaiming aneighborhood"). Besides creating a more enjoyable town or community,making streets and destinations accessible topedestrians tends to raise the value of real estate in acommunity. It turns out that people like to live intowns with walkable destinations and schools a quickbike ride away. This added value, if coupled with thereduced regulatory burdens described above, could be thespur that moves development past cookie-cutter sprawl.

Whether we hope to reduce oil consumption or tailpipeemissions, it is natural to look at the fuel supply forrelief. There is a host of possible alternatives toconventional gasoline, ranging from the close cousins(reformulated gasoline or compressed natural gas) tothose more exotic in source but not in use (such asethanol derived from specially grown crops, calledbiomass), to those requiring a redesign of theautomobile (electric cars or hydrogen fuel cells). Here, the classic policy dilemma of radical versusincremental reforms becomes apparent: Easy, but smallimprovements can be had from moderate shifts to cleanerfossil fuels. Larger contributions will be possible ifthe nation can stomach the more difficult switch towell-designed biomass programs. And truly revolutionarychanges are possible only if automakers begin with aclean sheet of paper. The last two options on the better-fuels section of ourmap--electric cars and fuel-cell cars--have captured theattention of air quality officials in California and theNortheast, where air pollution is so bad that almosteveryone agrees that big changes are necessary.California has required car manufacturers to sell anincreasing fraction of zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs,beginning with 2 percent of new cars in the state in1998 (an estimated 31,000 vehicles) and growing to 10percent by 2003. Although, in a decade or so, vehicles that run on fuelcells should also become available, in the short run,only electric cars are likely both to be economicallyviable and to meet the zero-emission standard. Theprimary limitation of electric cars is the battery,which holds much less energy than gasoline does. Thistranslates into reduced driving range and reducedperformance. Against that limitation, electric carsoffer reduced maintenance, lower driving costs, higherenergy efficiency, quieter operation, and, mostimportant, drastically less pollution. And, as batteriesbecome more effective energy carriers, the problems withrange will lessen. The California regulation promoting electric vehicleshas greatly invigorated research and development onelectric car technologies in small companies, universitylabs, and auto manufacturers. There has been a greateradvance in control systems, drive components, andbatteries in the last three years than in the previoustwo decades. But the regulation has also inspired opposition fromautomakers, who worry they will be compelled to buildexpensive, poorly performing cars for which there is nomarket. Electric car advocates note that auto companiesused the same arguments against regulations for seatbelts, collapsible steering columns, air bags, andfuel-efficiency standards, all of which have beenremarkably successful. Auto companies rebut thatelectric vehicles are a more fundamental change thanprevious requirements. The California regulations are clearly steering theeconomy into uncharted territory: It is too early topredict how zero-emission vehicles will perform or togauge their potential market. It is clearly not tooearly, though, to look for ways to boost the market forelectric cars and ensure that society reaps the benefitsof this newly invigorated technology. California hasstarted that work by offering a variety of taxincentives for alternative-fuel vehicles. Policy-makersshould also consider other ways to make electric carsespecially attractive. Cities and states could, forexample, allow operators of electric vehicles to: Park for free Use high-occupancy vehicle lanes Pay reduced tolls Receive a tax credit Obtain reduced-rate electricity for night-time charging. Every one of these policies--especially the ZEVmandate--arouses controversy, since they all constitutesome regulatory interference in the market. But the autoitself has impacts beyond the market: Remember the oilcrises, the environmental destruction, and the hoursspent in congestion. And of course the infrastructure onwhich the auto depends--highways, streets, and eventax-subsidized mortgages--is built and maintained "beyond the market."

Anyone who is a serious transit rider knows the virtuesof a car. Cars are ready when you are; they go where youare going. Buses, subways, and light rail instead forceyou to operate on their schedule and route. It is nowonder that many transit systems are in a death spiral:declining use results in reduced revenue, which leads toworse service and further declining use. The decline in transit mirrors the huge publicinvestments in highways and auto facilities. Since the1950s, federal policies--ranging from the InterstateHighway Act to mortgage tax deductions--have inducedsprawl at the expense of the city. The imbalance betweenthe car and its alternatives needs to be righted. As this essay describes, the very popularity of the caris limiting its usefulness, both for those stuck inendless congestion and for those who cannot drive butmust live and work in an automobile topography. One short-term and two long-term strategies will maketransit attractive. First, system managers and localpolitical leaders need to inject funds into publictransit to make it safer, cleaner, and more reliable.The New York City subway system has recently undergonesuch a transition: Trains are, on the whole, now free ofgraffiti. They are safer, cleaner, and more dependable.Certainly the New York subway system still needsimprovement, but the trend is in the right direction.New York's commuter trains have shown even moreimprovement. In other cities, such as Philadelphia andChicago, supreme effort should be made to prevent thedismantling of existing systems, which would beextremely expensive to replace. The longer-run solutions tie into the previous sectionof this essay and the one following. The form of themetropolis ultimately limits the usefulness of thetransit system. It is difficult or impossible to buildtransit systems that economically serve low-densitydevelopments; rebuilding cities through infilldevelopment makes transit systems viable. Perhaps moreimportantly, good transit systems can induce"transit-oriented development," which inverts thepublic-transit death spiral. Finally, we have to consider the economic signals thatcar drivers and transit users face. Purchasing a car andpaying for its insurance are the two largest costs ofdriving. Those costs are fixed whether the car is used alittle or a lot. The costs that vary with auto use--suchas oil, tires, and tolls--amount to only 20 percent ofautomobile operating costs. Once someone buys a car, itcosts them very little to drive it. Transit is the opposite. Tickets for the bus, subway, ortrain are usually purchased for every ride. Even if thetotal cost of using transit is less than that of owningand driving a car, the marginal costs are often muchhigher. To give more accurate price signals, good public policywould shift auto expenses from the fixed to the variablecolumn. For example, insurance could be paid on aper-mile basis, with the information taken from annualodometer readings. The varying price would moreaccurately reflect the varying risk--which, after all,grows with every mile driven. Similar ideas have beenproposed for congestion. Users now pay nothing to usemost roads, so there is no incentive to use themjudiciously. If some general taxes were reduced inexchange for "congestion pricing"--charging driversdirectly for using roads--there would be far fewertraffic jams, less pollution, and less waste. Perhaps the most important inaccurate price signal isthat for gasoline which, at one-fourth European levels,fails to account for the pollution it leaves whenburned, or the wars it sparks in the Mideast. These"external" costs--estimated by some at more than $300billion per year--are now borne by children with lungdisease and farmers with stunted crops, not by those whobenefit from the cheap gas. If pollution were taxeddirectly, it would be possible to reduce other taxeswhile cleaning the air. All the policies described in this essay would morenaturally fall into place if prices accurately reflectedtrue costs (see "The truecosts of driving."). Cleaner cars and cleaner fuelswould become cheaper. Driving to distant suburbs wouldbe more expensive, and the value of pedestrian-friendlycommunities would rise. Transit would become a moreeconomical choice. But there are great forcesmaintaining the current price system. Americans areused to cheap gas and distrustful of taxing politicians.And it would be profoundly unfair to change pricesignals if those changes left the poor worse off. Many sound arguments exist for using better pricesignals to resolve the transportation dilemma. GeneralMotors and Chrysler have advocated higher gas taxes as awiser solution than fuel-efficiency standards. TheNational Academy of Sciences believes that congestionpricing--charging for the use of highways during peaktraffic hours--would save billions of dollars.Environmentalists have long argued that polluters shouldpay for the damage they cause. But commuters do not understand the reasons for chargingfor a road their tax dollars already built. And forlower-income citizens, any policy that raises the costof living is a direct threat to their livelihood. Better price signals are conceptually elegant, but theyhave so far failed virtually every political test.Unless policies can be designed so that they producebenefits-such as income tax relief-directly to thosepaying the new fees, they have little chance of beingenacted. The challenge, then, is to create pricingpolicies that are an integral part of tax reform. Suchpolicies must not impose new burdens on the poor ormiddle class: indeed, when they are truly economicallyefficient, they should generate net benefits that canthen be distributed to different income classes.

In manycities, the very convenience of the car has begun toturn on itself, as congestion keeps those 100mile-per-hour cars crawling along at 10 or 15 miles perhour. In Los Angeles, average highway speed is only 28miles per hour, and it is projected to slow to 18 mphearly in the next century. The real, grisly glimpse of acar-saturated future lies in today's Bangkok, where car toilets arebecoming popular, since commutes can take many hours. It is possible to reverse the trends that are locking usin cars and isolating us in our own communities. It willtake major policy changes and a willingness to abandonparochial concerns; instead we need to embrace anapproach that integrates a broad range of solutions.Perhaps most important, reviving the American metropoliswill require courage, will, and a collective vision; weneed a sense that it is possible to shape our commondestiny. The staff and board of the Energy Foundation recognizethe difficulty of changing the transportation system,and we understand how tightly our economy and mobilityare interwoven. But we are committed to supportingefforts that can solve difficult problems without makingothers worse, that can untangle the gridlock on thestreet and in the legislatures, and that can help makethe nation's cities and communities more livable.

The IPCC report declares thatthe 6 billion metric tons of carbon emitted into theatmosphere globally each year are indeed heating theplanet. Because economic growth and energy consumptionhave historically marched in lockstep, there is greatconcern that policy measures aimed at reducingfossil-fuel use could constrain future prosperity. Fortunately, the world need not choose betweencatastrophic climate change and economic growth. A host of new technologies offers themeans to simultaneously boost the economy and reducegreenhouse gas emissions. So while some argue thatcutting U.S. carbon dioxide emissions could be a costlydrag on the economy, this report provides dozens of casestudies that show the opposite: the reduction of carbondioxide emissions can be a beneficial side effect ofprofitable business choices. Sponsored by Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Energy Foundation January 1996 A. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy IncreaseEconomic Growth While Decreasing the Threat of GlobalClimate Change History shows that the United States can increaseeconomic growth while cutting energy consumption. Figure1 shows that from 1973 to 1986, Gross Domestic Product(GDP) grew 35 percent while the energy consumed per unitof GDP fell to 2.4 percent per year. Figure 1: Energy Efficiency: Decoupling Economic Growth from Energy Consumption By the end of this period, Americans were savingover $150 billion each year through improved energyefficiency, and had avoided a 50 percent cumulativeincrease in carbon emissions. Figure 2 shows that moderating energy use isfundamental to solving the global climate changedilemma. Figure 2: Sources of Emissions Driving Climate Change Since 1986, however, low fossil fuel prices in theU.S. have encouraged an increase in energy consumption.Today, Americans spend $505 billion per year on energy,and U.S. carbon emissions have reached an all-time high:1,394 million metric tons in 1994, accounting for 25percent of the global total. Unless decision- makersplace greater emphasis on efficiency and renewableenergy, these trends will continue. The U.S. Departmentof Energy (DOE) projects that with current trends andpolicies, energy use could increase to about 104quadrillion Btu (quads) per year by 2010, up from 85quads today. Given this rise in demand and resultantincreases in energy prices, this could translate to anational energy bill in 2010 of about $950 billion - and an increase in carbon emissions of 17percent. At a global summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,the United States was one of 154 nations and theEuropean Community to sign the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change. The framework stipulatesinternational commitments to cut greenhouse gasemissions, including carbon dioxide emissions, to 1990levels. Despite this commitment, as Figure 3 shows, U.S.carbon emissions are continuing to grow at about onepercent per year. Figure 3: Carbon Emission Trends B. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Markets AreGrowing Rapidly, and Creating Jobs The United States has barely scratched the surface ofenergy-saving opportunities available in the economy.The global market for energy efficiency has grown toover $80 billion annually, and is expected to reach$115-140 billion annually by 2015. The American Councilfor an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) estimates thatU.S. efficiency improvements consistent with a 2.4percent annual reduction in national energy intensity(the rate achieved in the U.S. during 1973-1986) couldcreate a net increase of nearly 500,000 jobs by the year 2000,and nearly 1.1 million new jobs by 2010. (Energyintensity measures energy use per dollar of GDP, andreflects how efficiently goods and services areproduced.) The majority of new jobs nationwide would becreated as money saved on power bills is recirculatedinto the economy and spent on additional products andservices. Investments in energy efficiency can lower consumers' energy bills, reduce energy costs,cut oil imports, increase the net number of jobs, andboost incomes - all while cutting carbon dioxideemissions and reducing the threat of global climatechange. C. Numerous Case Studies Demonstrate That Carbon DioxideEmissions Can Be Cut While Adding to U.S. Prosperity When they invest in energy efficiency, U.S. businessesimprove their bottom line by lowering their energybills, and boost their productivity and increase theircompetitiveness - all while cutting greenhouseemissions. 1. Industrial Energy-Efficiency Successes U.S. industries spend $121 billion per year on energyand consume about a quarter of all U.S. energy. Severalstudies show that industry could cut its energyintensity by 11 to 38 percent between now and the year2015. When businesses improve their manufacturingprocesses to use energy and raw materials moreefficiently, productivity, profitability, and employmentoften increase. At the same time, carbon dioxideemissions and environmental compliance costs typicallyfall. 3M Corporation. 3M has cut its energy use perunit of production in half over the last 20 years,reducing overall emissions by one-third. The company hasworked aggressively to achieve an ambitious butpractical corporate goal: cut energy use per unit ofproduction and per square foot of building space by 20percent. It has pledged to implement all energy-savingprojects with a 15 percent or greater return oninvestment (a payback period of six to seven years).Energy cost-cutting has made the company morecompetitive and more productive. 3M is also marketing anew "dual cure coating" process that is used foraircraft topcoats and primers, and for coatings for thebacking of high-temperature electrical tape. The newcoatings could eliminate an estimated 236,000 metrictons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) annually - 7.5 percent of U.S. total emissions. Because thenew process requires less energy, it could also reducecarbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 2 millionmetric tons a year. By 2010, the cumulative energysavings could be greater than all the electricity usedin all the commercial establishments in the state ofIowa in 1995. Dow Chemical. Dow Chemical's Louisiana Division,whose 2,400 employees in more than 20 plants makechemicals such as propylene, began a yearly contest in1982 to find energy-saving projects that paid forthemselves in one year and that required a capitalinvestment of less than $200,000. The first year, thecontest produced 27 winning projects that required atotal capital investment of $1.7 million and produced anaverage return on investment of 173 percent. The 1983contest had 32 winning projects requiring a totalcapital investment of $2.2 million and providing a 340percent return on investment - producing an annual,ongoing savings of $7.5 million. The yearly contest wasso successful that Dow changed the rules to eliminatethe $200,000 limit and to include savings from all kindsof waste reduction, not just energy. For 575 projects implemented throughoutthe 1980s, the average return was 204 percent (audited).After ten years and nearly 700 projects, the 1992contest had 109 winning entries that enjoyed an averagereturn of 305 percent; the 1993 contest generated 140 projects with an average return of298 percent. 2. Utility Industry Efficiency Successes America's utilities provide roughly $260 billion eachyear in energy services to homes, businesses andindustries - a figure that represents 5.2 percent of the gross national product (GNP). At thesame time, U.S. utilities emitted approximately 500million metric tons of carbon in 1993, or about 36percent of the annual U.S. total. This figure hasdropped from where it would have been had not a wide array of electric utility energy-savingprograms saved the U.S. economy billions of dollars. From 1989 to 1993, utility investments inenergy-efficiency programs tripled to about $3 billionper year. These investments reduced national generationin 1993 by 44,000 gigawatt-hours, 1.6 percent of totalU.S. generation. These savings cut consumers' utilitybills by nearly $4 billion that year, while reducingcarbon dioxide emissions by approximately 27.8 millionmetric tons. Utility efficiency programs in California providednet benefits of $2.2 billion during the period from 1990to 1994. In 1994, the average cost of savedkilowatt-hours was less than 2 cents per kilowatt-hour - less than the wholesale price of power producedby the cheapest new generating plant. New York utilityprograms delivered $1.4 billion in net benefits tocustomers between 1990 to 1994. In the PacificNorthwest, efficiency programs during 1995 saved morethan 900 average megawatts of electricity at an averagecost of 2 to 2-1/2 cents per kilowatt-hour, savingretail consumers $2 billion. The efforts avoided more than 5.35 millionmetric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. In Wisconsin,utilities achieved a cumulative reduction in energydemand from 1988 to 1994 of 2,959 gigawatt-hours, whilereducing carbon dioxide emissions by 1.8 million metrictons. From 1995 through 2013, projections show,Wisconsin utility efficiency programs could reduceelectricity usage by 5,152 gigawatt-hours, preventingmore than 3.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxideemissions. In Massachusetts, programs at three majorutilities delivered net benefits of nearly $400 millionbetween 1990 and 1993. Market uncertainties due to proposed utilityindustry restructuring are currently causing utilitiesto cut back on all long-term investments, includingefficiency. However, the newest utility restructuringmodels - from California and New England - indicate that energy efficiency investments willcontinue. The most profitable course for future, still-regulateddistribution companies will be to select the lowest-costoption to meet energy needs. A recent report projectsthat utility efficiency programs will deliver 3 percentof electricity demand annually by the year 2000,avoiding 45 million metric tons of carbon dioxideemissions. 3. Efficiency Successes in Buildings, Equipment, and Appliances The U.S. could cut energy consumption in buildings by 33to 50 percent by the year 2015, simply by investing incost-effective, commercially available tech- nologies.Substantial progress in building efficiency has beenmade already. Improved building codes, energy-efficientdesigns, retrofits, and improved equipment andappliances have stabilized energy intensity in thecommercial sector, and have reduced energy intensity inresidences. Offices and homes now get the sameservices - lights, heating, air-conditioning - usingless energy than in the past. But much more energy wastecan be trimmed. a. Successful Building Design Energy design decisions are long-lasting. The medianlifetime for commercial buildings is between 50 and 70years. The potential for savings is high. A reasonably attainable 30 percent improvement in U.S.building efficiency would reduce energy bills by $75billion annually in 15 years. Energy-efficient building and office design cansignificantly increase worker productivity. By improvinglighting, heating, and cooling, workers are made morecomfortable and productive. An increase of 1 percent inproductivity can provide savings that exceed a company'sentire energy bill. Lockheed Missiles and Space Company. One of themost successful examples of efficient design for acommercial office building is Lockheed Missiles and Space Company'sBuilding 157 in Sunnyvale, California. A central atriumin the 600,000 square-foot office brings daylight deepinto the building, saving Lockheed about 75 percent onits lighting bill. Since daylight generates less heatthan office lights, peak air-conditioning has been cutsubstantially. Overall, the building runs with abouthalf the energy costs of a typical building of similarsize. Although the energy-efficient improvements addedroughly $2 million to the building's $50 million capitalcosts, the energy savings, worth nearly $500,000 peryear, paid for themselves in a little more than fouryears. More important, however, have been productivityimprovements. Russell Robinson, manager of FacilityInterior Development, reports that productivity is up while absenteeism has declined. According to DonAitken, chairman of the Department of EnvironmentalStudies at nearby San Jose State University, "Lockheedmoved a known population of workers into the buildingand absenteeism dropped 15 percent." Aitken led numeroustours of Building 157 after it opened, and was told byLockheed officials that the reduced absenteeism paid 100percent of the extra cost of the building in the firstyear. The architect, Lee Windheim, has learned thatproductivity rose 15 percent on the first major contractdone in the building. b. Lighting Retrofits Lighting accounts for 19 percent of all electricity soldin the U.S. and costs consumers nearly $40 billion peryear. The best light bulbs on the market use only aquarter as much energy as conventional incandescent light bulbs and last ten times longer, eachpreventing the burning of as much as 400 pounds of coal,and saving consumers more than $35 net on theirelectricity bills over the life of the improved bulb. If energy-efficient lighting were installedeverywhere profitable to do so, America's demand forelectricity would drop by more than 10 percent. Thiswould result in annual reductions of 1.3 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 600,000metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 202 million metrictons of carbon dioxide. That's a reduction in carbondioxide emissions equivalent to taking 44.5 million carsoff the road. These reductions represent 12 percent ofall U.S. utility emissions. Boeing Corporation. Boeing has been a participantin the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) GreenLights program to promote energy-efficient lighting.Lighting upgrades have cut electricity use by 25 to 90percent in several million square feet of Boeing'sfacilities, with a 53 percent annual return oninvestment. Boeing's upgrades have saved 130,000megawatt-hours, have paid for themselves in just twoyears, and have cut carbon dioxide emissions by 18,070metric tons per year. They have also reduced annual emissions of other air pollutants,including sulfur dioxide (down 4,536 metric tons) andnitrogen oxides (down 1,815 metric tons). The newlighting has improved workers' abilities to detectmanufacturing defects by 20 percent. According toLawrence Friedman, Boeing's conservation manager, thesavings from catching errors early,while difficult tomeasure, are estimated to exceed greatly the cost of theenergy-efficient upgrades. c. Efficient Appliances and Equipment Appliance and equipment standards are saving consumers$1.9 billion annually, and ultimately will saveconsumers $132 billion net over the lifetime of productspurchased by 2030, providing a ratio of total benefitsto costs of 3-to-1. Past and necessary future applianceand equipment standards could cut residentialelectricity use 7 percent by the year 2015, saving about80,000 gigawatt-hours and 21,000 megawatts annually, andavoiding approximately 50.6 million metric tons ofcarbon dioxide per year. Whirlpool's "Golden Carrot" Super-EfficientRefrigerator. Refrigerators consume 20 percent of allresidential electricity, and average about 685kilowatt-hours per refrigerator each year. To encouragemanufacturers to develop and marketrefrigerator-freezers that are substantially moreefficient, a group of electric utilities formed aconsortium - the Super Efficient RefrigeratorProgram, Inc. (SERP) - that put up a $30 millionpot of incentive money. In June 1993, SERP selected twosemi-finalists - including Whirlpool. As shown inFigure 4, energy and carbon savings from the GoldenCarrot refrigerator are substantial. Compared toan owner of a 1978 model, each owner of a GoldenCarrot refrigerator saves $135 per year in electricitywhile cutting carbon emissions by two-thirds. Figure 4a: New Golden Carrot Whirlpool Design Reduces Comsumer Costs... Figure 4b: ...And Carbon Emissions Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The U.S.Department of Energy program at the Lawrence BerkeleyNational Laboratory (LBNL) has made enormouscontributions to national energy efficiency bycontributing to the development of electronic ballastsand low emissivity, or "Low-E," windows. Electronicballasts, virtually unknown in the mid-1970s when LBNL'sresearch began, now capture a 24-percent share of theballast market. Cumulative energy savings attributableto electronic ballasts from 1988 to 1993 total $400million. By 2015, use of electronic ballasts could avoidenvironmental emissions of approximately 157,000 metrictons of sulfur dioxide, 144,000 metric tons of nitrogenoxides, and 73 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.Today, Low-E windows have captured 36 percent of theU.S. windows market, boasting $600 million in annualsales. By 1993, the cumulative energy savings tothe U.S. was $760 million, and will reach $17 billion bythe year 2015. By that year, Low-E windows are projected to prevent, throughavoided electricity generation, 142,000 metric tons ofsulfur dioxide, 129,000 metric tons of nitrogen oxides,and more than 64 million metric tons of carbon dioxideemissions. Energy-efficient building codes, building designs,retrofit investments, and equipment and appliancestandards all contribute to greater businesscompetitiveness and economic growth - while helpingto avoid carbon dioxide emissions. 4. Successes in the Transportation Sector The combustion of fossil fuels in America'stransportation sector consumed 35 percent of thenation's energy in 1990 and produced more than 32percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. Transportation will be the fastest growing source ofU.S. carbon dioxide emissions over the long term - by far - unless Americans take aggressive steps tobuild efficiency into transportation systems. Two-thirds of total U.S. oil consumption goes totransportation, and each day Americans use 4 millionmore barrels of oil for transportation than the U.S.produces. The United States imports half the petroleumit uses, a fact that contributed $56 billion to the U.S. trade deficit in 1994, and the trend isupward. The gap between what we use and what we produceis projected to rise to 9 million barrels per day by the year 2010. Dependence on oil imports threatens U.S.national security, making our economy vulnerable toforeign cartels, price swings, supply disruptions, andforeign wars. Transportation energy use accounts for about half of all air pollution emissions in theU.S. and more than 80 percent of air pollution incities. Highway vehicles alone account for 26 percent ofU.S. emissions of VOCs, 32 percent of nitrogen oxides,and 62 percent of total carbon monoxide. The American Lung Association estimates thatAmerica spends $50 billion each year on health care as adirect result of air pollution. Fortunately, fuel efficiency has improvedsubstantially in the transportation sector during thelast 20 years, and efficiency gains are far fromexhausted. Federal Corporate Automobile Fuel Efficiency(CAFE) requirements for new vehicles are one of themajor energy-policy success stories of the past 20years. CAFE standards doubled automobile fuel efficiencyfrom 14 miles per gallon (mpg) to 27 mpg between 1975and 1985. The standards, which have not been improvedsince the mid-1980s, are presently saving nearly 3million barrels of oil per day - which correspondsto $50 billion of consumer savings and 150 millionmetric tons of greenhouse gas emissions avoidedannually. As shown in Figure 5, working prototypes couldeasily double vehicle fuel efficiency, while electric and hybrid-electricvehicles - if incentives are created to spur marketdevelopment - could usher in a new age of cleantransportation, powered by renewables-derivedelectricity. Figure 5: Efficient Prototype Vehicles General Motors Corporation. Many manufacturersare moving ahead with electric vehicle production.General Motors originally unveiled its Impact model in1990. The Impact, with a composite body and stiffaluminum frame, incorporates an advanced electric motor,electronic controls, regenerative braking, andaerodynamic streamlining. The energy cost of running anImpact is only a quarter that of a gasoline-powered car.The driving range is about 100 miles using its 1,100pounds of lead-acid batteries. Those who havetest-driven the Impact have given it rave reviews forits quiet ride, maneuverability, and rapid acceleration.Even counting the emissions from the power plants usedto charge it, the Impact produces two-thirds lesspollution than California will allow under its 1998ultra-low emission standard, and 72 percent less carbondioxide than is emitted by a 1994 Ford Taurus. 5. Renewable Energy: Coming of Age Efficiency reduces consumption while maintaining orimproving the services provided by energy. Renewableenergy could supply new power needs with no carbonemissions. Renewable energy technologies - wind, photovoltaics, solar-thermal, andgeothermal - have made major advances in the past decade.Figure 6 highlights the dramatic drop in renewableenergy costs. Figure 6: Renewable Energy Costs are Dropping For example, the cost of wind-generated electricityin the U.S. dropped from 25 cents per kilowatt-hour in1984 to less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour today. Thecost curves for solar-thermal and photovoltaic utilityplants show similar downward trends. Increasedproduction would further reduce costs. If pollution and social costs from fossil fuel use wereto be internalized in fossil fuel prices, manyrenewables today would be cheaper than fossil fuels. At the same time, reliability has improvedmarkedly, and renewable capacity is expected to grow. Arecent study projects that existing renewable technologies could supply roughly one-quarter of ourcurrent energy use by 2010. The advancement of wind energy is a convincingsuccess story. U.S. wind resources are large enough tosupply more than 4.4 billion megawatt-hours - more than 1-1/2 times the total amount ofelectricity used in the United States. At leastthirty-seven states have commercial wind energypotential. The wind industry is producing utility-scaleturbines that are significantly less costly and far morereliable than earlier generation turbines. Utilitycontracts for wind power have been signed recently for alevelized price of less than 4 cents per kilowatt-hour - competitive with fossil sources and cheaper thannuclear. Wind has enormous advantages over fossil fuels,including minimal future costs subject to inflation, andlow operating and maintenance costs. Wind energy is oneof the least costly sources of new electrical generationand is competitive with new plants fired with fossil fuels. Kenetech Corporation. U.S. Windpower, Inc. formedKenetech Corporation, based in San Francisco, in 1986 asa holding company. Kenetech, the world's largest windcompany, has more than 800 employees. It manufacturesand sells one of the most advanced wind turbines in theworld, the variable speed Model 33M-VS. This turbine isable to deliver electricity at less than 5 cents perkilowatt-hour, making it economically competitive withtraditional fossil-fuel energy sources. Kenetechoperates an installed base of approximately 4,400 windturbines, most of which are in the United States. InCalifornia, Kenetech generated 659,131 megawatt-hours ofelectricity in 1993, offsetting 226,082 metric tons ofcarbon dioxide emissions that would otherwise have beengenerated by California's average mix. Photovoltaic (PV) power is another promisingrenewable technology. PVs use semiconductor technologyto convert sunlight directly into electricity withoutthe need for turbines, generators, or any other movingparts. PV production costs have fallen more than 50-foldduring the last 20 years, and PVs generate power todayat an average cost of 25 to 50 cents per kilowatt-hourfor grid-connected applications. At these prices, PVapplications are mainly cost-effective for off-the-griduses in remote locations and for specialized gridsituations where distribution and transmission expansioncosts can be avoided. For example, PV arrays situated atgenerating substations to support a utility'stransmission and distribution system, and PV arrays atresidential and commercial centers, have the potentialto manage demand for electricity by shaving utility peakloads. Overall costs are reduced and carbon emissionsavoided. Amoco/Enron Solar. The domestic PV industryreceived a boost in January 1995 when Amoco Corp., whichowns Solarex, the largest U.S. manufacturer and marketerof PV systems, launched a joint venture with EnronCorp., the nation's largest natural gas company.Together, they propose to build a $25 million facilityto manufacture PV modules and a $150 million,100-megawatt PV-powered generating plant in Nevada thatthey maintain will be able to sell power profitably for5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (escalating at 3 percentannually over 30 years). Production at the plant - which each year will manufacture large-area,multijunction amorphous silicon modules with capacity inexcess of 10 megawatts - is scheduled to begin in1996. D. Conclusion The successes reviewed in this report not only savedollars and boost economic performance, but also cutcarbon dioxide emissions and reduce the threat of globalclimate change. Our nation can grow economically, addjobs, and become more internationally competitive whilecutting greenhouse gas emissions. The task ahead is not simple, however. While themarket has captured many efficiency and renewable energysuccesses, a host of market barriers to efficiencyinvestments persists. For example, although efficiencyand renewable energy technologies are often cheaper on alife-cycle basis, their up-front costs are typicallyhigher than less-efficient products. Public policiesthat provide consumers with life-cycle productinformation could help overcome this market failure. Similarly, because it takes up-front capital to investin improved efficiency, public policies that promotefinancing and technical assistance can facilitateinvestment. Although the focus of this report is onefficiency and renewable energy success stories, giventhe market hurdles to efficiency investments, utilityefficiency programs and public policy incentives arecrucial to encourage energy efficiency. The effects oftighter environmental regulations and the prospect ofhigher fossil energy prices will increasingly makeefficiency investments a prudent pursuit for allbusinesses. Michael Porter, a professor at the Harvard BusinessSchool, notes that "the underlying cause of sustainednational advantage is improvement and innovation." Thecompelling conclusion of the case studies in thisreport, coupled with the solid economic, employment,public health, and pollution-reduction benefits reviewedin each, support a strategic vision for U.S. energypolicy: Energy efficiency and renewable energy can addto U.S. prosperity while cutting U.S. carbon dioxideemissions and reducing the threat of global climatechange.

The IPCC report declares that the 6 billion metric tons of carbon emitted into the atmosphere globally each year are indeed heating the planet. Because economic growth and energy consumption have historically marched in lockstep, there is great concern that policy measures aimed at reducing fossil-fuel use could constrain future prosperity. Fortunately, the world need not choose between catastrophic climate change and economic growth. A host of new technologies offers the means to simultaneously boost the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. businesses, municipalities, and educational institutions are finding that investments in energy efficiency cut power bills and provide a rapid payback, while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. So while some argue that cutting U.S. carbon dioxide emissions would be a costly drag on the economy,[ 1 ] this report shows dozens of examples of how carbon dioxide reductions are often a beneficial side effect of profitable, energy-saving business choices. Energy efficiency[ 2 ] can increase profitability and competitiveness by lowering the cost of doing business. When businesses improve their manufacturing processes to use energy and raw materials more efficiently, carbon dioxide emissions and environmental compliance costs fall while profitability, productivity, and competitiveness improve, creating jobs. A. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Reduce the Threat of Global Climate Change While Fueling Economic Growth B. Energy Efficiency Does Not Mean Reduced Economic Growth C. Energy Efficiency and Renewables Markets Are Rapidly Growing, and Creating Jobs D. Successes Demonstrate That Cutting Carbon Dioxide Emissions Can Add to U.S. Prosperity 1. Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been charged with assessing the economic costs of climate change. Some have argued for the use of "top-down" macroeconomic models, which look at aggregated statistical data, and claim that carbon dioxide emission controls could cost the U.S. economy 1 to 2 percent of GDP annually. On the other hand, "bottom-up" computer models find the opposite conclusion, that carbon dioxide emission controls could actually grow the economy by 1 to 2 percent annually through increased energy and economic efficiency, enhancing profitability, productivity, and new job creation. Advocates for the "top down" models claim that it would be more cost-effective to delay implementation of carbon controls until current capital infrastructure and investments reach the end of their life-cycle. This argument, however, suffers in two respects. First, it fails to account for ecological reality: carbon dioxide continuously accumulates in the atmosphere, so emission reductions sooner are more valuable than reductions later. Second, it reflects an outmoded business philosophy. As discussed below, the businesses that will thrive in an increasingly competitive global economy are those that recognize the necessity of constant reinvestment in efficient production and productivity improvements. Energy efficiency investments will assist companies in becoming more productive and competitive, while helping the U.S. meet its international carbon dioxide reduction obligations.

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Reduce the Threat of Global Climate Change While Fueling Economic Growth Energy-related carbon emissions in the United States have reached an all-time high. Emissions resulting from the nation's use of fossil fuels climbed to 1,394 million metric tons in 1994, an increase of 24 million metric tons (1.8 percent) over 1993 levels, and of 56 million metric tons (4.2 percent) compared with 1990 levels. [ 3 ] But this growth in carbon emissions can be reversed. A national energy strategy that emphasizes energy efficiency and renewable energy could remedy the threat posed by global climate change. Chart 1: Carbon Emission Trends Numerous studies have examined the impact of a national energy strategy that emphasizes greater energy efficiency. America's Energy Choices, [ 4 ] for example, showed that vigorous adoption of cost-effective energy efficiency and renewable energy measures could cut national energy usage in 2030 by nearly 50 percent. Those same measures could dramatically reduce our nation's petroleum dependence, save consumers more than $2 trillion net over the next 40 years, and cut carbon dioxide emissions in 2030 by more than 70 percent (relative to emissions in 1988). [ 5 ] The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimates that 23 percent of all U.S. electricity consumption could be saved for less than 3 cents per kilowatt-hour - which is less than the cost of generating that electricity. [ 6 ] 3. Geller, H. and Morris, H., U.S. Carbon Emissions Continue to Climb in 1994, p. 1 (Washington, D.C.: American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, June 1, 1995). 4.

Investments in energy efficiency offer significant environmental improvements and economic gains. If the U.S. was to adopt the program laid out in America's Energy Choices, by the year 2010 America could: Reduce annual electricity generation by 27 percent; Decrease the need for new generating facilities by more than 50 percent; Reduce emissions of carbon dioxide in the utility sector by 33 percent and nitrogen oxides by 12 percent; Reduce the total amount paid for electricity by 18 percent (a savings of $50 billion in 1992 dollars); and Increase annual consumption of goods and services other than electricity by $45 billion. All this could be accomplished without a loss of jobs or increased inflation, and with a cumulative savings of $211 billion off the nation's electric bill.

Union of Concerned Scientists, et al., America's Energy Choices: Investing in a Strong Economy and a Clean Environment (Washington, D.C.: 1991). 6. Other studies have also shown that the U.S. materials economy is only about 10 to 15 percent efficient - or even lower. Robert U. Ayres estimates that roughly 94 percent of the materials used in the U.S. manufacturing sector are converted to waste. This implies a net efficiency of only 6 percent. The vast volume of resource waste means a large environmental impact. It also means a higher cost of goods and services.

Energy Efficiency Does Not Mean Reduced Economic Growth Prior to 1973, U.S. energy consumption and the Gross National Product (GNP) seemed to be inexorably linked. But more recent history shows that energy consumption can be reduced during economic expansion. From 1973 to 1986, GNP grew 35 percent while the energy consumed per unit of GDP fell to 2.4 percent per year. Some 26.6 "quads" [ 7 ] of anticipated energy usage per year, worth $150 billion, never materialized - mostly due to improved energy efficiency. [ 8 ] A 50 percent increase in carbon dioxide emissions was thus avoided during this period. Chart 2: Energy Efficiency: Decoupling EconomicGrowth from Energy Consumption The United States now uses about 85 quads of primary energy annually, resulting in a national energy bill of $505 billion per year. [ 9 ] The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) projects that with current trends and policies, energy use will increase to about 104 quads per year by 2010. Given this rise in demand and resultant increases in prices, our national energy bill in 2010 is projected to reach about $950 billion. [ 10 ] Increasing energy use creates a host of problems besides higher dollar outlays, including greater oil imports (DOE forecasts a 68 percent increase between 1990 and 2010) and greater pollutant emissions (DOE forecasts an 17 percent increase in carbon emissions between 1993 and 2010). [ 11 ] Vigorous energy-efficiency improvements could lower consumers' energy bills and reduce the cost of energy services, cut oil imports, reduce pollutant emissions, create a net increase in jobs, and boost individual incomes. 7. A "quad" is one quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) of energy. The entire U.S. consumed 88.5 quads in 1994. Approximate equivalents to 1 quad include: (1) the amount of gasoline that will enable the average car to travel 170 billion miles; (2) the amount of energy in 6 billion cubic feet of hardwood; or (3) the primary energy that will meet the needs of 3 million average Americans for 1 year.

Energy Efficiency and Renewables Markets Are Rapidly Growing, and Creating Jobs Energy-efficiency and renewables-technology markets are growing rapidly and generating thousands of jobs nationwide. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) estimates that efficiency improvements consistent with a 2.4 percent annual reduction in national energy usage (the rate achieved in the U.S. during 1973-1986) could create a net increase of nearly 500,000 jobs by the year 2000 and nearly 1.1 million new jobs by 2010. [ 12 ] A recent study has found that in Ohio alone as many as 63,000 jobs could be created by the year 2010 through energy-efficiency investments and the manufacture of energy-efficiency products. [ 13 ] For example, new jobs have been created at Staber Industries in Groveport, Ohio, which makes energy-saving clothes washers, and at General Electric in Circleville, Ohio, which makes compact fluorescent light bulbs. The majority of new jobs nationwide would be created as money saved on power bills is recirculated into the economy and spent on additional products and services. [ 14 ] Current energy efficiency markets are already sizable. The global energy efficiency market is now in excess of $80 billion per year, and is projected to reach $115-140 billion annually by 2015. [ 15 ] Energy efficiency and environmental technology markets are large and growing all over the world. [ 16 ] 12.

Successes Demonstrate That Cutting Carbon Dioxide Emissions Can Add to U.S. Prosperity This report documents how U.S. businesses and individuals are increasing their bottom lines while improving economic prosperity, employment, and public health - and cutting greenhouse emissions. Chapter I reviews energy-efficiency success stories in the industrial sector, stories that demonstrate how companies that set out to cut electricity bills also improved worker productivity and became more competitive. Chapter II assesses a wide array of energy-saving electric utility programs and federal energy-efficiency programs that have saved the U.S. economy billions of dollars. Chapter III reviews gains in the energy-efficient design of commercial buildings and residences nationwide, and assesses ongoing innovations that could lead to improved building codes. It discusses commercial and residential energy-efficiency retrofit successes - including lighting upgrades - as well as efficiency gains in the design of appliances and equipment. Chapter IV reviews the transportation sector and the improvement in fuel efficiency over the last 20 years. It goes on to discuss how new automobile engines that are now available could double vehicle fuel efficiency, while electric and hybrid-electric vehicles - given incentives that would spur market development - could usher in a new age of clean transportation, powered by renewables-derived electricity. Chapter V reviews recent successes in renewable energy, including a drop in the cost per kilowatt-hour of wind, photovoltaic, solar thermal, and geothermal power. Wind can now compete head-to-head with fossil fuels. All of the successes reviewed in this report not only save dollars and add to U.S. economic strength, but also cut carbon dioxide emissions and reduce the threat of global climate change. Our nation can grow economically, add jobs, and become more internationally competitive while cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The task ahead is not simple, however. While the market has captured many efficiency and renewable energy successes, a host of market barriers to efficiency investments persists. For example, although efficiency and renewable energy technologies are often cheaper on a life-cycle basis, their up-front costs are typically higher than less-efficient products. Public policies that provide consumers with life-cycle product information could help overcome this market failure. Similarly, because it takes up-front capital to invest in improved efficiency, public policies that promote financing and technical assistance can facilitate investment. Although the focus of this report is on efficiency and renewable energy success stories, given the market hurdles to efficiency investments, utility efficiency programs and public policy incentives are crucial to encourage energy efficiency. The effects of tighter environmental regulations and the prospect of higher energy prices will increasingly make efficiency investments a prudent pursuit for all businesses. Michael Porter, a professor at the Harvard Business School, notes that "the underlying cause of sustained national advantage is improvement and innovation." [ 17 ] The following case studies - coupled with the solid economic, employment, public health and pollution-reduction benefits reviewed in each - establish the need for a strategic vision for U.S. energy policy: energy efficiency and renewable energy can add to U.S. prosperity while cutting U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, reducing the threat of global climate change. 17.

Industrial Energy Efficiency Successes U.S. industries spend $121 billion per year on energy, consuming about a quarter of all U.S. energy. [ 18 ] While manufacturers account for roughly half of that annual bill ($61.1 billion in 1991), they are responsible for 85 percent of U.S. industrial carbon dioxide emissions - approximately 504 million metric tons annually. Efficiency improvements in the manufacturing process can reduce these emissions, cut consumption, and improve a company's bottom line. [ 19 ] Percentage of Manufacturing Energy Consumptionby Industry According to several studies, the annual energy savings that could be attained by U.S. industry over the next two decades ranges from 11 to 27 percent of the demand that would otherwise occur, and potential savings by 2015 may reach as high as 38 percent. [ 20 ] These improvements depend, however, on the design and implementation of new policies and programs to stimulate more energy efficiency. Finding ways to encourage the installation of technologies such as high-efficiency motors, [ 21 ] computerized controls, industry-specific technologies, and cogeneration units could result in avoided energy consumption of 59 quads a year by 2010 - a savings worth $183 billion in 1994 dollars. [ 22 ] 18. United States Department of Energy, "Why Industrial Energy Use Matters," Fact Sheet, p. 1 (Washington, D.C.: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, 1995). 19. The industrial sector includes manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and construction. Manufacturing is the largest component of the industrial sector, and accounts for about a quarter of total national electricity consumption. Including system losses in electric generation, manufacturing consumption was 20 quads in 1991, and accounted for 37 percent of total U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. Elliott, R. Neal, Electricity Consumption and the Potential for Electric Energy Savings in the Manufacturing Sector, pp. iii, 2 (Washington, D.C.: American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, April 1994); United States Department of Energy, "Why Industrial Energy Use Matters," Fact Sheet, p. 1 (Washington, D.C.: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, 1995). 20. According to one market-based scenario, total energy use in the industrial sector could be reduced by 12 percent by 2010 and 18 percent by 2030 from baseline projections. See America's Energy Choices, pp. 65-66. The DOE has estimated that technical industrial energy savings potential in the year 2010 is 27 percent, and achievable industrial energy savings potential in the year 2010 is 13 percent. Congress' Office of Technology Assessment estimates that the potential industrial savings in the year 2015 is between 11 and 37 percent. An Oak Ridge National Laboratory report estimates that the cost-effective industrial fuel (non-electric) savings potential is 11 percent in the year 2010. See Hopkins, M., and Jones, T., Getting in Gear: How Energy Efficiency Can Help Smaller Manufacturers Compete in the Global Marketplace, p. 58, n. 21 (Washington, D.C.: Alliance to Save Energy, January 1995). The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimates that 14 to 38 percent of total electricity consumption can be saved through an orderly upgrade of equipment at the time of equipment failure, process modernization, or new construction. Process optimization and redesign would significantly increase this conservation potential. Elliott, R. Neal, Electricity Consumption and the Potential for Electric Energy Savings in the Manufacturing Sector, p. iii (Washington, D.C.: American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, April 1994). 21. More than 80 percent of the energy savings available to U.S. industry comes from electric motor systems improvements. Lighting and process improvements contribute slightly less than 10 percent. More than 33 percent of the energy savings available from motor systems improvements comes from the application of adjustable speed drives, with another 25 percent coming from improved drivetrain, electricity supply, and maintenance practices. Another 17 percent of electricity savings available from motors is estimated to come from installing more efficient motors. In fact, manufacturers spend about $30 billion annually to operate 40 million electric motors - which consume 70 percent of all energy in a typical manufacturing facility. These costs could be cut nearly in half with efficient motor systems. Elliott, R. Neal, Electricity Consumption and the Potential for Electric Energy Savings in the Manufacturing Sector, pp. iii, 2 (Washington, D.C.: American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, April 1994). 22.

Energy-Efficiency Investments Can Boost Productivity While Reducing Industrial Waste Materials Inefficient industrial energy use is closely related to the generation of industrial waste materials. Industry is responsible for producing more than 544 million metric tons of hazardous wastes and approximately 11.8 billion metric tons of solid wastes each year. [ 23 ] Industry spends approximately $45 billion each year to meet emissions control requirements. [ 24 ] Minimizing the generation of waste materials, and transforming wastes into feedstocks, could reduce the nation's primary energy requirement by as much as 6 quads per year. [ 25 ] Energy efficiency technologies and processes, when installed "pre-end-of-the-pipe," can prevent pollution before it occurs, lowering production costs and thereby freeing capital for more productive purposes. High and Low Efficiency Savings Potentialin the Manufacturing Sector Both energy use and pollution are controllable costs. Although energy is typically a small percentage of total production costs, [ 26 ] other production costs - such as wages, work rules, materials costs, and disposal charges - are often more difficult to control. Controlling energy and waste cuts the operating budget and can have an enormous impact on a company's bottom line. [ 27 ] In many cases, the energy savings embodied in new technologies capable of reducing environmental emissions is sufficient to pay for upgrades - regardless of such other benefits as improved product quality or productivity. Energy efficiency should be a fundamental component of all manufacturers' environmental programs - to help them meet today's environmental regulations and tomorrow's more stringent standards. [ 28 ] 3M Corporation. Often cited as one of the best-run companies in the world, 3M - based in St. Paul, Minnesota - has reduced its energy use per unit of production by one-half over the last 20 years, and in the process has reduced overall emissions by one-third. The company has achieved greater returns through energy-efficiency improvements than through alternative cost-cutting measures, and has pledged to implement all energy-saving projects with a 15 percent or greater return on investment (a payback period of six to seven years). It has aggressively pursued a corporate goal to further cut energy use per unit of production and per square foot of building space by 20 percent from 1990 through 1995. [ 29 ] Energy cost-cutting has made the company both more competitive and productive. 3M is also marketing a new "dual cure coating" process, a low-solvent technique that uses light to cure coatings. It is used for aircraft topcoats and primers, and for coatings for the backing of high-temperature electrical tape. The process produces superior physical properties with minimal volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. [ [ 30 ] ] Based on a conservative projection of 10 percent market penetration, the new coatings could eliminate an estimated 236,000 metric tons of VOCs annually - 7.5 percent of the U.S. total. This energy-efficient process will also reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 2 million metric tons a year. By the year 2010, 3M's new coatings could save an estimated 25 trillion Btu of energy - more than all the electricity used in all the commercial establishments in the state of Iowa in 1995. [ 31 ] Haskell-Lemon Construction Company. Haskell-Lemon Construction Company of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma manufactures asphalt paving products. Mixing hot asphalt can waste, in the form of exhaust steam, as much as 60 percent of the energy used in various stages of the mixing process. In 1989, Haskell-Lemon installed a heat-recovery system at one of three asphalt hot-mix plants to recover the waste steam, speed the manufacturing process, and reduce energy costs. Haskell-Lemon personnel tested the system for two months and documented the energy savings. The new system reduced fuel requirements by 30 percent and increased production by as much as 40 percent. Emissions decreased by 50 percent because some toxic fumes that previously escaped with evaporating steam were condensed in the heat-recovery process. The heat-recovery system cost $100,000. Annual energy savings ranged between $20,000 and $30,000, depending on the cost of fuel, and thus the internal rate of return on the heat-recovery system was 20 to 33 percent. [ 32 ] If all 4,500 hot-mix plants in the United States used the same heat-recovery process as Haskell-Lemon, the industry could save $250 million in energy costs each year. In 1991, the Haskell-Lemon project was selected for the DOE's Sixth National Awards Program for Energy Innovation. [ 33 ] DOE's Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Center/Industrial Assessment Center (EADC/IAC) has issued several energy-saving recommendations for companies that mix asphalt paving. By installing the six most frequently recommended efficiency improvements, [ 34 ] each asphalt mixing company would spend an average of $54,393 and save $37,186 annually in reduced energy bills - while cutting carbon dioxide emissions each year by 652 metric tons. [ 35 ] Hill-Rom Company. Hill-Rom Company of Batesville, Indiana manufactures furniture and medical equipment. To address high energy costs in the mid-1980s, as well as a number of engineering problems, Hill-Rom installed a monitoring system for production equipment and an integrated maintenance control center. It saved $180,000 in energy costs by replacing inefficient space heaters with new high-efficiency heaters, installing a lighting control system, replacing manual motor starters on the ventilation system, and replacing manual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) controls with direct networked controls. [ 36 ] The new monitoring systems improved productivity. The plant has been able to shorten maintenance response time, reduce machine downtime, and improve plant environmental conditions. The labor and material savings attributable to the systems amounted to $430,000 in 1990. Taken together, the direct energy savings and productivity savings enabled Hill-Rom to pay back its $424,300 investment in fewer than eight months. [ 37 ] In Hill-Rom's industry, the DOE's EADC/IAC program audited 12 smaller-sized furniture manufacturing plants. The program identified 68 energy-saving measures. [ 38 ] The average cost of implementing the six most common recommendations was $3,770 per plant, and they yielded an average annual energy savings of $5,459 while cutting annual carbon dioxide emissions by 69 metric tons. [ 39 ] Brush Wellman, Inc. In 1991, perchloroethylene (PCE) spilled from a storage tank at Brush Wellman, Inc.'s facility in Elmore, Ohio. The spill contaminated groundwater and surrounding soils. Brush Wellman, a manufacturer of beryllium and beryllium alloy products, had relied on PCE as a cleaning solvent. But faced with a $1.49 million clean-up tab, the company set out to end the threat of spills and find alternatives to PCE cleaning systems. [ 40 ] Brush Wellman's solution was to install a high-energy, dense-fluid cleaning system that uses nonhazardous (when not emitted as a greenhouse gas) carbon dioxide. The new cleaning process saved energy when compared with the previous system. Natural gas savings amounted to 31.66 million cubic feet per year, and electricity savings were 323 megawatt-hours annually. [ 41 ] The entire PCE waste stream was eliminated. All told, the new system cost $1.23 million while saving $282,000 per year in the costs of PCE solvent, steam, electricity, water, waste disposal, and maintenance. The payback period was just over 4 years. The new cleaning process has many potential applications: any metal-machining or product-processing company could adapt the system. [ 42 ] Besides the substantial annual energy savings, Brush Wellman's new cleaning system reduces overall carbon dioxide emissions from avoided electricity usage by 1,640 metric tons each year. [ 43 ] Chrysler Corporation. U.S. automobile manufacturers are seeking better paint-application systems to replace liquid spray-paint systems, which are major sources of VOC emissions. Chrysler Corporation's Newark, New Jersey assembly plant generates more than 83 metric tons of VOCs per year. Chrysler is developing powder coatings that could eventually replace liquid spray-paint systems in automobile manufacturing. Chrysler is installing and testing a full-body powder-paint antichip system [ 44 ] at its Newark facility. [ 45 ] The new system will save 24.3 billion Btu of energy per year by eliminating the old system's incinerator for the VOCs, and an additional 22.2 billion Btu per year by lowering the paint booth air heating requirements. The system virtually eliminates VOCs and nitrogen oxides emissions, and cuts carbon dioxide emissions by 2,951 metric tons annually. The system also uses paint more efficiently, eliminating 95 percent of the sludge waste that had to be landfilled under the old spray-paint system. Chrysler will save nearly $4 million per year from reduced material use, energy consumption, and waste disposal. This savings, combined with the superior performance of the powder-painted surfaces, could enhance the competitiveness of U.S. automotive manufacturers. [ 46 ] 23.

Energy-Efficiency Investments Can Improve Competitiveness The relatively low industrial energy prices in the United States are considered key competitive advantages in the global marketplace. However, these low prices also mean that U.S. manufacturers may place less importance on energy efficiency than do their competitors in Europe and Japan. This difference is illustrated in the selling prices of many products; one expert estimates that 5 percent of the difference in price between similar Japanese and American products is the result of more efficient energy use in Japanese plants. [ 47 ] U.S. industry can use energy efficiency to its competitive advantage. The Breyers Company. In New England, public utilities have helped local businesses and industries compete and expand by investing more than $500 million in energy efficiency since 1987. The efficiency expenditures have lowered the energy bills of these companies, and have benefited the utilities by delaying the need to build expensive new generation plants. [ 48 ] When the Breyers Company ice cream plant in Framingham, Massachusetts was having difficulty staying competitive, Boston Edison Company, the local utility, helped it install energy-efficiency improvements. The joint investment in energy-efficient refrigeration, heat-recovery systems, motors, and lighting reduced the plant's electricity use by 12.5 million kilowatt-hours (enough to power 2,000 homes) while simultaneously improving product quality and adding new jobs. [ 49 ] The electricity savings cut annual carbon dioxide emissions by more than 8,275 metric tons. [ 50 ] Big Bear Stores . The Big Bear Stores grocery chain in Ohio and West Virginia has aggressively cut electricity bills by installing computer-controlled refrigeration and freezer display cases, lighting, and ventilation systems. Waste heat from the refrigeration units helps heat both the stores and hot water. Freezers, refrigerated display cases, and air-conditioning systems all use high-efficiency motors and compressors. Company-wide, electrical costs per square foot have decreased by approximately 15 percent, saving the company $1 million per year and helping it price its foods more competitively. [ 51 ] Mar-Jac, Inc. Mar-Jac, Inc. is a poultry processor in Gainesville, Georgia that employs 550 people. Processing poultry requires water heated to between 120° and 130° F. The company used three natural gas-fired boilers to supply steam to the heat exchangers that heated the water. The boilers' low efficiency resulted in high energy costs, and maintenance was difficult and expensive. [ 52 ] In 1988, the plant manager replaced the three steam boilers with two new water heaters capable of supplying water at up to 180° F, and installed a new direct-fired gas water heater as well. Both process improvements resulted in substantial energy savings. The new system cost $210,000, but reduced gas consumption by 40 percent - resulting in a payback of less than 3 years. The process manufacturing investments improved safety, reduced the possibility of blowing a boiler, and lowered maintenance costs while cutting emissions. [ 53 ] The DOE's EADC/IAC conducts free energy audits at small- and medium-sized manufacturing plants around the country. These audits have resulted in an estimated energy savings of $517 million (94 trillion Btu), at a total cost to taxpayers of $27 million. EADC/IAC has issued energy-saving recommendations for various businesses, including poultry processors. By installing even the six most recommended efficiency improvements, each poultry processor would spend an average of $7,912 while saving $13,495 annually in reduced energy bills - and cutting carbon dioxide emissions each year by 304 metric tons. [ 54 ] Chris Erhart Foundry and Machine Company. Erhart Foundry in Cincinnati, Ohio produces iron castings for customers throughout the Midwest. The foundry has been in business for 140 years, but since the 1980s, the plant's effort to improve energy efficiency has been a "constant battle," says Dan Erhart. Energy comprises 15 to 20 percent of total operating costs, and any reduction in consumption goes to improving the company's competitive position in the industry. [ 55 ] In the early 1990s, Erhart called in Cincinnati Gas Electric (CG&E) for an energy audit. Based on CG&E recommendations, Erhart replaced the foundry's 500 incandescent fixtures with high pressure sodium fixtures that provided twice as much light while using a third less energy. [ 56 ] Erhart's biggest investment, however, was a change in its foundry process. The company installed a computer controller on its 800-kilowatt induction furnace. Employees had been manually monitoring the furnace temperature, which made it extremely difficult to control demand. The controller is now reducing energy bills by 182 kilowatts per month - a 23 percent reduction - which saves $22,000 a year. The computer, which allows operation during off-peak hours and reduces the load during on-peak hours, paid for itself in six months. The energy savings shave 4 percent off Erhart's operating costs - a boon to productivity and competitiveness. [ 57 ] 47. In many Japanese plants, every employee is expected to minimize energy usage.

Energy-Efficiency Investments Can Create Jobs Energy efficiency cuts costs, increases productivity, and reduces pollution - while saving and often creating jobs. Implementing efficiency measures that are cost effective on a life-cycle basis leads to more jobs, higher personal incomes, and a higher GDP for the United States. [ 58 ] A number of case studies demonstrate how companies have benefited economically - and in some cases have even been turned around, by investing in energy efficiency. Southwire Company . The Southwire Company, headquartered at Carrollton, Georgia, is a large manufacturer of copper rod, cable and wire. Southwire had soaring energy costs in the early 1980s, when its energy bills reached 20 percent of overhead and were rising. Profit margins were dropping, and the company had to lay off 1,000 of its 4,000 workers. [ 59 ] Between 1981 and 1988, however, a comprehensive efficiency program saved Southwire $40 million in energy costs. Efficiency measures included a particularly successful motor efficiency program. The program focused on the life-cycle costs of motors, comparing the costs of rewinding older motors with the costs of buying new, high-efficiency motors. Southwire purchased high-efficiency motors whenever the net present value of the energy savings over five years exceeded the financing costs. To minimize downtime, the company then stocked the motors in preparation for their replacement. In addition, plant operators shut off many motors during peak demand times to avoid excess energy costs. The $40 million in energy savings cut overhead from 20 to 13 percent and turned Southwire into a profitable company. [ 60 ] The Kelly Company . As a leading manufacturer of injection molded and structural foam parts for the paint and hardware industries, The Kelly Company of Clinton, Massachusetts was a productive and profitable player in its industry for many years. But in the mid-1980s, the national recession and international competition brought the manufacturer to the brink of financial disaster and jeopardized the livelihoods of its 65 employees. [ 61 ] Seeking to cut costs without cutting jobs, the company focused on reducing electricity costs, its third largest operating expense. With the assistance of Massachusetts Electric Company and the Massachusetts Industrial Services Program, Kelly installed variable-speed drives on injection molding machines, process cooling system improvements that included new high-efficiency pumps, and premium efficient grinders to reuse waste material generated by the injection molding machines. Kelly's electricity costs dropped 20 percent, saving $83,000 per year and enabling the company to expand product lines and add personnel. The efficiency improvements cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 7 metric tons and carbon dioxide emissions by 659 metric tons annually. [ 62 ] Crane Valves. In the face of strong foreign competition undercutting the foundry business, Crane Valves of Washington, Iowa needed to cut manufacturing costs to save jobs. Assisted by the Metal Casting Center at the University of Northern Iowa, Crane-Washington implemented a "total assessment audit" of its plant. The audit brought in six public- and private-sector organizations with expertise in energy efficiency, productivity improvement, and waste reduction. The audit catalyzed a total quality management program that delineated a host of capital and non-capital improvement initiatives - all of which focused on energy-use efficiencies, productivity improvements, and process management. The audit assessed energy use in all process cycles, including the materials, equipment, and tooling cycles of foundry operations. With funding from the Iowa Energy Center in Ames, Crane-Washington launched a demonstration project at its facility that could serve as a model for the entire foundry industry. The results are striking: kilowatt-hours per ton of materials were slashed by 29 percent; scrap was cut by 39 percent; error rates dropped by 28 percent; and the number of labor-hours per ton of poured materials fell 27 percent. All this while productivity soared: the average tons per day of materials poured increased an astounding 78 percent, while the number of good molds poured daily increased 42 percent. To top it off, new jobs increased by 30 percent from November 1993 through October 1994. [ 63 ] Dow Chemical. Often the best efficiency investments begin with employee suggestions, which, when implemented systematically, can bolster productivity and expand the company, creating jobs. Dow Chemical's Louisiana Division, whose 2,400 employees in more than 20 plants produce chemicals like propylene, began a yearly contest in 1982 to find energy-saving projects that paid for themselves in one year (a return on investment of more than 100 percent) and that required a capital investment of less than $200,000. [ 64 ] The first year, the program had 27 winning projects that required a total capital investment of $1.7 million with an average return on investment of 173 percent. Dow's energy manager, Kenneth Nelson, reported that after the first 27 projects "many people felt there couldn't be others with such high returns." The skeptics were wrong. The 1983 contest had 32 winners. The projects they suggested required a total capital investment of $2.2 million and provided a 340 percent return on investment - producing savings for the company of $7.5 million in the first year and every year after that. [ 65 ] The yearly contest was so successful that Dow eliminated the $200,000 limit and included savings from all kinds of waste reduction, not just energy. Winning suggestions included more efficient pumps and installation of heat exchangers to salvage waste heat. Others involved sophisticated process redesign. An ethic of "continuous process improvement" began to pervade the company. Employees received engraved plaques in a formal awards ceremony, and in addition, were often rewarded by their supervisors through job performance raises. For 575 projects throughout the 1980s, the average return was 204 percent (audited). After ten years and nearly 700 projects, the 1992 contest had 109 winning projects with an average return of 305 percent, and the 1993 contest had 140 projects with an average return of 298 percent. [ 66 ] 58. The positive employment and income results of efficiency investments are due primarily to the relatively low number of jobs in the energy sectors (coal, oil, and gas extraction, fuel refining, and electric and gas utilities) compared to the economy as a whole. Conserving energy reduces the energy bills paid by consumers and businesses, thereby enabling greater purchases of non-energy goods, equipment, and services. The result is a shift of economic activity away from energy supply industries and towards sectors of the economy that employ more workers per dollar received. Less than 10 percent of the net jobs created are associated with direct investment in efficiency measures while more than 90 percent are associated with re-spending energy bill savings. The largest absolute increase in jobs is in the construction, retail trade and services industries, as these sectors install energy-efficiency measures and gain new business orders from the re-spending of energy bill savings. Productivity improvements in the oil and gas extraction industries are likely to lead to a reduction of 200,000 jobs in this sector by 2010. Individual companies in the fossil-fuel sector may be able to reduce adverse jobs impacts by diversifying into the energy efficiency and renewable energy fields.

Conclusion The best industrial efficiency programs start with employee suggestions, which subsequently must be supported by determined management and by federal, local, or utility financing and technical support. Communicating to plant staff members that energy efficiency is a priority and encouraging them to identify energy-saving opportunities taps the know-how of those closest to the manufacturing process - which can have extraordinary results. A key lesson from these industrial case studies is that process manufacturing efficiency improvements require a pervasive ethic of constant feedback from all members of a business. Efficiency improvements are rarely one-shot investments. Continuous improvement in energy efficiency and waste reduction can boost productivity and competitiveness - while empowering employees. It takes people - not just technology - to save energy, expand a business, and improve the environment at the same time.

Utility Efficiency Has Improved Markedly During the past two decades, the utility sector has made significant progress in improving electric energy efficiency. Between 1960 and 1973, U.S. electricity use grew at an average rate of 7.3 percent per year, almost double the 4 percent growth per year in GDP. [ 70 ] Between 1973 and 1986, however, growth in electricity use fell to 2.4 percent per year. Some 26.6 quads of anticipated energy usage per year never materialized, mostly due to improved energy efficiency. [ 71 ] Greater efficiency was caused by a combination of factors, including structural changes in the U.S. economy (including the shift from manufacturing to services), changes in electricity and fossil-fuel prices, development and commercialization of new energy-efficient products and services, government energy-efficiency programs, and utility demand-side management (DSM) programs.

DSM programs improve the efficiency with which customers use electricity, and also affect the timing of that use (e.g., by shifting it away from high-cost, peak times). Utilities run such programs for two primary reasons. One is to improve customer service. The second is to acquire resources that, just like power plants, can meet customer energy-service needs. DSM programs are often less expensive and environmentally cleaner than power plants.

Integrated Resource Planning Has Been a Demonstrated Success During the past five years, federal, state, and public utility commission regulators have adopted regulations that successfully promote energy efficiency and renewables development. Among these successes has been adoption of a regulatory model known as "integrated resource planning" (IRP), or least-cost energy planning. Initially mandated in California in 1990, IRP involves ranking all energy sources, including improvements in energy efficiency, by cost. An energy-efficiency improvement must be implemented first - before the acquisition of new generating capacity - if the improvement costs less per kilowatt-hour avoided than new supply would cost. Although most states now claim to have adopted IRP procedures to some degree, only 10 have a regulatory framework that genuinely ensures that DSM can compete on an equal footing with supply options.

Regional Demand-Side Management Programs Have Been Successful Nationwide In response to IRP policies, billions of utility dollars have been diverted away from building new generation capacity. The money instead has gone into DSM programs to reduce demand. From 1990 to 1994, utility investments in DSM programs and energy efficiency tripled to $3 billion per year. These investments reduced national generation 2 percent per year, while consumers saved nearly $4 billion annually on their utility bills. A 1993 EPRI survey of most U.S. DSM programs [ 74 ] found that the programs save electricity at an average cost of just 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour. [ 75 ] Utility spending on DSM programs increased dramatically between 1989 and 1993, growing from 0.5 to 1.5 percent of utility operating revenues. In 1993, U.S. electric utilities spent $2.8 billion on DSM programs. [ 76 ] These expenditures paid substantial benefits, including electricity reductions in 1993 of 44,000 gigawatt-hours and peak demand reductions of 40,000 megawatts. These reductions are equivalent to 1.6 percent of annual electricity sales and 6.8 percent of summer peak demand, and reduced U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 27.8 million metric tons. [ 77 ] In 1994, utility DSM programs cut potential summer peak demand by 7 percent and annual electricity use by 2 percent nationwide. Despite current uncertainties in utility markets due to industry restructuring, DSM programs are expected to expand, and could reduce national electricity demand by 3 percent annually by the year 2000. This continued expansion could reduce electricity generation by 71,000 gigawatt-hours in the year 2000, preventing 44.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. [ 78 ] Over the last decade of incorporating IRP into utility planning, literally hundreds of utility DSM programs have emerged. Utilities used DSM to retain customers, to increase market share, and to enhance profitability by improving customer services. DSM programs will become even more important in a restructured utility industry, as still-regulated distribution companies will select the low-cost option for providing energy needs. The following success stories, categorized by region, demonstrate the financial savings - and substantial environmental and health benefits - of utility efficiency programs. 74.

California DSM Successes DSM programs in California provided net life-cycle benefits of $2.2 billion during the period 1990 to 1994. [ 79 ] In 1994, the average cost of saved kilowatt-hours was less than two cents per kilowatt-hour. [ 80 ] By 1994, California DSM programs were saving 1 percent of system consumption each year - and companies and residences were not even touching the limits of their efficiency capacity. [ 81 ] Chart 6: Costs and Savings California DSM Programs Pacific Gas and Electric. Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), California's largest utility, was one of the first in the country to implement utility efficiency programs. PG&E's Direct Assistance programs, over their ten-year history, have weatherized more than 600,000 low-income homes with attic insulation, weather stripping, shower heads, caulking, water heater blankets, and duct wraps, at a total program cost of $245 million. [ 82 ] In addition, since 1987, the program has replaced more than 90,000 appliances - primarily refrigerators that exceed federal appliance efficiency standards, but also furnaces, evaporative coolers, and water heaters - with energy-efficient models at no charge to low-income customers. It also installed more than 70,000 compact fluorescent lamps. In 1992, the programs saved 16,283 megawatt-hours of electricity, which prevented 5,585 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Over their life-cycle, however, the efficiency installations from 1987 through 1992 saved 1,901 gigawatt-hours, resulting in a cumulative reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 652,000 metric tons. [ 83 ] PG&E's Model Energy Communities Pilot Project targeted the Antioch/Brentwood area northeast of Oakland, California, which was slated for construction of a new substation to handle a spike in demand when homeowners concurrently switched on air conditioners at the end of summer workdays. PG&E installed innovative demand-side management technologies that targeted this specific community, including compact fluorescent bulbs, low-flow shower heads, shell improvements, duct repair, insulation, sun screens, and air-conditioner tune-ups. PG&E also downsized air-conditioner units to better fit room conditions. [ 84 ] At a cost of $8.9 million, PG&E saved 4,322 megawatt-hours of electricity between 1991 and 1993, which prevented 1,482 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Over the life-cycle of the energy saving installations, 86.4 gigawatt-hours are expected to be saved, corresponding to a cumulative carbon dioxide reduction of nearly 30,000 metric tons. [ 85 ] Southern California Edison. Southern California Edison (SCE) created one of the more innovative lighting DSM programs when it awarded compact fluorescent lamp manufacturers wholesale rebates of $5 per unit, creating a "downstream" price reduction at the retail level. Because retailers traditionally double or treble their wholesale costs, customer rebates reached as high as $15 with each $5-per-bulb manufacturer's rebate. The wholesale rebates spurred manufacturer participation, while bulk rebates allowed SCE to stipulate performance specifications during manufacturing, including minimum efficiency requirements for each bulb. SCE achieved high participation by both residential and commercial consumers, while transforming the market away from old, inefficient incandescent lighting. [ 86 ] Residences saved 101,057 megawatt-hours of electricity annually because of the program, a reduction in demand that cut carbon dioxide emissions by 34,650 metric tons each year. Carbon dioxide reductions over the life-cycle of the new bulbs will total 225,300 metric tons. Commercial customers saved 118,979 megawatt-hours per year, with annual carbon dioxide reductions of 40,800 metric tons and life-cycle reductions of 265,250 metric tons. [ 87 ] The combined cost of the residential and commercial programs from 1992 through 1994 was $14,425,429. Sacramento Municipal Utility District. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) is a case study of an impressive utility turnaround. On the heels of a voter referendum to shut down its Rancho Seco nuclear power plant in the late 1980s, SMUD closed the plant and ushered in a new era at the utility. SMUD set out to secure 800 megawatts from DSM programs and 400 megawatts from renewable energy sources. Under the leadership of David Freeman, SMUD boosted its DSM budget from $3.8 million to $38 million in 1991. By 1993, SMUD's Energy-Efficient Refrigerators program, for example, had resulted in purchases of more than 70,000 energy-efficient refrigerators while 63,000 old, inefficient refrigerators were collected and recycled. SMUD's Direct Investment Program has provided electric-heat customers with almost 15,000 energy-efficiency measures for free. Participants in the Residential Peak Corps Program, SMUD's leading load-management program, have installed 96,130 air-conditioning cyclers. Participants in the Shade Tree Program have planted 109,000 trees, and 1,200 solar water heaters have been installed through the Solar Domestic Water Heater Program, which SMUD has expanded to promote rooftop solar photovoltaics. Equally impressive results have accrued from SMUD's commercial and industrial retrofit programs. [ 88 ] These programs saved, in 1993, 96.4 gigawatt-hours of electricity - which avoided 33,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in that year. During the life-cycle of SMUD's DSM and renewable-energy programs, including all efficiency installations made between 1978 and 1993, 4,039 gigawatt-hours will be saved, including 309 megawatts of capacity savings, at a total cost of $196 million. That represents a reduction of 1.38 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. [ 89 ] SMUD helped one of its industrial customers, Blue Diamond Almonds, become significantly more energy efficient. Blue Diamond installed energy-efficient lighting in its warehouses and offices, saving $52,000 annually. Heating equipment upgrades added another $18,000 in annual energy savings. A similar SMUD-supported energy-efficiency program for Intel, the large semi-conductor manufacturer, convinced the company to expand its operations in Sacramento, adding 250 jobs. [ 90 ] California Energy Commission. The California Energy Commission (CEC) seeks to cut the energy demand of local government facilities through its "Energy Partnership Program," which provides technical and financial assistance for energy upgrades at city and county facilities throughout California. The program has supplied technical assistance to existing public facilities, providing efficiency upgrades (compact fluorescent lamps, ballasts, occupancy sensors, thermostat controls, energy management systems, variable frequency drives, HVAC improvements) to city halls, administration buildings, libraries, fire and police departments, jails, hospitals, and wastewater treatment plants. CEC facilitates project financing through its own revolving loan fund, federal funds, utility assistance, energy service companies, or other outside funding sources. [ 91 ] The Energy Partnership Program has been a dramatic success, saving 15.7 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 1992 at a cost of $6.5 million, while preventing 5,385 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Cumulative savings include 165.9 gigawatt-hours from upgrades installed from 1989 through 1993, avoiding 56,900 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions at a total cost of $17.3 million. [ 92 ] 79.

Pacific Northwest DSM Successes In 1995, the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana) was enjoying nearly 900 average megawatts of electricity savings as a result of DSM efforts - annual savings equivalent to the power output of four good-sized gas-fired combustion turbines. Conserved energy totaled over 50,000 gigawatt-hours in 1995 at an average cost of 2 to 2-1/2 cents per kilowatt-hour - well below the next most costly resource alternative available. These DSM programs were saving retail consumers $2 billion per year while avoiding carbon dioxide emissions of approximately 5.35 million metric tons annually. [ 93 ] Portland Energy Office. In 1993, Portland, Oregon became the first U.S. city to adopt a local carbon dioxide reduction strategy, committing to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent below 1988 baselines by the year 2010. This target is a greater reduction than the United States committed to under the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change. [ 94 ] Portland's "Multifamily Energy Savings" program, initiated in 1987, exemplifies the city's long-standing commitment to energy efficiency. It is intended to target the split incentive between landlord and tenants - where tenants typically pay utility bills, leaving landlords little incentive to make efficiency improvements. The program encourages retrofits by marketing existing efficiency services - such as utility audits, rebates and loans, plus state tax credits - to building owners. By promoting a diverse package of financial incentives, the program has made building owners in Portland surprisingly receptive to investing in energy-efficiency measures like windows, insulation, common area lighting, water heaters, air sealing, and heating system improvements. To date, the program has weatherized more than 11,050 apartment units, producing savings of approximately 1,200 kilowatt-hours annually per unit. The highly successful program saved 1,412 megawatt-hours (avoiding 151 metric tons of carbon dioxide) in 1993 alone, and should save 375,570 megawatt-hours over the projected life-cycle of the improvements (avoiding 40,186 metric tons of carbon dioxide). It achieved these savings at a cost of less than 1 cent per kilowatt-hour saved. [ 95 ] Bonneville Power Administration . The city of Ashland, Oregon developed one of America's premier resource conservation initiatives in a small community. The city's Conservation Division worked with the Bonneville Power Administration - the region's wholesale power supplier - to implement a range of energy-efficiency measures, for both new construction and retrofits, that conserve electricity, gas and water, and reduce waste. The measures include weatherization, "Good Cents" new homes, showerheads, and composting. More than half the savings have been generated in the residential sector, lowering customers' bills and improving occupants' comfort. Ashland has also addressed the land-use implications of development, and has implemented a comprehensive set of land-use ordinances to minimize negative aspects of development. For example, the city rewards resource efficiency in new developments by issuing "conservation bonuses" that allow developers to build more units than normal, increasing density while easing travel, sprawl, and demands on gasoline and air quality. Ashland's comprehensive resource-efficiency approach has created nearly 10,000 megawatt-hours in annual savings while cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 1,070 metric tons annually. Cumulative savings from 1980 through 1994 come to 66,000 megawatt-hours of electricity and 7,062 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Over the life-cycle of the efficiency installations, more 26,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide will be saved. [ 96 ] Bonneville's "WaterWise" program is an agricultural initiative that involves a comprehensive effort to conserve irrigation water and energy while improving crop yields, thanks to the precision application of water. WaterWise provides technical, financial and informational services to farmers east of the Cascade Mountains in Washington and Oregon. The program focuses on irrigation system testing and design work, hardware retrofits (including low pressure, mainline, and pump modification equipment), and irrigation management, and it provides farmers with detailed information on weather patterns and evapotranspiration rates for optimal crop watering. For an investment of $24.5 million, Bonneville has saved 506.3 gigawatt-hours of electricity over the decade 1983 through 1993 - which corresponds to a carbon dioxide emissions savings of more than 61,250 metric tons. Over the life-cycle of the improvements installed during that decade, 1,419 gigawatt-hours will be saved, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 171,700 metric tons. [ 97 ] Bonneville Power administered an Aluminum Smelter Conservation/ Modernization program in the late 1980s that was responsible for enormous energy savings. The ten primary smelters in Bonneville's service territory consume one-third of all Bonneville power - 15 percent of all electricity used in the Northwest (sold by Bonneville and other utilities). Aluminum production is a highly electricity-intensive industry, with electricity purchases comprising roughly 25 percent of operating costs. The objective of the Conservation/ Modernization program was to encourage smelters to improve the efficiency of their industrial processes, both to remain competitive and to free up electric supply for other Northwest uses. Bonneville paid the smelters incentive payments for baseline efficiency improvements equal to half a cent per kilowatt-hour saved over a 10-year period, which is about one-third of the cost of efficiency improvements. The program has achieved electricity savings of 4.1 percent of total industrial sales - equal to 1,057.8 gigawatt-hours saved per year, and 225,311 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions reduced annually. [ 98 ] Puget Sound Power & Light. Puget Power's "Commercial and Industrial Electricity Conservation Service," begun in late 1978, was one of the first DSM programs to be offered to the commercial sector. Puget's philosophy has been to provide valuable customer services while controlling load growth. Puget's staff includes a highly-trained cadre of engineers with the technical expertise necessary to analyze commercial and industrial facilities. Their analyses have taken a whole-facility, customized approach; they look at all facets of electricity use and assess efficiency upgrades, including process systems, the building envelope, space conditioning, lighting applications, and water heating improvements. Puget uses a total resource cost basis for measuring cost effectiveness, and pays for upgrades based on the utility's avoided cost, a value that reflects the full life-cycle of each improvement. Typical incentive payments equal 60 to 80 percent of customers' total installation costs - a level that significantly exceeds most utility rebate programs. Puget generally ends up paying out about half its avoided cost. For instance, in 1992 the program cost an average of 3.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, while its avoided cost for measures with an average life-cycle of 15 years was 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Efficiency improvements installed during 1992 saved 122 gigawatt-hours in that year (16,958 metric tons of carbon dioxide saved) at a cost of $25.5 million, with life-cycle energy savings from those improvements totaling 1,823 gigawatt-hours, which should cut carbon dioxide emissions by 253,397 metric tons. Since the program began, the life-cycle savings of improvements installed between 1978 and 1992 are 6,356 gigawatt-hours at a total cost of $101.25 million, avoiding 883,484 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. [ 99 ] Seattle City Light. Seattle City Light, one of the nation's largest municipal utilities, reinforces the notion that utilities can effectively offer DSM services in regions characterized by low power rates. In 1993, Seattle City Light budgeted a precedent-setting 9.1 percent of gross revenues for DSM. The utility's early emphasis on energy efficiency, however, came only after a lawsuit overturned the utility's planned investment in the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS), a proposed series of nuclear plants. The WPPSS decision changed the utility's course, prodding it to become one of the nation's leaders in energy efficiency. Seattle City Light's comprehensive DSM programs cover the residential, commercial and industrial sectors, and have included weatherization, lighting, energy-efficient water heaters, and water efficiency measures, as well as industrial and commercial efficiency improvements for motors and HVAC systems. This success has been supported by the Bonneville Power Administration, which over time has funded nearly one-quarter of Seattle City Light's DSM expenditures. In 1993, efficiency improvements installed that year cut energy demand by 52,629 megawatt-hours (producing a carbon dioxide reduction of 7,315 metric tons), which will save 885,294 megawatt-hours over the life-cycle of those improvements (reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 123,055 metric tons). Cumulatively, since the DSM programs began in 1978, Seattle City Light efficiency programs have saved 2,454,256 megawatt-hours (341,141 metric tons of carbon dioxide). Over the life-cycle of the installations, 7,380,743 megawatt-hours will be saved - for a total life-cycle carbon dioxide reduction of 1,025,923 metric tons. [ 100 ] 93. Northwest Power Planning Council data, November 9, 1995.

New England DSM Successes In 1990, New England Electric System earned $8.3 million, a 12 percent return, on DSM programs. By 1991, New England utilities' DSM expenditures had increased to about $300 million annually, with the majority of those expenditures targeted for energy efficiency rather than load management. These investments have resulted in significant economic, environmental, and energy-security benefits. For example, in 1991, utility DSM investments in New England: were saving 2,169 gigawatt-hours of energy annually, enough to heat and power the New Haven metropolitan area; produced energy-efficiency improvements that will lower net electric bills by approximately $250 million over their life cycle; saved the equivalent of 3.7 million barrels of oil; avoided emissions of 11,800 metric tons of sulfur dioxide; avoided emissions of 5,000 metric tons of nitrogen oxides; and, avoided emissions of 1.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. [ 101 ] Three of the largest utilities in Massachusetts have worked collaboratively with environmental and consumer groups to design and implement DSM programs. From 1990 through 1993, investments in DSM by these utilities grew, such that by 1993, DSM outlays reached 5 percent of annual utility retail revenues. During that four-year period, investments totaled $540 million, including both utility and participant costs, for measures that produced energy savings at an average life-cycle cost of 3.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. The life-cycle savings total 14,091 gigawatt-hours and provide 267 megawatts of summer peak reductions. Carbon dioxide reductions over the life cycle of the measures total 9.3 million metric tons. [ 102 ] In 1994, the DSM programs of these three utilities accounted for about 3 percent of customer energy requirements. The net value of customer savings exceeded $843 million, including environmental benefits ($398 million if environmental externalities are excluded). The energy-efficiency investments have helped to defer investments in additional capacity. [ 103 ] Chart 7: Benefits of New England DSM Programs New England Electric System. In 1987, New England Electric System, which comprises three utilities - Massachusetts Electric Company, Narragansett Electric, and Granite State Electric - initiated its "Design 2000" program, which focuses on implementing efficiency upgrades at the time customers install new electrical equipment during the normal course of business. These "time dependent" opportunities occur during new construction, renovation, and when failed equipment is replaced. Design 2000 pays essentially all out-of-pocket expenses associated with the efficiency upgrades, which include lighting, motors and drives, HVAC upgrades, food-service and industrial-process improvements, and custom measures that employ emerging technologies - and then provides the participant with lower electricity bills. Energy savings from 1993 efficiency upgrades alone were 28,972 megawatt-hours (saving 15,935 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions), while the life-cycle savings of the measures installed in that year will be 416,276 megawatt-hours (a carbon dioxide emissions reduction of 228,952 metric tons). Cumulatively since 1989, 66,220 megawatt-hours have been saved (preventing 36,421 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions), while the life-cycle energy savings of upgrades to date will be 923,374 megawatt-hours (avoiding carbon dioxide emissions of 530,017 metric tons). The Design 2000 program has saved New England Electric 14.16 megawatts of new capacity at a total, cumulative program cost of $21.3 million. [ 104 ] Burlington Electric Department. Burlington has served the residents of Burlington, Vermont with a mix of electricity and energy-efficiency services since the late 1970s. At that time, it responded to the oil shocks by introducing its first energy-efficiency programs. More recently, local concerns over power purchases from Hydro-Quebec and its controversial James Bay development prompted Burlington voters to pass an $11 million bond issue to catalyze DSM programs. The utility introduced a "Smartlight" leasing program for compact fluorescent lamps, and promoted a program to convert electric resistance heating to other fuels in order to reduce winter peak load. Six other programs offer customers a comprehensive package of DSM options. Cumulative energy savings from 1991 through 1993 totaled 33,944 megawatt-hours (preventing 2,444 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions), and over the life cycle of these installations will save 290,183 megawatt-hours (preventing 20,893 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions).

New York DSM Successes DSM programs in New York provided net life-cycle energy savings to customers of $1.4 billion during the period 1990 to 1994. [ 106 ] Consolidated Edison. Consolidated Edison's "Commercial & Industrial Efficient Lighting Incentives Program" provides commercial and industrial customers with lighting rebates of 25 cents per watt of lighting load removed for fluorescent ballast upgrades. Lighting control devices are rebated at 10 cents per watt of connected lighting load. Under the Shared Energy Savings financing approach, Con Edison provides up-front installation costs with customer repayment derived from energy savings over a payback period of up to five years. Under this approach, Con Edison recovers its costs while customers receive the benefits of an immediate positive cash flow from energy savings without any capital outlay requirements. From 1990 through 1994, the program achieved approximately 1,251 gigawatt-hours of annualized energy savings and 311 megawatts of system peak reductions, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 587,970 metric tons. [ 107 ] Con Edison's "Commercial & Industrial High Efficiency Motor Incentive Program" encourages commercial and industrial customers to install high-efficiency electric motors and variable frequency drives (VFDs). Con Edison pays $10 per horsepower for motors meeting the utility's minimum efficiency standards, which fully offsets the differential equipment cost incurred by customers. The current incentive level for VFDs is either $50 or $90 per horsepower depending upon the pump and fan HVAC application. Here again, a Shared Energy Savings approach is offered as an alternative to rebates. From 1990 through 1994, this successful program saved approximately 137 gigawatt-hours in annualized energy and reduced the system peak by approximately 5 megawatts, and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 64,390 metric tons. Con Edison's "Dealer Incentive Programs" are point-of-purchase incentive programs for retail businesses that sell energy-efficient appliances and equipment. Con Edison encourages retail salespeople and their managers to sell high-efficiency units, such as air conditioners and refrigerators, by awarding credits which are redeemable for merchandise or travel. No direct incentives are offered to customers. The program is transforming the appliance and equipment market: appliance dealers have substantially increased their stock of highly-efficient appliances. From 1990 through 1994, this and other of Con Edison's residential DSM programs have saved approximately 60 gigawatt-hours in annualized energy and reduced the system peak by approximately 28 megawatts, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 28,200 metric tons. Other Con Edison DSM programs include the "Commercial & Industrial High-Efficiency Electric Space Conditioning Incentive Program," "Steam Air-Conditioning Program," "Commercial & Industrial Customized Energy-Efficiency Program," "Curtailable Electric Service Program," "Residential Compact Fluorescent Program," and "Residential Submetering Program." Con Edison's DSM programs have saved over 1,800 gigawatt-hours on an annualized basis during the 1990-1994 period, with associated peak demand savings of about 585 megawatts. The programs have avoided 846,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. [ 108 ] 106.

Wisconsin DSM Successes Wisconsin utilities achieved a cumulative reduction in energy demand from 1988 to 1994 of 2,959 gigawatt-hours, which avoided 1.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. In 1994 alone, Wisconsin's DSM programs saved 549 gigawatts, which cut carbon dioxide emissions in that year by 334,000 metric tons. Such savings are projected to continue, albeit at a declining rate, primarily due to uncertainties surrounding utility industry restructuring. Savings in 1995 are projected to be 451 gigawatt-hours, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 274,000 metric tons. Cumulatively from 1995 through 2013, projections show that Wisconsin DSM programs could reduce electricity usage by 5,152 gigawatt-hours, which could prevent more than 3.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. [ 109 ] Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Electric assists in providing energy-efficient, affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families. Through several innovative grant and loan programs, Wisconsin Electric seeks to instill an energy-efficiency ethic among low-income housing providers, community- based service agencies, and low-income energy customers. Projects have included installing energy-efficient fluorescent lights and refrigerators in a newly renovated emergency shelter in Milwaukee, in 13 low-income apartments in a recently converted building that had been a vacant elementary school, and in 18 transitional housing units in a joint project with the Milwaukee YWCA. The lighting retrofit saves the YWCA more than 15,000 kilowatts annually, and prevents more than 9 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. Wisconsin Electric also installed electric energy-efficiency measures in Goodwill Industries facilities that annually save an estimated $33,000 in electric bills. Another project teamed Wisconsin Electric with the Milwaukee Housing Authority to upgrade the electrical efficiency of 527 public housing units. Wisconsin Electric programs target low-income customers who do not have the financial resources to invest in energy conservation measures. Through these programs, Wisconsin Electric has cut energy demand by more than 4.4 million kilo-watt hours - preventing some 2,680 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. [ 110 ] Madison Gas and Electric. A small, investor-owned utility that sells both electricity and gas, Madison Gas and Electric (MGE) has been a pioneer in DSM programs. A 1991 DOE study found MGE to be one of nine leading utilities nationally in the delivery of rebate programs. Through its "Residential Lighting Program," MGE has been able to shift the Madison market away from incandescent lighting and into a reliable market for high-efficiency products, achieving maximum customer and utility energy savings at the least cost. For instance, in 1990 there were only four retailers in MGE service territory selling six models of compact fluorescent lamps. Now there are 62 retailers (out of 100 total retailers) selling a total of 63 models of compact fluorescents. MGE distributes rebate coupons for $5 or $10 off eligible lighting measures, and $15 or $30 off other measures, to both end-use customers and to retail stores. MGE offers to pay 50 percent of retailer costs for cooperative energy-efficient lighting advertising. MGE provides lists of retailers stocking compact fluorescents to its customers, and assists with in-store displays. Sales have skyrocketed so much that MGE has been able to slowly phase-out rebates and move toward consumer education to continue high sales volumes. Cumulative energy savings since 1990 are 23,799 megawatt-hours, saving 738 kilowatts of capacity, and avoiding 14,494 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions at a program cost of $1.5 million.

Federal Initiatives Continue to Spur Efficiency Successes Federal and state support for efficiency programs has been critical to the success of programs nationwide. According to the Congressional Research Service, the federal government has spent a total of $5.7 billion on energy-efficiency research and development since 1973. Technologies advanced by these efforts have saved American homeowners and businesses $226 billion, and will save billions more over the life cycle of the efficiency improvements. [ 112 ] Several of the federal program success stories are reviewed below. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Energy "Climate Wise" Program. Administered jointly by the EPA and DOE, the Climate Wise program is a voluntary program that works with businesses (with a focus on manufacturing firms) to install cost-effective energy efficiency and pollution prevention strategies. Climate Wise participants currently represent almost 4 percent of U.S. industrial energy use. By joining Climate Wise, businesses agree to initiate, expand, or accelerate a set of cost-effective measures to improve efficiency, including (1) improving equipment and manufacturing process efficiencies, (2) utilizing fuel switching and improved management practices, (3) integrating efficiency into new product design and manufacturing, and (4) participation in other federal voluntary programs, such as Green Lights (to install efficient lighting), Motor Challenge (to improve motor efficiencies), Waste Wi$e (to integrate waste reduction strategies), and NICE3 (to demonstrate energy-efficient, pollution-preventing technologies). Companies that have initiated Climate Wise programs have achieved significant economic and environmental benefits. By the year 2000, current Climate Wise companies expect to save more than $80 million annually. In return for their participation, Climate Wise companies receive technical assistance from federal agencies and national laboratories, utilities, trade associations, and state and local energy, pollution prevention, and economic development offices. Business-to-business exchange workshops facilitate replication of successful efficiency models. Financial assistance can be arranged through guaranteed loans, low-interest buy-downs from state providers, state tax credits, utility programs, and private-sector financing opportunities. Climate Wise "showcases" projects and businesses that demonstrate significant greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and sponsors media events, awards programs, and other promotional activities. [ 113 ] Dupont, headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, has installed energy-efficiency improvements through the Climate Wise Program that are currently saving $31 million annually. Dupont estimates that further energy-efficiency improvements, including fuel switching, improved steam balance and waste heat reductions, will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 18 million metric tons annually by the year 2000 from 1990 emission levels. [ 114 ] AT&T, in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, is installing efficiency improvements through the Climate Wise program projected to save the company $50 million each year and offset 154,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually by the year 2000. [ 115 ] U.S. Department of Energy "Climate Challenge" Program. The United States was one of 154 nations and the European Community to sign the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. [ 116 ] Domestic implementation of the U.S. commitment - which is to reduce U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 - follows mostly voluntary measures set forth in President Clinton's Climate Change Action Plan. The plan, issued in October 1993, seeks 108 million metric tons of carbon dioxide reductions and calls on electric utilities to provide much of those reductions. [ 117 ] Climate Challenge is the primary element of the plan that directly involves electric utilities. As of March 1995, 79 utilities, representing more than half of U.S. electricity generation, had signed agreements with DOE to participate in Climate Challenge, pledging to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 41 million metric tons by the year 2000. DSM programs account for 18 percent of the reductions planned in Climate Challenge. [ 118 ] Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP). As the world's largest consumer of goods and services, the federal government has a major impact on the marketplace. Energy consumption by the federal government can be reduced substantially through energy-efficiency measures. FEMP coordinates the reduction effort. If all agencies implemented the FEMP requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) and Executive Order 12902, [ 119 ] the agencies would save as much as $400 million annually by 2000 and $1 billion annually by 2005. [ 120 ] FEMP has successfully cut net energy consumption by 20 percent in four federal agencies (Energy, Interior, Justice, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency), and by 10 percent in six more (Agriculture, Defense, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, General Services Administration, and NASA). One of FEMP's strengths is its ability to attract outside resources to aid in the task of saving energy; the program leverages about $3 in savings for every dollar of taxpayer expenditures. [ 121 ] FEMP's efforts have cut the equivalent of 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. [ 122 ] U.S. Department of Energy "Weatherization Assistance Program." The DOE's Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) provides, through state energy offices, grants to community-based service providers for weatherization of low-income family residences, particularly those housing children, the elderly, and disabled family members. Since its inception in 1976, WAP has lowered the energy costs of more than 4.4 million homes, saving the equivalent of 12 million barrels of oil. A typical family served by the program has an annual income of $7,641, and as a result of the program, saved 18.2 percent off their annual heating costs. State and local agencies have leveraged more than $200 million each year to increase the number of assisted homes to about 225,000 annually. In fiscal year 1996, WAP is slated to weatherize an additional 116,145 homes. A 1990 Oak Ridge National Laboratory. study determined that for every dollar invested by DOE in WAP, $1.72 in energy savings results. WAP is also responsible for substantial job creation - 52 jobs for every $1 million of federal funds invested, plus another 22 indirect jobs. [ 123 ] State Energy Conservation Program. The federally-supported State Energy Conservation Program (SECP) provides the resources for many of the services provided by state energy offices. SECP funds are used nationwide for energy training, waste minimization, recycling, home energy rating systems, computerized bus routings to save energy, energy emergency planning, promotion of natural gas vehicles, and many other activities. Many states use SECP funds to provide technical assistance to businesses and industries for reducing their energy consumption, thus reducing associated costs. [ 124 ] Institutional Conservation Program. The Institutional Conservation Program (ICP) provides matching funds and technical assistance to schools and hospitals for energy-saving capital improvements for buildings, equipment, mechanical systems, and controls. Approximately 65,000 buildings - 22 percent of all eligible structures in the country - have had energy improvements through ICP. DOE estimates the cumulative energy cost savings directly attributable to ICP-supported retrofits totaled $4.1 billion through 1991. The ICP typically provides 50 percent of the efficiency investment costs, which are matched either by state or private sources. The average project takes three years to generate a positive cash flow from energy savings, but the annual return on investment is then greater than 33 percent. In addition, the projects generate substantial employment opportunities in the construction industry. These federal energy-efficiency programs make it possible for numerous state and local agencies to provide the technical and financial capacity for residential, commercial and industrial DSM programs. The nationwide efficiency effort has reduced national energy use; if the United States were still consuming energy as intensively as it did in 1973, it would have consumed approximately 116 quads in 1992 instead of the 85.5 quads actually consumed. This reduction in energy use represents a savings in energy costs to the American consumer of approximately $170 billion. [ 125 ] Federal energy-efficiency investments have been critical - and successful. Still greater financial and environmental gains could result from far-sighted national policies that bolster energy-efficiency and DSM budgets. 112.The Results Center, Madison Gas & Electric: Residential Lighting Program Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation: Commercial/Industrial Lighting Rebate, Profile #69 (Aspen, CO: IRT Environment, Inc., 1993).

DSM Programs Could Become an Essential Utility Service in a Restructured Utility Industry The utility industry is in the middle of a major restructuring. Adoption of the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) [ 126 ] has, by deregulating electricity sales among wholesale power buyers, stimulated a competitive wholesale power market while leaving end-user deregulation to the states. [ 127 ] Although the prospect of increased competition is leading some utilities to reduce or eliminate their DSM programs (because these programs often increase electricity prices), on a national level, DSM expenditures by utilities are projected to rise steadily through 1998. [ 128 ] Utilities are likely to refocus their DSM programs on customer service and customer productivity in an effort to retain market share and to gain new customers. [ 129 ] The transition to competitive markets is a window of opportunity for improved energy efficiency and renewables development. The bottom line is that the new industry structure should be more efficient - both economically and in terms of environmental protection. Enhanced competition and environmental protection need not be enemies. Restructuring and re-regulation of the utility industry must incorporate efficiency and renewables development if the United States is to meet its international obligations to reduce the threat of global climate change. 126. Energy Policy Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776 (1992), 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 13201-556 (West Supp. 1994) (EPAct). Title XVI of EPAct, titled "Global Climate Change," set forth a number of targets designed to promote a national least-cost energy strategy, including: (a) A 30 percent increase in energy efficiency by 2010, based upon 1988 levels;(b) A 75 percent increase in the use of renewable energy by 2005, based upon 1988 levels;(c) A reduction in U.S. oil consumption from 40 percent to 35 percent of total energ y use by 2005. 127. There are important reasons to restructure the present vertically-integrated utilities, and spin off generation, transmission, and distribution as separate legal entitiesincluding conflicts of interest among the three functions. For example, the business purpose of generation companies will be to maintain as much market share as possible within current retail service territories. On the other hand, distribution companies in a restructured industry - which provide hook-up services to end users - will seek to influence the generation portfolios that serve many, if not all, of their customers. Distribution companies will be in the energy services business, and will seek to provide a mix of energy resources as demanded by end-use customers. The portfolio provided by distribution companies may well include a mix that maximizes energy efficiency and renewables over more polluting generation sources. If the distribution companies help in any way to select the winners in an increasingly competitive generation marketplace, distribution's ownership of some of the generation competitors is a fundamental conflict of interest. Divestiture is perhaps the only solution. The utility industry would ultimately be comprised of independent electricity distribution, transmission, and generation companies.

Industrial Efficiency Services Will Exemplify Efficiency Programs in a Restructured Industry Implementing effective industrial efficiency programs requires specialized expertise. By far, the greatest energy-efficiency savings are gleaned from changes in the industrial process. Process equipment and manufacturing configurations account for a whopping 90 percent of a typical industrial firm's overall energy use. Many utilities hesitate to invest the time and effort required to locate trained assessors capable of evaluating different types of manufacturing operations. Utilities, however, have a compelling reason to target industry: industrial firms consume roughly 25 percent of all energy consumed in the United States. [ 130 ] A number of case studies demonstrate that utility-industry partnerships can deliver efficiency improvements to the industrial process which save money, increase production, while reducing emissions. By bundling energy-efficiency services with power sales to their largest customers - services that include assistance with process manufacturing improvements that streamline operations and save on utility bills [ 131 ] #139;industries stay put, jobs remain in the local area, and utilities improve their customer relations. Industrial DSM programs will be a key component of utility restructuring. As the following examples attest, successful industrial DSM programs are already underway in several regions. Western Massachusetts Electric. Western Massachusetts Electric serves 810 industrial customers, which make up 27.1 percent of its load. The utility, strapped with high rates due to the cost of bringing a nuclear power plant on line, had, on average in 1992, the third-highest electrical rates in Massachusetts - 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for industrial customers. But Western Massachusetts Electric now works directly with its industrial customers to find solutions to its high rates and to enhance customer competitiveness. [ 132 ] For example, Greenfield Industries, a machine tool manufacturer and a Western Massachusetts Electric customer, had to cut costs and improve competitiveness if it was to remain in business. The utility stepped in with technical advice, and partnered with Greenfield to restructure the production line. The utility first offered to pay for a walk-through assessment of the plant, and subsequently subcontracted out a more detailed energy assessment, and it split the costs with Greenfield. Most of the measures recommended in the assessment were then implemented by the subcontractor, including new vacuum furnaces and monitoring plans. The utility paid an incentive rebate based on an avoided cost of 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The rebate was enough to ensure that Greenfield's expenses for the retrofits paid for themselves from energy savings over just two years. Greenfield spent roughly $2 million on the new furnaces and plant reorganization, which included moving from a production process design that used 300,000 square feet across nine floors to one that utilized only 60,000 square feet an one floor. As a result of the improvements, Greenfield's production has risen 25 percent, market share has expanded, product quality has improved, and scrap rates have declined sharply. The firm estimates that 90 percent of its improved outlook is due to the process efficiency improvements - made possible by Western Massachusetts Electric. Greenfield's annual energy costs have fallen from $1 million to less than $400,000. The two new vacuum furnaces alone cut electricity consumption by 82 percent; the old furnaces consumed 1.8 million kilowatt-hours annually, while the new furnaces use 314,300 kilowatts per year, which means that carbon dioxide emissions decreased by 984 metric tons annually. [ 133 ] The process efficiency improvements also eliminated manufacturing steps required by the old system, which necessitated the use of chlorofluorocarbons as well as cyanide. In fact, the utility partnership helped the company essentially eliminate hazardous waste generation. Productivity is up; managers have hired two new employees and expect to hire 12 to 16 more in the near future. In sum, the utility-industry partnership increased dramatically the facility's energy efficiency, reduced its generation of hazardous wastes, and improved productivity substantially. Equally important, employees are committed to continuous process improvements in production and in reducing waste. The change in employee outlook builds an enhanced pride in the company, and further spurs productivity. [ 134 ] Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Electric's "Smart Money for Business" program offers commercial and industrial customers zero-to-low interest loans or cash rebates for installing qualifying energy-efficiency measures. Prescriptive rebates are available for lighting, motor, HVAC, and refrigeration measures, while custom incentives are available for process-related improvements and are negotiated with each participant (between 15 and 30 percent of a custom project's total costs are typically covered by the incentive). Utility engineers communicate with process-level plant personnel, marketing the program to them; larger projects involve senior management of both the utility and customer simultaneously. More than half of all Wisconsin Electric's industrial customers have received rebates or loans through the Smart Money program. The utility has found that personal, one-on-one contact with the customer while providing technical expertise is essential to successful process-oriented programs. The program has reduced the utility's sales to industrial customers by 2.5 percent, at a levelized cost of 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour saved. From 1987 through October 1993, Wisconsin Electric's cumulative electricity savings were 357,600 megawatt-hours, deferring 71.7 megawatts of capacity and cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 217,778 metric tons. [ 135 ] Bonneville Power Administration . Bonneville's decentralized, flexible "Energy $avings Plan" seeks to form partnerships with industrial customers and tailor process efficiency improvements to their needs. For example, the Holnam Company, a cement manufacturer in Seattle, sought to reduce its rising energy costs to compete in an increasingly competitive market for cement in the Pacific Northwest. Based on an assessment and plant evaluation sponsored by Bonneville, Holnam carried out four energy-efficiency projects, at a total cost of $248,232. Bonneville reimbursed the company $115,615 to account for the saved energy. The four projects, all of which targeted the production process, included kiln drive motors, kiln stack gas precipitators, cooler grate drive motors, and cooler fan motors. They will save a projected 1,782 megawatt-hours, or 3.4 kilowatt-hours per ton of cement, annually - improving productivity. These savings cut carbon dioxide emissions by 248 metric tons annually. [ 136 ] Most important, the partnership has established a flexible mechanism for future process efficiency improvements. 130.

Conclusion In the future, regulated local distribution companies are likely to continue to deliver energy-efficiency services to customers, as will a host of unregulated energy-service companies, equipment vendors, and power marketers. These changes in DSM-program orientation and delivery, however, are unlikely to alter significantly the rationale behind DSM programs. Regardless of the future structure of the utility industry, energy efficiency is an important asset: efficiency cuts customers' bills, reduces system costs, and cuts emissions.

Energy Use in Buildings: Progress in Efficiency Design, Retrofit Investments, and Equipment and Appliance Standards The energy-efficiency of most of America's residences and commercial buildings could be substantially improved. In 1989, U.S. buildings consumed 36 percent of total U.S. energy at a cost of $200 billion. [ 137 ] That's more than what was consumed by transportation or industry. Residences spent $120 billion on energy bills, while commercial buildings (offices, stores, schools, hospitals) spent nearly $80 billion. [ 138 ] The energy consumed by U.S. buildings causes more than 450 million metric tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions - 33 percent of the U.S. total and about 8 percent of global annual emissions. [ 139 ] The United States could cut building energy consumption by 33 to 50 percent by the year 2015 if it invested in cost-effective, commercially available energy-saving technologies. [ 140 ] Substantial progress has been made. Energy-efficient building designs, retrofits, equipment, and appliances have stabilized energy intensity in the commercial sector, [ 141 ] and have reduced energy intensity in residences. [ 142 ] The buildings sector, however, presents distinct policy challenges for capturing efficiency savings. Buildings occupants are often not owners - which undermines incentives to invest in efficiency and creates a market imperfection that is difficult to overcome. [ 143 ] Energy costs over a building's 50- to 70-year useful life are comparable to initial construction costs. Similarly, the life-cycle energy costs of equipment and appliances are often many times greater than their initial cost. Because markets focus more on the first costs than the full life-cycle costs of new buildings, retrofits, equipment, and appliances, public policy must correct these market failures through a combination of intelligent regulation and market incentives. 137. U.S. buildings consumed about 31.5 "quads" in 1989. Rosenfeld, A., and Ward, E., "Energy Use in Buildings," The Energy-Environment Connection, Hollander, J., ed., p. 223 (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 1992). 138. Id. 139.

United States Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, Building Energy Efficiency, OTA-E-518, p. 3 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, May 1992). 141.Commercial buildings used 12.9 quads of energy at a cost of $68 billion in 1989. Despite growth in the number of energy-intensive commercial buildings (the commercial building stock, as measured by total square footage, grew more than 50 percent from 1970 to 1989), and increases in air conditioning and other equipment, energy intensity (energy use per square foot per year) stayed flat in the commercial sector from 1970 to 1990. Improved energy-efficiency technologies helped dampen the growth in energy use through improved windows and shells, greater use of ceiling and wall insulation, more efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment, better lighting systems, and other technologies. Future commercial energy use, despite expected continued expansion of commercial office space, is also projected to remain flat. Investments in commercial building technologies with a positive net present value to the consumer could cut building energy use from 29.7 quads today to 28 quads by 2015, corresponding to an annual energy savings of 14 quads by 2015 - worth $80 billion at today's energy prices. United States Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, Building Energy Efficiency, OTA-E-518, pp. 3, 21-32 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, May 1992). 142.Americans consumed 16.8 quads of energy in residential buildings (including single-family dwellings) in 1989. Space heating is responsible for almost half of total residential energy use, followed by water heating, refrigerators and freezers, air conditioning, and lights. Although total residential energy use increased from 1970 to 1989, primarily due to a 45 million increase in U.S. population over that period, energy intensity (energy consumed per household per year) actually decreased by 15 percent in the same period. The reasons for the decrease include: Retrofitting older homes with energy-efficiency technologies. From 1983 to 1988, about 26 million owner-occupied U.S. households added storm windows and/or doors, and 17 million added insulation. Greater use of energy-efficient building practices in newer houses. New houses built in 1985 installed far more insulation than did houses built in 1973, including 46 percent greater R-value (insulation heat retention) in ceilings, 20 percent more R-value in exterior walls, 60 percent more R-value in floor insulation, and 68 percent fewer single-pane windows. Improved equipment and appliance efficiency. Assuming the recent decrease in residential energy intensity continues, an annual residential consumption of 15.6 quads by 2010 is possible. United States Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, Building Energy Efficiency, OTA-E-518, pp. 3, 15, 18, 31 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, May 1992). 143. Individual homeowners also often fail to make efficiency investments because of a variety of market barriers, including uncertainty regarding the savings that will result from specific measures, uncertainty regarding how long they will own or occupy the home, uncertainty regarding the resale market value of the efficiency improvements, and lack of capital. In addition, renters are often responsible for utility bills but are not in a position to make capital improvements.

Energy-Efficient Building Design Can Significantly Improve Worker Productivity Numerous examples demonstrate that energy-efficient building and office design can significantly increase worker productivity. By improving lighting, heating, and cooling, workers can be made more comfortable and productive. An increase of 1 percent in p roductivity can provide savings to a company that exceed its entire energy bill. [ 146 ] Lockheed Missiles and Space Company. One of the most successful examples of efficient office-building design is Lockheed Missiles and Space Company's Building 157 in Sunnyvale, California. [ 147 ] The 600,000 square-foot office building, designed by the architectural firm Leo A. Daly, brings daylight deep into the building. A central atrium runs top to bottom; the building's 2,700 engineers and support staff consider it the building's most attractive feature. Exterior "light shelves" on the south facade operate as sunshades or as reflectors depending on the season; in summer, they bounce light onto the interior ceiling to maximize interior light, while in the winter, when the sun's angle is lower, they diffuse reflected light and reduce glare. The overall design separates ambient and task lighting, with daylight supplying most of the ambient lighting and task lighting fixtures supplementing each workstation. Continuously dimmable fluorescents with photocell sensors maintain a constant level of light automatically and save even more energy. The open office layout was designed to foster the interaction, and the comfort, of the engineers and staff. Employees rave about the building. Daylighting has saved Lockheed about 75 percent on its lighting bill. Since daylight generates less heat than office lights, the design features cut peak air-conditioning substantially. Overall, the building runs with about half the energy costs of a typical building of similar size. Although the energy-efficient improvements added roughly $2 million to the building's $50 million capital costs, the energy savings are worth nearly $500,000 per year, and paid for themselves in a little more than four years. More important, however, have been productivity improvements. Russell Robinson, manager of facility interior development, reports that productivity is up while absenteeism is down. Lockheed considers productivity data to be proprietary, but according to Don Aitken, chairman of the Department of Environmental Studies at nearby San Jose State University, "Lockheed moved a known population of workers into the building and absenteeism dropped 15 percent." Aitken led numerous tours of Building 157 after it opened, and was told by Lockheed officials that the reduced absenteeism paid 100 percent of the extra cost of the building in the first year. The architect, Lee Windheim, reports that Lockheed officials told him that productivity rose 15 percent on the first major contract done in the building. Apparently, top Lockheed officials told Aitken that they believe they won a very competitive $1.5 billion defense contract on the basis of their improved productivity - and that the profits from that contract alone paid for the entire building. [ 148 ] West Bend Mutual Insurance Company. Another example of improved productivity through energy-efficient design involves West Bend Mutual Insurance Company's new 150,000-square-foot headquarters in West Bend, Wisconsin. The building is the subject of one of the most carefully documented increases in productivity due to green design. [ 149 ] The building incorporates a number of energy-saving design features, including an energy-efficient lighting system (including task lighting and occupancy sensors), efficient windows, shell insulation, and a more efficient heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. It uses a thermal-storage system that makes ice overnight to help cool the building during the day. Offices all have individual temperature and airflow controls. Perhaps the most innovative feature of the building is its "environmentally responsive workstations" (ERWs). Workers in open-office areas are given direct, individual control over temperature and airflow via radiant heaters and vents built directly into their furniture and controlled by a panel on their desks. The control panel also provides direct control of task lighting and white-noise levels. A motion sensor in each workstation turns the station off when the worker leaves the space and turns it back on when he or she returns. West Bend Mutual Insurance's old building had used $2.16 of annual electricity costs per square foot. The annual electricity costs in the new building are $1.32 per square foot - a 39 percent reduction. Furthermore, the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York conducted a detailed study of productivity in the old building in the 26 weeks before the move and in the new building for 24 weeks after the move. The conclusion of the RPI study: "The combined effect of the new building and ERWs produced a statistically significant median increase in productivity of approximately 16 percent over productivity in the old building." [ 150 ] Although a significant portion of the productivity increase derived from the ERWs, analysis shows that the majority of the productivity increase came from the building's energy-efficient design and systems.1 [ 151 ] Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's prototype "Eco-Mart" in Lawrence, Kansas incorporates several energy-efficient design features that have produced several interesting surprises for Wal-Mart management. Although the Eco-Mart design includes a glass arch at the entrance for daylighting, an efficient lighting system, an HVAC system that utilizes ice-storage, and special light-monitoring skylights, it includes a design flaw: only half the store is daylit. Interestingly, departments located in the daylit half of the store are considerably more productive. Sales in the daylit areas are higher than any other department in the Eco-Mart. They are also significantly higher than the same departments in other Wal-Mart stores. Wal-Mart is implementing many of the Eco-Mart measures in new construction for other stores and is retrofitting already-built stores with various energy-efficiency measures. [ 152 ] 146.

Building Codes Offer Substantial Energy Savings Building codes are cutting U.S. energy consumption substantially. By the year 2000, improved residential and commercial building codes could cut electricity use by 14,000 gigawatt-hours, [ 153 ] reducing nationwide carbon dioxide emissions by some 8.86 million metric tons. [ 154 ] Since the 1970s, private engineering societies, government agencies, and code official organizations have promulgated a number of model building codes that include energy-efficiency standards. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires states to adopt commercial building standards that meet or exceed the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) model standard for commercial buildings. However, states are only required to consider adopting such standards for residential buildings. [ 155 ] A considerable gap remains between what is possible for energy-efficient and economical building construction and actual practice. The ASHRAE commercial building standards in effect nationally are expected to reduce energy bills by $2.1 billion annually by 2010. [ 156 ] Improved commercial building codes slated for adoption by ASHRAE could cut carbon dioxide emissions by 1 million metric tons per year by the year 2000 and 11.2 million metric tons annually by 2010. [ 157 ] New homes have been built with designs that use half or less of the energy consumed in older homes. Every year, about 1 million new houses are built in America. Each represent a one-time opportunity: many energy efficiency designs and installations that are easy and inexpensive to include in new dwellings are difficult or expensive to add later as retrofits. Building codes are needed to "raise the floor" for energy efficiency in new homes. The Model Energy Code. Adoption of a widely accepted residential model energy standard - the Model Energy Code (MEC) of the Council of American Building Officials (CABO) - could save 500,000 megawatt-hours of energy in every year's new housing stock - enough to power another 65,000 to 70,000 single-family homes each year. Carbon dioxide emissions could be cut by 316,600 metric tons every year. [ 158 ] Cumulatively, the energy savings from ten years of housing starts could total 3.6 quads of energy over a 50-year span - which highlights the importance of capturing energy-efficiency opportunities at the time of construction. [ 159 ] If Congress would require adoption of the MEC at the state level, as well as improved code compliance and enforcement procedures, [ 160 ] carbon dioxide emissions could be cut by 600,000 metric tons by the year 2000 and 3.8 million metric tons by the year 2010. [ 161 ] The MEC's added energy efficiency would be cost-effective. Although energy-efficiency installations can increase construction costs, energy savings would outweigh costs by 3-to-1 over a 30-year period. Every MEC home's annual energy bill would be reduced, on average, by $150, more than the average increase in mortgage payments of around $90. Thus, the actual "payback" to the average home buyer is almost immediate.

Those states (primarily in the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast) that refer in their state codes to BOCA standards will remove the reference to the ASHRAE standards (which are more than 15 years old and have been superseded by newer standards referenced in the newest MEC).

Building Retrofits Cut Energy Bills While Improving Worker Comfort and Productivity Energy-efficiency retrofits for existing buildings and residences have attractive economic returns. For example, a three-year payback, which is typical in lighting retrofits, is an internal rate of return of 33 percent - generally superior to the results of financial managers for personal investments. Retrofits typically cut energy use by 50 cents or more per square foot of commercial space, a significant reduction in overhead. [ 164 ] The greatest gains, however, are found - somewhat surprisingly - in improved worker productivity that often results from efficiency improvements. [ 165 ] Because labor costs dwarf energy costs per square foot, productivity gains often are the prime motivator for businesses to improve energy efficiency. [ 166 ] In the following examples, companies set out to cut energy and maintenance expenditures through energy-efficiency retrofits. Gains in worker productivity were often an unintended, added benefit of the energy efficiency investments. [ 167 ] Main Post Office, Reno, Nevada. In 1986, mail sorters at the Main Post Office in Reno, Nevada became the most productive in the western region of the United States. A $300,000 lighting retrofit, which included a lowered ceiling that made the room easier to heat and cool, boosted productivity more than 6 percent annually. The rate of sorting errors by machine operators dropped to 0.1 percent - the lowest error rate in the western region. The annual energy and maintenance savings came to about $50,000 - a six-year payback. The productivity gains, however, were worth $400,000 to $500,000 per year, and paid for the entire renovation in less than a year. [ 168 ] DOE's James Forrestal Building. The U.S. government spends $9 billion each year on energy for federal buildings, operations, and employee transport. Federal agencies are required by law to reduce their energy use by 30 percent in the next decade (from 1985 consumption levels). [ 169 ] The goal is to save $400 million annually by the year 2000, and $1 billion a year by 2005. The DOE has made strides toward this goal, starting with its own headquarters, the James Forrestal Building in Washington, D.C. Lighting upgrades in 1994 cut energy bills by two-thirds. Because the retrofits produce higher quality light, worker comfort and productivity has increased. The cost of the project, $1.36 million, was paid for with a Potomac Electric Power Company utility rebate plus private-sector financing from an energy-service company (ESCo). The ESCo will recover its investment from the anticipated 63 percent savings in lighting consumption. The reduced electricity demand cuts pollution emissions in the local utility service area by 27 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 14 metric tons of nitrous oxide, and more than 3,600 metric tons of carbon dioxide. [ 170 ] City of Phoenix's Energy Management Program. Municipalities and school districts have improved productivity through energy-efficiency retrofits. The Energy Management Program for the city of Phoenix, Arizona installed energy-efficiency measures in 300 municipal buildings - including an airport, water and waste treatment plants, offices, libraries, and fire and police stations - saving the city $22.8 million over 16 years, plus far greater savings in worker productivity improvements. Energy savings over this period exceeded 290,000 megawatt hours, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 105,000 metric tons. [ 171 ] EPA's Energy Star Buildings Program. In April 1995, EPA launched a comprehensive, nationwide strategy for maximizing energy-efficiency in existing buildings. EPA's "Energy Star Buildings" program is underway in twenty-four "showcase" buildings nationwide, and includes buildings owned by Honeywell, Inc., Inc., J.C. Penney, Mobil Corporation, Target Stores, Washington Times , and others. The program involves a five-stage upgrade strategy that capitalizes on system interactions to maximize energy savings at minimum cost. After upgrading to energy-efficient lighting (stage 1), participants tune up building systems (stage 2) and reduce heating and cooling loads (stage 3). Participants then improve fans and air-handling systems (state 4) and improve heating and cooling equipment (stage 5). Upgrades are staged so that heating and cooling loads are reduced before major HVAC equipment upgrades are initiated. This staged approach provides immediate energy cost savings and ensures proper load matching when upgrading major equipment in the latter stages of the strategy. Results in the showcase buildings have been impressive. On average, participants are reducing their energy use by 35 percent and earning a 58 percent return on their investment. By the year 2000, the Energy Star Buildings program could lower annual U.S. buildings energy expenditures from today's $70 billion annually to about $42 billion. [ 172 ] 164. These gains are typically tiny compared to the cost of employees, which is greater than the total energy and operating costs of a building. A 1990 national survey of large office buildings measured average electricity costs at $1.53 per square foot. Maintenance and repairs add another $1.37 per square foot. Labor, on the other hand, costs on average $130 per square foot - 72 times the energy costs. Thus, an increase of 1 percent in productivity can nearly offset a company's entire annual energy expenditures. Romm, J., and Browning, W., Greening the Building and the Bottom Line: Increasing Productivity Through Energy-Efficient Design, p. 3 (Snowmass, CO: Rocky Mountain Institute, December 1994). 165. Productivity is measured by Joe Romm, Special Assistant for Policy and Planning to the Deputy Secretary of Energy, in terms of production rate, quality of production, and changes in absenteeism. These productivity factors can be improved by fewer distractions from eye strain or poor thermal comfort, and similar variables. Id. 166. United States Department of Energy, "Why Building Efficiency Matters," Fact Sheet, p. 1 (Washington, D.C.: Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, 1995). 167. The energy-efficiency investments were not undertaken for energy conservation, but rather to increase energy efficiency. Conservation implies reduced services; energy efficiency means providing the same or better energy services using less energy. In general, building efficiency upgrades provide more pleasing light, more reliable production, and greater comfort and control.

Lighting Retrofits Cut Error Rates and Improve Productivity Lighting accounts for 19 percent of all electricity sold in the United States. [ 173 ] Every kilowatt-hour of lighting not used prevents emissions of 5.8 grams of sulfur dioxide, 2.5 grams of nitrogen oxides, and 1.5 pounds of carbon dioxide. [ 174 ] The best light bulbs on the market use only a quarter as much energy as conventional incandescent light bulbs and last ten times longer, preventing the burning of up to 400 pounds of coal, and saving consumers a net $35 on their electricity bills over the life of the improved bulb. If energy-efficient lighting were installed everywhere profitable, America's demand for electricity would drop by more than 10 percent. This would result in annual emission reductions of 1.3 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 600,000 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 202 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Those reductions would be equivalent to taking 44.5 million cars off the road, [ 175 ] and represent 12 percent of all U.S. utility emissions. [ 176 ] EPA's Green Lights Program. Although lighting represents only about 10 percent of the available electricity savings potential in the U.S. economy, lighting represents one of the easiest ways to save electricity. [ 177 ] The Environmental Protection Agency's "Green Lights" Program has brought together more than 1,600 organizations [ 178 ] to upgrade their lighting with state-of-the-art technologies. In 1994, Green Lights participants saved more than 1 million megawatt-hours of electricity, which reduced electricity bills by more than $92 million [ 179 ] and cut carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 633,200 metric tons. [ 180 ] The typical Green Lights upgrade yields an after-tax internal rate of return of 20 to 40 percent. Unanticipated benefits often include increased employee productivity and morale improvements from better lighting quality. Full implementation of Green Lights upgrades by current participants could save $15.8 billion and 12.2 million megawatt-hours of electricity annually, while cutting carbon dioxide emissions by more than 7.7 million metric tons per year. [ 181 ] If that $15.8 billion were reinvested in jobs and enhanced productivity, by the year 2000, Green Lights could result in more than 220,000 new jobs. [ 182 ] Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Since the mid-1970s, the DOE has invested some $70 million at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for research and development of advanced energy-efficient building technologies, software, and standards. That investment has helped spawn a $2.4 billion U.S. market for key products - including energy-efficient lighting. Lighting costs U.S. businesses and consumers nearly $40 billion each year. The strategic use of federal research dollars can trim billions from this annual bill. LBNL's early work on the electronic ballast illustrates the potential payoff from lighting research and working with industry. The electronic ballast has developed from a laboratory curiosity to a highly successful energy-efficient lighting technology. By 1993, electronic ballasts had captured 23 percent of total ballast sales. They will likely replace magnetic ballasts in more than 75 percent of applications by 2015 because of utility and other incentive programs and federal programs and standards. The federal investment in electronic ballast research and development is about $3 million. Cumulative energy savings attributable to electronic ballasts from 1988 to 1993 alone were $400 million. Businesses and consumers will ultimately save a net $700 million from electronic ballasts installed through 1993, which could grow to $13 billion for technologies installed through the year 2015. By 2015, electronic ballast technology could avoid 142,400 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 130,600 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 66.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. [ 183 ] Boeing. Substantial inroads have been made in cutting lighting electricity demand. For example, Boeing, headquartered in Renton, Washington, has been an EPA Green Lights participant. Lighting upgrades have cut electricity use by 25 to 90 percent in several million square feet of its facilities, with a 53 percent annual return on investment. Boeing's upgrades have saved 130,000 megawatt-hours, have paid for themselves in just two years, and have cut carbon dioxide emissions by 18,070 metric tons per year. Other air pollutants have also been reduced, including 4,536 metric tons of sulfur dioxide and 1,815 metric tons of nitrogen oxides each year. The new lighting has improved workers' abilities to detect defects by 20 percent. The savings from catching errors early, according to Lawrence Friedman, Boeing's conservation manager, while difficult to measure, are estimated to exceed greatly the cost of the energy-efficient upgrades. [ 184 ] Pennsylvania Power & Light. Pennsylvania Power & Light's drafting engineers had been working in a 12,775-square-foot room prone to "veiling reflections," a form of indirect glare. A lighting upgrade - consisting of high-efficiency lamps and ballasts fitted with parabolic louvers to reduce glare - in a 2,275-square-foot portion of the shop floor brought impressive results. Building superintendent Russell Allen notes, "Generally speaking Š we converted from general lighting to task lighting. As a result, more of the light is directed specifically to work areas and less is applied to circulation areas, creating more variance in lighting levels which upgrades the appearance of the space." The total net cost of the lighting upgrade was $8,362. Energy use dropped 69 percent, and annual operating costs fell 73 percent from $2,800 to $765. With these savings, the investment would have paid for itself in 4.1 years, a 24-percent return. But the resulting 13.2 percent boost in productivity, worth $42,240 a year, turned a 24 percent return on investment into a 540 percent return with payback in just 69 days. Absenteeism and error rates dropped and morale rose, changes worth at least another $50,000 per year. All told, the return on investment exceeded 1,000 percent. [ 185 ] AT&T. AT&T in Columbus, Ohio slashed its energy costs by $4.5 million over 14 years by installing state-of-the-art metal halide light bulbs, improving insulation, and installing variable-speed drives on heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning fans. [ 186 ] The light bulb retrofits alone saved roughly 1,000 megawatt-hours of electricity per year - which slashed electricity bills 50 percent - while increasing light levels 70 percent. Workers in assembly areas, where small parts are handled, reported that they can see better now that old-style fluorescent lighting has been replaced with metal halide bulbs. Assembly errors have dropped, resulting in a marked improvement in productivity. The lighting retrofits alone cut carbon dioxide emissions by 820 metric tons annually. [ 187 ] Hyde Tools. Hyde Tools, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of cutting blades, installed a lighting upgrade of sodium-vapor and metal-halide bulbs in the early 1990s. The retrofit cost $98,000 (including labor), with $48,000 of that covered by the local utility. Annual energy savings came to $48,000, yielding a payback of about one year. Substantial productivity improvements resulted unexpectedly. Doug DeVries, the company's purchasing manager, initially installed the upgrade in only a small portion of the factory floor. At first, several workers complained because the new lights cast an orange hue. After six months, he gave workers the option of restoring the original lighting on the principle that no amount of energy saved would be worth making his operators dissatisfied. But according to DeVries, "When we experimented by turning the old fluorescent lights back on after six months, there was a near riot of disapproval." The new lights had made it possible to see tiny specks of dirt on each blade during their manufacture. Unless detected, the dirt caused product defects. With the new lighting, DeVries says, "The quality of work improved significantly because we could see things we couldn't see before." DeVries estimates that the improved quality was worth another $25,000 a year to the company. DeVries notes that every dollar saved on the shop floor is worth $10 in direct sales - and thus the improved quality from the efficient lighting was the equivalent of a $250,000 increase in sales. [ 188 ] United Airlines. The United Airlines Maintenance Operations Center at San Francisco International Airport could save an estimated $100,000 annually due to a lighting retrofit recently completed by Parke Industries, Inc. United wanted to improve productivity in an important maintenance and repair area by enhancing the quality of light. Workers in this area regularly service aircraft, parts and components for the airline's entire fleet flying both domestic and international routes. The lighting project is expected to cut 1,022 megawatt-hours of electricity annually, saving $51,000 off annual electric bills - about half the original $100,000 annual operating cost. The project payback is 1.09 years. Additional benefits include another $48,000 in savings from reduced maintenance requirements. Carbon dioxide emissions could be cut by 350 metric tons each year. [ 189 ] The World Trade Center. New York's World Trade Center is receiving a $1,826,000 lighting retrofit. The New York Power Authorityy High-Efficiency Light Program is providing an $834,000 cash incentive and is offering a shared savings deal on the $991,000 balance. Yearly demand and consumption of electricity will be reduced by approximately 828 kilowatts and 5,121 megawatt-hours, resulting in an annual savings of nearly $330,000 while reducing annual carbon dioxide emissions by 2,406 metric tons. [ 190 ] Lockheed Martin Defense Systems Lockheed Martin Defense Systems in Pittsfield, Massachusetts upgraded more than 8,000 assorted fluorescent fixtures to high-efficiency electronic ballasts and energy-efficient T-8 lamps, saving 3,400 megawatt-hours of electricity per year and reducing annual energy bills by $188,100 (a 113 percent internal rate of return). Carbon dioxide emissions were reduced by 2,250 metric tons per year, which is equivalent to taking 496 cars off the road each year. [ 191 ] Ashton Elementary School. Ashton Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida retrofitted its lighting from 4,444 T-12s and 20 incandescent lamps to 2,222 T-8s and 20 compact twin-tube lamps, which improved the quality of classroom light while reducing electricity consumption by 246 megawatt-hours per year at a savings of $17,236 - an annual internal rate of return of 50 percent. Carbon dioxide emissions were cut by 144 metric tons annually, equivalent to taking 32 cars off the road per year. [ 192 ] Shell Oil. Shell Oil implemented a lighting upgrade at its Anacortes, Washington refinery, replacing 7,730 150-watt incandescent lamps with 7,520 70-watt high pressure sodiums and 240 T-8 lamps. The retrofit cut electricity demand by 1,803 megawatt-hours per year, saving $127,346 in energy costs - a 25.5 percent internal rate of return. Greater efficiency from the lighting upgrade reduced annual carbon dioxide emissions by 250 metric tons, equivalent to taking 55 cars off the road each year. [ 193 ] University of California at Berkeley. University of California at Berkeley's five-year, $6 million lighting upgrade project renovated the lighting in 60 campus buildings by installing 91,000 high-efficiency ballasts, 18,000 reflectors, and 3,000 occupancy sensors. Electricity saved amounted to 12,116 megawatt-hours each year, at an energy cost savings of $909,000 annually - a 20 percent internal rate of return. Annual carbon dioxide emissions were reduced by 4,156 metric tons, equivalent to taking 915 cars off the road each year. [ 194 ] Tennessee Valley Authority. The Tennessee Valley Authority set an example for other public agencies by replacing 524 incandescent fixtures with compact fluorescents and 190 incandescent exit signs with LED exit signs at its Knoxville Office Complex. TVA also replaced 9,400 old fluorescent fixtures with T-8 lamps, electronic ballasts, and parabolic lenses and installed 1,200 occupancy sensors to control lighting. The upgrade cut TVA's electricity demand by 3,100 megawatt-hours, saving $210,000 each year while reducing annual carbon dioxide emissions by 1,879 metric tons - equivalent to removing 414 cars from the road each year. [ 195 ] Nike, Inc. Nike upgraded 1,545 T-12 lamps to 1,545 8-foot T-8 lamps, all with electronic ballasts, at its Western Division Distribution Center in Wilsonville, Oregon. It also upgraded 44 exit signs from 20-watt incandescent lamps to 2-watt LEDs. After the upgrade, Nike found it was spending half the amount on energy while getting twice the lighting level. Electricity demand dropped by 331 megawatt-hours per year, saving $16,553. Annual pollution reduction benefits included 22 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 13 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 35 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Said Nike, "There are always ways to Just Do It better." [ 196 ] Compaq Computer Corporation . Employees at Compaq Computer's Houston, Texas headquarters were pleased with a lighting upgrade that reduced both glare and reflections, while saving money and reducing the company's environmental impact. The company retrofitted older fixtures with two 40-watt enhanced T-10, 3,700 lumens, 80 CRI with 24,000-hour life. Lighting energy usage fell 39 percent. Overall electricity consumption dropped by 1,307 megawatt-hours per year, saving $83,493 annually in energy costs. Annual pollution reduction benefits included 193 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 120 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 920 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. [ 197 ] Amoco Oil. In early 1993, Amoco decided it would install 10,300 T-8 lamps, 105 energy-efficient exit sign lamps, and 500 occupancy sensors in its Tulsa Research Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Energy savings totaled 1,197 megawatt-hours per year, a cost savings of $124,883 annually. Pollution reduction benefits include 34 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 46 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 907 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. [ 198 ] Washington Times. The Washington Times upgraded its headquarters facility in Washington, D.C. with 6,360 T-8's, 1,151 compact fluorescents, 145 occupancy sensors, 409 halogen PAR lamps, and 153 LED exit signs. According to one receptionist, "I no longer feel heat on my head all day long. The light bulbs . . . are much cooler and give off better light than before. These lights have cured my headaches." Electricity savings annually amounted to 1,085 megawatt-hours and $72,810 per year. Annual pollution-reduction benefits included 244 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 77 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 1,293 metric tons of carbon dioxide. [ 199 ] Bell Atlantic. Bell Atlantic retrofitted all fluorescent fixtures at its Data Center in Richmond, Virginia with T-8's and electronic ballasts, and installed a variable voltage dimming system to reduce glare and enable a constant light output. Air-conditioning energy outlays dropped by 273 megawatt-hours due to the new, cooler lighting. Total electricity usage fell by 1,600 megawatt-hours, saving $109,000 each year. Annual pollution reduction benefits include 443 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 141 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 803 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. [ 200 ] McDonald's Corporation. McDonald's Corporation is engaged in a nationwide effort to upgrade existing 4-lamp fluorescent fixtures with T-8 lamps and electronic ballasts. The average results for one McDonald's restaurant, based on a sample of more than 200 stores in the northeastern United States, include electricity reductions of 30 megawatt-hours at a savings of $2,260 per year - reflecting a 38 percent internal rate of return. Carbon dioxide reductions total 19 metric tons per store annually, equivalent to taking 4 cars off the road per year. In the words of Joe Megacz, corporate utilities manager, "The energy savings numbers per store may be modest, but when you multiply them by the 1,500 company-owned restaurants we have committed to the Green Lights program, the total becomes significant." [ 201 ] Provo, Utah's City Hall. The city of Provo, Utah - which developed the first prototype hydrogen-powered mass-transit bus back in 1974 - upgraded its City Hall with a combination of T-8s, compact fluorescents, and high-pressure sodium lamps. The result saves 709 megawatt-hours of electricity each year and reduces the city's electricity cost $36,678 annually, reflecting a 22 percent internal rate of return. The lessened electricity demand prevents 640 metric tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions. In the words of Alan Dewitt, Provo facility manager, "[w]e are committed to energy efficiency as a city. By making our buildings more efficient, we have become a model for citizens throughout the community." [ 202 ] Marriott Marquis Hotel. The New York Marriott Marquis Hotel has extensively upgraded its 1,825,726-square- foot facility. The upgrade included the addition of an Energy Management System. Guest room upgrades alone replaced 10,009 incandescent lamps with compact quad-tube lamps. Total annual electricity reductions were 2,556 megawatt-hours, which saves $190,033 each year - an internal rate of return of 100 percent. Carbon dioxide emissions were cut by 1,201 metric tons each year, equivalent to taking 264 cars off the road per year. According to Ed Pietzak, director of engineering, "The hotel used less electricity in 1994 than it did in 1986, despite the guest room occupancy rates increasing from 64.8 percent to over 90 percentŠ The experience of the hotel shows that even with relatively new facilities and increasing occupancy rates, significant savings can be achieved." [ 203 ] Longs Drug Stores. Longs Drug Stores in Hilo, Hawaii upgraded from T-12s and incandescents to T-8s and compact twin-tube lamps. The store's management also installed occupancy sensors and reflectors. Electricity usage has dropped by 31,974 megawatt-hours per year, saving $3,453,166 annually, which represents an 83 percent internal rate of return. Annual carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced by 21,966 metric tons. David Alexander, facilities manager, says, "It became apparent after our upgrades that we not only saved the expected energy, but also that the visual acuity of our customers and employees was dramatically improved. After upgrading our store's lighting, we learned that saving energy in lighting does not have to mean working in a cave." [ 204 ] U.S.X. Corporation/U.S. Steel Group. U.S.X. Corporation/U.S. Steel Group listened to employees' suggestions to upgrade to section lighting and timers in the company's Caster Spares Building in Gary, Indiana. The workers designed a lighting system that saves the Gary plant $120,892 annually while cutting electricity usage by 2,628 megawatt-hours per year. The upgrade changed 748 400-watt mercury vapor lamps to 403 600-watt high pressure sodium lamps, which operate 87 percent fewer hours per year under timed switching devices. Annual pollution reduction benefits include 784 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 264 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 2,588 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Tim Briney, plant coordinator at the Gary plant, had this to say: "We listen to the workers in our facilities. And they wanted to upgrade their lighting." [ 205 ] The County of San Diego. San Diego County, California sought to upgrade lighting in as many of its 610 buildings as possible. In the words of Tom DuMont, deputy director of facility services, "Our experience has demonstrated that the commitment and involvement of directors and top managers provide the momentum to start and maintain an aggressive, major relighting program, and to ensure that the financial benefits are well understood by executive, financial, and administrative officials." At its Operations Center Annex, the county upgraded a combination of T-12s and incandescent lamps to T-8s and compact quad-tubes, saving 1,063 megawatt-hours and $99,009 annually. Pollution-reduction benefits include 22 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 30 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 365 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. [ 206 ] Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts upgraded campus lighting with approximately 225,000 T-8 lamps, 100,000 electronic ballasts, 3,000 reflectors and 2,500 new fixtures. Electricity demand dropped by 12,278 megawatt-hours per year, saving $982,241 annually - a 13 percent internal rate of return. William Wohlfarth, P.E., senior electrical engineer for the school, noted that the upgrade was "well received by facility users. The improved color rendition was observed immediately, and people noted better depth perception and clearer, cleaner spaces. My advice to other organizations is to spend time obtaining good initial surveys and accurate run hours. Also, you should standardize on upgrade materials as much as practical, and negotiate large quantity material prices." MIT's upgrade avoids 8,128 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, equivalent to taking 1,790 cars off the road each year. [ 207 ] Johnson & Johnson. At Johnson & Johnson's McNeil Consumer Products Company in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, nearly all buildings received lighting upgrades, including buildings performing such diverse functions as manufacturing, product packaging, administration, research, warehousing, food service, and child development. The light quality has greatly improved and maintenance has been reduced. By converting all 6,000 inefficient fluorescents to T-8s and T-10s, all incandescents to compact fluorescents, and all exit signs to LED or compact fluorescents, the facility is saving 1,373 megawatt-hours per year and cutting its energy bills by $107,574 annually. Pollution reduction benefits include 8 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 3.7 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 800 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. Spokesman Mike Vlasic notes that "with the money we are saving . . . we have expanded into other energy saving products - such as motion sensors and exit lights - and enhanced our energy management system."

Home Energy Rating Systems (HERS) Provide Important Consumer Information Every year, 3.5 million homes in America change hands. Every transfer offers an opportunity to retrofit homes with energy-efficiency measures. When buying a home, consumers typically only have enough information to base their decision on the home's first costs. But the life-cycle energy costs of a home, like a car or appliance, are important values that make a substantial difference in the real cost - and value - of a home. DOE's Five-Star Rating Program. The U.S. DOE has developed a uniform home energy rating system that evaluates the efficiency of residences on a 100-point scale. The most efficient house receives 100 points ("five stars plus"), indicating a home that is roughly two times as efficient as one built to the specifications of the 1993 Model Energy Code.209 In mid-1995, DOE proposed the program as a national standard, with voluntary adoption left to the states. States should be encouraged to implement the program, which will offer buyers essential information about the life-cycle energy costs of a potential home purchase. Uniform Home Energy Rating Systems (HERS), nationwide, will remove market barriers to financing for energy-efficiency investments. The real estate industry, and most consumers, fail to recognize the life-cycle market value of efficiency investments. Lenders are generally unwilling to loan more dollars for more efficient houses, even though those households have greater disposable income due to lower energy bills. Uniform efficiency ratings will help standardize the real estate efficiency market, enabling lenders and utilities to expand energy loan programs and increase consumer demand. [ 210 ] Energy Rated Homes of America The private sector has also taken on HERS. "Energy Rated Homes of America" also uses a 100-point scale and provides an "as-is" rating for each home it evaluates. [ 211 ] An "improvement-options" rating is also provided, which indicates how the home would rate, and the potential savings, if fully detailed retrofit measures were installed. Thus the process of rating a home not only provides a score, but provides the home owner with cost-effective, suggested improvements. The funds necessary to carry out these improvements can be added to mortgages - discussed below - allowing inefficient homes to be upgraded and the cost of improvements financed over the life of the loan. [ 212 ] The Austin, Texas "Energy Star Program." Austin's Energy Star Program is a similar new-home HERS program. The rating compares a particular energy-efficient home to the same home if it were built to minimum code standards. A one-star home [ 213 ] saves approximately 6 percent more energy than the base (code-built) home; a two-star home [ 214 ] saves about 15 percent; and a three-star home [ 215 ] represents more than 23 percent energy savings. Austin has marketed the Energy Star Program especially toward volume builders, who typically are conscious of small incremental cost increases per unit and historically have been less inclined to meet efficiency levels much above code requirements. Austin has been able to get more than 40 builders to join the Energy Star Program - a majority of the builders in the Austin area. The builders have become so actively involved in the program that, according to Doug Seiter, Energy Star Program manager for the city, they are "changing their design plans just to get better ratings. They've been joining because it makes them competitive." [ 216 ] In the 12 months preceding October 1, 1990, the program had given Energy Star ratings to 622 homes, representing 50 to 60 percent of that year's new residential building stock. These homes saved more than 1 million kilowatt-hours that year - enough electricity to serve more than 100 homes for a year. Projected electricity savings are estimated to be $143,060, an average of $230 per home. Just these 622 homes saved 704 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions during 1990. [ 217 ] 209. Unfortunately, the House and Senate have each passed legislation that would prohibit DOE from conducting any buildings-oriented rulemaking, including HERS.

Increased availability of uniform ratings would enable lenders and utilities to expand their energy loan programs much more rapidly and help increase consumer demand. 213. A one-star home includes increased heating and cooling efficiencies, somewhat higher insulation levels, and improved shading coefficients on windows (solar screens). 214. Two-star homes include reduced air infiltration, improved shading techniques, higher equipment efficiencies, and higher insulation values. 215. Three-star homes typically take the total design of the home into account for maximum energy advantage, as well as optimum efficiencies. These ratings apply to both all-electric and multifuel homes.

Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs) Can Provide Necessary Retrofit Financing The Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, various lenders, and numerous utilities have introduced new financing products for energy-efficiency upgrades. Home buyers are being encouraged to install efficiency improvements at the time of purchase through Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs) - which provide financing for efficiency upgrades as part of a home mortgage package. EEMs allow home buyers to automatically qualify for a larger mortgage to pay for efficiency improvements - improvements which then more than pay for the added cost of the mortgage through energy savings. Lenders provide EEMS under the rationale that the mortgagee will have greater disposable income from savings on utility bills and can therefore afford a greater monthly mortgage payment. [ 218 ] The Federal Housing Administration. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to offer up to $8,000 above the qualifying loan amount for cost-effective219 efficiency retrofit measures at the time of home resale. In October 1995, the FHA announced that it is expanding its EEM program nationwide. The FHA EEM will apply not only to retrofits but also to new construction. [ 220 ] A borrower can finance through the mortgage 100 percent of the cost of eligible energy-efficient improvements - which may include energy-saving equipment as well as active and passive solar technologies - without an appraisal of the energy improvements and without further credit qualification of the borrower. [ 221 ] Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In Colorado, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a loan program that allows borrowers to finance energy upgrades in both new homes and resales as long as the increase is less than or equal to the present-value calculation of the rated energy savings. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have expressed an interest in taking the program nationwide. Under Fannie Mae's Community Home Buyers Program, purchasers with incomes at or below the national median can finance efficiency upgrades with a 3 percent down payment. Freddie Mac has a similar program known as the Affordable Gold Program that reduces the cash required for the down payment. These programs qualify low or median income home buyers for energy-efficient homes using cash from utility rebate programs as part of their down payment. [ 222 ] Pacific Gas and Electric. In California, Pacific Gas and Electric has teamed with three lenders to automatically qualify buyers for an additional 10 percent mortgage, at below-market interest rates, for homes that are rated 10 to 25 percent more efficient than the California state energy code. Loan demand has exceeded all expectations. The lenders involved are now marketing these new incentives nationwide to utilities and ratings organizations interested in promoting energy-efficiency financing. [ 223 ] Fannie Mae is pilot testing an unsecured home-improvement loan at below-market interest for up to $15,000 with the same California utility. This energy loan program is operated with a utility partner and a third-party consumer loan originator. If successful, Fannie Mae says it will take the program nationwide. [ 224 ] 218.

Energy Services Companies Provide Retrofit Services With Immediate Energy Savings Efforts to improve energy efficiency in buildings are often obstructed by the divergent priorities and incentives of the building industry. Lack of coordination between architects, building engineers and subcontractors, lenders, owners, tenants, and the operations and maintenance staffs of large commercial buildings often results in a failure to capture potential energy efficiency savings. [ 225 ] Energy Services Companies (ESCos) are in the business of designing and installing energy-efficiency systems in buildings, typically on a performance contract basis. Performance contracts allow businesses and building owners to upgrade their facilities without sacrificing scarce financial resources up front. ESCo performance contracts guarantee a positive financial return from efficiency upgrades throughout the contract term. ESCos often bundle their services with private bank financing packages that provide a net positive cash flow from energy savings from day one of efficiency installations. ESCos typically conduct an initial audit of a building, and then implement a multi-stage retrofit involving lighting upgrades, automation and control systems, temperature control systems, improved HVAC systems, building envelope and windows upgrades, and microprocessor-based energy management control systems for monitoring overall system efficiency. Additional ESCo services include indoor air quality diagnostics, chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacement, maintenance of equipment and controls, and on-site training of employees in order to optimize building performance and energy savings. [ 226 ] Honeywell, Inc., Inc. Honeywell, headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is the largest U.S. ESCo. Honeywell has retrofitted buildings and facilities throughout the U.S. with energy-efficiency technologies and processes, including federal, state and local governments, schools, hospitals, commercial buildings and industries. Honeywell uses performance contracting, and bundles its services with private bank financing that guarantees a neutral or positive cash flow from efficiency upgrades. Most often, actual energy savings far exceed the performance guarantee, with all additional energy savings accruing to the customer. In 1990, Honeywell contracted with the City of Seattle, Washington to install efficiency upgrades in the Seattle Municipal Building. Honeywell replaced old lighting with new electronic ballasts and T-8 fluorescent lamps. Automated centralized lighting controls and occupancy sensors reduced the hourly energy used for lighting from 400 kilowatt-hours to 224 kilowatt-hours. To improve poor indoor air quality, Honeywell installed a new high-efficiency air filtration system and new fan coil units. In the first two years, the upgrades cut building energy use by 2,483 megawatt-hours - an energy savings of 62 percent. These savings avoided 345 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, equivalent to removing 76 cars from the road. [ 227 ] ESCos will play an increasing role in the future, both in the buildings sector and in a restructured utility industry, because of their ability to package capital with design expertise, serving to improve their clients' bottom line. Government facilities, private businesses, public housing and potentially private residences can benefit from ESCo services. 225.

Energy-Efficient Appliances and Equipment Provide Significant Energy Savings During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a number of states established efficiency standards for major home appliances, and appliance manufacturers petitioned the federal government to establish uniform preemptive national standards. These were enacted as the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987. There are now national efficiency standards for most categories of home appliances and equipment. The U.S. DOE periodically reviews and updates these standards. Although efficiency measures add a small extra cost to products, the efficiency standards are set at levels where the extra costs are rapidly offset by energy savings. [ 228 ] Chart 8: Life-Cycle Energy and Economic Benefits of Selected Appliance Standards Residential appliance standards alone are already saving consumers $1.9 billion annually, and ultimately will save consumers $132 billion net over the lifetime of products purchased by 2030, providing a ratio of total benefits to costs of 3-to-1. [ 229 ] Past and necessary future appliance and equipment standards could cut residential electricity use 7 percent by the year 2015, saving about 80,000 gigawatt-hours and 21,000 megawatts of capacity annually [ 230 ] - which represents approximately 50.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide reductions per year.

Whirlpool's "Golden Carrot" Super-Efficient Refrigerator One of the most creative and impressive new technology-forcing incentives is the "Golden Carrot" Super-Efficient Refrigerator program. [ 232 ] Refrigerators consume 20 percent of all residential electricity, and average about 685 kilowatt-hours per refrigerator each year. [ 233 ] To encourage manufacturers to develop and market refrigerator-freezers that are substantially more efficient than the 1993 standards, and also to influence the next round of federal standards, a group of electric utilities formed a consortium - the Super Efficient Refrigerator Program, Inc. (SERP). [ 234 ] In July 1992, SERP issued a Request for Proposals to refrigerator manufacturers asking them to design, manufacture, and sell the most energy-efficient refrigerator possible - while competing for a $30 million pot of incentive money. The manufacturer who promised the most energy savings at the lowest cost per kilowatt-hour saved was to win the entire pot (provided that the manufacturer can sell enough qualifying models within the service areas of the participating utilities). To be eligible, bids had to be for CFC-free designs. In October 1992, SERP received fourteen bids, including a number of bids from major manufacturers. In December 1992, it selected two semi-finalists - Frigidaires and Whirlpool. These manufacturers then built prototype units and submitted them to SERP for testing. Both prototypes used roughly 40 percent less energy than required under the 1993 federal efficiency standards. SERP selected a single winner in June 1993 - Whirlpool. The $30 million prize will be paid as the efficient Whirlpool refrigerators are delivered to retail stores within the service areas of participating utilities. [ 235 ] New Golden Carrot Whirlpool Design Reduces Comsumer Costs... ...And Carbon Emissions Energy savings from the Golden Carrot program are substantial. About 25,000 SERP refrigerators were sold in 1994, providing savings of 7,100 megawatt-hours of energy and 1.6 megawatts of capacity - and cutting carbon dioxide emissions by about 4,495 metric tons. Over the life-cycle of those 25,000 refrigerators, 135,375 megawatt-hours will be saved, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 85,719 metric tons. [ 236 ] Once the program's 250,000 refrigerators enter the market as planned, the program could result in direct annual energy savings of 96,000 megawatt-hours (a capacity equivalent of 16 megawatts) and 1.83 million life-cycle megawatt-hours - cutting carbon dioxide emissions by about 60,787 metric tons each year and by about 1,158,756 metric tons over the life cycle of the refrigerators. [ 237 ] Chart 10: Refrigerator Electricity Use and Volume The indirect effects of the program, however, produced the greatest benefit. Because of the program, the entire market for refrigerators could be transformed; Whirlpool's competitors are also now developing more efficient refrigerators. [ 238 ] The Golden Carrot concept could be replicated to encourage improved efficiency designs for buildings, equipment, and appliances. Federal, state, and local governments could form partnerships with local utilities, manufacturers, and other interested parties to encourage improved efficiency through similar incentive schemes for technology demonstration and marketing. 232. The program was crafted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, Pacific Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison. 233. The average rated electricity consumption of new refrigerators declined from about 1,725 kilowatt-hours per year in 1972 to around 685 kilowatt-hours per year in 1993.

[ 239 ] Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The DOE's program at the LBNL has made an enormous contribution to national energy efficiency through its development of low emissivity, or "Low-E," windows, which use a special coating to reduce heat loss by 35 percent. LBNL helped private businesses develop prototype coatings and new, low-cost, thin-film deposition processes. Today, Low-E windows have captured 36 percent of the U.S. windows market with $600 million in annual sales. By 1993, the cumulative energy savings to the United States was $760 million, and cumulative savings will reach $17 billion by the year 2015. By that year, Low-E windows are projected to be preventing, through avoided electricity generation, 142,000 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 129,000 metric tons of nitrous oxide, and more than 64 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

The label is currently used by personal computer, monitor, printer, copier, and fax machine manufacturers whose products offer a low-power "sleep" mode when not in use (with no loss in performance) and can awaken automatically when needed. Computer systems consume 5 percent of all commercial electricity - a percentage that could grow to 10 percent by the year 2000. Some 30 to 40 percent of all computers are left on at night and over weekends. On an average day, computers are active less than 20 percent of the time.

Conclusion Much more could be done to improve the energy efficiency of America's buildings, residences, appliances, and equipment. Fifty percent of large businesses that spend at least $100,000 annually on energy bills invest in energy efficiency only when paybacks are 2 years or less. This is equivalent to demanding better than 50 percent annual returns on financial investments. Energy-efficiency investments simply make good sense: they offer returns superior to those of most financial instruments, and they often improve worker comfort while significantly increasing productivity. Energy-efficient building designs, retrofit investments, and equipment and appliance standards all contribute to greater business competitiveness and economic growth - while preventing carbon dioxide emissions.

Transportation The combustion of fossil fuels by the U.S. transportation sector consumed 35 percent of the nation's energy in 1990 and produced more than 32 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. [ 242 ] Transportation will be the fastest-growing source of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions over the long term - by far - unless Americans take aggressive steps to build efficiency into transportation systems. [ 243 ] Two-thirds of total U.S. oil consumption goes to transportation. [ 244 ] Transportation is the only sector of the U.S. economy that is totally dependent on oil. Oil consumption by transportation has profound implications for national security. Each day, Americans use 4 million more barrels of oil for transportation than the United States produces. The United States imports more than half the petroleum it uses, and those imports contributed $56 billion to the U.S. trade deficit in 1994. [ 245 ] The United States is importing more oil than ever before, and the trend is upward. The gap between what we use and what we produce is projected to rise to 9 million barrels per day by the year 2010. [ 246 ] Dependence on oil imports threatens U.S. national security. [ 247 ] It makes our economy vulnerable to foreign cartels, price swings, supply disruptions, and foreign wars. Transportation energy use accounts for about half of all air pollution emissions in the United States and more than 80 percent of air pollution in cities. [ 248 ] Highway vehicles alone account for 26 percent of U.S. emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), 32 percent of nitrogen oxides, and 62 percent of total carbon monoxide. [ 249 ] Emissions of these hydrocarbon vapor emissions are tied to gasoline use. Hydrocarbon by-products of gasoline consumption react with nitrogen oxides to form ground-level ozone, a major air pollutant that aggravates asthma and causes other respiratory problems. The American Lung Association (ALA) estimates that the United States spends $50 billion each year on health care as a direct result of air pollution. [ 250 ] Every tank of gasoline consumed by an automobile produces between 240 and 400 pounds of carbon dioxide when burned. [ 251 ] Every pound emitted accumulates in the atmosphere for between 50 and 200 years. [ 252 ] The United States emits almost as much carbon dioxide from the transport sector as Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, China, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East combined. [ 253 ] 242.

Great strides have been made since 1970 in improving fuel efficiency and in reducing air pollutant emissions. Perhaps more than any other sector of the economy, however, transportation stands to gain the most from a concerted, national effort to mobilize efficiency improvements.

Internal Combustion Engine Efficiency Has Improved Only about 13 percent of the energy consumed by today's vehicles actually propels them forward. [ 255 ]Each year U.S. drivers spend $77 billion ongasoline and oil for their vehicles - with the bulk of each gallon of gasoline discharged through the tailpipe as waste exhaust. [ 256 ] Much of this energy need not be wasted. The increase in automobile fuel efficiency already achieved is an important transportation success. The technology exists, however, to substantially improve fuel efficiency in internal combustion engines. The most efficient cars now on the road achieve more than 45 miles per gallon (mpg). Commercial prototypes boast more than 70 mpg in the city. [ 257 ] Technology exists to raise average new-car fuel economy 65 percent, from 28 to 46 miles per gallon, by 2005. A comparable increase can be made for light trucks. [ 258 ] Phasing these improvements into U.S. cars and light trucks over the next 10 years could save 2.8 million barrels of oil per day by 2010. These savings are larger than the supplies expected from exploiting reserves offshore or in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. [ 259 ] Chart 11: Efficient Prototype Vehicles, Because carbon dioxide emissions are proportional to fuel consumption, higher fuel economy means lower greenhouse gas emissions. If a 6 percent annual improvement trajectory in new vehicle fuel economy is started in 1996, annual greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by 27 million metric tons in 2000 and by 152 million metric tons in 2010. [ 260 ] These savings would be on top of substantial progress already obtained in integrating energy efficiency into automobiles, including passenger cars and light trucks, over the past two decades. Automobiles required 40 percent less energy per vehicle-mile in 1990 than in 1970. [ 261 ] These efficiency gains are due in large part to technology-forcing regulations, especially federal Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) standards, as well as greater consumer acceptability and affordability of smaller vehicles. Between 1970 and 1990, the annual amount of fuel used per automobile declined by 25 percent. [ 262 ] Honda Motors Corporation. Honda has introduced a new high-efficiency Civic HX Coupe that meets the California low-emission vehicle (LEV) standard several years before the requirement goes into effect. The vehicle's continuously variable transmission (CVT) and lean-burn 1.6 liter engine give the vehicle up to 25 percent greater mileage over conventional automatics, at an economical price.

CAFE standards doubled automobile fuel efficiency from 14 mpg to 27 mpg between 1975 and 1985. The standards are presently saving nearly 3 million barrels of oil per day - corresponding to $50 billion of consumer savings and 150 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions avoided annually. [ 264 ] Although average fuel economy for new cars has not improved since the mid-1980's, the technology has improved substantially during this time.

Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Programs Can Improve Air Quality As cars age, emissions can rise dramatically, sometimes increasing more than a hundredfold after only a few years. "Super-emitters" of air pollution are those 10 percent or so of cars and light trucks that account for half of all vehicle emissions. They also tend to reduce dramatically the average fuel efficiency of the U.S. fleet. Despite the federal 27.5 mpg CAFE standard, the fleet average is only 19.2 mpg, primarily due to continued use of older, less efficient vehicles. [ 265 ] Accelerated vehicle retirement programs have been getting these older, more polluting vehicles off the road. In some jurisdictions, industrial sources are able to meet their Clean Air Act obligations more cheaply by buying and scrapping super-emitters than by installing pollution-control equipment. Chevron Corporation. In Southern California, Chevron Corporation is purchasing and dismantling 4,200 pre-1975 model-year cars under California's Rule 1610, which awards mobile source emissions credits to stationary source polluters that operate scrapping programs. Chevron plans to use the credits to forestall required installation of vapor-recovery technology at one of its off-shore oil terminals. [ 266 ] Total Petroleum Company. Total Petroleum Company in Denver, Colorado is scrapping 300 pre-1982 cars and repairing another 300 post-1982 models. The Denver Regional Air Quality District subjects each car to emissions testing prior to scrapping, and bases the number of pollution permits to be awarded to Total Petroleum on verified pollution reductions. The program targets cars that have been: (1) waived from the state's tailpipe inspection; (2) reported on a state "smoking vehicle hotline," where motorists are encouraged to inform the state of cars that exhibit signs of high emissions; and (3) deemed to be high emitters by remote sensing technology. [ 267 ] Total Petroleum is paying $1,000 for all scrapped cars and up to $500 for repairs to emissions-related parts. 265. Super-emitters tend to be older vehicles, but some are relatively new vehicles with poorly maintained engines, defective emission-control equipment, or emission controls that have been tampered with.

Remote sensing is considered by some as the cutting edge of AVR. A remote sensor projects a beam of infrared light across the road to a detector. The exhaust from a passing car alters the beam, and the resulting fluctuations measure carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.

Vehicle Emissions Reduction Technologies Have Successfully Cut Emissions New cars in the early 1990s emitted only about one-fourth as much pollution as uncontrolled vehicles of the 1960s. [ 269 ] This progresshas beendue primarily to federal uniform standards for new-car emissions. [ 270 ] These standards have spurred the development of numerous technologies, including cleaner fuels, advances in pollution-control technologies such as catalytic converters and electronic fuel-injection systems, better vehicle maintenance technologies, and inspection standards. Lead, for example, has been virtually eliminated from motor vehicle exhaust through the introduction of cleaner fuels. Charts 12a: Vehicle Miles Traveled are Projected to Rise Automobile Efficiency Standards are Flat Thus, Gasoline Consumption is Expected to Rise Despite vast reductions in tailpipe emissions, automobiles are still a primary source of urban air pollution. This is because people are driving more - racking up 43 percent more vehicles miles traveled (VMT) each year. [ 271 ] Increases in the number of vehicle miles traveled has more than offset increases in average vehicle fuel economy. Every American travels, on average, nearly 8,800 miles each year in a car or light truck, and the rate of increase in per capita VMT is growing at more than 2 percent per year. [ 272 ] In the absence of additional efficiency standards, total end-use carbon emissions in the transport sector are projected to increase by 90.7 million metric tons between 1990 and 2010, because growth in personal and freight travel is projected to outpace fuel-efficiency improvements.

New Vehicle Technologies are Ushering In an Era of More Efficient Transportation 1. Technology Incentives Spur Markets For Efficient Vehicles Faced with increasing vehicle emissions and the prospect of failing to attain federal Clean Air Act standards, several U.S. jurisdictions are implementing policies that require greater vehicle efficiency. The California Air Resources Board. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has galvanized a low-emission vehicle (LEV) and zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) market in California by requiring automobile manufacturers to include at least 2 percent zero emission vehicles in their 1998 vehicle sales (an estimated 31,000 vehicles). Sales must rise to 5 percent by the year 2001 and 10 percent in 2003. [ 274 ] The level of overall ZEV investment, in both human and financial terms, has been remarkable, reaching as high as $500 million by some estimates. The California ZEV program has the capacity to create a trillion-dollar industry of environmentally clean transportation products that will create millions of jobs and investment opportunities in the United States and around the world. The California ZEV mandate has been embraced by Vermont, Massachusetts, and New York, and is being seriously considered by a number of other states. [ 275 ] 274. Companies subject to the ZEV requirements are "major" automakers selling more than 35,000 vehicles per year in California. The companies include General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Chrysler, Honda, Nissan, and Mazda. In 2003, the threshold will drop to 3,000 sales per year, which will affect most European companies and smaller Japanese companies. Sperling, D., Future Drive: Electric Vehicles and Sustainable Transportation, pp. 38-39 (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 1995). An important lure for all these companies is the ability to sell ZEV credits. For each vehicle sold, the California Air Resources Board will provide the company with a ZEV credit. Credits can be sold t o any of the Big Seven manufacturers. Because the fine for not selling a ZEV is $5,000, and the loss per vehicle is expected to be greater than $5,000 per vehicle initially, the Big Seven should be willing to pay up to $5,000 for each vehicle credit. The trading of ZEV credits could be attractive to all concerned. It allows a company such as General Motors to meet part (or all) of its ZEV responsibilities without paying an embarrassing fine and without incurring large losses. And it provides small, cash-strapped electric vehicle companies with a substantial cash subsidy for every vehicle sold, even small neighborhood electric cars. Id., p. 43. 275. Id., p. 39.

The new designs may be three to five times as efficient as today's, and reduce emissions of regulated pollutants by at least 95 percent. Carbon dioxide emissions could decline by 75 to 90 percent. [ 276 ] Calstart, Inc. Calstart is a public-private consortium founded in 1992 to help California companies foster an advanced transportation industry by arranging for grants, marketing their products, and sharing information. It is a leading player in the state's efforts to support LEV and ZEV vehicles. More than 150 member companies have joined forces and are developing advanced transportation technologies. Thus far, member companies have deployed an aluminum chassis for electric vehicles, opened one of the largest production sites for natural gas vehicles, developed the first electric-natural gas hybrid vehicles, developed the first electric-natural gas hybrid bus, and introduced the nation's first electric school bus. Through June 1995, the member companies had created 1,655 jobs. [ 277 ] DOE's "Clean Cities" Program. The U.S. DOE "Clean Cities" program has successfully expanded the use of vehicles that use alternative fuels in 34 communities that have received a Clean Cities designation. Clean Cities communities intend to have more than 60,000 alternative fuel vehicles in use by the end of 1996, and will establish 700 refueling and maintenance facilities. [ 278 ] 276.

Electric Vehicles Electric vehicles are the closest thing to a nonpolluting transportation medium. Their only adverse effects on the environment would be linked to the generation of electricity to charge their batteries and, possibly, to disposal of the batteries (although recycling may dispel this concern). [ 279 ] Although the initial price of electric cars will likely be higher than the price of internal combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles will have lower overall life-cycle costs. [ 280 ] Inadequate batteries, at present, are the only significant obstacle to widespread use. [ 281 ] South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), California. In July 1995, SCAQMD unveiled a two-year "Electric Vehicle Incentive" program to help bring electric vehicles to the market. Beginning in 1996, SCAQMD will offer a $5,000 discount for motorists purchasing an electric vehicle, up to a total of 1,200 vehicles. The vehicles will be required to meet certain minimum performance specifications and all federal motor vehicle safety standards. In addition to this program, SCAQMD will use an additional $1 million to encourage the development of electric vehicle corridors. Under this program, groups of three or more clustered cities along designated corridors can apply for matching funds to help develop electric vehicle infrastructure. General Motors Corporation. Many manufacturers are moving ahead with electric vehicle production. General Motors originally unveiled its "Impact" model in 1990. [ 282 ] The Impact, with a composite body and stiff aluminum frame, incorporates an advanced electric motor, electronic controls, regenerative braking, and aerodynamic streamlining. The energy cost of running an Impact is only a quarter that of a gasoline-powered car. The driving range, however, is limited to about 100 miles by its 1,100 pounds of lead-acid batteries. [ 283 ] Nevertheless, those who have test-driven an Impact have on the whole given it rave reviews for its quiet ride, maneuverability, and rapid acceleration. [ 284 ] Even counting the emissions from the power plants used to charge it, the Impact produces two-thirds less pollution than California will allow under its 1998 ultra-low emission standard,285 and 72 percent less carbon dioxide than is emitted by a 1994 Ford Taurus. [ 286 ] Clean, Intelligent Transportation, Inc . (CITI). Calstart and a Norwegian consortium joined forces recently and unveiled a personal electric car designed for affordability, with a sticker price of less than $10,000. The new company, Clean, Intelligent Transportation, Inc., will bring the new car, the PIVCO CITI, to California, and plans to begin manufacturing there by late 1996 or early 1997. The car is a roomy two-passenger vehicle that will be marketed as a commuter car for use as a family's second car to be used primarily for commuting and running errands around town. The car will run at freeway speeds, includes air conditioning, and will, with its dual air-bags, meet U.S. safety standards. The car will have a range of 60 to 80 miles between charges. [ 287 ] Solectria Corporation. Solectria, of Wilmington, Massachusetts, has produced a lightweight electric sedan with the standard features typical of sedans on the market today. With its aerodynamic styling, the new Sunrise sedan incorporates a state-of-the-art AC induction drive system and a driving range of 120 miles per charge, using advanced lead-acid batteries. (Enhanced range is expected as superior battery technologies are introduced in the future. A Sunrise prototype using a nickel metal-hydride battery has logged 238 miles in mixed city-highway driving without stopping for a charge.) The two-door, four-passenger electric vehicle includes power brakes, dual air bags, cruise control, automatic battery thermal management for winter driving, efficient electric air conditioning/heating, and a sophisticated onboard battery charging and monitoring system. The car accelerates from zero to 30 mph in 6 seconds, zero to 60 mph in 17 seconds, and maintains a cruising speed of 75 mph. The vehicle is projected to cost $20,000 at a mass-production level of 20,000 units, and will be available in 1998. Over the past 6 years, Solectria vehicles have consistently achieved top honors for efficiency, range and performance. [ 288 ] 279. More electric vehicles does not necessarily mean more power plants. Batteries can be recharged during off-peak hours when excess generating capacity is available. The prospect of recharging at night presents electric utilities with an opportunity to operate more efficiently by allowing them to draw power from otherwise idle capacity.

The most expensive component in the electric driveline is the battery. Currently available lead-acid batteries last less than two years and 20,000 miles and do not store enough energy to power a full-size vehicle very far or fast. But major improvements are expected, especially as the California ZEV mandate approaches in 1998. See Id., pp. 48-49. 282.

Researchers see a potential to increase the energy storage capacity of lead-acid batteries by 50 percent or more, while other research teams are seeking to adapt the more efficient but costlier nickel-cadmium and lithium batteries used in computers and other electronic devices. A 1994 study by the California Air Resources Board suggests that battery technology continues to advance rapidly, and that by the end of this decade new batteries may double the 60- to 100-mile range typical of today's electric cars. In the longer run, still lower costs and greater storage capacities are within reach. Id., pp. 211-12. 284.

Hybrid-Electric Vehicles Hybrid-electric vehicles are another promising technology that could increase the efficiency of automobiles, retaining most of the environmental advantages of a battery-powered model without the huge quantity of batteries that weigh down pure electric vehicles. Hybrid-electrics have both a battery-powered electric motor and a small combustion engine, which are used either separately or together, depending on the driving situation. In some modes, the engine runs continuously, efficiently and relatively cleanly, charging the batteries and greatly extending the vehicle's range. This advantage has prompted renewed interest in hybrids, with most large automakers developing models to meet either the zero-emission vehicle or ultra-low emission vehicle standards that take effect in some regions in the next three to six years. [ 289 ] Mitsubishi Motors. Mitsubishi has come out with a prototype hybrid-electric vehicle that can attain top speeds of 95 miles per hour. Running on the battery alone, the vehicle achieves zero local emissions. When stored energy levels fall, a gasoline engine/generator takes over to provide wheel power while simultaneously recharging the battery. The vehicle's driving range is 150 miles on one tank of gasoline. Ford and GM are both working on advanced hybrid vehicles in programs cofunded by the U.S. DOE. [ 290 ] 289.

Fuel Cells Fuel cells could represent a whole new era in transportation technology, and a significant advance over both internal combustion and battery-powered vehicles. NASA employed fuel cells in the Apollo spacecrafts and space shuttles; using them to power automobiles, however, could become their most important application. Fuel cells transform hydrogen and oxygen into electricity. In an automobile, a fuel cell's power train would consist of a storage tank that holds hydrogen or a hydrogen-carrying fuel such as methanol, a fuel cell system that converts the fuel into electricity, and an electric motor. Given their greater efficiency and lower operating costs, fuel cell vehicles are likely to have lower life-cycle costs than gasoline or battery-powered vehicles. [ 291 ] Fuel-cell vehicles would have many advantages, including zero emissions, quiet operation, long range, and unparalleled energy efficiency. Fuel cells run on methanol, natural gas, or petroleum - and would dramatically reduce pollution and cut greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption by at least half. [ 292 ] The greatest promise involves powering future fuel cell vehicles with solar-derived hydrogen. [ 293 ] Three fuel cell buses have been built under the supervision of Georgetown University with funding from the U.S. DOE. All three are powered by methanol, a phosphoric-acid fuel cell made by Fuji Electric, and a nickel-cadmium battery available for peak-power needs, such as hard accelerations and climbing steep hills. Several smaller fuel cell vehicles are under construction as well. In late 1993, Energy Partners, a start-up company in Florida, rolled out a fuel cell car running on compressed hydrogen. Daimler-Benz unveiled a van running on a fuel cell and hydrogen in April 1994. General Motors is building a methanol fuel cell car to be completed by 1996. In mid-1994, the U.S. DOE announced contract awards of $13.8 million to Ford Motor Corporation and $15 million to Chrysler Corporation to develop fuel cells for light-duty vehicles. Both intend to use hydrogen as the on-board fuel. [ 294 ] The City of Palm Desert, California. Palm Desert is participating in a $4.23 million-dollar multi-organization project to build and test eight fuel cell-powered electric vehicles during the next three years. These vehicles will run on hydrogen that will be produced by a solar photovoltaic array near Palm Desert's City Hall and a wind turbine north of the city. Unlike battery-powered vehicles, which may be associated with some air pollution from the electricity generation plants, these vehicles will truly have zero emissions. [ 295 ] 291. The cost of fuel-cell vehicles is sensitive to the type of fuel used. The life-cycle costs of fuel-cell cars powered by solar hydrogen may be somewhat greater than those of comparable gasoline cars, while fuel cells powered by natural gas probably would be cheapest. Sperling, D., Future Drive: Electric Vehicles and Sustainable Transportation, p. 93 (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 1995). 292. Id., p. 89. 293. Solar hydrogen is hydrogen made by electrolytically splitting water using solar cells. The technology is still expensive. However, Joan Ogden and Robert Williams of Princeton University have argued that rapid advances in solar technology make inexpensive solar electricity a possibility. They predict that the cost of solar hydrogen in the early years of the next century, including all distribution and retail mark-ups (but not taxes), could be between $2.25 and $3.25 per gasoline-equivalent gallon. Because fuel cells are more than twice as energy efficient as internal combustion engines, the relatively high cost of solar hydrogen is, from the vehicle user's perspective, more than halved, bringing fuel costs within a commercially viable range. The ideal place for producing solar hydrogen is in sunny locations such as the American Southwest. If all the cars and trucks in the U.S. were fueled with hydrogen in 2010, only 1 percent of U.S. deserts - equivalent to 0.1 percent of the total U.S. land area - would be needed to produce the hydrogen.

Improving the Efficiency of Other Transportation Modes Reduces Carbon Dioxide Emissions While Improving Competitiveness Energy efficiency has improved the way the United States transports commercial products, and the way public transit moves people. Efficiency reduces costs, thereby increasing competitiveness at the same time that it reduces carbon dioxide emissions. 1. Air Transport In 1993, air transport accounted for 13.5 percent of total U.S. transportation energy use. This figure is expected to rise to 15.5 percent in 2010. Efficiency gains in air transport are a clear success. Over the past 20 years, air transport has achieved the largest improvements among all transport modes - halving energy use per passenger-mile. In the past, fuel costs exceeded 40 percent of an airline's direct operating costs. Those airlines that have adopted cost-effective efficiency technologies have managed to remain competitive while cutting fuel to 15 to 20 percent of operating costs. Despite these gains in fuel efficiency, the expected rise in passenger miles traveled means that U.S. air transport carbon dioxide emissions are expected to rise from about 475 million metric tons today to between 650 and 1,100 million metric tons in 2015.

Long-Term Solutions Must Include Improved Urban Design For the last 40 years, urban form has revolved around the automobile. Engineers have designed roadways to enhance vehicle speeds, rather than pedestrian safety. In many suburban developments, the sidewalk has disappeared altogether. Shopping centers are often set far from residential areas. Catering to patrons who arrive by automobile, they provided excessive parking, limited pedestrian assess, and no bicycle facilities. America has become a nation where the automobile seems necessary to accomplish daily tasks and leisure pursuits. Road systems are often unable to keep up with demand and congestion continues to worsen. The spatial separation between jobs, homes, stores, and recreation is increasing. Those segments of our society that do not drive have been marginalized from mainstream society and employment opportunities. If the United States is to seriously address carbon dioxide emissions in the transportation sector, it will be necessary to reorient our urban design toward people rather than cars. Urban structures cannot be changed overnight. However, there are signs that efforts to improve urban design have already begun. The goal is to create more livable communities. The side benefit will be cleaner air and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. MetroLink, St. Louis. One urban design success story is St. Louis' light-rail system, MetroLink. Using federal highway funds for construction, the system opened in 1993, 32 years after the city's last commuter rail line closed. Careful planning, implementation, and promotion have made MetroLink a model transit and land-use planning success. MetroLink is an economic boon to the city, and people find they both like and use the rail line. It has reduced traffic on St. Louis' most congested freeways and lowered demand for downtown parking facilities. MetroLink uses less energy per mile and produces less air pollution per passenger-mile than automobiles. The system reached its five-year ridership goal in its first year. The citizens of St. Louis approved a sales tax increase to expand MetroLink and improve other transit services. The most significant factor in MetroLink's success is its land-use planning approach: St. Louis uses a radial corridor land-use pattern. Radial patterns lend themselves to transit development because population densities in the corridors tend to be high, increasing chances that ridership, too, will be higher than it would be in cities with grid development patterns. Also, radial corridor cities tend to have a lot of magnets - shopping centers, museums, and sports arenas - within walking distance of transit stations. MetroLink facilitates a resurgence of a land-use pattern more widely known before the age of the automobile - the American village land-use pattern - where most daily conveniences were located within walking distance. This pattern could prevail for land-use planning in the 21st century. [ 297 ] Chicago's Community Green Line Initiative, Chicago . The Community Green Line Initiative is a planned community-based transit-oriented development centered around the Pulaski Street Station in Chicago. The Pulaski Street Station is part of what used to be the Lake Street Elevated Line - now the Green Line - one of Chicago's historic elevated transit lines. In 1994, the line shut down for a two-year reconstruction project, which will include building or renovating 28 transit stations. Within a half mile of the Green Line live 118,000 people - a population similar to a small city. Only half of these households have access to a car. Members of the community developed the Green Line Initiative to boost transit ridership, reduce automobile dependence, stem the abandonment of buildings, and increase job opportunities - all while contributing to regional air quality goals. West Garfield, the community surrounding Pulaski Station, has suffered greatly from development patterns that favor sprawl, structural disinvestment, and suburban infrastructure funding - all patterns that continue to contribute to the social and economic disintegration of inner cities across the United States. The Community Green Line Initiative has encouraged citizen involvement in planning, and seeks to upgrade the neighborhoods surrounding the Green Line by making the area an attractive place to live, work, raise families, and shop. New jobs will be created - within walking distance of workers' homes. The land-use plan calls for rebuilding neighborhood density with new housing, revitalizing the neighborhood economy with retail and commercial development, and creating new public parks. The Green Line Initiative has taken advantage of federal funds made available through the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), which mandates broad changes in the way transportation decisions are made and funded, and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program (CMAQ), a component of ISTEA, which provides funds for projects that reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. To help the initiative qualify for these funds, the American Lung Association (ALA) projected the air quality impacts of the project. According to the ALA, the Green Line Initiative will eliminate 17.5 percent of vehicle trips to work and 20 percent of all other trips, thereby saving 1,556 vehicle miles traveled every day. These reductions could cut ozone precursors, including VOCs, by 6.9 metric tons, and nitrogen oxides by 2.75 metric tons per year. [ 298 ] 297. Warren, W., "Why Success in St. Louis?"

Conclusion Transportation will be the fastest-growing source of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions over the long term - by far - unless Americans take aggressive steps to build efficiency into transportation systems. Transportation is the only sector of the U.S. economy that is virtually totally dependent on oil. America is importing more oil than ever before, and the trend is upward. Transportation accounts for about half of all air pollution emissions in the United States, and more than 80 percent of air pollution in cities. Every tank of gasoline consumed by an automobile produces up to 400 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. Solutions to these transportation problems are within reach; what is needed is the political will to tackle them. Internal combustion engines are becoming increasingly efficient. Federal CAFE standards have doubled automobile fuel efficiency, saving nearly 3 million barrels of oil every day. Programs are helping retire older, more polluting vehicles from the road, while emissions-reduction technologies in new vehicles are being improved. A revolution is underway in the transportation sector - the development of new low-emission and zero-emission vehicle technologies. The California Air Resources Board has implemented LEV and ZEV vehicle standards, which will take effect in 1998, that should spur a potential trillion-dollar market for environmentally clean automobiles. Several electric vehicle and hybrid-electric vehicle manufacturers are gearing up for mass production. If the United States is going to seriously reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the transportation sector, however, long term solutions must include a reassessment of land-use planning. Communities nationwide are seeking to redesign urban structures around people, rather than around traffic. Several new urban designs maximize the benefits of locating conveniences within walking or bicycling distance.

Renewables: Coming of Age Renewable energy technologies - wind, photovoltaics, solar-thermal, and geothermal [ 299 ] - have made major advances in the past decade, and are rapidly becoming a means of minimizing the costs of providing energy services. Renewables can assist utilities with environmental regulatory compliance, protect ratepayers from fluctuations in fossil-fuel prices, diversify the energy supply mix, improve air quality, cut public health costs, and improve local economies as a result of market demands for, and export of, cleaner technologies. [ 300 ] Chart 12: Renewable Energy Costs are Dropping Renewable energy costs have dropped while reliability and performance have improved dramatically. For example, the cost of wind-generated electricity in the United States dropped from 25 cents per kilowatt-hour in 1984 to less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour today. [ 301 ] The cost curves for solar-thermal and photovoltaic utility plants show similar downward trends. Increased production would further reduce costs. [ 302 ] If pollution and social costs from fossil use were to be internalized in fossil prices, many renewables today would be cheaper than fossil fuels. With support from forward-looking public policies, renewables could play a strong role in meeting future U.S. energy needs. 299. Renewables also include hydroelectric and biomass. Substantial potential for hydroelectric capacity expansion exists in the U.S., particularly in the Northeast. Although biomass provides some 5 percent of U.S. total energy use (including electricity generation, space heating with wood, and transportation fuels such as ethanol and methanol), biomass employs the combustion process, creating air emissions that include carbon dioxide. Biomass feedstock management can offset these emissions by sequestering carbon dioxide as feedstocks grow, and the use of biomass in place of fossil fuels can involve a net decrease in overall carbon dioxide emissions. 300.

Renewables Technologies Have Made Major Advances When Congress enacted the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), [ 303 ] it required utilities to buy renewables-generated power at the utility's "avoided costs" [ 304 ] - which sparked the first major deployment of renewable energy in the U.S. market. Since then, approximately 12,000 megawatts of nonhydroelectric renewables have come on line. Several states, particularly California, have encouraged the development and deployment of renewable resources, and have experimented with a variety of mechanisms to push renewables into the marketplace. The costs of renewables have dropped, allowing them to compete with more conventional power generation. The U.S. DOE projects a continued drop in prices. At the same time, renewable capacity is expected to grow. By 2005, renewable capacity in the United States could increase to 4,180 megawatts of wind, 260 megawatts of photovoltaics, 3,440 megawatts of geothermal, and 12,500 megawatts of biomass and municipal solid waste energy. [ 305 ] U.S. export opportunities for renewables and efficiency technologies have become one of the fastest-growing economic sectors. [ 306 ] 303. Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-617, 92 Stat. 3117 (1978), 16 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq. (1982) (PURPA). 304. Avoided costs are measured as the amount the utility would have had to spend to provide the capacity and energy itself. Utilities are able to pass through the cost of purchased power to ratepayers, creating an incentive for utilities to engage in demonstration and commercialization of renewables. PURPA demonstrated that competition in generation is both viable and beneficial and has led to an expanding renewable energy sector. 305. Rosenzweig, R., "The Federal Interest in Electric Restructuring," Public Utilities Fortnightly, Vol. 133, No. 20, p. 18 (Vienna, VA: November 1, 1995). 306. Internationally, India has committed to install 2,000 megawatts of renewable energy by 2000, and China has featured renewable energy in its Agenda 21 - a plan developed to achieve the objectives established by the Framework Convention on Climate Change. India and China alone will account for 35 percent of incremental electricity demand between 1993 and 2010, requiring $450 billion in capital. Because research and development has driven down their costs, renewable technologies will have an opportunity to compete against conventional technologies in international markets. Id.

Renewable Energy Has Become Reliable The reliability of renewables has improved markedly. Although renewables by their nature provide power intermittently (when the sun shines or the wind blows), technological improvements have made renewable energy highly reliable. For example, new models of wind turbines are up and running 95 percent of the time the wind blows. Many renewable technologies can generate electricity as part of base load or are otherwise dispatchable; geothermal units can have capacity factors greater than 90 percent. [ 307 ] For comparison, the average capacity factor for all operating coal-fired power plants in the United States was 60 percent from 1990 to 1994. A recent National Renewable Energy Laboratory study suggests that intermittent generation load levels of at least 10 percent (and perhaps as high as 20 percent) can be accommodated with no adverse system impacts. [ 308 ] In California, Pacific Gas and Electric uses wind to supply as much as 7 percent of its system load - 5 percent during peak hours - with no adverse effects. EnergyWorks . Bechtel recently joined forces with Pacificorp of Portland, Oregon to form EnergyWorks, a joint venture based in Landover, Maryland to develop, finance, own, and operate small, renewable energy systems, including solar, wind, and hybrid energy systems. Bechtel's president, John D. Carter, sees the venture as an opportunity in an increasing global shift toward renewables. EnergyWorks' president and CEO Jeffrey W. Eckel notes, "The use of new renewable energy technologies is growing at a rate between 10 and 20 percent annually in a number of markets," including foreign markets. The EnergyWorks venture reflects the growing economic viability of renewable energy. 307. Capacity factor is the amount of load achieved by operating a given generation source, and is a measure of dependability. Solar- and wind-based projects, without storage, typically have capacity factors of 20 to 30 percent because they operate only when the sun shines or the wind blows. Swezey, B., and Wan, Y., The True Cost of Renewables: An Analytic Response to the Coal Industry's Attack on Renewable Energy, NREL/TP-462-20032, pp. 2-4 (Golden, CO: National Renewable Energy Laboratory, October 1995). 308. When power from intermittent resources is not available, other generators on the system are called on to supply the power. At low renewables penetration levels, this situation is much like the normal utility system response to load fluctuations. At higher renewables penetration levels, a utility might have to provide additional dispatchable capacity to compensate for both normal load fluctuations and the output variations of the intermittent renewables generators. Research shows that intermittent penetration levels above 10 percent are entirely feasible, with any technical limits being a function of the specific utility system characteristics.

The Growth of Renewables Depends on Several Factors Several factors affect renewable electricity development, including: Prices of competing fuels, especially natural gas. The current and forecasted price of natural gas and other fossil fuels will continue to influence the business climate for renewables, affecting utility power purchases, the competitiveness of renewables in bidding solicitations, and the availability of private investment capital and government support. Deploying renewables has high up-front capital costs, but typically extremely low operating costs because there are no fuel costs. On a life-cycle basis, renewables often have lower costs. [ 309 ] Nevertheless, at present, natural gas beats renewables on a first-cost, short-term basis. Modular natural gas facilities currently produce electricity at around 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, or less. Although fossil prices, including natural gas prices, will inevitably rise, it is uncertain when. [ 310 ] Evolving electric power regulation. Because renewables have difficulty competing with natural gas on a first-cost basis, regulatory treatment is critical to the future development of renewable electricity. Legislative incentives and regulatory policies favoring renewables have been responsible for the bulk of purchase contracts awarded to renewable electricity developers to date. Just ten states have accounted for more than 70 percent of U.S. renewables development (excluding hydropower development by utilities), which shows the importance of state utility regulatory policy. [ 311 ] P> Environmental externalities. A key question in the utility industry restructuring debate is whether, or how, the price of fossil fuels will be adjusted to account for the environmental and social costs associated with their extraction and combustion. At present, these externalities are not fully incorporated into market prices. Since renewable electricity technologies consume less water and generate much less air pollution, hazardous waste, and carbon dioxide emissions, they would see wider use in markets that internalize the environmental costs of energy production. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, as of early 1994, 29 states and the District of Columbia required electric utilities to consider environmental externalities in their resource planning processes. Seven of these states - California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon and Wisconsin - have developed monetary values for pollutant emissions. The momentum toward quantifying and incorporating the costs of environmental externalities, however, has recently stalled. [ 312 ] P> Future Cost Curves of Renewables. Further cost reductions could greatly enhance the market penetration of renewables. Reductions in the price of renewables are dependent, however, on the willingness and the ability of private industry, the federal government, and electric utilities to continue to fund technological research, demonstration, and commercialization programs. Regulatory uncertainty and overcapacity in the market have slowed needed investments in renewables, while Congress is scrutinizing the U.S. DOE's budget and is even considering abolishing the department altogether. [ 313 ] P> Foreign Competition. Although the United States has pioneered most renewable electricity technologies, the foreign rate of development for these technologies is beginning to surpass the U.S. pace. [ 314 ] If the U.S. market continues to be inhospitable, it may force renewables development overseas. If the United States fails to develop aggressively its own renewables market through public incentives, the future U.S. energy infrastructure could become dominated by foreign firms. 309. Wind project developers have been signing contracts to deliver electricity at prices as low as 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in a contract's first year, and wind developer Zond Systems just signed a contract for 3 cents per kilowatt-hour levelized over 30 years. Geothermal and small-scale hydro plants can produce electricity for between 4.5 and 7 cents per kilowatt-hour. Even the more expensive photovoltaics systems (which convert sunlight to electricity) have seen costs fall to around $7 a watt for grid-connected systems, down from $30 a watt for experimental systems in the early 1980s, and now produce electricity for between 25 and 50 cents a kilowatt-hour.

Wind Power The advancement of wind energy is a convincing success story. The wind industry is producing utility-scale turbines that are significantly less costly and far more reliable than earlier generation turbines. Newer turbines are routinely available for generation more than 95 percent of the time, and utility contracts for wind power have been signed recently for a levelized price of less than 4 cents per kilowatt-hour - a price that is competitive with fossil sources and cheaper than nuclear. [ 315 ] Wind has enormous advantages over fossil fuels, including minimal future costs subject to inflation [ 316 ] and low operating and maintenance costs. [ 317 ] Wind energy is one of the least costly sources of new electrical generation and is competitive with new fossil fuel-fired plants. [ 318 ] Chart 14: U.S. Wind energy Potential Wind power has another advantage - its modularity. Wind turbines individually cost a fraction of what a conventional power plant costs, and a generator can install as many wind turbines as it needs, when it needs them, and with lead times of about one year. [ 319 ] The cost of wind energy ranks well below all other energy sources when measuring rational, economic costs. [ 320 ] In spite of wind energy's declining costs, the market still presents numerous barriers. As utilities turn to market mechanisms, such as bidding, to determine the type of power plants that will be built, wind energy's beneficial attributes are being ignored in the "dash to natural gas" - the mid-1990s fuel of choice. [ 321 ] The market should discount future cost projections of fossil fuel-fired technologies because of price volatility. [ 322 ] At the end of 1994, 1,717 megawatts of wind capacity had been installed in the United States, producing around 3.5 million megawatt-hours per year. (Using wind to provide 3.5 million megawatt-hours of U.S. generation avoids about 2.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. [ 323 ] The bulk of this capacity was installed in the mid-to-late 1980s. Far greater growth of wind installations has occurred in foreign markets. Europe accounted for 80 percent of the wind industry's sales in 1993, and Germany alone accounted for nearly half of worldwide wind capacity installed in 1994. Worldwide grid-connected wind energy capacity was 3,657 megawatts at the end of 1994, and generated more than 6 million megawatt-hours of electricity. [ 324 ] The U.S. wind resource is large enough to supply more than 4.4 billion megawatt-hours - more than 1.5 times the total amount of electricity used in the United States. [ 325 ] A 1990 Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory study concluded that available wind technology under tight land use restrictions could economically produce 20 percent of the electrical needs of the contiguous United States on just 0.6 percent of the land. [ 326 ] Although wind power (without storage) is an intermittent resource, meteorologists have become reasonably accurate in predicting the energy profile of a wind resource in sites with good wind data. [ 327 ] Kenetech Corporation. Kenetech Corporation, based in San Francisco, was formed in 1986 as the holding company for U.S. Windpower, Inc. [ 328 ] Kenetech, with more than 800 employees, is the world's largest wind company. It manufacturers and sells one of the most advanced wind turbines in the world, the variable speed Model 33M-VS. This turbine delivers electricity at less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour, making it economically competitive with traditional fossil-fuel energy sources. Variable-speed turbines capture a higher percentage of available energy than did earlier designs, and rotate faster as wind speeds pick up to maintain steady power output to the utility grid. Kenetech is the only U.S. wind turbine manufacturer that is producing utility-scale turbines on a volume basis. Kenetech operates an installed base of around 4,400 wind turbines, most of which are in the United States. An example of one ongoing Kenetech project is the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) five-megawatt wind project, which began operation in 1994 using Kenetech turbines. The project produced energy at 4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour in its first year (non-inclusive of federal energy production incentive payments). [ 329 ] Kenetech provided SMUD with guarantees that its turbines would operate at 28 percent of capacity over two years and that the project will annually produce 121.7 gigawatt-hours - which offsets 41,743 metric tons of carbon dioxide from California's average annual generation. [ 330 ] SMUD has an option to expand the plant size to 100 megawatts. [ 331 ] Overall in California, Kenetech generated 659,131 megawatt-hours of electricity in 1993, offsetting 226,082 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions that would otherwise have been generated by California's average mix. [ 332 ] FloWind Corporation FloWind, based in San Rafael, California, develops wind plants and manufactures and designs wind turbines. The company operates two wind farms with more than 860 turbines in the Altamont and Tehachapi Passes in California. FloWind pioneered commercial development of a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT), and also has exclusive marketing rights to a 275-kilowatt horizontal axis turbine designed by Robert Lynette and Advanced Wind Turbine - the AWT-26. During 1993, the company invested substantially in research and development for a new generation VAWT - a 17-meter "extended height to diameter" VAWT. FloWind began testing prototypes of this 300-kilowatt turbine in Tehachapi in early 1994 and plans to upgrade substantial portions of its two wind plants with the new turbine design. FloWind's VAWT design was developed in part with Sandia National Laboratories. Using a $3.2 million cost-shared research agreement with the DOE, FloWind conducted a study of possible advancements in the VAWT technology, and integrated a number of improvements that capture more wind energy and bring down costs. [ 333 ] Commercial production of the turbine is slated for 1995. FloWind has grown into a company with 100 employees and annual wind turbine sales of $66 million, including $47 million in sales to India. [ 334 ] The total installed capacity of the more than 860 turbines operated by FloWind is around 140 megawatts, including 94 megawatts from turbines it owns. In 1993, FloWind generated 170,499 megawatt-hours of electricity in California, [ 335 ] offsetting 58,481 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions that otherwise would have been emitted by California's average generation mix. [ 336 ] P> Zond Systems, Inc. Zond Systems, with headquarters in Tehachapi, California, is the second-largest producer of wind-generated electricity in the world. Zond's five operating wind facilities in California have a total generating capacity of about 260 megawatts. The company also has designed the largest U.S.-made turbine, rated at 500 kilowatts. The 500 kilowatt turbine - the Z-40 - is a three-bladed, upwind, 40-meter rotor diameter machine developed with assistance from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Zond installed one Z-40 in Tehachapi Pass, California, in 1994. In February 1994, the DOE agreed to provide Zond with a $1 million grant under the government's Value Engineered Turbine Program. Zond will use the funds to produce a prototype Z-40, test it in the field and release it for commercial production. Zond says it plans to begin building its first wind-power plant with Z-40 turbines in 1995. [ 337 ] Zond generated 578,172 megawatt-hours of electricity in California in 1993, [ 338 ] which offset 198,313 metric tons of carbon dioxide that otherwise would have been emitted by California's average generation mix.

The cost of operating and maintaining wind turbines is about half a cent per kilowatt-hour. This is half the cost of coal and nuclear plant operations, maintenance, and fuel, and about one-third the cost of that for gas-fired plants. The installed capacity cost of new turbines in commercial-scale projects of 10 to 20 megawatts ranged from $800 to $1,000 per kilowatt in 1994. The American Wind Energy Association expects that the industry will reduce installed costs to around $750 per kilowatt by the year 2000. Id., pp. 23-24, 262. 318. Id., p. 24. The difference in cost between decommissioning nuclear power plants and wind power plants is substantial, but often ignored. For example, decommissioning the damaged Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island will cost more than $1 billion when completed, nearly as much as it cost to build the plant. Overall, decommissioning nuclear plants will cost from $0.3 billion to as much as $3 billion per 1000-megawatt reactor in 1985 dollars, or $300 to $3,000 per kilowatt. Wind plants, in comparison, are sustainable, and can be upgraded indefinitely. If decommissioning were necessary for some reason, it would cost about $3,000 to $5,500 per turbine, or $30 to $55 per kilowatt - at least six times less than nuclear. The turbine's salvage value would likely offset much of this. Id. 319. A 50-megawatt wind facility typically is completed in 18 months. Id., p. 24. A study by Los Alamos Laboratory found that "utilities could afford to pay as much as four times more in overnight construction costs for five-year lead-time plants than for 15-year lead-time plants." According to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, building a series of power plants with short lead times would cut the price of electricity 18 percent over the 15-year period considered, or 1.3 cents per kilowatt hour, relative to building one 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant over four years. Id., pp. 24-25. 320. Id., p. 25. Michael DeAngelis and Sam Rashkin of the California Energy Commission's research and development office performed an analysis of the hidden costs associated with all electric generation sources, and concluded that oil combustion, nuclear fission, fuel cells, and coal have among the highest costs, while efficiency, wind, biomass, hydroelectric and solar thermal electric are among the lowest-cost technologies. 321. Id. A survey by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that competitive bidding in most states has a "systematic bias against renewables" because of the emphasis on using "proven" (traditional) technologies, the undervaluation of environmental costs, and the exclusion of fuel-price uncertainty for fossil fuel plants. 322. By de-emphasizing the price volatility of fossil fuels, the cost of energy for conventional energy sources appears lower in early years than that for technologies with high capital costs but low fuel costs, like those of renewables. Id. 323. This carbon dioxide reduction data uses a national average for electricity, given the actual fuel share in 1993, of 0.6332 metric tons per megawatt-hour (MWh). In the future, avoided emissions will depend on the actual displacement of future and/or existing plants. Laitner, S., Economic Research Associates (Arlington, VA: December 5, 1995). 324.

This figure derives from a 1990 Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory study, which assumed that, in windy areas of the 37 states most suitable for utility-scale wind development, 90 percent of range lands, 70 percent of agricultural land, and 50 percent of forest ridge crests would be available for energy production, while urban areas and environmentally protected lands would be excluded. Wind development is compatible with other uses, and preserves land for rural uses; much of the range and agricultural lands still would be available for grazing and farming because wind power development (including roads, turbine and transformer pads, and service buildings) occupies only 5 to 10 percent of the total land area for a project.

Photovoltaics Photovoltaic (PV) power uses semiconductor technology to convert sunlight directly into electricity without the need for turbines, generators or any other moving parts. Photovoltaics' rapid evolution has been tied to advancements in solid state physics and, like the computer industry, its future development could revolutionize the way we live. [ 340 ] Photovoltaics' inherently modular technology lends itself to a wide variety of applications, ranging from hand-held calculators to rooftop generating systems and central station power plants. Because of this flexibility, and because PV systems can be used in diffuse or direct light in all climates - including every state in the U.S. - PV technology appears to have the greatest potential of all renewable resources. [ 341 ] Chart 15: Photovoltaic Conversion Efficiency PV production costs have fallen more than fiftyfold over the last 20 years, and generate power today at an average cost of 25 to 50 cents per kilowatt-hour for grid-connected applications. Grid-connected PV systems cost about $5 to $7 per watt to manufacture. At these prices, cost-effective PV applications are mainly for off-the-grid uses in remote locations where power is needed for water pumping, refrigeration, lighting, and communications. However, PVs can be cost-effective in specialized grid situations. For example, PV arrays sited at generating substations to support a utility's transmission and distribution system, and PV arrays sited at residential and commercial centers, have the potential to manage demand for electricity by shaving utility peak loads. The Boston Edison Company has found cost-effective applications for PVs, even at today's prices. The Union of Concerned Scientists, in an extensive study, concluded that as much as 31 percent of Boston Edison's electricity could be supplied by renewables, including PVs. Boston Edison's break-even cost of supplying electricity (without adding in externalities) is $5.20 per watt - within the current cost range of PVs. PV technology has matured to the point where it can be cost-effective when transmission expansion is necessary, and can play an important role in utility transmission and distribution planning. [ 342 ] As of 1994, the U.S. had just 18 megawatts of grid-connected PV installed capacity, and 25 megawatts of additional PV in stand-alone applications. [ 343 ] These numbers are expected to climb. Chart 15 shows the five principal PV technologies currently under development, and their present and projected efficiencies. With prices dropping, PV generation is likely to become a major source of clean power by the turn of the century. Amoco/Enron Solar. The domestic PV industry received a boost in January 1995 when Amoco Corp., which owns Solarex - the largest U.S. manufacturer and marketer of PV systems - launched a joint venture with Enron Corporation , the nation's largest natural gas company. Together, they propose to build a $25 million manufacturing facility to produce PV modules and a $150 million, 100-megawatt PV generating plant in Nevada that they maintain will be able to sell power profitably for 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (escalating by 3 percent annually over 30 years). [ 344 ] When production begins in 1996, the plant will manufacture in excess of 10 megawatts of large-area multijunction amorphous silicon modules annually. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) is perhaps the utility most committed to solar energy in the country. SMUD has implemented a wide range of solar technologies, including 2 megawatts of PV arrays located at its retired Rancho Seco nuclear power plant, 600 kilowatts of PV arrays at its Hedge substation (where it has developed a highly cost-effective single-axis mounting strategy), PV electric vehicle recharging stations, and rooftop solar collectors for residential and commercial customers. SMUD's "PV Pioneers" program has installed 4-kilowatt PV panels, manufactured by Siemens Solar, on customers' roofs, at a cost of $7.07 per peak watt. These customers seem eager to pay a premium for the satisfaction of generating and consuming clean, renewable electricity. [ 345 ] SMUD has installed more than 240 systems in Sacramento's residential neighborhoods, allowing the utility to gain valuable insights into decentralized generation, whereby customers also become generators, feeding small increments of power into the fingers of the distribution network where it is often needed most. SMUD's PV programs produced 63,971 megawatt-hours of cumulative power between 1986 and 1994. This electricity output, had it been produced by California's average mix, would have pumped 21,942 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. [ 346 ] Instead, it was emissions-free. Siemens Solar Industries. The leading U.S. PV producer, Siemens Solar, based in Camarillo, California, shipped approximately 15 megawatts of PV modules in 1994, and 12.5 megawatts of PV modules in 1993, representing more than half of all U.S. PV shipments and 21 percent of the global market. In February 1995, the company announced its intent to increase production capacity by nearly 50 percent. Its core technology is single crystalline solar cells, but Siemens Solar also is developing copper indium diselenide thin-film cells. Siemens Solar has also installed several grid-support systems. One is a 500-kilowatt PV installation at Pacific Gas and Electric Company's Kerman, California substation, which places the power generation source closer to the point of demand, reducing transmission and distribution costs. A second system, for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, includes four-kilowatt residential rooftop systems and a 200-kilowatt single axis tracking PV system for transmission and distribution support. Siemens Solar is also providing Southern California Edison Co. with off-grid systems. [ 347 ] 340.

Three solar thermal electric technologies - parabolic troughs,central receivers, and parabolic dishes - are being developed in the United States today. All three technologies use tracking mirrors to reflect and concentrate sunlightonto a central receiver, where the conversion to high temperature thermal energy takes place.

Parabolic Troughs Of the three technologies, only parabolic troughs have been developed to commercial scale. [ 348 ] Luz International, Ltd. installed parabolic trough technology at nine plants between 1984 and 1990. To finance the plants, Luz used federal and California tax incentives, international tax incentives for equipment purchases, and favorable power purchase agreements. Although Luz is now out of business, other owners are still operating its solar thermal plants, selling power to Southern California Edison. While Luz was operating the plants, it dramatically reduced generation costs from nearly 25 cents per kilowatt-hour in 1984 to around 9 cents per kilowatt-hour in 1989. Sandia National Laboratories estimates that new parabolic trough plants could produce electricity for 8 to 14 cents per kilowatt-hour, depending on tax incentives and plant size. [ 349 ] 348. Parabolic troughs consist of long rows of concentrators that are curved in only one dimension, forming troughs. The troughs are mounted on a single-axis tracking system that tracks the sun from east to west. They are lined with a reflective surface that focuses the sun's energy onto a pipe located along the trough's focal line. A heat transfer fluid is circulated through the pipes and then pumped to a central storage area, where it passes through a heat exchanger. The heat is then transferred to a working fluid, usually water, which is flashed into steam to drive a conventional steam turbine. Id., p. 451. 349. Without favorable tax treatment, a parabolic trough system would generate electricity for about 17 cents per kilowatt-hour today. Id.

Central Receivers The second solar thermal technology, central receivers - or "power towers" - have yet to be demonstrated on a commercial scale. [ 350 ] However, a 10-megawatt plant is scheduled to begin operation in early 1996 and continue through 1998. The project, known as Solar Two, is a partnership between the U.S. DOE and a consortium led by Southern California Edison. The project is upgrading a prior 10-megawatt demonstration system, known as Solar One, that produced more than 35,000 megawatt-hours of electricity at an installed capacity cost of approximately $14,000 per kilowatt-hour. [ 351 ] The new system is expected to do better, and will use a molten salt thermal storage system, enabling it to assist Southern California Edison's peak demand period by extending electricity generation into the early evening hours. Bechtel Corporation. Bechtel, with headquarters in San Francisco, is the project team manager for Solar Two, the 10-megawatt central receiver "power tower" project sponsored by a consortium of 15 companies and utilities, as well as the U.S. DOE. The consortium and the DOE will split the total cost of the project, estimated to be $48.5 million. Bechtel designed the Solar Two system, which basically converts the Solar One facility in Daggett, California from a pressurized water/steam receiver and oil/rock storage system to a molten nitrate salt receiver and thermal storage system. Solar Two will be able to collect and store solar heat in molten salt during the day and then generate electricity with it during cloudy periods or in the early evening, during peak demand. Construction began on Solar Two in November 1994. The consortium hopes to bring Solar Two on-line in late 1995 and to complete testing in 1998. The sponsors of Solar Two also contracted with Bechtel to develop a plan to commercialize the technology. [ 352 ] 350. Central receiver technology consists of a fixed receiver mounted on a tower surrounded by a large array of mirrors, known as heliostats. The heliostats track the sun and reflect its rays onto the receiver, which absorbs the heat. Within the receiver, a fluid absorbs the receiver's heat energy and then is transported from the receiver to a turbine generator or a storage tank. Id., p. 454. 351. Id., pp. 454-55. 352 Id., p. 467.

Parabolic Dishes The third solar thermal technology, parabolic-dish generating systems, achieve the highest performance of the three solar thermal designs in terms of annually collected energy and absorption of peak sunlight. [ 353 ] During the past 15 years, about eight systems ranging in size from a few kilowatts to 50 kilowatts have been built and operated in the United States, although recent development has largely been confined to industry and government cost-shared research and development. The DOE is investing in a utility-scale joint venture to develop a 25-kilowatt system that utilizes advanced Stirling engines at the concentrator focal point. The DOE hopes to spark commercialization of dish/Stirling systems, and expects the systems eventually to achieve capital costs of $1,500 per kilowatt-hour (for systems augmented by fossil fuels) and a levelized energy cost of 6 cents per kilowatt-hour. [ 354 ] Cummins Power Generation, Inc. Cummins Power Generation (CPG) is a subsidiary of Cummins Engine Co. of Columbus, Indiana. CPG is America's foremost producer of dish/Stirling systems. CPG is developing two systems - a 7-kilowatt and a 25-kilowatt system - both of which were selected by the U.S. DOE's Joint Venture Program for commercial demonstration. Under both contracts, CPG's systems will employ a free-piston Stirling engine driven directly by high heater head temperatures of 675° Celsius. The entire structure of parabolic dishes will track the sun as it moves. 353. Parabolic dish generating systems consist of parabolic-shaped point-focus concentrators that reflect solar energy onto a receiver mounted at the focal point. Parabolic dishes typically use dozens of curved reflective panels made of glass or laminated films, mounted on a structure that tracks the sun. When the concentrated sunlight hits the receiver, it is either directly utilized by a heat engine, or used to heat a fluid that is transmitted to a central engine. Id., p. 457. 354. Id., pp. 457-58.

Geothermal Geothermal energy is heat stored beneath the earth's surface. The amount of heat ultimately recoverable is dependent on the technology available to tap it. Some geothermal sites may be developed in a sustainable manner so that the heat withdrawn equals the heat being replaced naturally. Practically speaking, potential geothermal resources are so large that they are not considered depletable. [ 355 ] Geothermal power has been in commercial production since about 1960, with the United States leading the world with more than 3,000 megawatts of installed capacity. [ 356 ] Since the early 1990s, however, geothermal development has been hindered by slumping U.S. energy markets in the West, where most of today's usable domestic geothermal resources are located. Despite a drop in geothermal electricity costs to between 4.5 and 7 cents per kilowatt-hour, low natural gas prices have made it difficult for geothermal to compete. [ 357 ] Nevertheless, because gas prices eventually will rise, geothermal resources have a tremendous potential to provide clean and sustainable energy in the future. Pacific Gas and Electric . Electric utilities, primarily Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), were the first in the United States to build geothermal generating facilities. PG&E owns about three-quarters of the capacity of The Geysers, a 35-square-mile dry steam field in Northern California, that has an infrastructure investment of about $3.5 billion. The Geysers has about 500 wells, most of which are 6,000 to 10,000 feet deep, tapping into a steam reservoir whose temperatures exceed 220° Celsius. The field has been in production since 1960, but began to decline in 1988, when it reached a peak output of 2,000 megawatts. [ 358 ] PG&E has found geothermal to be highly economical. The first ten PG&E power plants at The Geysers - completed between 1960 and 1974 - were all built for less than $200 per kilowatt. In the late 1970s, however, the cost of new plants at The Geysers started to rise because less desirable sites were used. Two PG&E units brought on-line in 1985 had an average capital cost of about $1,400 per kilowatt. More recent projects had an average capital cost of about $2,500 per kilowatt. Despite the production decline at The Geysers, geothermal remains one of PG&E's lowest-cost sources of power over the life of the facilities, and in 1994 represented around 10 percent of PG&E's thermal generating capacity. [ 359 ] P> California Energy Company, Inc. California Energy Company, based in Omaha, Nebraska, is the world's largest independent geothermal power company, with operations in the United States, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The company operates 13 geothermal facilities with a total capacity of 575 megawatts, has contracted to provide over 1,500 megawatts in the future, and has projects under construction totaling another 540 megawatts. [ 360 ] In 1990, the California Energy Company received the National Environmental Achievement Award for its 288-megawatt Coso project at the U.S. Naval Weapons Center in Inyo County, California. The company plans to expand this facility - a nine-unit steam geothermal complex - to around 600 megawatts. In 1995, California Energy acquired Magma Power Co. Co., another leader in the geothermal industry, and made it a wholly-owned subsidiary. Magma Power operates seven power plants (three purchased from Unocal in 1993) totaling 264 megawatts in the Salton Sea Known Geothermal Area in California's Imperial Valley.361 In 1993, California Energy sold 4,103 megawatt-hours of its geothermal electricity to Southern California Edison. This geothermal electricity offset 1,407 metric tons of carbon dioxide that otherwise would have been emitted by California's average generation mix. [ 362 ] 355. Id., pp. 185-86. 356. Id., p. 185. 357. Id., pp. 185-86. 358. In 1994, production stood at about 1,250 megawatts. Field operators expect an additional 50 percent decline over the next 20 years, to about 600 megawatts. Although industry estimates that only about 5 percent of the field's geothermal heat has been tapped, the decline stems from depletion of fluid in the field. Over-building has contributed to the fluid decline, as well as the practice of reinjecting only about 20 percent of the fluid used in production (the other 80 percent is evaporated in cooling towers). By adding fluid from external sources, including reinjecting most of the produced fluid and modifying power plant design, The Geysers could supply at least several hundred megawatts of electricity for another 50 years.

Conclusion Renewables will be a key component of any national strategy to cut carbon dioxide emissions and reduce the threat of global climate change. Renewables costs have fallen steeply and are expected to drop further. Wind energy is already nearly cost-competitive with fossil generation - even when the high social and environmental costs of fossil fuels are not added to their prices. Photovoltaics are already cost-effective for certain transmission and distribution expansion applications, and are often the best option for off-grid generation. Solar thermal technologies continue to improve thanks to prudent federal government assistance, and offer promise as large-scale, centralized generation facilities. Geothermal is a proven technology yet to tap its vast geographic potential.

On Sept. 29, 1993, the Big Three automakers committed todeveloping a triple-efficiency "clean car" prototypewithin a decade. A really efficient car, however, can'tbe made by pursuing incremental refinements to afundamentally obsolete concept of the automobile. Aleapfrog is needed, is now feasible, and can far surpassthe 1993 goal. Striking technological innovations havebeen made that, artfully integrated, can yield safe,affordable and otherwise superior cars getting hundredsof miles per gallon. Accelerating today's heavy steel cars requires enginesso large that their efficiency is halved: only 15-20percent of the gasoline's energy is available to movethe car, and only 1 percent available to move thedriver. Almost all of the lost power heats the tires androad, the brakes, and the air pushed aside by the car. The key to the super-efficient "hypercar" is first tomake it ultralight. Advanced composite materials can cuttotal weight three- to four-fold while improving safety.Sleeker streamlining can cut aerodynamic drag whilebetter tires and lowered weight will reduce tire androad loss. Once this ultralight strategy has largelyeliminated unrecoverable energy losses, the remainingloss of wheelpower is braking. But if the wheels aredriven by special electric motors, those motors can actas electronic brakes that convert motion back intouseful electricity. A long driving range can then be achieved by burning anyliquid or gaseous fuel, in a tiny onboard engine orother powerplant, to make electricity to run thewheel-motors. A few batteries can temporarily store and reuserecovered braking energy. This "hybrid" technologycombines the best of gasoline and electric cars. Combining these approaches yields extraordinarysynergies. Adding hybrid-electric drive to an ordinaryproduction car increases its efficiency by one-third toone-half. Making an ordinary car ultralight doubles itsefficiency. But doing both together can boost a car'sefficiency by about tenfold. Amory B. and L.

If drivers were charged directly for using roads,there would be fewer traffic jams, less pollution, andgreater incentive to use transit systems. A treacherous gap has opened between our perceptionthat driving costs almost nothing, and the reality ofthe enormous cost we actually pay to drive. Gasoline prices have been at a post-World War II low,and efficient cars stretch gasoline dollars. We oftenenjoy "free" parking and rarely pay tolls. Most carownership costs-purchase price, fees, andinsurance-don't go up the more we drive. But driving costs are actually high and they aregrowing. The true costs of driving are detailed in areport commissioned by the Conservation Law Foundation,released in May 1994. For each form of transportation,researchers at Apogee Research Inc., a leadingconsulting firm, tallied personal expenses, governmentcosts, and environmental and other impacts. The conclusions: Parking costs as much as 24 cents permile of solo driving, in land, maintenance, and taxbreaks. Ignoring damage to crops, plant and animal life,and buildings, air pollution costs 7 to 11 cents permile. Accident costs not covered by insurance add 1 to 6cents. Personal expenses like insurance add 40 to 67cents. And if one considers government spending, taxbreaks, and the trade effects of dependence on foreignoil, gas costs half again the pump price. In the Boston region, solo driving costs 81 centsto 94 cents per mile, and that doesn't include manyunquantifiable expenses, like the costs of sprawl andoil spills. By comparison, the costs of transit rangesfrom 29 to 64 cents per mile; carpooling from 34 to 41cents; and walking or bicycling from 13 to 14 cents.

If streets are well laid-out and destinations arebrought closer, people can get around without having todrive. At the turn of the century, West Garfield was a thrivingcommunity on Chicago's West Side, offering jobs, easytransportation, and a regional park. But today themedian household income of its declining population isonly $15,102, and 40 percent of the neighborhood lotsare vacant. Things are improving, though. Garfield Park is being refurbished, a regional library has opened, and the LakeStreet El Coalition stopped the Chicago TransitAuthority from shutting down the elevated train linethat serves the neighborhood. In 1993, the coalitionadvanced an ambitious plan, assembled by theCenter for Neighborhood Technology(CNT), to use Pulaski Station on the Green Line as thecenterpiece of a pedestrian-friendly, transit-basedredevelopment model designed to boost ridership byincreasing density and encouraging sustainable economicdevelopment. Specifics of the plan include on-site policing, childcare, retail stores, and business offices at PulaskiStation, which would become an intermodal hub with ashuttle to the nearby commercial strip, and with bicyclelockers, traffic calming, and a pedestrian-orientedshopping strip. In-filling would provide greater housingvariety, while technical and financial assistance wouldhelp retain manufacturing jobs. Lake Street would bedesignated a "green industrial area" to recruitenvironmental businesses. The project should save more than 1,500 vehicle milestraveled per day. Because the Lake Michigan area has notattained national air quality standards, the projectqualified for a $4 million capital grant through thefederal transportation act. Because this project willhelp clean the air, CNT was able to secure demonstrationfunds for similar plans at four other inner-city GreenLine stations.

POST OFFICE BOX 748 CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS 02139 (617) 868-9386 JULY 20, 1991    OLSEN:   What's the difference between synthetic THC and natural THC?    MCKINNEY:   Molecularly speaking, there's no difference at all.   The only difference between getting THC out of the plant, is when you get it out of the plant, the residuals, the impurities, are all these dismissive molecules, which are other plant molecules, of course.   When you make synthetic THC, the only residual impurity, quote-unquote, is delta-8 THC, so Marinol's technically 95% THC and 5% delta-8 THC, whereas marijuana is 5% THC and 95% plant material which apparently has no effect, because every time people give all this testimony and talk about the effects of smoking marijuana, or whatever, whenever they talk about the effects, the effects are identical from the effects of taking THC.    OLSEN:   You said there's never been any ..., you know, when people talk about marijuana, they're talking about THC, because none of the other chemicals have ever been tested.    MCKINNEY:   Exactly.  Well, it's not that they haven't been tested, they've been tested, but there's been no real indication that they have an effect to the extent that it changes the effect of smoking marijuana.  In other words, there's never been a test on any of the other drugs that are in marijuana that indicated they have dramatic enough effects that they would be changing the effect of THC.  Say, maybe, there was, you know, 2% water in your orange juice, it wouldn't do a lot of difference to the orange juice.  It would be slightly diluted, but you wouldn't taste any difference, and you wouldn't feel any difference.  So, what's happening is, the government charges, which are totally specious, is that there are these other things in marijuana, sure, but not one of these other things in marijuana has been shown to be dangerous or problematical, nor has it ever been shown that those experiencing the effects of marijuana are experiencing the effects of anything else but THC.    OLSEN:   What about the argument that smoking marijuana is bad because it's smoke?    MCKINNEY:   That, per se, is silly, because the National Cancer Institute will tell you that unless you smoke more than four cigarettes a day, there's no determination that you're moving towards lung damage, and very few people are smoking more than four joints a day.    OLSEN:  Is there anything different about marijuana smoke than tobacco smoke    MCKINNEY:  No.  Actually, marijuana does have a slightly tarrier smoke.  It's about 30% to 40% tarrier, but, again, we go down to how many joints a day.    OLSEN:  What about the bronchodilator and bronchoconstrictor things?    MCKINNEY:  That has to do with the effects of THC on the smooth muscle.  Initially, it acts as a stimulator, which causes smooth muscle to contract, which gives you that feeling of your diaphragm getting tight, or people say that smoke is expanding.  That's ridiculous.  Smoke is not expanding their diaphragm, it's contracting.  It's because it effects all smooth muscle immediately, making it contract.    OLSEN:  Well, they say marijuana's like a bronchodilator, and tobacco is a bronchoconstrictor.    MCKINNEY:  Who say?    OLSEN:  I've read this over and over again.    MCKINNEY:   Yeah, well, there's a lot of things.  People used to say you could bury your dope in the ground, it would get full of mold and everything.  There's a lot of bullshit around in this business, because there's so many people    OLSEN:  I've also heard that it was good for migraines, because it expanded the blood vessels in the brain.    MCKINNEY:  Well, that's complete bullshit, because there's nothing that's going to give you a headache faster than expanding the blood vessels in the brain.  In fact, the two kinds of headaches that we normally have, one is caused by constriction of the muscles in the neck which drops the blood pressure in the brain, the other is caused by exhaustion which by making the smooth muscles relax ...    OLSEN:  Well, it was described to me as the migraine or the headache comes from constricting of the blood vessels, cutting off the supply of oxygen to the brain.    MCKINNEY:  No.  No, not at all.  If you cut off the blood supply to the brain, you'd be dead.  It just drops the blood pressure slightly.    OLSEN:  Well, just restricting the flow, I mean, somewhat.    MCKINNEY:  Restricting the flow drops the blood pressure, doesn't it?    OLSEN:  I don't know.    MCKINNEY:  Well, let's face it.  You've got X amount of blood pressure, and you put less blood in.  Come on.    OLSEN:  Yeah.  I don't know.  It was described to me as being a reduction in oxygen.    MCKINNEY:  By a licensed physician who had a knowledge of cardiovascular things, or some marijuana advocate?  Let's get straight here.  Who are we talking to, experts or Merlins?    OLSEN:  No.  I just heard this.  I'm just checking it out.    MCKINNEY:  Don't believe a thing you hear, unless the guy who is saying it .    OLSEN:  Well, I don't believe a thing I hear.  I repeat it as being something I heard, and that's all the value I give it.    MCKINNEY:  Between you and me, I won't pass along anything.  Ever since I've been in the drug education business, since 1970, I always check it out with the medical journals before I repeat anything.    OLSEN:  Well, of course, well, I just thought I'd check with you, since you're that kind of a person.    MCKINNEY:  Well, here's the word.  THC from a plant and THC from a vat are absolutely identical.  However, since that's the case, and since no one smoking marijuana has ever described the symptoms of smoking marijuana as being different from those of having an effect of THC, we are really putting people in jail for an alternative administration of a legal drug, and that's what I keep saying.  If you vaporize a plant to get your THC molecules, even though they re mixed with a lot of other crap, sure, it's ineffective, but it's simply an alternative mode of administration.  And the Drug Enforcement Administration has to admit that people smoking marijuana are self-medicating themselves with THC.  And if you talk about self-medication, instead of getting high, and you talked about self-medication with crude THC, rather than smoking a doobie, now you re talking about using this wonder drug that everyone says is so safe.    OLSEN:  Yeah.  Yeah, OK, tell me now, what are the two chemicals that are used to make THC synthetically.    MCKINNEY:  Olivitol and paramenthadianol , And you react the two, and I'm not certain how you react the two, I mean, that's the part I don't know.  Do you put it in a pressure cooker?  Do you put it in a special apparatus?  Do you do this?  Do you do that?  I'm not sure.  But you react the two together.  It is being done at Norac Industries owned by Chester, Dr.  Chester, McCluskey in Azusa, California.  I mean, this is something that ought to he fun.  You could get a sort of a tour of the lab.  You could get all the marijuana activists out to Azusa and stand around the place where they make the THC.    OLSEN:  Yeah.  I'm interested in where they get these two chemicals from, too.    MCKINNEY:  They get it from Sandoz in New Jersey.    OLSEN:  And do you have any idea how Sandoz gets it?    MCKINNEY:  They make it.    OLSEN:  OK.  And do you have any idea how they make it?    MCKINNEY:  Yeah, from a lot of other stuff.  I think they start with gallac acid.  I'm not certain, but I think they start with gallac acid.  I'm not sure, but the thing is, someone told me ...  Carl Nocka is the man who makes it.    OLSEN:  OK.  Got his address?    MCKINNEY:  Carl Nocka is the man who makes the olivitol for Sandoz.  I believe it's Sandoz, in their chemical division.  He describes the process of making olivitol as mouse milk.    OLSEN:  OK.  Is there any way I could find out from this guy, or from anybody else, exactly where the organic compounds come from?  What do they start out with?  Where do they get the plant material or the mineral material?    MCKINNEY:  There's no plant material.    OLSEN:  Well, where do they get the minerals from then, to start this whole process?    MCKINNEY:  Well, they usually get them out of the ground.    OLSEN:  Yeah.  And what are they?  What are the minerals?    MCKINNEY:  Well, it comes down to probably atoms of carbon and nitrogen, and things like that.  You see, when you talk about biosynthesis, it means the plant, using its own clever bits of iona this and iona that, is shifting the molecules back and forth.  Let's also recall that the plant doesn't make tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it makes tetrahydrocannabinolic acid and then it has to be decarboxylated by heat.  Now, the other way of making THC is to make cannabidiol and then reverse isomerize it, which the isomerizer never did do, into THC.  That's the Razdan process.  You see, the thing is, that when you're making THC, if you let the reaction go too far, you end up with cannabidiol.  And, what the Razdan process locked into, the fact was, take it all the way to cannabidiol and then turn the cannabidiol into THC.  That's how they do Razdan THC, which is the stuff that Harry Pars wanted to put on the market.  Remember, THC can be made by anybody for nausea, it can't be made by anyone else excepting Unimed for weight gain.    OLSEN:  OK.  Why?    MCKINNEY:  Why?  Because they got an orphan drug from the United States government, a monopoly.  That's why this whole thing started.  Kapoor, an Indian fellow with $200 million, took over Unimed and then he got an orphan drug for weight gain, and pushed forward with a lot of government pressure, and they opened up the market in Europe by having the UN change their OKs on THC.    OLSEN:  OK.  What's an orphan drug?    MCKINNEY:  Orphan drug means when a drug supposedly has so little market that making the ..., the expense of creating an FDA passable version of the drug would exceed the money that a person was going to make from it.  It's called an orphan drug.  That means that nobody really wants to make it, because it's not profitable enough.  So, in order to induce a company to make an orphan drug, the government gives one company a monopoly.  So, Unimed has a monopoly.  The interesting thing about Unimed is that it's owned by an Indian named John Kapoor who lives in Chicago, but it's distributed by Roxane Laboratories which is wholly, privately, owned by the German drug cartel Boehringer-Ingelheim, which means that the profits from this drug are going to Germany.  And, the people who make the olivitol are Sandoz.  It's a Swiss company.  So, the profits from the manufacture of the raw ingredients go to Switzerland.  All the money from this wonderful drug goes out of the United States, increasing our deficit.  If we grew it in this country and made it, it would be American THC.  This is sold by the Germans, with ingredients made by the Swiss.  And we could do it all ourselves.  The original work was done by Arthur D. Little and was picked up by Unimed back in 1983, because no one else wanted to make it.  The capsules are made by Banner Laboratories in Los Angeles.  So, the THC, pure THC, is shipped from Norac to Banner, Banner puts it into capsules and ships it to the Cleveland, Ohio, warehouse of Roxane Laboratories.    OLSEN:  How do you think that the government can keep marijuana illegal then?    MCKINNEY:  Well, because, you see, the law, as was written by John Mitchell, is the Controlled Substances Act.  If it was the Controlled Drug Act, we'd have a real problem, because in modern day we don't think of a drug as being a collection of substances, but as being a specific molecule.  But, by calling it a Controlled Substances Act, you can play all sorts of legal rubbery games like saying that cocaine is in Schedule 2, because there's a medical use for cocaine, but crack is in Schedule 1.    OLSEN:  And the coca plant is in Schedule 2.    MCKINNEY:  Yes.  But, what I'm trying to point out is, although cocaine is in Schedule 2, and they can't get it out of Schedule 2, to make more money for the police and the Justice Department, crack is in Schedule 1, which means there is no medical intervention, it's all in the hands of the police, although, chemically speaking, crack and cocaine are precisely the same.  It's simply another form of it.  And that's why I say you have the Controlled Substances Act.  That's how you can have the entire peyote plant in that category, or the entire marijuana plant, because it's a substance.  THC is in Schedule 2.  Marijuana is in Schedule 1.  It's in Schedule I supposedly because it contains a drug called THC which is in Schedule 2.  However, if you take the THC out of marijuana, it's still in Schedule 1, even though its got its drug taken out of it, because it's the marijuana that's the controlled substance, and that is the trick to a controlled substance.  They could make Scotch Tape into a controlled substance.    OLSEN:  Why is marijuana then, without THC, in Schedule I and tobacco is legal?    MCKINNEY:  Because, in Schedule I in the Controlled Substances Act they define a number of different items, and marijuana is defined as the leaves and the flowering tops and everything made of the marijuana plant.  That's the legal definition.    OLSEN:  But how can you call it due process, I mean, how is it fair that a classification include something and doesn't include something else, when they both fit the same definition?    MCKINNEY:  No one ever said the body of law in any country is particularly good.  In Arabia, they chop your head off.  I mean, let's face it, the laws are never anything but the current reflection of popular political opinion.  So, what you're looking at here is a drug which is itself, at 95%, considered to be a wonder drug, safe, never been an overdose.  OK?  But, at 5% in a plant, it's in the same category as heroin.  In other words, when it's 20 or 30 times more potent, it's legal.  But, when it's so crude, when it's in its crudest form, it's like saying gasoline and crude oil ...    OLSEN:  Well, aren't they saying, because of the fact that it's only 5% and it's mixed with all this other stuff, that that's why it's worse that the 95% pure?    MCKINNEY:  Well, what they're saying, whenever you try to make marijuana into Schedule 2, is that there are all these other things which haven't been tested.  They make you put marijuana through the same test you'd put THC through, which is to say, what are the impurities?," and of course there are 423 molecules in marijuana, only one of them is THC.  So, if you take out the THC, how many impurities have you got?  422.  That's how they do it.  Because, normally, when you make a drug, you've got to test the impurities and see if they're OK, and see if they have any effect.  Can you imagine anyone wanting to test 422 other molecules?  Now, the only thing I have, there's been a change in the generic drug laws that says you don't have to duplicate the entire procedure, but you do have to make it equivalent, its got to have the same effect.  And when the FDA told us that they didn't care where you got THC from, as long as it was 95% pure, there was some question there.  But what it comes right down to is that nobody in the marijuana movement, including Richard Dennis, wants to put their money behind the one simple routine that would change everything, which I've been talking about for the last four years, which is a very simple movement to change the definition of marijuana in the rule books.  All you have to do is include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as one of the legal products of the plant, along with hemp seed and hemp cloth and hemp this and hemp that, and the whole thing would fall apart immediately, because then you would have the anomaly of a plant which had its active ingredient removed still being in Schedule 1.  It would fall apart on its own ridiculousness.  And yet ...    OLSEN:  In other words, you're saying that it would be looked at like tobacco?    MCKINNEY:  Yeah.  I mean, it wouldn't be looked at like tobacco.  Suppose that you had a lemon, and vitamin C was legal, but lemons were illegal because they had vitamin C, and a lemon was defined as everything that comes off the lemon tree.    OLSEN:  Yeah.  Well, you re saying marijuana is illegal because it has THC in it.    MCKINNEY:  I'm saying that the way that the government keeps marijuana illegal is by broadcasting the idea that marijuana contains a dangerous drug.  The dangerous drug they refer to is THC at 5%.  On the other side of their mouth, they're calling THC a safe and harmless drug at 95%.  In other words, when the THC is in sesame oil, which is the only other ingredient in Marinol, surrounded by a gelatin capsule, it's a wonder drug.  When the THC is in a hemp stalk, surrounded by hemp fibers, it's Schedule I criminal, and how it would be illegal for us to hack our way into there and pull the legal drug out.  You see, to us, to our way of thinking, and our argument all along, we're going into a plant to pull out something legal, and we're calling the plant illegal because its got the legal stuff in it.  It doesn't make any sense.  You can simply say that the people smoking marijuana are self-medicating themselves with the effects of THC, which are found by the government to be safe, efficacious, and absolutely harmless.  There's never been an overdose, there's never been a death.  And they're just people who have, you know, nausea maybe?  Who knows, maybe they want to gain weight.  Fine, let them self-medicate.  Why can't they medicate by taking it out of the plant?  It's like saying you've got to have pure synthetic maple syrup, you can't tap a tree.    OLSEN:  So, is there another way to get THC out of marijuana besides smoking it, and without refining it?    MCKINNEY:  No.    OLSEN:  Is there some way to use the raw marijuana at home, does it have to go through some ...    MCKINNEY:  You can't get pure THC out of it.    OLSEN:  You can't?    MCKINNEY:  You can't.  No.  You can get maybe a solution as high as 65% or 75%, you can.  That's about as high as you con go.  The reason it costs nearly as much to make natural THC is because there's so much more gunk to clear out with the liquid chromatograms.  When you've only got two molecules to separate, it's not so hard.  When you've got 400 to separate, it's harder.    OLSEN:  It would be more expensive to make THC from a plant than it would be to ...?    MCKINNEY:  As expensive.  Until you get into serious large production, there's no real advantage.  The one thing that's the biggest advantage is you don't have to rely on a lot of complex expensive chemicals made by a lot of complex expensive companies.  When Carl Nocka said that making olivitol was mouse milk, what he meant was it takes a hell of a lot of whatever they use to make it out of to make a little bit.  It's a very low yield process.  That's why olivitol costs $1,000 a kilogram.  Very expensive.  Now, in the making of THC from the raw materials, it costs a lot more to refine it, but the raw materials are cheaper.  You see, the liquid chromatogram uses packed columns of silica gel which will retard certain molecules and let other molecules go through.  And what happens is that it retards the cannabinoids say, but then eventually the little granules in the tube become all clogged up with what they're trying to sieve out.  And the problem is because there's so many similar molecules to THC in the gunk, that you can't run the solution through the tubes more than two or three times and it's all gunked up.  And, silica gel costs $150 to $250 a kilogram.  It's like sand.  It's specially treated sand, for all intents and purposes.  But the fact is, it's expensive, and when you have a synthetic, which only has delta-9 and delta-8, you can see it's a lot easier to separate them.  Still, the most expensive part of making the synthetic is separating the delta-9 so you end up with a 95% solution.    OLSEN:  You have to do this no matter how you make it, right?    MCKINNEY:  You always have to go to the liquid chromatogram for the last stage.  The thing is, when you make it synthetically, you end up with an 80% solution, and there are only two molecules in that solution.  In the making of natural , you end up with a 75% solution, 25% of which is made up of 420 different other things.  However, generically speaking, this may not be as important if it's shown that tests have no differences in the effect.  The only reason that Perdue-Frederick dropped that is because there wasn't enough sales of the synthetic.  Otherwise, they would have backed us with the natural.    OLSEN:  They would have kept testing?    MCKINNEY:   They would have backed us with the natural.  They didn't test.  They never got to that stage.  But the funny thing is that, of course, if they push the synthetic enough, or course, other people will come in line and start working with the natural, hopefully.  And, if they're going to make the natural, they're going to have to make it out of the plant, and the plant will have to drop to Schedule 2, as all precursors of Schedule 2 drugs have to be in the same schedule.  You can't have a precursor of a drug in a higher schedule than the drug itself.    OLSEN:  What is a precursor?  You mean the plant?    MCKINNEY:  The plant, the poppy.    OLSEN:  The coca plant?    MCKINNEY:   Yeah.  The poppy plant is in Schedule 2, opium poppy.  And, if, say, for instance, if mescaline became legal, they'd have to put peyote in Schedule 2 for the same reason.  And that's why I keep saying, if we can only get natural THC into Schedule 2, it would force marijuana into Schedule 2.  But the nutniks in the marijuana reform movement are all a bunch of ex-hippies sitting around rolling doobies on the back porch and gazing at the sun and saying, "Oh wow!"  They're not realizing there are two important things to do.  First, it's very easy to change the definition if it looks like you're doing it to keep marijuana away from people.  And by simply slipping in a definitional change in the marijuana definition in the law, state by state, you can slip that through the legislatures with no one getting excited, because they wouldn't understand what you were really doing.  It sounds like you're, you know, bringing the definition up to date, because in 1985 THC became legal, therefore, THC is defined as the psychoactive drug in marijuana, and that's the way it's defined in the Physician's Desk Reference, the PDR.    OLSEN:  Well, you know, Iowa's law says that marijuana's in both Schedule I and Schedule 2.  Schedule I says it has no medical use, and Schedule 2 says it does, and what you just said would be a way to solve, to make the Iowa law make sense and accomplish exactly what they tried to accomplish without making it look like a bunch of idiots wrote it.    MCKINNEY:  You can change the definition so that marijuana is illegal, excepting for the products, and one of those products would be pure, it could be pharmaceutically pure THC.    OLSEN:  Which would be Schedule 2.    MCKINNEY:  Yeah.  Now, the legislatures and the lawmakers know if anyone wouldn't realize what they were doing by changing that to make it clear that only pharmaceutically pure THC from the marijuana plant would be considered legal, but the rest of it's no good, it sounds like you're making it impossible for someone to do this, but whet they are doing is that they're making marijuana the precursor of a legal drug.

Bonner, Administrator  Drug Enforcement Administration  Washington, D.C. 20537  Dear Mr. Bonner:       I just finished reading your decision on the Marijuana Rescheduling Petition, 57 FR 10499 (March 26, 1992).  Your explanation of the scheduling criteria in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) left me confused.  By your definition, a substance in Schedule II is a scientifically established chemical compound capable of reproduction in standardized dosages.  Of course, marijuana is not such a substance, it is a plant, not a drug.       Although you made no mention of the fact, the coca plant, from which cocaine is made, and the opium plant, from which morphine and heroin are made, are both in Schedule II of the CSA.  As I was reading your decision, I wondered how these two plants can be in Schedule II.  These plants are subject to the same variances in chemistry as the marijuana plant.  It seems like you are treating marijuana unfairly.       If Congress intended to rely on scientifically established chemistry and reproducible dosages, why did Congress include the coca and opium plants in Schedule II?       It seems to me that these plants should not be included in the CSA at all, because they will never fit into your definition of drugs, and I think your definition is correct as far as it goes.  However, since Congress has decided to include them in the CSA, your definition is inadequate to explain them.  I hope you will correct your definition, and not simply ignore this apparent inconsistency.       Thank you for your attention.       Sincerely,       Carl Eric Olsen       (515) 243-7351 WT01-B18-240IA087-000632-B040-61http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/DEA/bonner-2.html 206.61.184.43 19970122071715 text/html 2321HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:17:05 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:11:36 GMTContent-length: 2106 August 17, 1992  Dear Mr. Olsen:       This is in response to your letter of July 21, 1992, regarding my decision with respect to the Marijuana Rescheduling Petition.       Your letter correctly states that one of the factors to be considered in determining whether a substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment is that it is a scientifically established chemical compound capable of reproduction in standardized dosages.  While you are also correct in noting that Congress placed coca and opium plant materials in Schedule II, your attempt to analogize those substances to marijuana, and to find inconsistency in their scheduling, fails.       In placing coca leaves and opium plant material in Schedule II, Congress was very much aware that these plant materials have historically been recognized as the source for a variety of accepted and useful medications.  Neither of these plants are used medicinally as plant material.  In both instances, the medically active alkaloids are extracted from the plant material after which pharmaceutical compounds capable of reproduction in standardized dosages are produced.  These compounds are the medications which may then be lawfully marketed in the United States.  While indigenous populations in various parts of the world brew coca teas, chew coca leaves, and smoke opium for various purposes, these practices are not permitted in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act.       Unlike pharmaceuticals derived from opium and coca leaves, the petition to reschedule marijuana did not involve the scheduling of any medically useful compound to be extracted from the plant material.  Instead, the petition involved unsupported claims for the medical use of smoked marijuana.  There is, therefore, no inconsistency in my finding that such claims did not make a case for accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.       Very truly yours,       Robert C.

Bonner, Administrator  DrugEnforcement Administration  Washington, D.C. 20537  Dear Mr. Bonner:       Carl Eric Olsen hereby petitions the Administrator to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) pursuant to Section 201 of the CSA, Public Law 91-513, 21 U.S.C. � 811 and 21 C.F.R. � 1307.03.       Attached hereto and constituting a part of this petition is a statement of the grounds upon which petitioner relies for the proposed rescheduling.       Five copies of this petition are provided pursuant to 21 C.F.R. � 1308.44(b).

Marijuana is currently in Schedule I of the CSA.      On March 26, 1992, the Administrator made a final decision in a marijuana rescheduling petition, DEA No. 86-22, rejecting the finding of an administrative law judge that marijuana has medical use in treatment in the United States, and rejecting the administrative law judge's recommendation that marijuana be moved to Schedule II of the CSA.  57 FR 10499.      The essence of the decision was that marijuana is a plant and not a drug.  The Administrator argued that the chemistry of the marijuana plant is complex, varies from plant to plant, and is incapable of reproduction in standardized dosages (attributes common to all plants), and that a drug is a scientifically established chemical compound capable of reproduction in standardized dosages.      The Administrator's decision has been appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by several parties seeking medical access to marijuana plants.      According to the Administrator, "the petition to reschedule marijuana did not involve the scheduling of any medically useful compound to be extracted from the plant material."  The Administrator went on the say, "the petition involved unsupported claims for medical use of smoked marijuana."  See Exhibit A.      As for other plants in Schedule II, the Administrator said, "In placing coca leaves and opium plant material in Schedule II, Congress was very much aware that these plant materials have historically been recognized as the source for a variety of accepted and useful medications."  The Administrator went on to say, "Neither of these plants are used medicinally as plant material."  See Exhibit A.      It must follow from the Administrator's explanation that marijuana need not have an accepted medical use in treatment in the United States in order to be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA, it only needs to be shown that marijuana is a source for an accepted and useful medication.      On October 11, 1985, the Administrator proposed to reschedule dronabinol to Schedule II of the CSA.  50 FR 42186 (October 18, 1985); 21 C.F.R. � 1308.12(f)(1) (1991).  Dronabinol is the synthetic equivalent of the isomer of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol which is the principle psychoactive substance present in Cannabis Sativa L., marijuana.  50 FR 42186 (October 18, 1985).      Dronabinol is the U.S. Adopted Name (USAN) for the substance (6aR-trans)-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-dibenzo [b,d] pyran-1-ol or (-)-delta-9-(trans)-tetrahydrocannabinol, the principle psychoactive substance in Cannabis sativa L., marijuana.  50 FR 42186 (October 18, 1985).  It has the empirical formula C21H30O2 with molecular weight of 314.45.  1989 Physician's Desk Reference, page 1859.        On May 24, 1991, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ESCOR) rescheduled delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol from Schedule I to Schedule II of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.  U.N. Doc. E/CN.7/1991/26.  Report of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs on its thirty-fourth session, U.N. Doc. E/1991/24, Supp. No. 4.  The United States is a party to that international convention pursuant to the Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-633, November 10, 1978).  50 FR 42186 (October 18, 1985).      Since marijuana is now a source for an accepted and useful medication, it must now be moved from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA.

The crux of your petition is that marijuana itself need not have an accepted medical use in treatment in the United States if it is shown that marijuana is the source of an accepted and useful medication.  To that end, you argue that marijuana should be rescheduled as a source of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol because dronabinol, the synthetic form of the same isomer, is controlled in Schedule II.       In a final rule published on May 13, 1986, then Administrator John C. Lawn placed a very specific substance, synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules, in Schedule II.  Administrator Lawn's action did not involve the rescheduling of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol itself, nor did it include any form of dronabinol other than the synthetic.  Accordingly, pursuant to 21 C.F.R. � 1308.44(c), your petition to reschedule marijuana is not accepted.       Since I am not accepting your petition on the grounds that dronabinol is a wholly synthetic substance, not obtained from marijuana, it is unnecessary for me to consider the broader question of whether the rescheduling of marijuana would be appropriate if accepted medications were indeed obtained from that source.  As you are well aware, the issue of whether marijuana itself has any accepted medical use is pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  We are confident that the Court will find no merit in the petition and that it will affirm my ruling in that case.       Very truly yours,       Robert C.

It is true that a good many drugs useful in therapeutics can be extracted from herbs.  Some drugs have an animal origin, e.g., many hormones.  A synthetic drug is a drug that is made by chemically combining various starting materials to make the desired product.  The product is then identical in all respects to the product isolated from a plant source.  Such a product can be marketed under the same name.  For example, cortisone is synthesized from a yam that grows in Mexico and it is identical to cortisone extracted from adrenal tissue.       A synthetic drug would be in the same schedule as its naturally occurring twin.  For example, synthetic lysergic acid amide is in the same schedule as lysergic acid amide derived from the plant source.       Please let me know if I can be of further assistance on drug matters.

In support of this motion and as the basis therefore, respondent states as follows:       1.   On September 6, 1992, appellant Olsen filed a petition with the Administrator requesting that marijuana be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.  In support of this petition, appellant filed a statement of grounds for rescheduling in compliance with 21 C.F.R. § 1308.44(b)(B).       2.   On October 23, 1992, the Administrator responded to appellant's petition by refusing to accept that petition for filing. Prior to rejecting the petition for filing the Administrator took no action to review the grounds upon which appellant relied in that petition.       3.   Pursuant to the 21 C.F.R. § 1308.44(c), respondent is required to accept the petition for filing absent some defect in format.  As this requirement was not met, respondent now requests this Court to remand the matter so that respondent may accept appellant's petition for filing and review that petition in accordance with regulations.  See NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).       4.   Respondent makes this motion in the interests of fairness and judicial economy and not with the intent of causing unnecessary delay.  Therefore, respondent respectfully requests this Court to order the Administrator upon remand to accept appellant's petition for filing and to make a ruling upon the matter within 90 days of the date of this Court's final order in the related cases of Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 92-1168 and Drug Policy Foundation v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 92-1179.  Both of these cases are scheduled for oral argument on October 1, 1993.

On September 6, 1992, I filed a petition with the Administrator requesting that marijuana be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.  In support of this petition, I filed a statement of grounds for rescheduling in compliance with 21 C.F.R. § 1308.44(b)(B).       2.   On October 23, 1992, the Administrator responded by refusing to accept my petition for filing and by ruling on its merits.  Contrary to what the respondent says in paragraph two of the Motion for Remand, the Administrator did review the grounds upon which I relied and did make a ruling on the merits of my petition.     3.   Pursuant to the 21 C.F.R. § 1308.44(c), respondent is required to accept a petition for filing absent some defect in format.  As the respondent now admits, this requirement was not met, and respondent now claims it is requesting this Court to remand the matter so that it may accept my petition for filing in accordance with regulations.  However, since the respondent ruled on the merits of my petition, it is questionable whether the respondent actually refused to accept my petition for filing.       4.   Respondent claims to make the Motion for Remand in the interests of fairness and judicial economy and not with the intent of causing unnecessary delay.  However, the respondent fails to mention that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been developing a pattern of unfairness, waste of judicial resources and unnecessary delay.  The respondent mentions one example in the Motion for Remand, NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974), but fails to mention another case where a petition was not accepted for filing, Carl Eric Olsen v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir 1989).  Between 1983 and 1985, I filed several petitions which the DEA refused to accept, until a mandamus action was filed in the U.S. District Court.  Id. 878 F.2d at 1459.  Then, after review of the DEA's denial of the petition on its merits was sought, the DEA asked this Court "to remand the matter for renewed agency consideration."  Id. 878 F.2d at 1460.  This is exactly what the DEA is doing now.       5.   Since the DEA has already ruled on the merits of my petition, the only possible reason for a remand would be because the DEA didn't make a reasonable decision on the merits of my petition and now wants to hold an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge to correct its error.  If the DEA simply plans to deny the petition again after it is accepted for filing, then there is no reason for a remand, because a final ruling has already been made and such a remand would simply be a waste of judicial resources and an unnecessary delay.       6.   Respondent now requests this Court to order the Administrator upon remand to accept my petition for filing and to make a ruling upon the matter within 90 days of the date of this Court's final order in the related cases of Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 92-1168 and Drug Policy Foundation v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 92-1179.  Both of these cases are scheduled for oral argument on October 1, 1993.  I strongly oppose my case being delayed for these two cases.  The grounds upon which I seek rescheduling are entirely unrelated to the grounds relied upon in these two cases, and, if this Court decides to remand this matter, I think this Court should set a time frame that is unrelated to them.

When such a petition is filed with the Drug Enforcement Administration, it is carefully evaluated to determine whether the petition meets the requirements of 21 C.F.R. � 1308.44.  Section (b) of that regulation requires that the petition conform to the format provided and also specifies that four copies be filed.  If the petition is accepted for filing, the Administrator will evaluate the petition on its merits.  If the petition is not accepted for filing, because it is either lacking in the regulatory requirements or not readily understood, the Administrator will notify the petitioner of his decision and reasons thereof.  21 C.F.R. � 1308.44(c).  A copy of the regulation has been provided for your convenience.       As you are aware, your constituent has appealed the DEA's nonacceptance of his petition to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  In that case, the DEA has asked for a remand of the action in order that the Administrator may accept Mr. Olsen's petition for filing and review that petition on its merits.

Olsen.       As you are aware, your constituent has appealed the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) nonacceptance of his petition to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. � 811, and interested party can petition the DEA to reschedule a controlled substance.  When such a petition is filed with the Drug Enforcement Administration, it is carefully evaluated to determine whether the petition meets the requirements of 21 C.F.R. � 1308.44.

Despite Mr. Olsen's contentions, the Administrator did not review the grounds upon which Mr. Olsen relied in his petition before refusing to accept his petition.  However, DEA has recognized that the requirement that a petition be accepted for filing absent some ambiguity or some defect in format was not met in this matter.  Therefore, in the pending case before the Court of Appeals, DEA has asked for a remand of the action in order that the Administrator may accept Mr. Olsen's petition for filing and review that petition on its merits.

In respect to the naturally extracted and synthetically manufactured dronabinol, the Drug Enforcement Agency has promulgated the enclosed regulation.  Please note that tetrahydrocannabinol is a Schedule I substance, but dronabinol, synthetic, in sesame oil and in a soft gelatin capsule, is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug product and is a Schedule II substance.  Both marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol are Schedule I substances.       With respect to your other questions on marijuana, the original chemical researcher was Dr. Roger Adams of the University of Illinois chemistry department.  The pharmacology of the compounds was investigated by Dr. Seigried Lowe of the University of Utah.  A review of marijuana is given on page 549-553 of Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8th Edition, Pergamon Press, 1990.

On September 6, 1992, Carl Eric Olsen (Petitioner) of Des Moines, Iowa, submitted a petition requesting that the controlled substance marijuana, be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA).  The Petitioner's grounds were based on his evaluation of two prior rescheduling actions by the Administrator.  See Rescheduling of Synthetic Dronabinol in Sesame Oil and Encapsulated in Soft Gelatin Capsules, 51 Fed. Reg. 17476 (1986) and Marijuana Rescheduling Petition, 57 Fed. Reg. 10499 (1992).  On October 23, 1992, the-Administrator of Drug Enforcement, Robert C. Bonner, declined to accept his petition.  The Petitioner subsequently filed for review of then-Administrator Bonner's decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  The matter was remanded by Order of that Court to the DEA for a ruling.  Pursuant to that Court's Order, and 21 C.F.R. § 1308.44(c), the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration has considered the matters before him and thereby renders his final decision.     In his Petition for rescheduling, the Petitioner alleged that marijuana need not have an accepted medical use in treatment in the United States in order to be rescheduled from Schedule I, but "it only needs to be shown that marijuana is a source for an accepted and useful medication".  This contention was based on Petitioner's own analogies drawn from an earlier DEA marijuana rescheduling case, 57 Fed. Reg. 10499 (1992), and subsequent written statements made to the Petitioner by then-Administrator Bonner regarding coca leaves and opium plant material; and the Petitioner's incorrect contention that the DEA proposed to reschedule dronabinol in a proposed rulemaking.  See Rescheduling of Synthetic Dronabinol in Sesame Oil and Encapsulated in Soft Gelatin Capsules, 50 Fed. Reg. 42186 (1985).  It appears that Petitioner contends that this rescheduling action included delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), an ingredient in marijuana, and concluded that "since marijuana is now a source for an accepted and useful medication, it must now be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA".     The Deputy Administrator finds, for the reasons stated herein, that the grounds upon which the Petitioner relies are not                                      2 sufficient to justify the initiation of proceedings for the transfer of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA.      In July 1992, the Petitioner wrote then-Administrator Bonner regarding his final order of March 26, 1992, (57 Fed. Reg. 10499), in which the Administrator declined to reschedule marijuana to Schedule II, and the apparent "unfair" classification of the marijuana plant as a Schedule I substance, while coca and opium plants remained in Schedule II.  Then-Administrator Bonner replied by letter on August 17, 1992, and distinguished the pharmaceuticals or derivative compounds from each plant.  Apparently, the Petitioner then created a theory, that given that the Schedule II opium and coca plants were a source for accepted medication, then if marijuana plants were a source for accepted medications it should also be a Schedule II substance.  To further his argument, the Petitioner pointed to the rescheduled drug, which he called dronabinol, as having its source in marijuana.  The Petitioner also alluded to inconsistencies of scheduling of delta-9-THC, a component of marijuana, between the CSA and certain multilateral international agreements.     When the CSA was created, Congress specified the initial scheduling of controlled substances and the criteria by which controlled substances could be rescheduled.  21 U.S.C. §§ 811-812.  The DEA is bound, by law, to follow this mandate.  Congress placed both the tetrahydrocannabinols, which includes delta-9-THC, and the plant marijuana into Schedule I when it enacted the                                    3 CSA.  See Pub. L. 91-513, § 202(c), Schedule I (c)(17) and (c)(10). Similarly, Congress placed opium poppy and straw and coca leaves into Schedule II.  See Pub. L. 91-513, § 202(c), Schedule II (a)(3) and  (a)(4).  The legislative history indicates that marijuana was placed into Schedule I on its own merits and not because delta-9-THC could be extracted from it.  H.R. Rep. No. 1444, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, at 12 (1970).     Whether or not marijuana is a source of delta-9-THC is irrelevant to the status of marijuana under the CSA.  With regard to the classification of controlled substances, the Attorney General may, by rule, add to the established schedules or transfer between such schedules and drug or other substance if [s]he finds that such drug or other substance has a potential for abuse, and makes with respect to such drug or other substance the findings prescribed by subsection (b) of Section 812 for the schedule in which such drug is to be placed.  21 U.S.C. § 811(a)(1). The Attorney General has delegated this authority to the Administrator, who has redelegated it to the Deputy Administrator.  See 28 C.F.R. §§ 0.100(b) and 0.104.  (59 Fed. Reg. 23637 (May 6, 1994)).     In order for a substance to be placed into Schedule II, the Attorney General must find that:  "(A) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.  (B) The drug or other substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.  (C) Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead                                    4  to severe psychological or physical dependence."  21 U.S.C. § 812(b)(2).     Then-Administrator John C. Lawn previously determined that marijuana does not have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and as a result must remain in Schedule I.  See Marijuana Rescheduling Petition, 54 Fed. Reg. 53767 (1989).  Then-Administrator Lawn's final order was appealed to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit which returned the matter to the DEA for an explanation of the factors relied upon in determining "currently accepted medical use".  See Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. Cir. 1991).     In response to the remand, then-Administrator Bonner issued a final order in which he determined that for a substance to have a "currently accepted medical use" the following must exist:      a.   the drug's chemistry must be known and reproducible;      b.   there must be adequate safety studies;      c.   there must be adequate and well-controlled studies proving           efficacy;      d.   the drug must be accepted by qualified experts; and     e.   the scientific evidence must be widely available. Then-Administrator Bonner concluded that marijuana failed to meet all elements of the five-part test and, therefore, did not meet the statutorily prescribed criteria for a Schedule II substance. Marijuana Rescheduling Petition, 57 Fed. Reg. 10499 (1992); See                                   5 Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. DEA, et al., 15 F.3d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1994) upholding the Administrator's decision.      Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator concludes that the Petitioner's contention that marijuana need not have an accepted medical use in treatment in the United States in order to be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA is not in accordance with law.  DEA may only move a drug from Schedule I if there is a finding of "currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States".     Although delta-9-THC is the principle psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, it can be synthesized and exist as a chemical. Delta-9-THC is a generic term which refers to four separate chemicals and two mixtures of chemicals, i.e., four stereochemical variants of the parent substance and two racemates.  One of the stereochemical variants, the (-) delta-9-trans-THC isomer, is the principle psychoactive ingredient in Cannabis sativa, L., or marijuana.  That isomer is also the ingredient in a pharmaceutical product which has been shown to be safe and effective as an anti-emetic for certain patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, and is identified chemically as (6aR-trans)-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]-pyran-1-ol.  The International Nonproprietary name (INN) and the U.S. Adopted Name (USAN) for that isomer of delta-9-THC is dronabinol.      With the development of scientific and medical evidence that demonstrated that a pharmaceutical product which contained                                  6 dronabinol was safe and effective for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in certain patients, then-Administrator John C. Lawn rescheduled this pharmaceutical product from Schedule I to Schedule II. See 51 Fed. Reg. 17476  (1986).  Only the pharmaceutical product was transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II, i.e., "dronabinol (synthetic) in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug product".  No rescheduling action was taken with regard to (-) delta-9-trans-THC, i.e., dronabinol, which remains in Schedule I of the CSA. Tetrahydrocannabinols, including delta-9-THC, one of the synthetic equivalents of the substances contained in the plant or resinous extractives of Cannabis (marijuana) are listed at 21 C.F.R. § 1308.11(d)(25).      Tetrahydrocannabinols and all their isomers, including delta-9-THC, are also the subject of control by international agreement under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, February 21, 1971, 32 U.S.T. 543, T.I.A.S. 9725, 1019 U.N.T.S. 175. Cannabis, cannabis resin and extracts and tinctures of cannabis are regulated as Schedule I substances under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, March 30, 1961, 18 U.S.T. 1407, T.I.A.S. 6298, 520 U.N.T.S. 204. The United States is a party to both conventions.     Then-Administrator Lawn also discussed the United States international obligations in his Dronabinol in Sesame Oil and Encapsulated in a Soft Gelatin Capsule, rescheduling action.                                   7 See 51 Fed. Reg. 17476 (1986). Since Article 7 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 has strict prohibitions on activities involving Schedule I drugs, in 1987, the United States Government initiated an action to have delta-9-THC transferred to Schedule II to allow the pharmaceutical product to be marketed. See U.N. Doc. E/CN.7/1990/4.  Such a transfer was not inconsistent with the substance delta-9-THC remaining in the CSA Schedule I. Under Article 23 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, a party may adopt more strict or severe measures of control if desirable or necessary for the protection of the public health and welfare.      Under the CSA, the regulation of chemicals and the plant material are distinct from each other. The classification of delta-9-THC has no bearing on the classification of marijuana. Under the CSA, a proposed change in the schedule of either a tetrahydrocannabinol or the plant marijuana requires the Attorney General to proceed independently.      Petitioner apparently does not wish to look to the clear construct of the Controlled Substances Act, but to pose alternative theories of the Act.  Under the CSA, drugs or other substances may be treated and classified differently, according to the enumerated statutory criteria. 21 U.S.C. § 812(b).      The Deputy Administrator reaffirms that marijuana does not have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and is thus appropriately listed as a Schedule I controlled substance. The Deputy Administrator finds nothing to                                  8 support the petitioner's contention that since marijuana, coca, and opium are all plant materials they must be treated alike in the CSA. The Deputy Administrator further finds that the rescheduling of the pharmaceutical product "dronabinol (synthetic) in sesame oil and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drug product", which contains the synthetic chemical ingredient (-) delta-9-trans-THC, did not require that either the plant marijuana or substance delta-9-THC be similarly rescheduled. The Petitioner's request is denied.       Stephen H.

Whether the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Administrator erred in ruling that the DEA may only move marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) if there is a finding of "currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States."     2.   Whether this court's ruling in Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (upholding the DEA's decision not to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA, based on the lack of marijuana's "currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States"), effectively overruled this court's prior ruling in National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (finding that marijuana could be moved to Schedule II without having a "currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States").     3.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling that the principal psychoactive ingredient in Cannabis sativa, L. (marijuana), the (-) delta-9-trans-THC isomer of delta-9-THC (dronabinol), 21 C.F.R. � 1308.12(f)(1), remains in Schedule I, while the identical substance becomes a Schedule II substance when it is contained in a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug product (Marinol) "in sesame oil and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule."     4.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling that the regulation of chemicals and their plant material sources are distinct from, and have no relationship to, each other.     5.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling that the placement of marijuana in the CSA has no relationship to the scheduling of delta-9-THC, contrary to this court's ruling in United States v. Watson, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C. Cir. 1975).       6.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling that plant materials are not treated consistently in the CSA.

Shulgin)To: carlolsen@dsmnet.comSubject: old lettersHi:I think these are the two files that you wanted.  It is awful to lose stuff from the hard disk, when there is no one else to blame.----------------olsen-01.ats----------------Hello Carl:Thanks for the letter.  Let me see if I can answer your questions without waiving my hands around.(1)  How many isomers are there of the THC molecule?There is delta-1 THC (using a different numbering system, this is also known as delta-9 THC).  It has two asymmetric centers, and so it can exist in a trans- or as a cis-form (known as stereoisomers) and each of these forms is resolvable into a dextro- and a levo-component (known as optical isomers).  Putting this into a box form, you have:                    trans-pair (stereo)         cis-pair (stereo)     dextro-           d-(trans)-delta-1          d-(cis)-delta-1     (optical)              THC **                     THC     levo-             l-(trans)-delta-1          l-(cis)-delta-1     (optical)              THC *                      THCwhich adds up to four isomers.There is also delta-6 THC (same as delta-1(6) THC or, with a different numbering systems delta-8 THC).  Using the same square as with the delta-1 isomer, we have:                    trans-pair (stereo)         cis-pair (stereo)     dextro-           d-(trans)-delta-6          d-(cis)-delta-6     (optical)              THC                        THC     levo-             l-(trans)-delta-6          l-(cis)-delta-6     (optical)              THC                        THCwhich totals another four isomers.There is a third isomer explicitly named in the law, not a natural material, but a laboratory product that had been studied in the early days of the chemistry of these compounds.  This is called delta-3,4 THC (or delta-6a,10a THC with the other numbering system).  Here the two optically active carbon atoms that allowed the cis-trans argument now carry the double bond (the meaning of the term delta) but a new optically active site has been opened up at the 1- (9-) position.  So there can be a dextro-form and a levo-form (optical isomers) but no cis- or trans-pairs.  This totals to another two isomers.  Thus the answer to your first question, there are ten possible isomers of THC to be considered in the halls of law enforcement.(2)  What is an isomer?That depends upon who you ask, and in what context.  Literally, iso- means the "same", and -mer is from meros, meaning "part."  In common chemical usage, it is generally taken to mean that the same atoms are there (in terms of which elements and how many of them), but they are just hooked up differently.  And when there are describing (or limiting) prefixes, they emphasize just how these different hookups are most readily recognized.       Stereoisomers are distinguished by the differences in shape.  Think of a hand in a five-fingered rubber glove, making all kinds of different forms, but always with the same amount of hand inside the glove.  A fist shape and a splayed finger shape would be stereoisomers.Optical isomers are distinguished by their mirror-image relationships.  Two molecules not superimposable but are in every other way identical.  Put a rubber glove on your right hand, and another on your left.  They are identical, except that cannot be superimposed.  One is the mirror reflection of the other.Positional isomers are defined as have certain groups as being over there rather than over here.  Consider a conventional rubber glove (the thumb-shaped covering at position one) and then another with the thumb position where the third finger usually is, and the third finger position at the thumb's location.  These are positional isomers, with the finger positions being the rearranged factor.The authors of the law, and thus the DEA, are quite inconsistent in the use of this term.  Since you have the Controlled Substances Manual, check out the first full paragraph on page 226 for some insight into this confusion (page 212 if you have the first edition).(3)  Is delta-9 THC an isomer, or does it have isomers of its own?Look up at the first box.  All for named items are isomers of delta-9 THC (the trans- and cis-pairs, and the optical isomers of each pair).  Thus delta-9 THC can exist in any of four isomeric forms.  This is pretty close to saying that delta-9 THC has its own isomers.But, in common parlance, the term delta-9 THC is very often used for the natural component of cannabis, the active component, and this is explicitly the trans, levo-isomer of delta-9 THC.  This is the lower left isomer in that box, the one marked with a "*".  If this is the sense in which the term delta-9 THC is used (and it is so used frequently and casually) then it is an isomer, the natural isomer, the one with the * above.The answer to this question depends exactly on what the asker has in mind when he uses the term delta-9 (or, delta-1) THC.  Remember, that the two names are synonymous.One final caveat.  The delta-9 THC that is the material used in the Schedule II drug known as Dronabinol is something yet different than any of these.  It is a synthetic material, and is isolated as the trans- material, but I do not believe that it is resolved into its optical isomers.  Thus, in this context, delta-9 THC is a 50:50 mixture of l-(trans)-delta-9 THC and d-(trans)-delta-9 THC.  This is a 50:50 mixture of the one * and the two ** things in the first box above. To summarize:When the term delta-1 (delta-9) THC is used to represent the active factor of cannabis, it is the isomer with the one *.When the term delta-1 (delta-9) THC is used to represent the active component in the Schedule II drug, it is a 50:50 mixture of the one * and two ** isomers.  When the term delta-1 (delta-9) THC is used to represent the chemical concept without stereo- or optical-designations, then the term embraces all four isomers in that first box.  Hope this helps.  It is a one hour lecture distilled down into a ten minute note.Sasha---------------------olsen-02.ats---------------------Hi Carl:I have just now been looking with more care at the package insertthat accompanies the commercial Marinol, Dronabinol, and also thePDR, and both of them give the chemical name as:(6a-R-trans)-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-1-oland the Merck index refers to these commercial drugs as(-)-delta1-3,4-trans-formI had assumed, without checking, that the synthetic material was the racemate (the two trans isomers in the first of the diagrams I sent you.  But the letter "R" in the first name, and the minussign "-" in the second name, both attest to the fact that thesynthetic drug (the component of the schedule II item) is indeeda single isomer.  Thus the term delta-1 THC (delta-9 THC) means not three things, but only two.  As a general term, it can be all four of those isomers, individually or collectively.  As a botanical term, it is the one specific isomer in that collection, the l-trans delta-1 isomer (the first "l" is the letter ell, as the first letter of levo, or rotating to the left and the second is the number "1").  And so is the synthetic.  And, as to your other question, no, the two isomers cannot be isolated from the plant, as only one is there.  To summarize:     l-trans- (the letter ell)     levo-trans     6a-R-trans     all refer to the natural (as well as the synthetic) delta-1 THC, that is apparently prepared from optically active startingmaterials.     dl-trans     racemic trans     6a without the R but with the transall refer to an optically inactive form of delta-1 THC, stilltrans, but containing an isomer that is not found in nature, andthat is not in the drug Marinol.     delta-1 THC can refer to any or all of the four isomers, both trans and cis, both levo and dextro.Sorry about the wrong assumption above.  Hope this makes everything clearer.SashaWT01-B18-254IA087-000632-B041-234http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/DEA/order.html 206.61.184.43 19970122072109 text/html 1880HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:21:02 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:12:18 GMTContent-length: 1665 UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALSDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT No. 94-1605                           September Term, 1994                                      United States Court of Appeals                                      for the District of Columbia CircuitCarl Eric Olsen, Petitioner           FILED AUG 25 1995v.Drug Enforcement Administration, Respondent O R D E R      It appearing that the above case may fall within the intent andpurpose of Rule 34(j) of the Circuit Rules of this Court and may alsomeet one or more of the criteria set forth in that rule, it is ORDERED,sua sponte, that a briefing schedule be established as follows:          Appellant(s)/Petitioner(s) Brief and Appendix           10/6/95          Appellee(s)/Respondent(s) Brief                         11/6/95          Appellant(s)/Petitioner(s) Reply Brief                  11/20/95     This notice does not preclude the court, after examination of thebriefs, from setting this case for oral argument.

STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND     In response to the growing drug problem in the UnitedStates, Congress in 1970 passed the Controlled Substances Act, 21U.S.C. 801 et seq. ("CSA").  The CSA classifies various hazardousdrugs into five schedules.  Id. 812.  Restrictions upon use andaccess to a particular drug vary based upon the drug's schedulestatus in the CSA.  Drugs in Schedule I are subject to moresevere restrictions than drugs in the other schedules.  SeeAlliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Admin.,930 F.2d 936, 937 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  Congress placed marihuana inSchedule I of the CSA.1  21 U.S.C. 812(c), Schedule I(c)(10).     Although Congress made the initial scheduling decisions, theCSA specifically permits the Attorney General to add a substanceto a schedule, transfer a substance from one schedule to anotheror remove a substance from the schedules entirely.  Id. 811(a).The Attorney General may only transfer a substance to a differentschedule if she "finds that such drug or other substance has apotential for abuse" and makes findings that the drug orsubstance meets the requirements for the new schedule.  Id.  Thefindings required for placing a substance in a particularschedule are listed in 21 U.S.C. 812(b).  The Attorney Generalhas delegated the authority to reschedule controlled substances____________________     1    The substance is called "marihuana" in the CSA and therespondent will use that spelling throughout this brief.However, where the spelling "marijuana" is used in a quotedpassage, the spelling has not been changed.                                2 to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration("DEA").  28 C.F.R. 0.100(b).  The Drug Enforcement Administrator("Administrator") has further delegated this authority to theDeputy Administrator.  28 C.F.R. 0.104.     For over 20 years, various groups and individuals have askedDEA to exercise its authority to move marihuana from Schedule Ito a less restrictive schedule or to remove marihuana from theCSA schedules entirely.  See Alliance for Cannabis Therapeuticsv. Drug Enforcement Admin., 15 F.3d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1994);Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, 930 F.2d at 937; NationalOrg. for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Drug Enforcement Admin.,559 F.2d 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977); National Org. for the Reform ofMarijuana Laws v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).Despite these efforts, in March of 1992, the Administrator issueda final order denying a petition to reschedule marihuana fromSchedule I to Schedule II of the CSA.  See 57 Fed. Reg. 10,499(1992).2     The Administrator relied upon the language of the CSA in____________________     2    DEA's review of the rescheduling petition was quiteextensive.  DEA issued a notice of a hearing on the reschedulingpetition in 1986.  See 51 Fed. Reg. 22,946 (1986).  Afterhearings before an administrative law judge, the Administratorissued findings of fact and conclusions of law that determinedthat marihuana should not be moved from Schedule I because themarihuana plant has no currently accepted medical use and becauseit is not safe for use, even under medical supervision.  See 54Fed. Reg. 53,767, 53,784 (1989).  On appeal, this court generallyupheld the Administrator's decision but remanded the matter forclarification.  See Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, 930 F.2dat 940-941.  On remand, the Administrator again found thatmarihuana plants should remain in Schedule I.  See 57 Fed. Reg.at 10,507-10,508.  The latter decision was affirmed by this Courtin Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, 15 F.3d at 1137.                                3 making his determination.  Under the CSA, a drug or substance maynot be placed in Schedule II absent findings that:     (A)  The drug or other substance has a high          potential for abuse.     (B)  The drug or other substance has a currently          accepted medical use in treatment in the          United States or a currently accepted medical          use with severe restrictions.     (C)  Abuse of the drug or other substances may          lead to severe psychological or physical          dependence.21 U.S.C. 812(b)(2)(A)-(C).     In the Administrator's final order, he concluded that themarihuana plant had no currently accepted medical use and thuscould not be placed in schedule II.  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,499.The Administrator applied a five-part test for determiningwhether a substance had a currently accepted medical use:     (1)  the drug's chemistry must be known and reproducible;     (2)  there must be adequate safety studies;     (3)  there must be adequate and well-controlled          studies proving efficacy;     (4)  the drug must be accepted by qualified experts; and     (5)  the scientific evidence must be widely available.57 Fed. Reg. at 10,504-10,507.  After reviewing the evidence inthe record, the Administrator found that marihuana could notsatisfy a single one of these criteria.  Id. at 10,507.  Thesefindings, as well as other findings of fact and conclusions oflaw, resulted in the denial of the marihuana reschedulingpetition.                                4 II.  THE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS     On July 21, 1992, the petitioner sent a letter to then-Administrator Robert C. Bonner in which he raised several questions about the Administrator's final order.  In the letter, the petitioner appeared to agree with the Administrator's findingthat marihuana, as a plant, failed to satisfy the first part ofthe test for determining a currently accepted medical use becausea plant such as marihuana is not a scientifically establishedcompound capable of reproduction in standard dosages.  A. 1.3The petitioner's letter then asked why coca and opium plants (thesources of cocaine, morphine, and heroin) were placed in ScheduleII.  Id.  If, the petitioner reasoned, coca and opium plants aresubject to the same scientific variances as marihuana plants,then DEA is "treating marijuana unfairly."  Id.  The petitionersuggested either removing all plants from the CSA schedulesbecause they "will never fit into your definition of drugs" orchanging the definition to account for the inconsistency in thetreatment of the different plants.  Id.     On August 17, 1992, Administrator Bonner sent the petitionera response to his letter.  A. 5.  In the response, theAdministrator rejected the petitioner's attempt to analogizemarihuana plants to coca and opium plants.  Id.  TheAdministrator explained that when Congress placed coca leaves andopium plant materials in Schedule II, it was aware that these____________________     3    "A." references are to the bound appendix submitted bythe petitioner with his brief.                                5 plants had been recognized historically as the source for avariety of accepted and useful medications.  Id.  The plantscontain medically active alkaloids that can be extracted and usedto produce pharmaceutical compounds capable of reproduction instandardized doses.  Id.  In contrast, the Administrator pointedout that the recent attempts to reschedule marihuana were notgrounded on claims that medically useful compounds could beextracted from marihuana, but rather that smoking marihuanaitself produced medical benefits.  Id.  Thus, the Administratorfound the scheduling decisions to be reconcilable.  Id. at 5-6.     The petitioner, proceeding t)ro se, then filed a formalrequest for the rescheduling of marihuana pursuant to 21 U.S.C.811 and 21 C.F.R. 1307.03.4  A. 2-4.  In his petition, he drewan analogy from language in the Administrator's letter of August17, 1992.  He reasoned that if coca leaves and opium plants couldbe placed in Schedule II because they are sources of accepted and____________________     4    The petitioner has frequently litigated issues relatedto the legal treatment of marihana.  He challenged severalcriminal convictions by arguing that marihuana smoking wasprotected by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment andthe equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  SeeOlsen v. Iowa, 808 F.2d 652, 653 (8th Cir. 1986); United Statesv. Rush, 738 F.2d 497, 511-513 (lst Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470U.S. 1004 (1985); State v. Olsen, 315 N.W.2d 1, 7-9 (Iowa 1982).Additionally, the petitioner has brought numerous civil actionsseeking to obtain judicial authorization to use marihuana.  SeeOlsen v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 878 F.2d 1458, 1461-1465 (D.C.Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 906 (1990); Olsen v. DrugEnforcement Admin., 776 F.2d 267, 268 (llth Cir. 1985), cert.denied, 475 U.S. 1030 (1986); Olsen v. State, Civ.  No. 83-301-E,1986 WL 4045, at *1 (S.D. Iowa March 19, 1986).  The petitioneralso participated in the administrative proceedings where the DEAconsidered a petition to reschedule marihuana from Schedule I toSchedule II of the CSA.  See 54 Fed. Reg. at 53,767.                                6 useful medications, then marihuana plants could be placed inschedule II if marihuana is shown to be "a source for an acceptedand useful medication."  A. 3.  The petitioner then noted thatdronabinol, a synthetic equivalent of the isomer which is theprinciple psychoactive substance in marihuana, has beenrescheduled to Schedule II.  Id.  Because marihuana is the sourceof an accepted and useful medication, dronabinol, the petitionerreasoned that marihuana must be moved to Schedule II of the CSA.Id. at 4.  The petitioner then requested that the Administratorreschedule marihuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA.Id. at 2.5     The Administrator initially refused to accept therescheduling petition because dronabinol is a wholly syntheticsubstance and is not obtained from marihuana.  A. 7.  However,after the petitioner appealed, DEA voluntarily asked this courtto remand the petition for a ruling.  This court remanded thepetition in an Order dated December 9, 1993.  See Olsen v. DrugEnforcement Admin., No. 93-1109 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 9, 1993).     On May 16, 1994, Deputy Administrator Stephen H. Greeneissued a nine-page final order denying the petition.  A. 17.  Thefinal order explained that Congress placed marihuana in ScheduleI.  A. 19-20.  It rejected the petitioner's analogy, finding thatmarihuana can only be moved from Schedule I if there is a findingthat marihuana has a "currently accepted medical use in treatment____________________      5    The petitioner did not ask DEA to reschedule any othersubstances.                                7 in the United States."  A. 22.  The order acknowledged that (-)delta-9-trans-THC isomer, the principal psychoactive ingredientin marihuana, is also the ingredient in a pharmaceutical productthat has proven to be a safe and effective anti-emetic forpatients receiving cancer chemotherapy.  Id.  However, the ordernoted that only a very specific synthetic dronabinol product wasrescheduled to Schedule II -- "dronabinol ("synthetic) in sesameoil and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule" in a drug productapproved by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA").  A. 23.The order further stated that the regulation of plants andchemicals under the CSA is distinct and that the CSA requires theindependent evaluation of each individual controlled substance.A. 24.  The final order reaffirmed that marihuana plants have nocurrently accepted medical use in treatment and found that therescheduling of one pharmaceutical product did not require DEA totransfer marihuana plants or any other substance to Schedule II.A. 24-25.     The petitioner has appealed the final order to this courtpursuant to 21 U.S.C. 877.                     SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT     Congress placed marihuana in Schedule I of the CSA and thisdecision has been consistently approved by the courts.  Thepetitioner is incorrect in asserting that marihuana must be movedfrom Schedule I to Schedule II if it is a source of an acceptedand useful medication.  The plain language of the CSA requiresthat a substance itself must have a currently accepted medical                                8 use before it may be moved from Schedule I to Schedule II.  Thepetitioner has failed to provide any evidence to suggest that themarihuana plant itself has a currently accepted medical use.Under the CSA, the rescheduling of synthetic dronabinol in apharmaceutical product has no effect on the scheduling of themarihuana plant.  Thus, the petitioner's request for reschedulingfailed to raise any issue that justified the initiation ofrescheduling proceedings.     The petitioner is also incorrect in asserting thatdronabinol was moved from Schedule I to Schedule II.  Only onespecific pharmaceutical product containing synthetic dronabinolhas been moved to Schedule II: synthetic dronabinol in sesame oiland encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule in a FDA-approved drugproduct.  Although the petitioner now seeks to challenge thelegality of the rule rescheduling this pharmaceutical product andargues that dronabinol should have been rescheduled in itsentirety, he did not raise these issues before DEA.  Theseissues should not be considered for the first time by this court.                            ARGUMENTI.   STANDARD OF REVIEW     Any interested person may submit a petition to DEArequesting that DEA reschedule a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C.811(a); 21 C.F.R. 1308.44(a).  However, a petition that isaccepted for filing "may be denied by the Administrator within areasonable time thereafter if he finds the grounds upon which thepetitioner relies are not sufficient to justify the initiation of                                9 proceedings."  21 C.F.R. 1308.44(c).  The Administrator reliedupon this provision in denying the petition in the instant case.A. 18-19.     In reviewing the Administrator's decision, findings of fact,"if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive."  21U.S.C. 877.  Additionally, DEA's action may be set aside if itwas arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or contrary tolaw.  5 U.S.C. 706.  However, when reviewing an administrativeagency's interpretation of a statute, the court must give effectto the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.  ChevronU.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S.837, 842-843 (1984).  If the statute is silent or ambiguous, thecourt is to determine whether the agency's interpretation isbased upon a permissible construction of the statute.  Id. at843.  The court may not substitute its own judgment for areasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.Id. at 844.II.  CONGRESS, DEA, AND THE COURTS HAVE ALL FOUND THAT     MARIHUANA IS PROPERLY IN SCHEDULE I OF THE CSA AND MUST     REMAIN THERE UNTIL IT SATISFIES THE CRITERIA IN 21     U.S.C. 812(b).     Congress made the initial decision to place marihuana inSchedule I.  21 U.S.C. 811(c).  This decision was made aftercareful consideration.  The legislative history of the CSAdemonstrates that Congress was sensitive to the arguments of                                10 Click here for part 2WT01-B18-257IA087-000632-B042-87http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/DEA/reply95.html 206.61.184.43 19970122072243 text/html 34741HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:22:36 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 17:12:03 GMTContent-length: 34525                               CASE BEING CONSIDERED FOR TREATMENT                      PURSUANT TO RULE 35(j) OF THE GENERAL RULES              IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS               FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT_________________________________________________________________                           No. 94-1605_________________________________________________________________                         CARL ERIC OLSEN                           Petitioner,                               v.

DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION                           Respondent._________________________________________________________________             Petition for Review of an order of the                 Drug Enforcement Administration_________________________________________________________________                    Petitioner's Reply Brief_________________________________________________________________                            ARGUMENT     The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) claims that the  issue of whether (-)-delta-9-(trans)-tetrahydrocannabinol (also known as levo-trans-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) has been, or should have been, rescheduled to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act is being raised for the first time in this petition for judicial review.  This objection is without merit.  The matter of the scheduling of (-)-delta-9-(trans)-tetrahydrocannabinol1 was implicit in the original petition for rescheduling of marijuana.____________________	1 Throughout the remainder of this brief, the abreviation "THC" will be used in place of the term "tetrahydrocannabinol."                              - 1 -      There are four isomers of delta-9-THC: (1) levo-(trans)-delta-9-THC; (2) levo-(cis)-delta-9-THC; (3) dextro-(trans)-delta-9-THC; and (4) dextro-(cis)-delta-9-THC.  Of these four, only one is found naturally occurring in the marijuana plant: levo-(trans)-delta-9-THC (also known as (-)-delta-9-(trans)-THC).2  Levo-(trans)-delta-9-THC is also the only one of the four isomers that is active (or psychoactive).  This isomer is the same isomer found in the commercial product Marinol�.  This isomer has also been given the U.S. Adopted Name (USAN) of dronabinol.     In the petitioner's brief which accompanied the original petition to the DEA, A. 3-4,3 a substance by the name of dronabinol was clearly identified.  A DEA proposal to reschedule dronabinol to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act was also cited in the orignal brief filed with the DEA by the petitioner.  50 Fed. Reg. 42,186 (Oct. 18, 1985).  According to the DEA and the Physician's Desk Reference, this substance is clearly identified as "the principle psychoactive substance in Cannabis sativa L., marijuana."  1989 Physician's Desk Reference, page 1859.  In other words, dronabinol can be made synthetically or extracted from marijuana, the plant in which it occurs naturally.  Dronabinol is exactly the same no matter whether it is produced synthetically in a test tube, or extracted from a marijuana plant.  This is an important distinction, because ____________________     2    Another name for this isomer is levo-(trans)-delta-1-THC, or (-)-delta-1-(trans)-THC.     3    "A." references are to the bound appendix submitted by the petitioner with his brief.                              - 2 - dronabinol is not exclusively a semi-synthetic substance like heroin,4 or a synthetic substance like alphacetylmethadol.5      Of course, the actual substance which was later rescheduled was not dronabinol, but rather "dronabinol (synthetic) in sesame oil and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule."  51 Fed. Reg. 17,476 (1986).  However, this combination of drug and food substances was not mentioned in the petitioner's brief which was attached to the original petition filed with the DEA.  The reason this combination was not mentioned was because sesame oil and soft gelatin capsules are foods.  Sesame oil is not added for purpose of diluting dronabinol, nor does encapsulation in gelatin capsules change the strength or potency of dronabinol.     The original brief filed with the DEA also referred to an international treaty, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, February 21, 1971, 32 U.S.T. 543, T.I.A.S. 9725, 1019 U.N.T.S. 175, which was amended at the request of the United States in 1991, and which included the rescheduling of all the stereochemical variants of THC.6  E/1991/24 E/CN.7/1991/26, 24 May 1991.  The United States is bound by this treaty and the ____________________     4    Pursuant to a telphone conversation of November 27, 1995, with John P. Morgan, Professor of Pharmacology, City Univerity of New York, Medical School, Room J903, 138th Street at Convent Avenue, New York, New York 10031; telephone (212) 650-8255.  Professor Morgan stated that heroin does not occur naturally in the opium poppy.  Heroin is a semi-synthetic derivative of morphine.     5    Id. Professor Morgan, footnote 4, supra.  Professor Morgan also stated that alphacetylmethadol is not a naturally occuring substances.  It is made synthetically.     6    This international rescheduling included all four isomers of delta-9-THC, along with all other forms of THC found in the plant, e.g., those found in 21 C.F.R. � 1308.11(d)(25).                              - 3 - amendment pursuant to the Psychotropic Substances Act, Pub. L. 95-633, November 10, 1978.  This international rescheduling procedure allowed the United States to reschedule dronabinol, although the DEA is claiming that only the specific isomer dronabinol (and only when made synthetically) in sesame oil and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule was actually rescheduled.     The petitioner's original petition and brief did not tell the DEA that rescheduling of dronabinol was being sought, because it was implicit in the argument that marijuana should be rescheduled.  The petitioner argued that dronabinol had already been rescheduled to Schedule II, and, therefore, marijuana is now the source of a Schedule II substance, dronabinol.  Contrary to the DEA's assertions, this issue is not being raised for the first time on judicial review.  The DEA could have asked for clarification, if it was unsure of the grounds for the petition.     The fact that no cite case law was cited in the Petitioner's original brief does not mean that none existed.  All of the ideas expressed in the petitioner's original petition and brief were taken from prior decisions of this court in United States v. Walton, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C. Cir. 1975), National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 559 F.2d. 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977), and Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  There is nothing original about these arguments, as they were all presented by this court in these three cases.                              - 4 -      On page 3 of its brief, the DEA talks about 20 years of rescheduling petitions, all of which have been appealed and denied.  The DEA fails to mention that none of these previous petitions raised the issue presented here.  In all of the cases cited by the DEA, the petitioners were seeking either recreational, medical, or sacramental use of the marijuana plant, in its natural form.  The matter presently before this court seeks none of these, and that's why the issue presented here has never been raised before, even though it was invited by this court in National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 559 F.2d 735, 748 (D.C. Cir. 1977).     If this case is successful in transferring marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the most that could be hoped for is that dronabinol could be extracted from marijuana, rather than being made entirely synthetically.  Both cocaine and morphine can be made synthetically, but neither of them are commonly made that way.  It is more economical to extract cocaine and morphine from their natural sources (the plants they come from, coca and opium poppy).7  The trend is to go with extraction, rather than synthesis.     The United States government currently grows marijuana under contract with the University of Mississippi, and it could easily ____________________     7    Id. Professor Morgan, footnote 4, supra.  Professor Morgan also stated that aspirin is not even made synthetically, because it's cheaper to extract it from it's natural plant source.                              - 5 - license others to manufacture marijuana for the purpose of extracting dronabinol.  In 1942, the federal government actually exempted farmers from military service if they agreed to grow marijuana for the production of hemp fiber during World War II.  Marijuana is still mentioned as a strategic military resource in Section 901(e) of the Executive Order 12919 of June 3, 1994 (National Defense Industrial Resources Preparedness).     The penalties for illegal possession of a Schedule II substance are no different from those for illegal possession of a Schedule I substance.  Therefore, there is no valid enforcement concern for the Drug Enforcement Administration, because the DEA's mission is strictly one of enforcement.  United States v. Moore, 423 U.S. 122, 135 (1972).  As the DEA Administrator stated in 1992, "Clearly, the Controlled Substances Act does not authorize the Attorney General, nor by delegation the DEA Administrator, to make the ultimate decision as to whether a drug should be used as medicine."  57 Fed. Reg. 10,499, 10,505 (March 26, 1992).  Rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II would not set any precedent for further rescheduling, nor would it lead to increased drug diversion when the strict Schedule II requirements for manufacture are met.8      Although the DEA in its brief continually refers to the statutory criteria for scheduling set forth in 21 U.S.C. � 812(b)(2) Schedule II, and is quick to point out that marijuana ____________________     8    Manufacturers would be required to meet the same standards as those currently employed by the federal government's marijuana farm at the University of Mississippi.                              - 6 - fails to satisfy any of them, it completely sweeps under the rug the fact that coca and opium poppy, both Schedule II substances, also fail to satisfy any of them.  The DEA refers to the plain meaning of the statute, but fails to explain this obvious inconsistency between its argument and the plain wording of the statute.  Congress was clearly using other factors to determine scheduling, which this court properly recognized in 1977.  Id. NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d at 748.     To be fair, the DEA has admitted there is an inconsistency in its argument.  In footnote 9, on page 16 of its brief, the DEA admits that some courts, including this one, have found that the scheduling criteria in 21 U.S.C. � 812 are neither cumulative nor exclusive.  However, the DEA gives two reasons why these doubts should be resolved in its favor.     First, the DEA claims that the dicta in these cases were overruled by this court's decisions in Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 15 F.3d 1131, 1133 (D.C. Cir. 1991), and Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 930 F.2d 936, 938-940 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  The problem with the DEA's reasoning is that the issue in this case was not raised by the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics cases, and, therefore, it is not res judicata in this matter.     The second argument given by the DEA is that this court should give deference to the DEA's interpretation of the statute because of the guidelines for statutory interpretation articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in Chevron , U.S.A, Inc. v.                               - 7 - Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).  Again, the problem with this reasoning is that Chevron requires this court to first look at the plain meaning of the statute.  This court must first resolve the inconsistency of the scheduling of coca and opium poppy under the statute.  According to the DEA's reasoning, neither coca and opium poppy could be scheduled in Schedule II of the statute.  The DEA has never moved to correct this inconsistency by attempting to reschedule coca and opium poppy to Schedule I.  Therefore, it is obvious that the DEA has failed to properly interpret the statute in this matter.     The DEA admits that, in drafting the statute, Congress was aware that coca and opium poppy were the sources of accepted medicines, but fails to acknowledge that this creates an additional scheduling criterion (being the natural plant source of an accepted medicine), and that Congress was equally aware that marijuana was not the source of any accepted medicine at the time the Controlled Substances Act was written.  Things have changed.  Marijuana is now the source of an accepted medicine, even though the DEA makes an artificial distinction between the synthetic and the naturally extracted equivalent of the drug.  Coca and opium poppy are the evidence that Congress did not consider the scheduling of plants and their included chemicals to be distinct, and the DEA half-heartedly admits as much.9 ____________________     9    It is important to note that coca, opium, and marijuana plants are not only the source of accepted medicines, but those medicines are all the principle psychoactive drugs contained within those plants.  In other words, these plants are only medically active (psychoactive) to the extent they contain these drugs.  Of course, that is not to say that these plants have no                               - 8 -      There is no difference between a synthetic drug and its naturally extracted twin.  By definition, a synthetic molecule must be identical to its natural equivalent.  The Food and Drug Administration verifies this fact.  A. 16.  Synthetic dronabinol and the (-)-delta-9-(trans)-THC found in the marijuana plant are the same thing.  The DEA is saying that only synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules has been rescheduled, and the Code of Federal Regulations actually distinguishes (wrongly) synthetic from naturally occurring dronabinol (as if synthetic and naturally occurring drugs were not the exact same thing).  21 C.F.R. � 1308.11(f)(1).  However, the DEA is saying that dronabinol itself was not transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA.  The DEA claims that only a pharmaceutical product, dronabinol (synthetic) in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules, was transferred to Schedule II.     On page 21 of its brief, the DEA briefly mentions Grinspoon v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 828 F.2d 881, 891-892 (1st Cir. 1987), but completely fails to mention its subsequent approval by this court in Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 930 F.2d 936, 939-940 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  The Grinspoon court held that the DEA cannot rely on FDA marketing approval in making scheduling decisions.  While it is true, as the DEA points out in footnote 13, on page 21 of its brief, that FDA marketing approval is sufficient to establish _________________________________________________________________other medicinal qualities, just none that are presently recognized by the medical profession.                              - 9 - accepted medical use, the DEA fails to acknowledge that lack of FDA marketing approval does not necessitate a finding that the substance has no medical use.  Alliance, 930 F.2d at 939; Grinspoon, 828 F.2d at 891.  As this court wrote in 1977,     If, as respondent contends, a determination that the      substance has no accepted medical use ends the inquiry,      then presumably Congress would have spelled that out in      its procedural guidelines.  Its failure to do so      indicates an intent to reserve to HEW a finely tuned      balancing process involving several medical and      scientific considerations.NORML, 559 F.2d at 748.  It would be ludicrous to assume that dronabinol has no medical value unless it is in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules, or that it would have no medical value if it were extracted from a marijuana plant.     It is interesting to note in footnote 7, on page 11, and, again on page 14 of the DEA's brief, that the DEA recognizes that Congress had strong doubts about placing marijuana in Schedule I and fully intended that further research would clarify this matter.  Further research has indeed revealed that marijuana has at least as much therapeutic value as coca and opium poppy.       It is also disturbing how the DEA ignores the holdings in United States v. Walton, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  This court specifically held that marijuana was illegal only to the extent that it contained THC.  This court interpreted the plain meaning of the statute, as well as its history in the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, and determined that it was plain from the face of the statute that THC10 was the controlling factor in ____________________     10   The term "THC", as used by this court, referred to dronabinol, since it is the only isomer of delta-9-THC which is                               - 10 - marijuana's scheduling.  The DEA seems to think this holding has been overruled by subsequent decisions in Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936, and Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. DEA, 15 F.3d 1131.  Again, the issues raised were not the same, and neither of the Alliance rulings are res judicata as to the issue presented here.     In footnote 10, on page 16 of its brief, the DEA makes an interesting analogy to a substance by the name of levo-alphacetylmethadol.  This is a great analogy, because it's almost exactly the same situation as we have with levo-(trans)-delta-9-THC.  The other three isomers of delta-9-THC are psychoactively inactive.  In other words, they have little, if any, medical value, which means that it's highly unlikely they will ever be rescheduled to Schedule II (or below) under the DEA's currently proposed (and faulty) standards.  It also means they have practically no abuse potential, which means that it's highly unlikely they would have ever been scheduled in Schedule I (or any schedule) if it had not been for their psychoactive counterpart (dronabinol).  As this court noted in Walton, it was the psychoactive isomer of delta-9-THC that caused marijuana to be outlawed in the first place.11  If none of the isomers of delta-9-THC were psychoactive, it would be highly unlikely that _________________________________________________________________present in the marijuana plant, and it is the only form of THC which is psychoactive.     11   At the time Walton was decided, the term THC was used as if it were the same thing as dronabinol, because the levo-(trans) isomer is the only isomer of delta-9-THC that is actually produced by the plant.  The other isomers can only be produced in a chemical laboratory.                              - 11 - Congress would ever have even thought of outlawing marijuana.  Without the psychoactive isomer of delta-9-THC, marijuana is just another weed.     Marijuana is the source of dronabinol, and not the source of the other three isomers of delta-9-THC.  Practically speaking, it is the levo-(trans) isomer of delta-9-THC that we are speaking of when we refer to delta-9-THC.  In the DEA's analogy, alphacetylmethadol would be the equivalent of delta-9-THC, and levo-alphacetylmethadol would be the equivalent of dronabinol.       Alphacetylmethadol doesn't come from a plant, it's made synthetically.12  If alphacetylmethadol came from a plant, that plant would only be controlled to the extent that it contained the psychoactive substance levo-alphacetylmethadol and not the other isomers of alphacetylmethadol which are psychoactively inactive.13  The difference between alphacetylmethadol and marijuana is that the former comes from a test tube and the latter comes from a seed.  The genesis of alphacetylmetadol is a test tube and the genesis of delta-9-THC is a plant.  The precedent for the treatment of plants has already been established by Congress in drafting the Controlled Substances Act.  The analogy breaks down, because alphacetylmethadol does not come from a plant.  Both alphacetylmethadol and the three non-dronabinol isomers of delta-9-THC can only be made synthetically.  However, dronabinol is produced either ____________________     12   Id. Professor Morgan, footnote 4, supra.     13   Id. Professor Morgan, footnote 4, supra.                              - 12 - synthetically or by a plant, while levo-alphacetylmethadol can only be made synthetically.     One last point that should be mentioned again is that the DEA originally sought to reschedule dronabinol itself.  50 Fed. Reg. 42,186 (Oct. 18, 1985).  On page 19 of the DEA's brief, the DEA incorrectly states that this proposal was only for synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule.  The original proposal was for dronabinol itself, not a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved product.  The actual rescheduling order changed the rescheduling to "dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules."  51 Fed. Reg. 17,476 (1986).  This is not difficult to understand, because this action was prior to the 1987 ruling in Grinspoon v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 828 F.2d 881, 891-892 (1st Cir. 1987), where the First Circuit ruled that the DEA could not rely solely on FDA marketing approval in making scheduling decisions.  This court approved the holding of the Grinspoon court in Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 930 F.2d 936, 939-940 (D.C. Cir. 1991).     The DEA's assertion that dronabinol was not rescheduled, along with its assertion that marijuana is not the source of an accepted medicine are false.  Evidence of the DEA's error is the list of controlled substances contained in Schedule I and Schedule II in the Code of Federal Regulations at 21 C.F.R. �� 1308.11 and 1308.12.  Dronabinol is the only substance that contains the following added language:                              - 13 -      (synthetic) in sesame oil and encapsulated in a soft      gelating capsule in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration      approved drug product21 C.F.R. � 1308.11(f)(1).  Every other substance in Schedule I and Schedule II is identified only by its chemical name.14  The addition of sesame oil and gelatin capsules does nothing to change the nature of the substance dronabinol.  In the petitioner's brief attached to the original petition filed with the DEA, the substance identified is dronabinol, not a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved product.             FAILURE TO FOLLOW PROPER ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE     Since the DEA is concerned about following proper administrative procedure, it should be noted that the DEA has failed to follow proper administrative procedure on numerous occasions, particularly in four cases (three in which the petitioner has been a party).  National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (case remanded because DEA refused to accept a rescheduling petition); Carl Eric Olsen v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 776 F.2d 267 (11th Cir. 1985) (DEA scolded for refusing to respond to a rescheduling petition); Carl Eric Olsen v. Drug ____________________     14   Admittedly, there is some cross-scheduling of substances in the lower schedules (e.g., codeine is in Schedule II, while codeine diluted to "not more than 200 milligrams of codeine per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams" is in Schedule V), but such cross-scheduling involves diluted forms of the same drug.  It is important to note that codeine is in Schedule II, not Schedule I, because it has medical use.  To suggest that codeine be included in Schedule I unless it is in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules would be absurd.  It is also important to note that there is no cross-scheduling between Schedule I and Schedule II (with the exception of dronabinol).                              - 14 - Enforcement Administration, 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (petitioner had to file for a writ of mandamus to compel the DEA to accept a rescheduling petition, and case later remanded because DEA failed to properly address the issues raised); Carl Eric Olsen v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 93-1109 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 9, 1993) (case remanded because DEA refused to accept a rescheduling petition).  This record shows that the DEA has made a consistent effort to obstruct justice and deny petitioners the first amendment constitutional right to petition government for a redress of grievances.                           CONCLUSION     The regulations of the DEA clearly state that a petition to reschedule can be brought by any interested party.  21 C.F.R. � 1307.03.  It is important that citizens be encouraged to keep an eye on government officials; in fact, it is a civil duty.  It is not the function of the government to keep the citizen from falling into error; it is the function of the citizen to keep the government from falling into error.     The DEA improperly failed to reschedule marijuana and dronabinol when it rescheduled the pharmaceutical equivalent of dronabinol.  The DEA improperly refused to reschedule marijuana when this error was brought to its attention.  The appropriate remedy is for this court to order that marijuana and dronabinol are both included within Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.                              - 15 -                     REQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT     The petitioner respectfully requests that he be granted oral argument in this matter.

All the best...LEH TO: L. Hirsch FROM: A. Kubiak RE: Review of Administrative Decisions Under the APA _______________________________________________________________________ The following information is a rough overview of the standard of review we will use to show the administrator's decision was made unfairly. Interestingly, none of the squibs I read noted that an administrator's decision, made arbitrarily and capriciously, violated a person's due process rights. I think this is because a decision improperly made in violation of the APA is not a constitutional violation per se. There are other possible causes of action which we may want to pursue. One area which crosses over into the APA issue is whether or not the administrator's decision was made in violation of the statute itself. According to the clear language of the statute the administrator is not to make the decision to reschedule without getting binding advice from HHS. It is not clear to me in this case that such advice was ever obtained regarding the difference between synthetic and actual delta-9-THC. Carl's argument that HHS has impliedly recommended moving 'true' THC to schedule 2 thru itsallowance of Marinol on schedule 2 is persuasive. Unfortunately, there is case precedent which treats the synthetic compound differently from the real thing. It seems that a good equal protection argument could be gleaned from this confusion. I have not really figured it out yet but I am thinking along the lines of an argument that Marinol users and 'compassionate use' patients are similarly situated groups being treated dissimilarly with for no rationally related government purpose. If we could construct an argument that the compassionate use patients have a significant liberty interest at stake (ie. the possibility of prosecution as opposed to the Marinol users), we may elevate the argument to a strict scrutiny plateau. All of these ideas are far beyond the scope of Carl's argument. Even so, they may be worthwhile to include should we get lucky. The following is a general guide which covers the basics of administrative review. It is neither exhaustive nor complete! I just thought you might want a little refresher course on administrative law for our conversation. Ihope to start building small, detailed and exhaustive memorandum on eachaspect of our petition. We should discuss how to break the argument section into small parts addressing each test under the standard of review. I asked Ryan to get copies of NORML's petition so that we don't end up duplicating their work. While they are using the same standard, their factual approach is different. If either of us were to get cert. granted, I would guess the court would pull in the other petition as well. STANDARD OF REVIEW In determining the reviewability of an agency action, the court must strike a balance between the goal of efficient agency action and the value of judicial review in ensuring the rationality and fairness of agency decision making. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. SEC., 606 F.2d 1031 (1979). It is the duty of the reviewing court to determine whether the course followed by the agency is consistent with the constitutional mandate from Congress on which it acted. The court must then justify and explain any departure from prior norms. Scott Paper Co. v. U.S., 372 F.Supp. 721, aff'd, 419 U.S. 807 (1979). The standard of judicial review of an agency action is based upon the scope of review outlined in �10(e) of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 USCS �706) and assuming that the statutory procedures are met and that the constitutional provisions have been complied with, a reviewing court is limited to a determination of whether the agency substantially complied with its statutory and regulatory procedures, whether its factual determinations were supported by substantial evidence and whether its actions were arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. Albert v. Chafee, 571 F.2d 1063 (1978). In review under this statute the court must inquire whether the agency action was within the scope of the agencies authority, whether agency conformed to its procedural requirements, and whether the decision was arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law. The third inquiry requires that the court consider whether the decision was based on consideration of relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgement. PPG Industries Inc. v. Harrison, 587 F.2d 237 (CA 5 1979), reh'g den., 591 F.2d 102, revrs'd on other grounds, 446 US 578. In reviewing challenged actions, the court must first determine whether a government official whose actions are being challenged followed necessary procedural requirements in reaching and implementing his challenged decision. Secondly, the courts must inquire whether the government official acted within the scope of his authority, that is, whether the decision was within the range of judgments he could legally make, whether they properly construed the limits of his authority and whether there is evidence before him sufficient to render it possible for him to reasonably believe the actions he took were ultimately within the limits of his authority. Finally, a court must consider whether the decision was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. This implies that the decision must have been based on good faith consideration of relevant factors and whether there was a clear error of judgement. Movement Against Destruction v. Trainor, 400 F.Supp. 533 (1975). --STATUTORY INTERPRETATION Statutory interpretation by an agency of statutes within its mandate is reviewable under the arbitrary and capricious standard and is not entitled great deference. Local School Board of Educ. v. Geauga County MHA, 732 F.2d 505 (1982). This is due to the consideration that the court is equally (if not more so) qualified to interpret the law. Matzke v. Block, 732 F.2d 799 (1983).* See long negative case history. OTHER STANDARDS Clearly Erroneous Test: In applying the arbitrary and Capricious test the court must consider whether the decision was based on consideration of relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error in judgement. Bowman Transportation Inc. v. Arkansas Best Freight System, 419 U.S. 281 (1974). Rational Basis Test: Under the aforementioned tests, there may be a careful inquiry into facts, the ultimate scope of review is a narrow one, namely that the administrator's decision was a rational one. See Id. ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS In General: Under section 706 the court is not permitted to substitute its own judgement for that of an agency. The standards require the courts inquiry must be searching and careful. The court must insure both that the agency has adequately considered all relevant factors and that it has demonstrated rational connections between facts found and the choices made and the court must examine the procedures employed by the agency in reaching its decision to insure that those procedures comply with applicable statutory and constitutional requirements. United States Lines Inc. v. Federal MaritimeCom., 584 F.2d 519 (1978). The arbitrary and capricious standard is applicable to both the situation where the agency has decided to act as well as to the situation where the agency has decided not to act. NRDC v. SEC, 432 F.Supp.1190 (1977). The burden to overcome the presumption that the agency's action was rational is placed on the complaining party. Great Salt Lake Minerals & Chemical Corp. v. Marsh, 96 F.Supp. 548 (1984). Construction of Standard: Agency rule meets the standard where it entirely fails to consider important aspects of the problem or offers explanations for its decision which run counter to evidence before an agency or offers an explanation so implausible that the agency could not ascribe to difference in review. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Asso. v. State Farm Met. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983). In order to have an action set aside the challenging party must prove that it was willful and unreasoning action without consideration and in disregard of facts or circumstances of case. Moore v. Curtis, 736 F.2d 1260 (1984). A decision is arbitrary where the agency relies on factors not intended by Congress, entirely ignores important aspects of the problem, explains its decision in a manner contrary to the evidence before it or reaches a decision so implausible that it cannot be subscribed to difference in view. Bedford County Hospital v. HHS, 769 F.2d 1017 (1985). Support for agencies action must appear in the record. National Welfare Rights Org. v. Mathews, 533 F.2d 637 (1976). STANDING: 5 USCS �702 does not create substantive rights, and there is therefore no right to sue for violation of APA in absence of a relative statute. Alvarez Mendez v. Stock, 941 F.2d 956 (1991). In cases arising under the APA standing requires that the plaintiff show challenged action has caused injury in fact. A claim is defeated where claim of injury is threatened rather than actual and risk of injury need not be certain as opposed to contingent. Idaho Conservation League v. Mumma, 956F.2d 1058 (1992). Review is permitted only in cases brought by a person whose putative injuries are within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the statute in question. INS. v. Legalization Assistance Project of the LA County Fed'n of Labor, 114 S.Ct. 422 (1993).WT01-B18-261IA087-000632-B042-208http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/MEDICAL/caprop215.html 206.61.184.43 19970122072357 text/html 4138HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 07:23:50 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:04:04 GMTContent-length: 3923 California Proposition 215 http://www.prop215.org/prop215.html http://Vote96.ss.ca.gov/Vote96/html/BP/215.htm vote totals for California propositions http://Vote96.ss.ca.gov/Vote96/html/vote/prop/page.961113073101.html Proposition 215 Medical Marijuana Intiative Section 1. Section 11362.5 is added to the Health andSafety Code, to read: 11362.5. (a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. (b) (l) The people of the State of California hereby find and declare that the purposes of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as follows: (A) To ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician who has determined that the person's health would benefit from the use of marijuana in the treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief. (B) To ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon the recommendation of a physician are not subject to criminal prosecution or sanction. (C) To encourage the federal and state governments to implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need of marijuana. (2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others, nor to condone the diversion of marijuana for nonmedical purposes. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no physician in this state shall be punished, or denied any right or privilege, for having recommended marijuana to a patient for medical purposes.

(e) For the purposes of this section, "primary caregiver" means the individual designated by the person exempted under this act who has consistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of that person. Sec. 2. If any provision of this measure or theapplication thereof to any person or circumstance is heldinvalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions orapplications of the measure which can be given effect without theinvalid provision or application, and to this end the provisionsof this measure are severable.

TEXT OF PROPOSED AMENDMENT Be it enacted by the people of the State of Arizona: The following amendments are proposed to become valid when approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon and upon proclamation pursuant thereto by the Governor of the State of Arizona. Section 1. TITLE THIS ACT SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS THE "DRUG MEDICALIZATION, PREVENTION, AND CONTROL ACT OF 1996." Section 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA FIND AND DECLARE THE FOLLOWING: ARIZONA'S CURRENT APPROACH TO DRUG CONTROL NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED. THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT, ACCORDING TO THE ARIZONA CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMISSION, BETWEEN 1991 AND 1993 MARIJUANA USE DOUBLED AMONG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS AND, BETWEEN 1990 AND 1993 QUADRUPLED AMONG MIDDLE-SCHOOL STUDENTS. IN ADDITION TO ACTIVELY ENFORCING OUR CRIMINAL LAWS AGAINST DRUGS, WE NEED TO MEDICALIZE ARIZONA'S DRUG CONTROL POLICY: RECOGNIZING THAT DRUG ABUSE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AND TREATING ABUSE AS A DISEASE. THUS, DRUG TREATMENT AND PREVENTION MUST BE EXPANDED. WE MUST ALSO TOUGHEN ARIZONA'S LAWS AGAINST VIOLENT CRIMINALS ON DRUGS. ANY PERSON WHO COMMITS A VIOLENT CRIME WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS SHOULD SERVE 100% OF HIS OR HER SENTENCE WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EARLY RELEASE. THOUSANDS OF ARIZONANS SUFFER FROM DEBILITATING DISEASES SUCH AS GLAUCOMA, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, CANCER, AND AIDS, BUT CANNOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE NECESSARY DRUGS THEY NEED. ALLOWING DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE SCHEDULE I CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES COULD SAVE VICTIMS OF THESE DISEASES FROM LOSS OF SIGHT, LOSS OF PHYSICAL CAPACITY, AND GREATLY REDUCE THE PAIN AND SUFFERING OF THE SERIOUSLY ILL AND TERMINALLY ILL. THE DRUG PROBLEMS OF NON-VIOLENT PERSONS WHO ARE CONVICTED OF PERSONAL POSSESSION OR USE OF DRUGS ARE BEST HANDLED THROUGH COURT-SUPERVISED DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN LOCKING NON-VIOLENT OFFENDERS UP IN A COSTLY PRISON. PILOT PROGRAMS IN ARIZONA THAT PROVIDE TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES TO PRISON FOR LOW LEVEL DRUG OFFENDERS HAVE A 73% SUCCESS RATE AND COST ROUGHLY 1/8 AS MUCH AS PRISON. OVER THE NEXT DECADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS CAN BE SAVED BY USING MANDATORY DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PRISON. VIOLENT OFFENDERS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PUNISHED DUE TO THE PRISON OVER-CROWDING CRISIS IN ARIZONA. PLACING NON-VIOLENT PERSONS WHO ARE CONVICTED OF PERSONAL POSSESSION OR USE OF DRUGS IN COURT-SUPERVISED DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS WILL FREE UP SPACE IN OUR PRISONS SO THAT THERE IS ROOM TO INCARCERATE VIOLENT OFFENDERS AND DRUG DEALERS. THE MISSING LINK IN DRUG EDUCATION AND PREVENTION IS PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT. THE TAX DOLLARS SAVED BY ELIMINATING PRISON TIME FOR NON-VIOLENT PERSONS CONVICTED OF PERSONAL POSSESSION OR USE OF DRUGS SHOULD BE USED FOR DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION, TARGETED AT PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR CHILDREN'S DRUG-EDUCATION. Section 3. PURPOSE AND INTENT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA DECLARE THEIR PURPOSES TO BE AS FOLLOWS: TO REQUIRE THAT ANY PERSON WHO COMMITS A VIOLENT CRIME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS SERVE 100 PERCENT OF HIS OR HER SENTENCE AND NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE OR ANY FORM OF EARLY RELEASE. TO PERMIT DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE SCHEDULE I CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES TO TREAT A DISEASE, OR TO RELIEVE THE PAIN AND SUFFERING OF SERIOUSLY ILL AND TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS. TO REQUIRE THAT NON-VIOLENT PERSONS CONVICTED OF PERSONAL POSSESSION OR USE OF DRUGS SUCCESSFULLY UNDERGO COURT-SUPERVISED MANDATORY DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND PROBATION. TO REQUIRE THAT NON-VIOLENT PERSONS CURRENTLY IN PRISON FOR PERSONAL POSSESSION OR USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS, AND NOT SERVING A CONCURRENT SENTENCE FOR ANOTHER CRIME, OR PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OR SENTENCED OR SUBJECT TO SENTENCING UNDER ANY HABITUAL CRIMINAL STATUTE IN ANY JURISDICTION IN THE UNITED STATES, BE MADE ELIGIBLE FOR IMMEDIATE PAROLE AND DRUG TREATMENT, EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY SERVICE. TO FREE UP SPACE IN OUR PRISONS TO PROVIDE ROOM FOR VIOLENT OFFENDERS. TO EXPAND THE SUCCESS OF PILOT DRUG INTERVENTION PROGRAMS WHICH DIVERT DRUG OFFENDERS FROM PRISON TO DRUG TREATMENT, EDUCATION, AND COUNSELING. Section 4. Title 41, Chapter 11, Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended by adding�41-1604.16 to read as follows: �41-1604.16. ARIZONA PARENTS COMMISSION ON DRUG EDUCATION AND PREVENTION.

EACH MEMBER SHALL BE APPOINTED FOR A TERM OF TWO YEARS. THE MEMBERS SHALL RECEIVE NO PAY, BUT MAY BE REIMBURSED FOR ACTUAL EXPENSES INCURRED ON COMMISSION BUSINESS. THE COMMISSION SHALL FUND PROGRAMS THAT WILL INCREASE AND ENHANCE PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT AND WILL INCREASE EDUCATION ABOUT THE SERIOUS RISKS AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE ABUSE OF ALCOHOL AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. THE COMMISSION SHALL CONTRACT FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES WITH A NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION OR GOVERNMENT ENTITY WITH EXPERTISE IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE EDUCATION AND PREVENTION. Section 5. Title 41, Chapter 11, Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended by adding�41-1604.14 to read as follows: �4l-1604.14.

Severability If any provision of this Act, or part thereof, is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining sections shall not be affectedbut shall remain in full force and effect, and to this end the provisions ofthe Act are severable. ANALYSIS BY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL (In compliance with A.R.S. section 19-124) Proposition 200 would require that certain persons who are convicted of drug offenses be sentenced as follows: Require that persons who commit violent crimes while under the influence of drugs serve 100% of their sentences, without eligibility for parole. Require that persons who have been convicted before the propositionpasses of the personal possession or use of a controlled substance such asmarijuana and who are serving their sentence in prison be released onparole. A person is released on parole after serving time in jail or prison,is under the supervision of a parole officer and may have his parole revokedif any condition of parole is violated. The State Department of Correctionswould be required to establish a procedure for paroling these persons. TheBoard of Executive Clemency would be required to release these personsunless the Board determines that a person would be a danger to the generalpublic. Persons who are released on parole would be required to participatein drug treatment or education. Require that persons who are convicted after the proposition passes ofthe personal possession or use of a controlled substance such as marijuanabe eligible for probation. A person who is sentenced to probation does notserve any time in jail or prison, is under the supervision of a probationofficer and remains free as long as the person continues his good behavior.A person on probation would be required to participate in a drug treatmentor education program. Proposition 200 would allow medical doctors to prescribe a controlledsubstance such as marijuana to treat a disease or to relieve the pain andsuffering of a seriously or terminally ill patient. The doctor must be ableto document that scientific research supports the use of the controlledsubstance and must obtain a written opinion from a second doctor thatprescribing the controlled substance is appropriate. A patient who receives,possesses or uses a controlled substance as prescribed by a doctor would notbe subject to criminal penalties. Proposition 200 would establish the Drug Treatment and Education Fund. These monies would come from a percentage of the luxury tax on alcohol, cigarettes and other tobacco products. 50% of these monies would be transferred to Superior Court probation departments to cover the costs of placing persons in drug education and treatment programs. The remaining 50% of the monies would be transferred to the Arizona Parents Commission on Drug Education and Prevention. Proposition 200 would establish an Arizona Parents Commission on DrugEducation and Prevention.

District Court of Appeal of Florida, First District. June 18, 1991. Defendants were convicted in the Circuit Court, Bay County, Clinton Foster, J., of cultivating cannabis and possession of drug paraphernalia, and they appealed. The District Court of Appeal, Ervin, J., held that: (1) statute defining cannabis as Schedule I substance did not preclude defense of medical necessity, and (2) defendants established medical necessity defense. Reversed. Nimmons, J., dissented. 1. Drugs and Narcotics 78 Statute defining cannabis as Schedule I substance did not preclude defense of medical necessity raised by defendant's charged with cultivating cannabis and possession of drug paraphernalia, who allegedly used marijuana to treat nausea which they suffered in connection with their contraction of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). West's F.S.A. § 893.03(1)(d). JENKS v. STATE Fla. 677 Cite as 582 So.2d 676 (Fla.App. 1 Dist. 1991) 2. Drugs and Narcotics 78 Defendants charged with cultivating cannabis and possession of drug paraphernalia established medical necessity defense; medical expert and physician testified that no other drug or treatment was available that would effectively eliminate or diminish nausea suffered by defendants, who had contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and defendants established that if their nausea was not controlled, their lives were in danger. West's F.S.A. §§ 893.13, 893.147. 3. Drugs and Narcotics 78 Elements of medical necessity defense to use of controlled substance are: that defendant did not intentionally bring about circumstances which precipitated unlawful act; that defendant could not accomplish same objective using less offensive alternative available to defendant; and that evil sought to be avoided was more heinous than unlawful act perpetrated to avoid it. John F. Daniel, of Daniel & Komarek, Chartered, Panama City, for appellants. Robert A. Butterworth, Atty. Gen., and Gypsy Bailey, Asst. Atty. Gen., Tallahassee, for appellee. ON MOTION FOR REHEARING ERVIN, Judge. We substitute the following opinion for Jenks v. State, 16 F.L.W. D1070, 1991 WL 61786 (Fla. 1st DCA Apr. 16, 1991). Kenneth and Barbara Jenks appeal their convictions for cultivation of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, contending that the trial court erred in refusing to recognize their defense of medical necessity. We agree and reverse. Kenneth Jenks inherited hemophilia from his mother, and contracted the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus from a blood transfusion in 1980. He unknowingly passed it to his wife, Barbara Jenks. Mrs. Jenks' health began to decline rapidly. Her weight dropped from 150 to 112 pounds during a three week period as a result of constant vomiting, and she was hospitalized at least six times for two to three weeks at a time. Although she had been prescribed over a half-dozen oral medications for nausea, none of them worked. When given shots for nausea, she was left in a stupor and unable to function. Like wise, when Mr. Jenks started AZT treatment, he was not able to eat because the medication left him constantly nauseous. He also lost weight, although not as dramatically as his wife. When the Jenks began participating in a support group sponsored by the Bay County Health Department, a group member told them how marijuana had helped him. Although initially reluctant, Mr. and Mrs. Jenks tried marijuana and found that they were able to retain their AIDS medications, eat, gain weight, maintain their health, and stay out of the hospital. They asked their treating physician about prescribing the drug, but were unable to obtain a legal prescription. The Jenks decided to grow two marijuana plants to insure its availability, avoid the expense of buying it on the street, and reduce the possibility of arrest. On March 29, 1990, the Jenks were arrested and charged with manufacturing (cultivating) cannabis, pursuant to Section 893.13, Florida Statutes (1989), and possession of drug paraphernalia, a violation of Section 893.147, Florida Statutes (1989). The Jenks admitted to cultivating the marijuana and advised officers at the scene that they each had AIDS and used the marijuana to relieve their symptoms. The Jenks waived their right to a jury trial and agreed that the bench trial should center on their defense of medical necessity. Because their physician, Thomas Sunnenberg, was not available to testify, the parties stipulated that Dr. Sunnenberg's testimony would be, in part: Defense witness, THOMAS D. SUNNENBERG, M.D. ... will testify as follows: * * * * * * * * 8. That he has been unable to find any effective drug for treating the defendants' nausea. 582 SOUTHERN REPORTER, 2d SERIES 678 9. That the nausea is so debilitating that if it is not controlled, the defendants could die. 10. That if he could legally prescribe Cannabis Sativa as a drug to control their nausea he would. 11. That the only drug that controls their nausea is Cannabis Sativa. 12. That he is presently seeking access to legal Cannabis Sativa through the Food and Drug Administration under the Compassionate Investigational New Drug Program (IND) for the Jenks. At trial, the defense also presented two expert witnesses, Robert Randall, who suffers from glaucoma and who successfully asserted the defense of medical necessity against a charge of marijuana cultivation in 1976,* and Dr. Daniel Dansak of Alabama, who has treated over fifty patients who have used marijuana to alleviate both disease symptoms and side-effects of medication. The trial judge rejected the defense of medical necessity, found the Jenks guilty of manufacturing marijuana, and withheld adjudication of guilt, placing the Jenks on one year of unsupervised probation. He ordered the Jenks to perform 500 hours of community service, to be discharged only by "providing care, comfort and concern for each other." The necessity defense has been formulated as follows: The pressure of natural physical forces sometimes confronts a person in an emergency with a choice of two evils: either he may violate the literal terms of the criminal law and thus produce a harmful result, or he may comply with those terms and thus produce a greater or equal or lesser amount of harm. For reasons of social policy, if the harm which will result from compliance with the law is greater than that which will result from violation of it, he is by virtue of the defense of necessity justified in violating it. W.R. LaFave & A.W. Scott, Jr., 1 Substantive Criminal Law § 5.4, at 627 (1986) (hereinafter LaFave & Scott). Or, as stated by Justice Holmes, "'Detached reflection cannot be expected in the presence of an uplifted knife.'" Arnolds & Garland, The Defense of Necessity in Criminal Law: The Right to Choose the Lesser Evil, 65 J.Crim.L. & Criminology 289, 290 (1974) (hereinafter Arnolds & Garland) (quoting Brown v. United States, 256 U.S. 335, 41 S.Ct. 501, 65 L.Ed. 961 (1921)). Although there is no specific legislative acceptance of the necessity defense in Florida, we conclude that the defense was recognized at common law and that there has been no clearly expressed legislative rejection of such defense. The necessity defense was articulated as early as 1551 in Reninger v. Fagossa, 1 Plowd. 1, 19, 75 Eng.Rep. 1, 29-30 (1551): "[W]here the words of [the law] are broken to avoid greater inconvenience, or through necessity, or by compulsion," the law has not been broken. Arnolds & Garland, at 291. The authors state that the defense is poorly developed in Anglo-American jurisprudence because there are so few cases dealing with it, "probably because these cases are not often prosecuted." In any event, they indicate that although there is some disagreement on this, "it seems clear that necessity was a defense at common law." Arnolds & Garland, at 290. The authors cite a number of pre-1776 cases involving the necessity defense. Arnolds & Garland, at 291 n. 29.* Consequently, we consider that Florida has adopted the necessity defense pursuant to Section 2.01, Florida Statutes (1989), which provides: The common and statute laws of England which are of a general and not a local nature ... are declared to be of force in this state; provided, the said statutes and common law be not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States and the acts of the Legislature of this state. JENKS v. STATE Fla. 679 Cite as 582 So.2d 676 (Fla.App. 1 Dist. 1991) The medical-necessity defense is merely a more particular application of the necessity defense, See, e.g., LaFave & Scott at § 5.4(c)7, at 631-33; G.E. Torcia, 1 Wharton's Criminal Law § 88 (1978); 22 C.J.S. Criminal Law § 50 (1989). In fact, in Bavero v. State, 347 So.2d 781 (Fla. 1st DCA 1977), this court recognized the defense of medical necessity there asserted by a prison escapee. Accord State v. Alcantaro, 407 So.2d 922, 924 (Fla. 1st DCA 1981) ("Medical necessity was recognized as an arguable defense by this court in Bavero v. State[.]"), review denied, 413 So.2d 875 (Fla.1982). [1] Although the state conceded at oral argument that the necessity defense exists in Florida's common law, the state nevertheless contends that Section 893.03, Florida Statutes (1989), is inconsistent with and therefore precludes the defense in the case at bar. We disagree. Section 893.03(1) provides: SCHEDULE 1. A substance in Schedule I has a high potential for abuse and has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and in its use under medical supervision does not meet accepted safety standards except for such uses provided for in s. 402.36. The following substances are controlled in Schedule I: * * * * * * * * (c)4. Cannabis. (Footnote omitted.) However, subsection (1)(d) provides, Notwithstanding the aforementioned fact that Schedule I substances have no currently accepted medical use, the Legislature recognizes that certain substances are currently accepted for certain limited medical uses in treatment in the United States but have a high potential for abuse. The state argues that section 893.03 permits no medical uses of marijuana whatsoever. In fact, all that subsection (1) states is that marijuana is not generally available for medical use. Subsection (1)(d), however, clearly indicates that Schedule I substances may be subject to limited medical uses. It is well established that a statute should not be construed as abrogating the common law unless it speaks unequivocally, and should not be interpreted to displace common law more than is necessary. Carlile v. Game & Fresh Water Fish Comm'n, 354 So.2d 362, 364 (Fla.1977) (quoting 30 Fla.Jur. Statutes § 130 (rev. ed. 1974); State v. Egan, 287 So.2d 1, 6-7 (Fla.1973); Sullivan v. Leatherman, 48 So.2d 836, 838 (Fla.1950) (en banc). We conclude that section 893.03 does not preclude the defense of medical necessity under the particular facts of this case. [2, 3] Moreover, we conclude that the Jenks met their burden of establishing this defense at trial. The elements of the defense have previously been addressed by trial courts in United States v. Randall, 104 Daily Wash.L.Rep. 2249 (Super.Ct.D.C. Nov. 24, 1976), and in Florida in State v. Mussika, 14 F.L.W. 1 (Fla. 17th Cir.Ct. Dec. 28, 1988), which both involved the medically necessary use of marijuana by people with glaucoma. Those elements are as follows: 1. That the defendant did not intentionally bring about the circumstance which precipitated the unlawful act; 2. That the defendant could not accomplish the same objective using a less offensive alternative available to the defendant; and 3. That the evil sought to be avoided was more heinous than the unlawful act perpetrated to avoid it. As applied to the case at bar, the Jenks obviously did not intend to contract AIDS. Furthermore, the Jenks' medical expert and physician testified that no drug or treatment is available that would effectively eliminate or diminish the Jenks' nausea.* Finally, the Jenks established that if their nausea was not controlled, their lives were 582 SOUTHERN REPORTER, 2d SERIES 680 in danger.* The state put on no evidence that contradicted the Jenks, and the trial court had no authority to reject the witnesses' testimony. Based upon these facts, we conclude the trial court erred in reject ing the Jenks' defense and in convicting them as charged. REVERSED with directions that judgment of acquittal be entered. ZEHMER, J., concurs. NIMMONS, J., dissents without written opinion. FOOTNOTES: 1. United States v. Randall, 104 Daily Wash.L. Rep. 2249 (Super.Ct.D.C. Nov. 24. 1976). 2.

Dr. Sunnenberg testified by stipulation that "he has been unable to find any effective drug for treating the defendants' nausea," and that "the only drug that controls their nausea is Cannabis Sativa." Dr. Dansak testified that there is a drug, Raglan, that is "a little more effective than marijuana," but that it must be given intravenously in "fairly whopping doses," thus creating problems with infections, particularly in AIDS patients. 4. The Jenks described their constant vomiting and weight loss at the hearing. Dr. Sunnenberg stated in his stipulated testimony that his patients' "nausea is so debilitating that if it is not controlled, the defendants could die." 589 SOUTHERN REPORTER, 2d SERIES 292 SUPREME COURT Docket Appeal from Title Number Date Disposition and Citation State v.

This man and his wife are smoking marijuana, but legal marijuana.  They are among only 14 people in the United States who have had it prescribed by their doctors.  Applications have to go through the DEA, the FDA, and the National Institute of Drug Abuse, and if all approve, the legal marijuana grown on a government farm in Mississippi is sent to the patient's pharmacist, a month's supply of cigarettes at a time.       Smoking to Live       SAFER:  Marijuana is not good for you.  It's an axiom.  But for some people, marijuana could be the difference between life and death.  That's what they and their doctors say.  The doctors prescribe it and the patients smoke it to live.      What you are watching is quite rare.  This man and his wife are smoking marijuana, but legal marijuana.  They are among only 14 people in the United States who had it prescribed by their doctors.  For Ken and Barbara Jenks, marijuana is but one more of the myriad of prescription drugs they must take every day.           [interviewing] How often do you smoke these?:     BARBARA JENKS:  We usually smoke - well, I usually smoke at least three to four a day.      SAFER:  What would happen to you physically, both of you, if you went for a couple of days without these?      KEN JENKS:  We'd throw up all the time.      Mrs. JENKS:  I would get sick to my stomach.      Mr. JENKS:  I mean, you couldn't - you get sick, and then you can't take your medicine, so      Mrs. JENKS:  I wouldn't be able to eat.      Mr. JENKS:  - and then you can't eat, so, I mean, the weight - and then you'd start losing weight, so, I mean -      Mrs. JENKS:  Having AIDS is like a wasting syndrome, you know, with      the virus and everything.  The smell of food, the - just even thinking about food just makes you nauseated.      SAFER:  [voice-over] Ken and Barbara Jenks are dying.  He is a hemophiliac.  Eleven years ago, he was given blood contaminated by the AIDS virus.  He unknowingly infected his wife.  They are both too sick to work.  They live on disability, barely able to cope.  Without the marijuana, they would probably be dead, would have wasted away because of the nausea brought on by their chemotherapy.      Before they got marijuana legally, they bought it on the street, or grew it, until last year, when police burst into their trailer in Panama City, Florida, and got the goods on them: two marijuana plants.      Mr. JENKS:  And then they started, you know, going through my house, I mean, just dumping drawers and tearing the cabinets up. SAFER:  [voice-over] The police thought they were onto something big when they found a suitcase filled with syringes and other drug paraphernalia.      Mr. JENKS:  I mean, they were going berserk. SAFER:  [voice-over] Ken tried to convince them that the syringes and the pills were prescribed by doctors.  He did not tell them that marijuana was the only medicine that enabled them to take the chemotherapy without being violently ill.      Mrs. JENKS:  You're talking to somebody that never wanted to take an aspirin for a headache.  It's - it's a relief to know that there's something that you can smoke to relieve the nausea from taking all the medications that you're on.      SAFER:  [voice-over] The Jenks were charged with growing marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia.  In court, their lawyer, John Daniel, tried to prove that for the Jenks, marijuana was a medical necessity.           [interviewing] Did the prosecution present any counterevidence?     JOHN DANIEL:  None whatsoever, sir.  In fact, they even stipulated in Kenny and Barbara's case that it was beneficial for them and that they would die without it.      SAFER:  The prosecution conceded that?      Mr. DANIEL:  Yes, sir.      SAFER:  But you lost the case because you couldn't prove medical necessity, so that doesn't jibe somehow.      Mr. DANIEL:  Judge Foster said there is no such doctrine as medical necessity in Florida, that it's a matter for the legislature to promulgate a statute that says that it is or is not.      SAFER:  But the judge was not an unsympathetic judge.     Mr. DANIEL:  Super judge.  The sweetest sentence I've had in 20 years of criminal defense work.     SAFER:  [voice-over] The judge found them guilty, but sentenced them to 500 hours of community service.  Their only task?  To look after each other.      As decent as the sentence was, the Jenks were outraged that they were still considered criminals.  They decided to appeal.      Mr. DANIEL:  Kenny and Barbara said, "Go for it.  We're going to be gone soon.  There's going to be people following in our footprints and in our pain and suffering, and there needs to be some law made one way or the other on it."  That's why they took it up on appeal, and I'm glad to do it for them.     SAFER:  Why?  They're not exactly the wealthiest clients in the world.     Mr. DANIEL:  No.  I'm not exactly charging them, sir.      SAFER:  [voice-over] The DEA classifies marijuana as a highly dangerous drug, in the same class as heroin and LSD.  And the only way to get it legally is to face a bureaucratic jungle, three of them.  Applications have to go through the DEA, the FDA and the National Institute of Drug Abuse, and if all approve, the legal marijuana, grown on a government farm in Mississippi, is sent to the patient's pharmacist, a month's supply of cigarettes at a time.      Robert Randall was the first American to gain legal access to marijuana for medical use.  He was diagnosed with glaucoma in 1972.  Doctors told him he had three to five years before he would go blind.  One evening, he tried a marijuana cigarette.      ROBERT RANDALL:  It was a bit like a "Eureka!" experience.  I mean, I had known in college that if I smoked marijuana, what the doctors then called "eyestrain" seemed to diminish, but I had never put all the pieces together, and suddenly they came together.  The next morning I woke up and thought that I was crazy.  It's crazy to believe that an illegal drug is going to prolong your sight, when all the modern pharmaceuticals have failed to do so.      SAFER:  [voice-over] Randall is still on prescription drugs, but his doctors found that the essential drug in relieving the intense eye pressure of glaucoma was marijuana, which he's been smoking for 15 years.  But getting it legally was not easy.      Mr. RANDALL:  It took 14 months from the time of my arrest.  I had to go  through -      SAFER:  You were arrested for possession?      Mr. RANDALL:  I was arrested for growing four marijuana plants.  I had to go through two controlled medical studies that were really unnecessary.  They simply demonstrated to others what I already knew to be the case.  And then I had to wait around for many months while a bunch of bureaucrats, who were really not very excited about this idea, decided whether or not I would go blind.  It's a very uncomfortable, frightening situation to be in.      SAFER:  [voice-over] Only 14 people are now able to get marijuana legally from the government.  It took the Jenks almost nine months to get their first prescription.  Many doctors are reluctant to make the effort, fearing that the ramifications of even applying for marijuana will affect their reputations.           [interviewing] The Jenks' own doctor, who prescribes marijuana for them, won't come on and talk about it.      Mr. DANIEL:  A junkie doctor.  He doesn't want to be called that.  I understand that.  He could - it could also be, "I'm afraid I'll have all of these people coming out of the woodwork saying, 'Oh, I've got a back pain, Doctor, how about giving me 400 joints?'"  I can understand that.      SAFER:  [voice-over] But many doctors say their reluctance to apply for a prescription has nothing to do with bureaucracy.  Dr. Richard Gralla, who heads the Department of Oncology at the Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans, told us that the scientific studies do not show marijuana as effective as other drugs, despite the claims of Randall and other patients.      Dr. RICHARD GRALLA:  There are testimonials for almost any medicine, and in fact, sometimes testimonials are the germ of a good idea, the beginning of a good idea.  Unfortunately, more often than not, they're just that, they're just testimonials.      SAFER:  [voice-over] But Dr. Lester Grinspoon, who practices psychiatry at Harvard University, disagrees.  He's one of the first physicians to take a stand on using marijuana as medical treatment.      Dr. LESTER GRINSPOON:  It is very useful for the treatment of the nausea and vomiting which accompanies the use of some chemotherapeutic substances for the treatment of some cancers.      SAFER:  [voice-over] Dr. Grinspoon knows it from the most personal kind of experience.  His son had leukemia and died, but during the chemothernpy Grinspoon feels it was the marijuana that was keeping young Danny alive.      Dr. GRINSPOON:  He would be so tense before he took the medicine, because he knew what was going to follow, and what followed was eight hours of first vomiting, and then retching.  It's very, very, difficult.  He got to the point where he said, "I'm not going to take the medicine anymore."     SAFER:  How old was he?      Dr. GRINSPOON:  He was 15.      SAFER:  [voice-over] His wife bought some marijuana near a local high school.  At Danny's next treatment, Grinspoon was amazed.      Dr. GRINSPOON:  It was absolutely stunning, the difference that this made.  He was relaxed, he had the treatment, he not only did not have nausea and vomiting, but he asked if he could get a submarine sandwich on the way home.  I was really dumbfounded.  I then called the doctor, Dr. Jaffe, who was taking care of him, and told him what had happened, and so the next time he smoked cannabis right in the treatment room at the Children's Hospital.  Same thing, not a bit of discomfort, ate afterwards, and it was then that Dr. Jaffe and I went to the head of the Children's Hospital, Dr. Frye, and suggested that maybe this bore some kind of systematic looking into.  And that, in fact, led to the Salan study, which first established that this is useful in the treatment of the nausea and vomiting of cancer chemotherapy.      SAFER:  But the DEA has maintained for years that marijuana has no therapeutic value, that it's a dangerous drug that must remain illegal.  However, no one from the DEA would come on this broadcast and respond to the scientific evidence of those who say otherwise.      Three years ago, the DEA's administrative law judge, Francis Young, wrote of marijuana, "In light of the evidence, it would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance."  But the DEA rejected its own judge's opinion and stands firm that doctors shall not prescribe marijuana.      [voice-over] Except, of course, for those few who are willing to go through the agonizingly long process of applying.  Desperate patients say they would rather live by buying marijuana illegally than die by playing by the rules.  Dr. Ivan Silverberg hears that all the time from his cancer patients in San Francisco.      Dr. IVAN SILVERBERG:  I have yet to hear of a patient who can't find it.  I have heard loud and clear from patients who resent having to go on the street when they're feeling sick, when they're nauseated, when they've lost 40 and 50, 60 pounds, to try and buy a drug from somebody without knowing whether that drug is adulterated because it comes off the street, of having to face the possibility that the person they're buying it from is an undercover policeman.  I think all these things are wrong.      SAFER:  [voice-over] But Silverberg says if he had to fill out that mountain of paperwork every time a patient needed marijuana, he wouldn't have time to treat his patients.           [interviewing] Why has the DEA dug its heels in on this and will not allow the general prescribing of marijuana by physicians when you can prescribe much more dangerous, much more habit-forming drugs?     Dr. SILVERBERG:  You're absolutely correct.  I think morphine, for example, Demerol, are far more hazardous drugs, in my opinion, than marijuana.  I think part of it is an entrenched bureaucracy that doesn't want to admit it's wrong.     Dr. GRALLA:  Even if it were available in 10 minutes down in the pharmacy, I'd be reluctant to write it.  It has nothing to do with it - the political issues that we have in drugs and the drug problem in the United States.  It's the fact that in my own experience in using cannabinoids - in my patients' experience, who have smoked marijuana, neither marijuana nor the cannabinoids measure up to those drugs that I have.      SAFER:  [voice-over] Among those drugs is Zofran, which has been on the market only for the past few months.  By all accounts, it works wonderfully.      Dr. SILVERBERG:  Zofran is a most effective drug which is said to have an 80 percent response rate, by their definition.  It costs $600 a day.     SAFER:  And the patient has to have it administered in the hospital?     Dr. SILVERBERG:  Or in a full - in an ambulatory care center where he's there, essentially, the whole day.      SAFER:  [voice-over] If marijuana is as effective as Doctors Silverberg and Grinspoon say it is, why haven't the drug companies tried to get government approval for it?      Dr. GRINSPOON:  You can't patent marijuana, it's a plant.  They can't make any money.  No way.  You see, in our country, the way drugs come into being, a drug company gets hold of a chemical, somebody discovered it has some sort of effect, they review it, they decide is it worth trying to do it. They have to invest between $80 and $100 million to get it from chemical to drug on the shelf.  But then they get an exclusive patent for 17 years, and they can earn a lot of money.  How could they possibly do this with cannabis?      SAFER:  [voice-over] For the Jenks, marijuana has made their troubled lives tolerable, and to the doubters they say -      Mrs. JENKS:  Do I look like a junkie?      Mr. JENKS:  Do I?  I mean -      Mrs. JENKS:  I wish I didn't have to take the medication that I - I wish I didn't even have to smoke marijuana.      Mr. JENKS:  Yeah.  It'd be nice to be to be free of drugs and disease, but we're not.  I mean, we need drugs.  I can't help that.  I mean, I've been taking drugs my whole life, and it hasn't made a junkie out of me.     SAFER:  Do you ever agonize over, "Why me?  Why us?"     Mr. JENKS:  At first.      Mrs. JENKS:  At first we did.      Mr. JENKS:  But then, I mean, for me it was easier.  I mean, I've been dealing with disease since I was six months old, so it was just like fuel to the fire.  I mean, you know, it was just one more thing.     Mrs. JENKS:  He blamed himself because I had gotten it, and I don't blame him, because he - you know, I love him, he's my husband.     Mr. JENKS:  You know, these are the cards you got dealt.  You've just got to play 'em or fold, kind of.      SAFER:  The Jenks eventually won their appeal and their criminal convictions were overturned.  The Public Health Service is not accepting any new applications into the program for marijuana prescriptions and it's considering closing it down entirely, regardless of what patients say.

Civil No. 93-0237 NHJFOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION,Defendant.                 DECLARATION OF DANIEL A. SPYKER, Ph.D., M.D. I, Dr. Daniel A. Spyker, do hereby declare the following:     1.   I am a Medical Officer in the Pilot Drug Evaluation Staff, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  I have held this position since August 1990.      2.   In my position as Medical Officer, I am engaged fulltime in the evaluation of clinical drug trials, proposed and completed, in support of investigational new drug applications (INDs) and new drug applications submitted to the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).  Since October 1990, I have been responsible for the review and follow-up of INDs relating to marijuana, including a number of single-patient INDs from physicians requesting therapeutic marijuana for their patients.      3.   A single-patient IND for marijuana, an unapproved new drug under the Act, allows a physician to receive and dispense the drug as an investigational drug for use in one specific patient.  Because marijuana is not a drug approved by the FDA, distribution of marijuana outside the IND process is in violation of the Act.     4.   While FDA processes and allows single-patient INDs for investigational drugs to proceed, FDA does not supply the drugs.  In the case of single-patient INDs for marijuana, the marijuana is provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services, pursuant to its authority under the Public Health Service Act.  Before the National Institute on Drug Abuse can supply marijuana to the sponsoring physician for a single-patient IND, because the drug is regulated under the Controlled Substances Act, the physician must apply to and receive approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Department of Justice, to receive and dispense the marijuana.  When the Drug Enforcement Administration issues a registration for the physician to receive the marijuana, it provides the order form which must be presented to the National Institute on Drug Abuse for shipment of the marijuana.      5.   When a single-patient IND for marijuana is received by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, it is forwarded to the Pilot Drug Evaluation Staff for review.  The IND is assigned to a consumer safety officer who distributes copies to the reviewing chemist, pharmacologist, and medical officer.  These reviewers decide whether it is safe for the study proposed in the IND to proceed.     6.   The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research received a single-patient IND for marijuana for Ladd Huffman on January 2, 1991.  The IND was submitted by Patricia J. Harrison, M.D.  The IND was received by the Pilot Drug Evaluation Staff on January 7, 1991.  The consumer safety officer distributed the IND to the reviewers.  The pharmacology review was completed on January 10, 1991, and it determined that it was safe for the IND to proceed.  The chemistry review was completed on January 11, 1991, and it determined that it was safe for the IND to proceed.     7.   I called the sponsoring physician, Dr. Harrison, on January 11, 1991, to discuss the requirements for the IND and to request the submission of additional information.      8.   I completed the medical review of the IND for Ladd Huffman on January 16, 1991, and determined that it was safe for the IND to proceed. On January 25, 1991, I received the information I had requested from Dr. Harrison.     9.   On March 8, 1991, I issued a letter to Dr. Harrison advising her that the IND for Ladd Huffman could proceed.      10.  In June 1991, the Pilot Drug Evaluation Staff was advised that the Assistant Secretary for Health, Department of Health and Human Services, had decided to consider whether the National Institute on Drug Abuse would continue to supply marijuana for single-patient INDs.      11.  In March 1992, the Pilot Drug Evaluation Staff was advised that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services had made a decision that the National Institute on Drug Abuse would not provide marijuana for single-patient INDs except to those patients who were receiving marijuana at the time.  This group receiving marijuana included patients whose INDs FDA has already reviewed and allowed to proceed, whose physicians had received approval to receive the marijuana from the Drug Enforcement Administration and for whom the National Institute on Drug Abuse had shipped marijuana upon receipt of the Drug Enforcement Administration order form submitted by the physicians.     12.  As I understand it, the March 1992 decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services not to provide marijuana to additional single patient INDs was based on a number of considerations including the health concerns of providing patients with potentially harmful substances, and the fact that existing medical evidence does not support additional research on smoked marijuana to treat disease in single patient studies.  For those patients who had already received marijuana, marijuana would continue to be supplied while their physicians, with assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services, explored alternative therapies.  Through attrition among this patient group, the Department of Health and Human Services would eventually achieve its ultimate goal of not supplying marijuana for any patients under single-patient INDs.      13.  As I understand from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, shipments began in August 1991 for the last person to receive marijuana under a single-patient IND.     14.  As I understand from the Drug Enforcement Administration, that agency received an application from Dr. Harrison to receive and dispense marijuana for Ladd Huffman on August 19, 1991, but no registration to receive marijuana was issued.  Since Dr. Harrison had not received approval to receive and dispense marijuana for Ladd Huffman from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse had not shipped any marijuana for Ladd Huffman.  Therefore, under the March 1992 decision of the Secretary, the National Institute on Drug Abuse would not supply marijuana for Ladd Huffman's single-patient IND.     15.  There were 27 additional single-patient INDs that FDA had allowed to proceed which had not received marijuana.  Under the Secretary's March 1992 decision, marijuana would not be supplied for these INDs by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.      16.  In March 1992, as a result of the Secretary's decision, I contacted the sponsoring physicians of the INDs for Ladd Huffman and other patients who were not already receiving marijuana to advise them that the National Institute on Drug Abuse would not supply marijuana for their single-patient INDs.  I also advised the sponsoring physicians of other treatment options for their patients' conditions and the availability of referrals to experts at the National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services. The single-patient INDs for these individuals were cancelled.     17.  FDA cannot disclose information regarding patients receiving marijuana under single-patient INDs without such patients' consent.      Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the foregoing is true and correct.      Executed on: June 16, 1993, at Rockville, MD.

POT'S TAB IN THE  WAR ON DRUGS   The investment:       * Federal matching funds for the "war on drugs" in Arkansas totaled $4.6 million in 1992.      * State and local agencies kicked in another $1.8 million.      * The Arkansas National Guard received $1.3 million to assist in marijuana eradication.      * An unknown additional amount of money was generated for drug investigations by the sale of confiscated property.      * No figures are available for the cost of prosecuting drug cases and incarcerating offenders.    The return:       * 42 percent of all arrests for the sale and manufacture of drugs in 1992 were for selling or growing marijuana.      * And 62 percent of all arrests for possession of drugs were for possession of marijuana.  By Mara Leveritt       The monkeys smoked a joint a day.       Actually, they didn't recline in their cages, puffing a hand-rolled reefer.  This being a scientific experiment, funded by the powerful National Institute on Drug Abuse, the process was more carefully controlled.  The monkeys were fitted with masks through which marijuana smoke, machine-puffed in carefully measured doses, was passed into their nostrils.      The experiment, performed at the National Center for Toxicological Research near Pine Bluff, was designed to test whether chronic marijuana use caused brain damage.  It lasted for several years, with the most intensive phase, during which monkeys were exposed to heavy doses of marijuana smoke, occurring from 1984 to 1985.      Reports on the study's findings continue to be published in pharmacology and toxicology journals.  But beyond those tight scientific circles, the results of the NCTR experiment, the most extensive of its kind yet conducted, have gone almost entirely unnoticed.      That's not surprising, perhaps.  In a world where the political majority has shown little tolerance for marijuana, the test results are explosive.      The experiment discovered no adverse impact from marijuana on monkeys' general health, no sign that heavy exposure to marijuana smoke caused lung cancer, and, with one exception, no long-term effects on the animals' behavior from exposure to marijuana.      Before the NCTR study, the largest experiment examining the effects of marijuana on primates was one conducted at the Stanford Research Institute.  That experiment, focusing on the brain's electrical activity under the influence of marijuana, involved 16 monkeys.      By contrast, the experiment at NCTR used 62 monkeys, all rhesus males.  In 1983, the animals were all approximately two to three years old, the monkey equivalent of teen-agers.      For one year before the start of the experiment, the monkeys were trained to play "games" designed to test their perception of the passage of time and their ability to discern left from right.  Only after they were proficient did the exposure to marijuana begin.      Toxicologists divided the monkeys into four groups.  Every day for a year, 16 monkeys each received what Dr. Merle Paule, head of NCTR's Behavioral Toxicology Laboratory and Primate Research Facility, called "a pretty heavy exposure" to marijuana, the human equivalent, Paule said, of "four or five joints a day."      Another group of 16 smoked the same amount of marijuana, but only two days per week.  Staffers called them the "weekend smokers."      A third group was administered smoke from cigarettes identical to the others, except that the psychoactive component of THC had been removed.  And a fourth group received no smoke exposure at all.      The monkeys smoked for a year, then they were monitored and tested for another year.      Dr. William Slikker, acting director of NCTR's Division of Neurotoxicology, explained that the study generated so much data, it has taken time to compile it and the results have been released gradually, in several reports since the experiment was ended.      In 1991, the journal Fundamental and Applied Toxicology published a report on the effects of marijuana on the monkeys' general health.  Slikker was the lead writer, with Paule (pronounced Paul) and other NCTR researchers listed as collaborators.      That report concluded, "The general health of the monkeys was not compromised by a year of marijuana smoke exposure as indicated by weight gain, carboxyhemoglobin and clinical chemistry/hematology values.      "Most clinical parameters ... did not show any treatment-related changes, and those few that did were of small magnitude, transient in nature, and were not different at the end of the five-month postdosing period."      Last week, in his office at NCTR, Paule explained the health study's results in more casual terms.  "There's just nothing there," he said.  "They were all fine."      Last year, the journal Toxicology Letters published a report by another group of NCTR researchers on the effects of marijuana on the lungs of the monkeys who smoked.  Seven months after the last exposure to marijuana smoke, some of the monkeys were killed and their bodies autopsied.  Scientists examined the lungs for signs of disturbances called "carcinogen-DNA adducts," considered to be one of the early indications of cancer.      The writers of that study reported that although their findings were not conclusive, they were "at variance with earlier work suggesting that fractions of marijuana smoke are highly genotoxic."      The seven authors noted that, "It has been suggested that marijuana smoking is a proximal cause of respiratory cancer.  However, these intimations have not been borne out by epidemiological investigations, which is surprising considering the widespread use of marijuana."      Moreover, the journal article noted: "The data presented here suggest that seven months after the last smoke exposure, there is not evidence of increased marijuana smoke-induced carcinogen-DNA adducts in the lungs of exposed monkeys."      Paule's informal interpretation: "If it's not there, it's probably not too terrible."      (The researchers discount the claim that as marijuana has become increasingly potent, due to refined horticultural techniques, it has also become more dangerous.  Other studies, they say, have demonstrated that smokers inhale only to the point of inebriation, so that persons smoking stronger marijuana smoke considerably less of it.)      Late last year, Paule himself was the lead author of a report published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.  It dealt with marijuana's effect on behavior.      This report's findings were more complex.       Before the monkeys were started on their year-long smoke exposure, Slikker, Paule and other scientists, conducted a short-term study to determine the immediate effect of THC on the animals; in other words, how they reacted when they were "high."      They found two areas of apparent impact.  One was the monkey's short-term memory.  "That's a function that's very sensitive," Paule explained, "but only on an acute basis.  If you test them the next day, you see no residual effect on those behaviors."      The monkeys sense of time also appeared disrupted.  Monkeys, it turns out, are as good as humans at estimating the passage of time.  Members of both species to equally well at a test that requires them, for instance, to press down on a lever for more than 10 seconds but not longer than 14 seconds.      Marijuana has been shown to affect human's ability to perform the test at normal levels, and the monkeys were no different.  "That time-estimation behavior is exquisitely sensitive to marijuana," Paule said, "even at very low doses."      The NCTR study corroborated human studies showing that time seems to stretch out for many subjects under the influence of marijuana.  In the monkeys' response to the time-perception test, Paule explained, "what they said was that eight seconds feels like ten."      That phenomenon too, however, quickly dissipated.  Testing the next day showed the monkeys' time perception restored to its normal acuity.      The main thrust of the study, however, concerned the long-term effects of exposure to marijuana.  To study that, the animals were tested for cognitive function and motivation 23 hours after each marijuana exposure.      The cognitive test involved four lights and two levers.  The monkeys were taught that when they saw a red or a yellow light, they were to hit a lever on their left in order to receive a food pellet.  If a blue or a green light came on, they would get the pellet by hitting a lever on their right.      The researchers wanted to see if the animals scored any differently 23 hours after exposure to marijuana than they had before receiving the drug.  "On that test," Paule said, "their performance was unaffected."      The test of motivation, however, showed a definite pattern of change.  This test required the monkeys to put forth an increasing amount of effort to get food.  Since a decrease in motivation or "work ethic" has been described as one of the effects of smoking marijuana, the researchers wanted to see "how much effort the monkeys were willing to put out," as compared to the nonsmoking control group.      Their paychecks were banana-flavored food pellets.  For the first pellet, the monkeys had only to depress a lever once.  They had to hit it twice to get the second pellet.  And for a third pellet, they had to pump the lever three times.      Here, the group exposed to THC showed a clear unwillingness to get worked up about work.  Paule pointed out that during the year the test was being conducted, the monkeys were passing from adolescence into adulthood, a time for them, as for humans, he said, when "the work ethic normally goes way up."      But that improvement didn't show up in the marijuana-smokers.  While the nonsmoking monkeys showed a willingness to work harder and harder as the year progressed, the marijuana groups stayed at adolescent levels.      "Our interpretation of this is that marijuana smoking in monkeys does produce something akin to an amotivational syndrome," Paule said.  He added, however, that the phenomenon may have occurred precisely because the monkeys were at the critical and deliberately chosen stage of adolescence when the NCTR test was conducted.      Because marijuana use is high among teenagers, depressed motivation at that stage in life can have serious effects.  But marijuana may not have the same effect on adults.      "We did a search of the literature," Paule said, "and we found that those studies that tried to find amotivational syndrome in adults could not find one.  It only appears in adolescence.  Chances are, if we'd done these studies in adults, we wouldn't have seen this effect.  And the good news is that, even among adolescents, when the exposure to marijuana was stopped, their motivation jumped right back up to normal levels."      "It took two to three months for them to recover to full values, but they did recover and they recovered fully."      Paule noted two other findings related to the motivational test.  One was that the willingness to work appeared to be equally affected in both the daily and weekend smokers.  "That totally surprised us," he said.      Another finding worthy of note was that, as in most areas of life, one monkey proved to be an exception.  As Paule put it, he seemed to go "blooey" under the influence of marijuana.      "Unlike the others, we found that this one particular animal was severely disrupted by chronic marijuana exposure on the discrimination task.  And he never recovered full from the amotivational syndrome.  We have no understanding of why.  Everything else about him tested normal."      That one monkey represents a warning.  As Paule cautioned, "There appears to be tremendous individual variation in susceptibility to marijuana."      Also of interest in the NCTR study, in light of U.S. criminal sanctions against marijuana, is the researchers' observation that the animals exposed to marijuana never posed a threat to their handlers.      "I've never seen anything that suggests marijuana is responsible for an increase in any violent behavior," Paule said, adding, "I would say that the perceived risk to marijuana is probably overstated."      That's the scientist speaking.  Here's the father.  Asked what he would tell his 9-year-old son about the risks of smoking marijuana, this was Paule's answer: "I'd tell him he probably shouldn't smoke dope before he becomes an adult."  POT RESEARCH LID ABOUT TO BLOW OPEN      Dr. Don McMillan, chairman of the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, is also the school's Wilbur D. Mills professor of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Prevention.  He led a major study into human tolerance of marijuana in the early part of his career, and more recently served as an advisor to the researchers at NCTR in planning of their study of marijuana's effects on monkeys.      After years during which he said marijuana research was "stalled," McMillan is once again excited about developments in the field.      "It looks like the whole lid on marijuana research is about to blow wide open," he said in a recent interview.  "I think we're going to know a tremendous amount more about the mechanism of action and how it works on the brain in the next two years."      As marijuana is studied further, its effects, especially relative to other, legal drugs, will also become better understood.  For example, marijuana is ranked with heroin and LSD as a Schedule I drug.  The federal government rates its potential for abuse higher than the risk of abusing cocaine, morphine, PCP, or methadone.      Asked about that, McMillan said, "The thing you have to remember is that that schedule is a legal classification, not a medical one."      He said the medical understanding of marijuana is that it poses a lower risk to society and individual health than that of two legal drugs -- alcohol and tobacco.      "Marijuana is probably less harmful than either of those -- but of course, there's still a lot we don't know about it."

GRUBOR, J.D. P.O. BOX 114 E. McKEESPORT, PA. 15035 (412) 855-2594 RECEIVED FEB 7 1995 SUPREME COURT WESTERN DISTRICT ALLOCATUR PETITION FOR ALLOWANCE OFAPPEAL AND NOW comes the PETITIONER, John M. Grubor, J.D., pro se,pleading for Allocatur Allowance of Appeal as follows: Petitioner pleads for relief from the PER CURIAM orderof the Commonwealth Court dated January 10, 1995, the text ofwhich was: "0 R D E R NOW, January 10, 1995, upon consideration of appellant's nunc pro tunc petition for reconsideration based on after acquired evidence, the petition is denied." The aforementioned Order followed a previous "OPINIONNOT REPORTED MEMORANDUM OPINION BY JUDGE McGINLEY FILED:October 28, 1994" and an Order attached thereto. Thecomplete opinion and Order are attached hereto and marked as "ExhibitII." For the purpose of clarifying the issues (see "Questionspresented for review") a proposed Petition for Certiorarihas been attached as "Exhibit I." The lower court order has been attached hereto and marked as"Exhibit III." The verbatim text of the first statute at issue has beenattached hereto and marked as "Exhibit IV." The verbatim text of the second statute at issue has beenattached hereto and marked a "Exhibit V." 1 QUESTIONS PRESENTED FOR REVIEW The circumstances of this case involve the bona fide medicaluse of a controlled substance for a life threatening medicalnecessity (deadly seizures), which was justified under section503 of the Crimes Code, and which justification should be acomplete defense to all other sanctions. The suspension of theDefendant's Driver's License in the instant case is the PoliticalSubjugation of Medicine, which is an issue of immediate publicimportance, justifying this Honorable Court's assumption ofplenary jurisdiction. The three main questions presented for review by thisHonorable Court are questions of substance not heretoforedetermined by this Honorable Court. There are two other questionswhich this Court has "apparently ruled upon" but whichare included in the proposed PETITION FOR CERTIORARI contained inthe Appendix of this pleading. The two other questions aresubsidiary questions fairly comprised within the three mainquestions and shall not be discussed in this pleading. However,argument on the two other questions, as set forth in paragraphsone and two of the aforementioned CERTIORARI, is hereby reservedfor subsequent pleadings and oral argument. The three mainquestions are as follows: A. Whether the commonwealth can suspend the driver's licenseof Defendant, who is a bona tide medical user of a controlledsubstance, for a plea bargain to a crime which had nothing to dowith the Motor Vehicle Code. B. Whether the Commonwealth can refuse to consider theissuance of an occupational Limited License to the Defendant. C. Whether the Defendant was denied his constitutional rightto Procedural Due Process by being required to present his entirecase to the lower court in five minutes. 2 STATEMENT OF THE CASE This case involves the bona fide medical use of a controlledsubstance for a life threatening medical necessity. After havingbloody nocturnal Epileptic seizures for almost five years, thePETITIONER (Defendant) began using the only substance that couldstop his seizures, Cannabis. Defendant was treated with Dilantinand other drugs by three Neurologists for 4 1/2 years, but theconventional drugs prescribed by the Physicians did not stop theDefendant's bloody nocturnal episodes. In 1986, Defendant read in the medical literature thatCannabis ("Marijuana" in Spanish) was known to be theonly substance to actually "stop" Epileptic seizures.Defendant was in fear of death from his nocturnal Epilepticseizures for two reasons. The first was the possibility of endinga seizure "on his back" and thereby suffocating on the"swallowing of the tongue" effect. But he was alsofearing death from "drowning on his own blood." On manya morning, Defendant woke up with blood all over his pillow andsheets. His tongue was severely bitten into on both sides and the tasteof blood would last for days. Sometimes it would take weeks forthe tongue to heal and the pain resulting from the back spasmsduring the seizures would last for months. Because Defendant had no other legal alternative, he beganusing Cannabis for his life threatening medical necessity in1986. His actions were and continue to be justified under thecriteria set forth in section 503 of the Crimes Code. Defendanthas had no seizures for nine years and his termination of the useof the controlled substance is not Medically indicated. In 1988, at the St. Louis University Medical School, and in1989, at the National Institute of Mental Health, cannabinoidreceptors were discovered and located in the human brain. Thisnew evidence gave the answer as to why Cannabis was so effective 3 in the treatment of Epilepsy. We already knew why the miracledrug cannabis was effective in Glaucoma, AIDS, Cancer, Asthma andother diseases, but the existence and location of the brain receptorsnow explained it's tremendous effectiveness in Epilepsy,Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and other spasticdisorders. It seemed that the law should recognize these newmedical developments, but it did not. Instead, politicians causedthe POLITICAL SUBJUGATION OF MEDICINE. In 1989, with George Bush playing "tough on crime,"the "Federal Mandates" came in like gangbusters. Themandates required the States to pass these new laws in order toget the new "Federal Money." The two statutes at issuein the instant case are the results of the "Federal Mandates."No one paid any attention to the needs of the Medical NecessityUsers. In March of 1992, Defendant plead guilty to the possession of1/3 ounce of cannabis in return for "one year probation andno other penalty." Defendant never knew or was told of themandatory driver's license suspension during the court Colloquy.When the Bureau of Motor Vehicles tried to suspend Defendant'sDriver's license in April of 1992, Defendant filed a StatutoryAppeal in the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court. On November 4, 1992, the lower court dismissed Defendant'sAppeal and Defendant filed a timely appeal to the commonwealthcourt. (The lower court order is attached hereto as "Exhibit III.")Oral Argument was not granted by the commonwealth Court and awritten "OPINION NOT REPORTED MEMORANDUM OPINION" wasfiled by the commonwealth court on October 28, 1994. (ExhibitII.) After consideration of a Petition for Reconsideration, theCommonwealth Court denied same on January 10, 1995. A timely Allocatur Petition for Allowance of Appeal was filedand is presently at issue before this Honorable Court. 4 REASONS FOR ALLOWANCE OF APPEAL This may be the most important case this Honorable SupremeCourt has ever considered, because it deals with the PoliticalSubjugation of Medicine. This recently identified PSM phenomenonhas caused an increase in the crime problem, the drug problem andthe domestic violence/abuse problems in the last seven years. Inessence, an overwhelming issue of immediate public importance isat hand: This Honorable Court is obligated to be a non-politicalentity, and it must therefore consider and rule upon this PSMwhich has invaded the Legislative and Executive branches ofGovernment. If the Judiciary does not do it's duty, then we loseour only hope for a decent Government: The Statutes at issue inthe instant case were passed without the slightest regard for thethen current medical information, a prime example of thePolitical Subjugation of Medicine. All three main questionspresented for review in the instant case are ramifications ofthis PSM and are questions of substance not heretofore determinedby this Honorable Court. The Petitioner is a member of a "suspect class" ofMedical Necessity users of the Controlled substance Cannabis, whodeserve "greater protection" than other offenders,because their actions are Justified under section 503 of theCrimes Code. This "suspect class" involves millions ofpeople in this commonwealth who use Cannabis daily for Epilepsy,Glaucoma, AIDS, Cancer, Asthma, Parkinson's Disease, MultipleSclerosis, Emphysema, Muscular Dystrophy and other diseases, and who'sdriver's licenses are put in jeopardy by their medicalnecessities. WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays to this HonorableCourt for Allocatur, Permission for Appeal and for oral argument. Respectfully Submitted, by: John M. Grubor, pro se, PETITIONER 5 "Proposed Pleading" (not to form): IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES PETITI0N FOR CERTIORARI Questions to be presented to the Court: 1. Whether a State may rule that a sanction passed under a"Crimes Code" is merely a "civil penalty."(thereby denying the consideration of constitutional rightsapplicability to the sanction). 2. Whether a State may deny Due Process to a Defendant who hasexecuted a plea bargain by later demanding additional penalties(license suspension and over $10,000 in costs) which were not disclosedto the Defendant at the time of the Court colloquy. (Defendantwould not have plead guilty if he had known of the driver'slicense suspension) 3. Whether a Defendant in a Driver's license suspension caseis denied Procedural Due Process by being required to present hisentire defense in five minutes in a courtroom that was a"joke" because of apparent case fixing by the tipstaff. 4. Whether a State may take away ones liberty (driver'slicense suspension) because of a Defendant's use (justified under503 of crimes code) of a controlled substance which had nothing todo with an automobile or the Motor vehicle Code. 5. Whether a State may refuse to consider the issuance of anoccupational Limited License to those individuals in the suspectclass of Medical Necessity Users of a controlled Substance who's actionsare justified within the definitions set forth in Section 503 ofthe Uniform Crimes Code.

Unfortunately, we have determined that we cannot comply with your request.As you know, decisions for the commitment of limited NIH resources are based upon scientific principles, so as to ensure the most effictive use of our research resources.  Our decision here is based upon issues of design, scientific merit and rationale.  We believe that your study will not adequately answer the question posed.Although the study propose seeks to make a dose-effect comparison of smoked marijuana to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), there is no real dosing control.  The marijuana is to be taken home and there is no requirement and way to ensure that the subjects smoke all available materials on any fixed schedule.  Additionally, that they are given a two-week supply of marijuana at one time further confounds the study design.  Thus, we believe the dose-effect component is confounded since the study cannot correlate variability in weight gain with dosage.We also believe the study lacks adequate sample size to make any inferences regarding the dose-effect relationship.  We base our conclusion on an analogous study performed by the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases that compared megestrol and THC in 56 subject [sic] with AIDS-related wasting syndrome but still lacked inferential power.  Another counfounding variable not adequately controlled for in your proposed study is diet.  Neither the total daily caloric intake nor the percentages of the composition of the foodstuffs is assessed.We sincerely share your hope that new treatments will be found swiftly to improve the quality and prolong the lives of patients suffering from this terrible disease.  As you know, a great deal of NIH research support is directed toward this end.Sincerely,[signed]Alan I.

Leshner, Ph.DDirectorNational Institute on Drug Abuse5600 Fishers LaneRockville, Maryland 20857Dear Dr. Leshner,I am writing in response to your letter of April 19 regarding my request that NIDA consider supplying marijuana for the Community Consortium's proposed study in patients with HIV-related wasting syndrome.  I was not only disappointed by the flat out rejection of the request, but also by the way this matter has been handled by your Institute from the onset.  To receive the first communication from your office nine months after we sent the initial submission is offensive and insulting.  I realize that this has been a very difficult decision for you to make because of all the nonscientific issues involved, but I am certainly not used to having no communication at all for nine months from someone with whom I had corresponded on an official matter.  The apparent abscence of any possibility to discuss your concerns and to modify the protocol appropriately so that we may work together for the benefit of our patients is also unacceptable in my opinion. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has not been the first body to review our proposed pilot study.  It has been reviewed and approved by the Committee on Human Research of the University of California, San Francisco, as well as by our own Scientific Advisory Committee and Community Advisory Forum.  In addition, the study has been approved (pending location of the source of inhaled marijuana) by the California Research Advisory Panel.  The US Food and Drug Administration has also been involved since the onset in developing the trial and has strongly influenced the study's design.  The General Clinical Research Center at San Francisco General Hospital has agreed to collaborate in the study by providing dietary counseling and monitoring of patients, as well as performing the state-of-the-art composition measurements we intend to perform. Collaborating investigators at Chiron Corporation were also eager toparticipate in this study by donating their newly developed technology to assess HIV viral burden in patients randomized to receive marijuana.  Hence, your concerns about the scientific merit of the study have not been shared by a number of competent reviewers and investigators.To respond to your concerns in a timely manner, I will address each issue you raise in turn.  However, it is important to stress that this trial was designed as a pilot study to determine the feasibility of conducting a larger study and, in particular, the sample size required to evaluate the efficacy of inhaled marijuana.  As you know, the use of a pilot study in clinical research is a well-established procedure.  I am sure you would agree that it is a prudent strategy to conduct a small pilot trial of inhaled marijuana prior to launchingthe definitive efficacy trial that would require a much larger sample size.We fully appreciate that the current pilot study would not be adequate to "make any inferences regarding the dose-effect relationship."  However, we would be able to determine whether a dose was associated with an intolerable rate of side effects, and that dose would then be eliminated from a larger efficacy trial.  As indicated in the protocol, we plan to do intensive monitoring of pulmonary and immune function as well as HIV viral load in our patients.  If we saw that inhalation of marijuana was detrimental to any of these parameters, that information would be crucial to share with others in order to protect the safety of patients who are already using inhaled marijuana (from other sources).  The current pilot study certainly should be large enough (with 30 patients smoking marijuana) to assess such possible detrimental effects.The Community Consortium conducts community-based clinical trials of treatments that are being widely used by the patient population and, as I am sure you are aware, individuals with access are currently utilizing inhaled marijuana.  Our aim is to assess the impact of treatments that we study in "real world" situations.  As you know, with whatever drug one studies in a clinical trial, we can never be truly certain that patients are consuming 100% of their assigned doses.  Even for treatment of Pneumococcal pneumonia, very few patients treated actually complete their full course of penicillin. Similarly, zidovudine (AZT) was approved as the first antiretroviral agent for treating HIV infectioin, and we know that compliance in those trials was not 100%.  In our study, we plan to ask patients to quantitate how much of their allotted marijuana they smoked on any given day.  We also plan to have patients return any unused marijuana so we can assess how much they actually usilized.  Whether they actually smoked all that they were given at each visit is irrelevant when an intent-to-treat analysis is utilized for data analysis.Your concerns about total daily caloric intake and "the percentages of the composition of the foodstuffs" are a bit extreme, in my opinion, but do not present insurmountable problems for us.  As the General Clinical Research Center at San Francisco General Hospital is our collaborating site where patients will go to be taught how to use the water pipe for inhalation, and where they will return for all of their follow-up evaluations, obtaining this dietary information is certainly possible.  In fact, this is the sort of information that the GCRC specializes in collecting!  Though we could add this requirement, it would be a major inconvience to these already ill patients to ask them to collect this information on a daily basis during the trial.  Of course, another option is to admit all patients on the study to the GCR for the duration of their participation in the study, so that all intake and output can be accurately assessed. Once again, however, that is not how patients would be living while they utilized the intervention in the real world, so the value of data obtained in this fashion is, in my mind, unclear.  It certainly does not reflect the "real world" usage.As an AIDS investigator who has worked closely with National Institutes of Health and the US Food and Drug Administration for the past 14 years of this epidemic, I must tell you that dealing with your Institute has been the worst experience of my career!  The lack of any official communication for nine months is unheard of, even in the most cumbersome of government bureaucracies.  In fact, I was so shocked to finally receive your communication that I failed to detach the green postcard to verify receipt.  I apologize to you, and to your staff who called for three consecutive days to make sure the letter had arrived.Finally, the "sincerity" with which you share my "hope that new treatments will be found swiftly" feels so hypocritical that it makes me cringe.  Believe it or not, I wish I had never needed to approach NIDA with this request.  The Community Consortium had a source of marijuana established for this study from the onset.  Unfortunately, the source was foreign and the FDA advised us that the DEA was having difficulty with the importation issue and suggested we contact you. (The DEA has also been less than forthcoming in responding to my request for a Schedule I license sent to them April 15, 1994.)Obviously, your letter leaves no door open for further discussion as to how this pilot study could be modified so that we could work together.  Hence, I will not bother you further.  Your letter will be widely distributed.  You had an opportunity to do a service to the community of people living with AIDS.  You and your Institute failed. In the words of the AIDS activist community: SHAME!Sincerely,[signed]Donald I.

But are our drug laws Nipping Compassion in the Bud?  Cover story: Reefer madness By Tracie Cone  [picture]  They are law-abiding citizens, but they or someone they love are suffering from grave illnesses, and pharmaceuticals don't ease the pain.

I decide I've been under surveillance since I broke state and federal law 15 minutes earlier in Santa Cruz.  My trunk holds marijuana amid golf clubs and dry cleaning.  Who would buy the story that I'm taking it to a sick friend?    Yet I am.  She is waiting at home, her gut churning from her latest round of cancer treatment, and this is the substance she prays will finally bring relief.  We had read of people who smoke marijuana to ease the nausea of chemotherapy.  She decided to try it after her prescription medication caused near-deadly complications.    The prospect of jail is viewed as just another indignity to people who are dying and will try anything to feel good again.  When a life is at stake, the rule books often get chucked, no matter how law-abiding the person may be.    "What have I got to lose?" she had asked.    Near the Pajaro River, I poise my hand on my blink-  POT  er.  Maybe a final act of traffic-law compliance will make the police go easy on me.    The car rides my bumper for a second, then pulls to the left and darts past.  It's only a Honda Accord with a ski rack on the top.  I sigh at the trick played by my paranoid brain and drive home under the comforting cover of darkness.  POSSESSING MARIJUANA makes criminals out people who use it to reverse the "wasting syndrome" of AIDS, relax spastic muscles, stifle epileptic seizures or ease the symptoms of a dozen other ailments.  It is a misdemeanor in California to possess less than an ounce.  People who deliver it to ailing friends are committing a felony.    These users rarely fit the law-enforcement profile.  They're not social misfits looking for a legal way to get high.  It is not a "gateway" to the land of LSD and crack cocaine.  They are simply doing what many sick people have done since ancient Egyptians smoked the leaves to cure headaches.    Studies have shown that the THC in marijuana, along with some combination of its 460 known compounds, eases nausea in chemotherapy patients and reduces eye pressure in people suffering from blinding glaucoma.    Yet the federal Government, spending billions in a popular war on drugs, halted all research that might prove whether the plant is more effective with some people than synthetic drugs on the market.    It's absurd that medical decisions are being made by politicians," says Dr. Arnold Jeffe, a Santa Cruz physician.  "It's so crazy that this has become such a big deal when, really, it's not a big deal at all."    Politics made marijuana illegal in 1937 and politics might soon put it legally back in doctors' hands.  San Jose Assemblyman John Vasconcellos has introduced a compassionate-use bill that would allow sick people to use marijuana.    "If people are in pain they ought to be able to use marijuana to relieve their pain," Vasconcellos said.  "It's none of the government's business in the first place."    Should the bill fail, the San Francisco-based group Californians for Compassionate Use has hired a political consultant to get the issue on the November 1996 ballot.    The proposition would make Californians the first in the country to decide a medical marijuana law, and the group -- AIDS activists skilled in the art of lobbying and sick people who depend on the drug -- believes the referendum has a chance.    They are encouraged by a recent statewide survey they commissioned showing that while few Californians want to make marijuana legal, 66 percent of the 750 randomly questioned respondents would support a law allowing sick people to use it with a doctor's prescription.    The law would turn Salinas retirees Dorothy  14 / MAY 14, 1995 / W E S T  and Richard Haskell into law-abiding citizens again.  They provide marijuana to their 44-year-old daughter, Vicki, who has liver cancer.    "Umm, we just want it for, well, medicinal purposes," Dorothy Haskell said.  "It breaks our hearts to see our daughter suffer."  FOR 25 YEARS the medical marijuana battle has been waged politely by people with glaucoma and cancer.  Now it is becoming the vocal, in-your-face fight of AIDS patients who say marijuana's appetite-inducing side effect keeps them from wasting away.  AIDS activists just might succeed where others have not: They already have forced the Food and Drug Administration to make experimental drugs available years ahead of schedule.    "I've been very conscious of the difference between AIDS patients and cancer and glaucoma patients," says Robert Randall of the non-profit Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, based in Washington, D.C.  "AIDS patients tend to be a part of a powerful, organized community of people who are suffering.  They look out for each other."    AIDS activists were a big part of successful marijuana referendums in San Francisco and Santa Cruz counties.  Eighty percent of voters in San Francisco, and 77 percent in Santa Cruz, approved resolutions supporting the use of pot for medical reasons.    Medical marijuana advocates want to modify a law that has been in place since 1970.  That's when the FDA and Drug Enforcement Agency ruled that the peace movement's drug of choice is as useless to medical science as LSD and heroin.  All three became classified as Schedule 1 narcotics -- drugs with no known medical use.    Morphine, cocaine and even Marinol -- a synthetic derivative of marijuana's Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -- are Schedule 2, which means doctors can prescribe them.  Medical marijuana advocates argue that Marinol often doesn't work as well as the real thing -- especially in a vomiting patient -- and want the plant moved to Schedule 2.    In April 300 people -- many sick or dying, on crutches and in wheelchairs, in suits and leather, Gray Panthers and gay activists -- gathered on the steps of the U.S. Federal Building in San Francisco to draw attention to the fight.    "This is our Stonewall!" shouted referendum leader Dennis Peron, comparing the marijuana battle to New York's historic gay freedom struggle.  "They are not going to drive us back into our closets.  I think back to '65 when cops were dragging our friends to jail -- and now cops want to take AIDS patients to jail."    With TV cameras rolling and tour buses creeping by, they dared the DEA to arrest them all.    Martin Simmons, 32, scooted his wheelchair to the front of the crowd and screamed the chant:    Racist, sexist, anti-gay    DEA, go away.    "I'm dying," Simmons, an AIDS patient, said afterward.  "F--- the law."  RICHARD AND DOROTHY HASKELL are proof that need is the thing most likely to convince someone with anti-drug views to accept medical marijuana.  My friend had never even seen marijuana.    I often drove her to the hospital and witnessed the horrendous nausea she suffered after treatment.  Prescription drugs were supposed to settle her stomach, but every day we stopped two or three times on the way home for her dry heaves to pass.  At home, she vomited more.  She lost the desire to eat and quickly dropped 15 pounds, which in turn made her too weak to withstand strong treatment.    This is what cancer sufferers say about anti-nausea drugs such as Zofran (which costs $600 a dose) and Torecan: The side effects can be worse than the problems they're designed to prevent.  Sometimes, it's a headache, stupor or insomnia.  My friend's pharmaceutical, besides not curing her nausea, constipated her.    In most people, that would be uncomfortable but not deadly.  But doctors continued giving her the toxic chemical they hoped would kill her cancer cells, and it wasn't leaving her body.  In the car beside me one evening, after a violent burst of dry heaves, she stopped breathing.  I beat on her chest, screamed frantically and started CPR:    "Please breathe.  Come back.  Please don't die."    She didn't die, and later I told her about my aunt who had smoked pot while undergoing chemotherapy for liver cancer.  My friend has a medicine cabinet full of painkillers, but had never tried an illegal drug.  Now she was desperate.    I asked friends about buying marijuana on the black market which, law enforcement should be happy to hear, doesn't seem as active as it was a decade ago.  Instead I found the medical marijua-na underground.  MY FIRST VISIT was with Scott Imler, who runs Citizens for Medical Marijuana in Santa Cruz.    On the cramped top floor of an old downtown Victorian, Imler dispenses advice and marijuana to people he believes are sincere.  It helps if they have a note from their doctor -- and almost all the patients Imler helps do.  He keeps records on a computer, and a stash in the closet.  He sent me home with a good supply of prime sinsemilla buds.    Imler, 37, used to be a special education teacher.  He grew pot in the late '80s to supply sick friends in San Francisco.  In 1992, after sheriffs deputies seized his crop, he worked to pass the Santa Cruz County compassionate-use referendum.    Dennis Peron of San Francisco sold marijuana in the 1960s and '70s as the drug culture thrived.  In the late '80s he discovered a higher purpose for law-breaking when his lover, dying of AIDS, used marijuana to stimulate his appetite.  Looking respectable with Gap clothes and a gray banker-style haircut, Peron now sells marijuana to sick people who can afford it, and gives it to those who can't at his Cannabis Buyers Club, an illegal reefer pharmacy in the city's Castro district.    Peron founded the statewide referendum group earlier this year and counts on his buyers club members for support.  One Friday in April, however, Peron abruptly closed the doors after he received a tip: The Drug Enforcement Agency would bust him that afternoon.  He quickly organized the protest outside the Federal Building because customers were returning to dark Tenderloin street corners or Dolores Park to find supplies.    "I haven't eaten in days, I can't sleep," Martin Simmons said.  "I don't know what else to do."    Valerie and Mike Corral of Davenport began growing marijuana 20 years ago, after reading that it could control Valerie's epileptic seizures.  Now they grow enough to share with about a dozen people, all of them dying, who find them by word-of-mouth.  With her bobbed hair, slacks and pumps, Valerie, 42, looks more Junior Leaguer than pot grower.    Once a week at her mountaintop cabin, she hunches over a tattered "Joy of Cooking" and modifies the traditional Butter Thin cookie recipe.  Using marijuana instead of flour, she produces a green cookie that will  induce the same effect as smoked marijuana after it meanders through the digestive system.    Santa Cruz County Sheriffs deputies have arrested Corral twice and destroyed her plants.  Yet even the prospect of prison does not stop her.    "There's not a person who could violate me more than a seizure, so I have no fear of cops," she says.    May is planting time, and Valerie and Mike are preparing the greenhouse.  They plant "Luther Burbank style," growing 100 seedlings, but keeping only the five or six female plants that develop the bushy foliage they're looking for.  They might net 15 pounds in a season.    "We've learned how to grow healthy plants and get a high yield," says Mike, who has collected seeds for 20 years.  "It's genetics."    One recipient of their pot is Bill Shanteau, 44, a Cabrillo College instructor who is in the final stages of colon cancer.  He waits in bed for the weekly delivery that brings physical, psychological and psychokinetic relief.  Yes, sometimes Shanteau just wants to get high.    "The point is," Shanteau says, "marijuana is a major agent in keeping me interested in life.  Besides restoring my appetite, it's like a hot tub for the brain.  It stimulates me intellectually.  It keeps me focused in the moment instead of me sitting here thinking I'm dying tomorrow.  I hate to think what my life would be like right now if I didn't have it."    Shanteau's desire to get high complicates the issue.  Marijuana doesn't only ease nausea in sick people; it also makes them high.  This troubles pot foes, who see the potential for abuse and distrust the motives of the people who are pushing medical marijuana.  Last year in Sacramento, a woman publicly lashed out at Valerie Corral:    "She said, 'You People just want to feel good,'" Corral recalls.  "And I said, 'Yeah?  So?  What's the crime in a sick person wanting to feel good?'"  TOM GORMAN OF SACRAMENTO cringes when people say anything good about marijuana.  A member of the California Narcotics Officers Association, Gorman says that stories of medical miracles are propaganda from people who want to decriminalize drugs.    "If you were dying of cancer," says the 27-year veteran of law enforcement, you'd probably grasp at anything.  But smoking anything is not good for you.  What we're doing in the '90s is the exact same thing we did in the '70s -- we're romanticizing drugs.  Once you get a soft attitude, kids get the impression it's not so bad."    Gov. Pete Wilson agrees.  In 1994 he vetoed a medical marijuana bill passed by the Legislature.  An aide says Wilson will veto the Vasconcellos bill if it lands on his desk.    "The governor believes it would serve no useful purposes" says spokesman Jesus Arredondo, "when the FDA has already concluded that marijuana is not good."    The California Medical Association says marijuana, used under a doctor's order, is often beneficial.  The American Medical Association, the only group originally to speak against Congress' 1937 ban, has not taken a stand, but supports more research.    The American Bar Association, the National Association of Attorneys General and the Conference of Episcopal Bishops are among the groups calling for the repeal of laws against medical marijuana.  Legislators in 35 states, including California, have passed non-binding resolutions supporting its use.    From the '40s through the '60s, as science refined pharmaceutical drugs, the medical community began thinking of herbs and botanical treatments as old-fashioned.  But in the '70s, recreational users inadvertently discovered marijuana's value to modern medicine; researchers reported that cancer patients they had treated felt better after using the drug.    Robert Randall of the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics has glaucoma.  In 1976, after a lawsuit and weeks of tests at the Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA, he became the first person in the United States to receive marijuana from the federal government.  By then he was nearly blind and the tests showed that only marijuana -- not any prescription drug -- would lower his eye pressure and save his sight.  The government, he says, had had that information since 1971.    "The prospect that an easily grown plant can ease human suffering should be a cause for celebration," he says.  "The problem is, we don't live in a sane society."    Randall says he smokes pot every day.  He still has limited eyesight.    From 1978 to 1986, New Mexico health officials tested marijuana on cancer patients who were not helped by other anti-nausea treatment; 90 percent reported improvement.  A study in New York showed that 78 percent of 56 cancer patients who didn't respond to other drugs felt better after smoking marijuana.  The study, published in 1988, also tested the synthetic THC:  One-third of the patients who did not feel better using it did show improvement after smoking marijuana.    By 1991, the federal government, still denying marijuana's benefits, was shipping it to 12 people suffering from cancer nausea, glaucoma, chronic pain and muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis.  Randall encouraged people with AIDS to apply, as he had, for an application to use an unproven drug.  It was a program established by Jimmy Carter after Randall's case became public.    Meanwhile, doctors began accepting the use of medical marijuana.  A 1991 study by Rick Doblin, a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard's Kennedy School, found that 44 percent of the 1,000 cancer specialists who responded to a nationwide survey have told patients that marijuana could relieve nausea.  More than half of the oncologists surveyed said it should be available by prescription.    Some doctors believe that not telling their patients is cruel.    "I have patients who say that it helps them, and I recommend it to patients," says Dr. Leff, 53, of Santa Cruz, who was Cincinnati's Drug and Alcohol Abuse director in the early 1970s.  "[Recommending marijuana] is not unusual.  It's only a big deal to people with religious or moralistic views about the drug."    The FDA, swamped with thousands of unproven drug applications, had approved about two dozen more patients by late 1991.  But the Public Health Service under George Bush quietly stopped approving new participants and ended all marijuana research programs.  The patients already approved but still waiting for marijuana were out of luck.  Today the government provides marijuana to only eight of the original 12 patients. (The other four have died.)    "There was a sense, with so many people applying, that we wouldn't have enough marijuana to provide," said Rayford Kytle of the PHS, which grows a small crop in Mississippi.    The PHS supported the Bush administration decision by saying that smoking marijuana, like cigarettes, can cause lung cancer.  The PHS further warned that smoking it can compromise immune systems already made fragile by AIDS or other diseases.  And being under the influence can cause anxiety.    Bill Clinton, who says he tried marijuana but didn't inhale, has upheld the ban.  His administration added a provision, however, that allows research into medical benefits.    Dr. Donald Abrams, assistant director of the AIDS project at San Francisco General Hospital, sought approval to study marijuana's effects on the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS.  "The study would not only see whether it's effective, but whether it's harmful," Abrams says.  W E S T / MAY 14, 1995 / 17  POT     He hoped to study 40 people -- too few to settle the marijuana question but enough to determine whether more research is warranted.  He applied to the FDA, the DEA and a state agency that oversees California university research programs.  The state approved the study and the FDA signed off after insisting on numerous chances.  On April 15, 1994, Abrams crossed what he thought would be the final hurdle when he paid the DEA for a license to distribute a Schedule I drug.  The DEA cashed the check, but has yet to approve the research.    "Everything I hear is from unofficial channels," Abrams said.  "They said they didn't trust my research, or they questioned my credibility.  Nobody can give me a direct answer on why this is taking so long."    A federal health official offered this reason: "It' s too volatile an issue with the anti-drug people.  It's a shame they can't distinguish between a small group of medically needy people and drug abusers."    Abrams' struggle has had an unfortunate side effect: It has discouraged others from applying.    "Political pressure has demoralized researchers," Doblin says.  "It has made it hard to get money for research.  If Donald doesn't get permission, nobody is going to try."    Few issues besides abortion produce such distrust between camps.  Marijuana opponents say we can't say "no" to most drugs but "yes" to one.  They say there are enough medications on the market to provide relief.  Few politicians want to be viewed as being soft on drugs.    The marijuana proponents counter that the government policy is set by pharmaceutical manufacturers who stand to lose billions of dollars in anti-nausea drug sales to a plant they cannot patent.  Proponents say medical professionals not bureaucrats, should decide health-care issues.    "They're probably right," says the federal health official, who asked for anonymity, "but until people convince their congressional representatives that the law needs to be changed, nothing will be done."    In 1988, after two years of public hearings, the DEA's own chief administrative law judge said the drug agency should rewrite its marijuana policy.    "It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefit of this substance in light of the evidence of this record," Judge Francis L. Young said.  MY FRIEND, who has never smoked a cigarette, didn't know how to inhale her marijuana.  We made a pipe by rolling aluminum foil into a tube, then bending one end up slightly.  We rolled some into joints.    After smoking a few puffs, or eating one of Corral's cookies, my friend had little nausea.  She could eat real food again.    In four weeks she regained her weight.  Her face was full, her cheeks pink.  Her eyes, which often seemed dull and half closed, were open and bright.  We drove home from the hospital without ever stopping again.    "If the government wants to find out whether marijuana can stop cancer patients and AIDS sufferers from throwing up and losing weight -- put them on a scale," Randall says.    Dorothy and Richard Haskell decided in March that breaking the law was preferable to watching Vicki suffer.    "We were always anti-drug," Dorothy says.  "It just wasn't the way we lived."    Vicki's pain medication had stopped working.  She couldn't sleep or keep food down.  The Haskells read about medical marijuana but didn't know where to find any until they read an article in which Imler was quoted.    When the Haskells stepped inside Imler's headquarters, they looked as if one more worry would break them.  From the parlor wafted the click of typewriter keys as Ed Frey, attorney and former D.A. candidate, worked in his office.  Imler gets free office space and a small salary to work as Frey's assistant.  The couple stammered nervously.    "Anyone who has ever had a child can tell you why we're here," Dorothy said.  "It breaks our hearts to see our daughter suffer."    "I just want her to be able to sleep, she's in so much pain," Richard said.  "It's our daughter, so as far as I'm concerned, I'm not doing anything illegal."    All day, Imler helps people like the Haskells, fields phone calls, teaches clients to grow pot for themselves, and solicits donations.    "We have an uneasy accommodation with local law enforcement here," he says.  "They know we're here, but so far we've been lucky."    Politicians know the voters in Santa Cruz County believe sick people should be allowed marijuana if they want it.  And Santa Cruz police say they are aware that medical marijuana proponents are active in town, but they are too busy to investigate the movement.    "We don't have enough personnel to enjoy the luxury of sitting around and wondering what they're doing," says deputy police chief Jeff Locke.  "But our feeling is still that it's against the law."    In March, Imler received a letter from Dr. Stephen Stein, medical director of the County of Santa Cruz Health Services Agency, asking him to provide marijuana to an AIDS patient.    "[The patient] reports using marijuana to treat symptoms of nausea and anorexia," Stein wrote.  "I have no objection to him using it for this purpose."    The local attitude makes District Attorney Art Danner wonder whether prosecuting a medical marijuana case would waste taxpayers money.  That's part of the reason he has declined to prosecute Valerie Corral both times sheriffs deputies arrested her.    A trial would cost thousands, and a loss would demoralize law enforcement.    "Hers was a difficult case," he says.  "I don't think I could get a jury to convict her.  It's a difficult situation here.  On the one hand, we have a lot of terminally ill people using it.  On the other hand, we don't want everyone with a headache to use it."    Danner, a member of the National Association of District Attorneys' Executive Committee, has asked the group to take up the issue at its annual convention in July.    "I suggested we take a good look at the research and see whether it should be moved from the legal to medical jurisdiction," Danner says.  "I got a lot of interest from other D.A.s whose constituents are talking to them about this issue.  They were more interested than I thought they'd be."    About the time the district attorneys meet, members of Californians for Compassionate Use will begin collecting the signatures of 433,000 registered voters.  The drive is being conducted by Ken Masterton, a political consultant who qualified recent successful propositions protecting mountain lions and increasing the tobacco tax.  THE HASKELLS were unaware of the various political movements when they visited Imler in March.    To them, marijuana was a last resort; a trip to the downtown head shop for a pipe too strange to consider.    "Uh, no, please, we can't go in there," Dorothy begged.  continued on page 22  POT  continued from page 19     Imler gave them joints instead of a pipe.  Richard held the sealed envelope and folded it in half.  He searched his pockets for a paper clip and nervously affixed the halves together.  He put the package in his pocket and realized the group had been watching him fumble.    "Oh, I don't know what I'm doing," he said.    Before leaving for their own nerve-racked drive home, the Haskells gave Imler a $50 bill.  It is a huge donation for a shoestring operation dependent upon the kindness of strangers.  Timing was good.  Donations of pot and money are off.  Imler's stash has been of such bad quality lately that even home health-care nurses have called to complain.    Back in Salinas, Vicki, who has two high school-age sons, attempted to try the marijuana.  Stigma proved a powerful deterrent.    "She didn't want to do it in front of her kids," Dorothy Haskell said.  "She's back in the hospital now, trying to get her pain medication  regulated.  I don't think she gave it a chance because she thought it was really wrong.  I even took a couple of puffs myself so she would think it was OK.  If your child is involved, you'll do anything."  IN MID-APRIL Vicki Haskell turned worse.  After trying every pain medication prescribed by her doctor, she smoked the marijuana.  After weeks of insomnia, she was able to sleep through the night.  On April 12, Richard and Dorothy drove back to Santa Cruz to get more.    "Every time someone like that leaves, I say, Now I know why we're here," Imler says.    Dennis Peron reopened the buyers club a week after he closed it.  Martin Simmons was among the 1,500 first-day customers.  Peron hopes drug agents won't show, and the DEA's Mike Herald declined to confirm whether Peron is being investigated.  If the DEA comes knocking, Peron threatens, agents will have to arrest all 4,000 members.    "Tell the jail to stock up on catheters and medical equipment," he says.  "The jail is going to be full of sick people.    Randall says the marijuana fight reminds him of the struggles of Galileo, the 16th-century astronomer.  Galileo saw craters on the moon, but the church replied the moon is perfect.  Look through the telescope, Galileo implored.  But the church said: No, it's an instrument of the devil.    "On the one hand, I'm more optimistic now than I've ever been," Randall says.  "AIDS patients have revitalized this movement around the world.  Still, bureaucrats resist, even under overwhelming evidence they are destroying people's lives."    And that, says Randall, is true reefer madness.    My friend recently learned that she is cancer-free for the first time in a decade.  Her doctor said part of the reason is that she kept on weight.    "You kept your strength up," he told her, "which allowed you to withstand the high doses.  I'm trying to determine what combination of chemicals may have caused that."    She hopes that someday she will find the courage to tell him.  TRACIE CONE is a staff writer for West.

It was recommended as an appetite stimulant, musclerelaxant, analgesic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant. As late as1913 Sir William Osler recommended it as the most satisfactoryremedy for migraine. Today the 5000-year medical history of cannabis has been almostforgotten. Its use declined in the early 20th century becausethe potency of preparations was variable, responses to oral ingestionwere erratic, and alternatives became available -- injectableopiates and, later, synthetic drugs such as aspirin and barbiturates.In the United States, the final blow was struck by the MarihuanaTax Act of 1937. Designed to prevent nonmedical use, this lawmade cannabis so difficult to obtain for medical purposes thatit was removed from the pharmacopeia. It is now confined to ScheduleI under the Controlled Substances Act as a drug that has a highpotential for abuse, lacks an accepted medical use, and is unsafefor use under medical supervision. In 1972 the National Organization for the Reform of MarijuanaLaws petitioned the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, laterrenamed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to transfermarihuana to Schedule II so that it could be legally prescribed.As the proceedings continued, other parties joined, includingthe Physicians Association for AIDS [acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome] Care. It was only in 1986, after many years of legalmaneuvering, that the DEA acceded to the demand for the publichearings required by law. During the hearings, which lasted 2years, many patients and physicians testified, and thousands ofpages of documentation were introduced. In 1988 the DEA's ownadministrative law judge, Francis L. Young, declared that marihuanain its natural form fulfilled the legal requirement of currentlyaccepted medical use in treatment in the United States. He addedthat it was "one of the safest therapeutically active substancesknown to man." His order that the marihuana plant be transferredto Schedule II was overruled, not by any medical authority, butby the DEA itself, which issued a final rejection of all pleasfor reclassification in Mach 1992. Meanwhile, a few patients have been able to obtain marihuana legallyfor therapeutic purposes. Since 1978, legislation permitting patientswith certain disorders to use marihuana with a physician's approvalhas been enacted in 36 states. Although federal regulations andprocedures made the laws difficult to implement, 10 states eventuallyestablished formal marihuana research programs to seek Food andDrug Administration (FDA) approval for Investigational New Drug(IND) applications. These programs were later abandoned, mainlybecause the bureaucratic burden on physicians and patients becameintolerable. Growing demand also forced the FDA to Institute an IndividualTreatment IND (commonly referred to as a Compassionate IND) forthe use of physicians whose patients needed marihuana becauseno other drug would produce the same therapeutic effect. The applicationprocess was made enormously complicated, and most physicians didnot want to become involved, especially since many believed therewas some stigma attached to prescribing cannabis. Between 1976and 1988 the government reluctantly awarded about a half dozenCompassionate INDs for the use of marihuana. In 1989 the FDA wasdeluged with new applications from people with AIDS, and the numbergranted rose to 34 within a year. In June 1991, the Public HealthService announced that the program would be suspended becauseit undercut the administration's opposition to the use of illegaldrugs. After that no new Compassionate INDs were granted, andthe program was discontinued in March 1992. Eight patients arestill receiving marihuana under the original program; for everyoneelse it is officially a forbidden medicine. And yet physicians and patients in increasing numbers continueto relearn through personal experience the lessons of the 19thcentury. Many people know that marihuana is now being used illegallyfor the nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy. Some knowthat it lowers intraocular pressure in glaucoma. Patients havefound it useful as an anticonvulsant, as a muscle relaxant inspastic disorders, and as an appetite stimulant in the wastingsyndrome of human immunodeficiency virus infection. It is alsobeing used to relieve phantom limb pain, menstrual cramps, andother types of chronic pain, including (as Osler might have predicted)migraine.2 Polls and voter referenda have repeatedly indicatedthat the vast majority of Americans think marihuana should bemedically available. One of marihuana's greatest advantages as a medicine is its remarkablesafety. It has little effect on major physiological functions.There is no known case of a lethal overdose; on the basis of animalmodels, the ratio of lethal to effective dose is estimated as40,000 to 1. By comparison, the ratio is between 3 and 50 to 1for secobarbital and between 4 and 10 to 1 for ethanol. Marihuanais also far less addictive and far less subject to abuse thanmany drugs now used as muscle re- From the Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School,and the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, Boston.

The chief legitimate concernis the effect of smoking on the lungs. Cannabis smoke carrieseven more tars and other particulate matter than tobacco smoke.But the amount smoked is much less, especially in medical use,and once marihuana is an openly recognized medicine, solutionsmay be found. Water pipes are a partial answer; ultimately a technologyfor the inhalation of cannabinoid vapors could be developed. EvenIf smoking continued, legal availability would make it easierto take precautions against aspergilli and other pathogens. Atpresent, the greatest danger in medical use of marihuana is itsillegality, which imposes much anxiety and expense on sufferingpeople, forces them to bargain with illicit drug dealers, andexposes them to the threat of criminal prosecution. The main active substance in cannabis, [delta-9]-tetrahydrocannabinol([delta-9]-THC), has been available for limited purposes as aSchedule II synthetic drug since 1985. This medicine, dronabinol(Marinol), taken orally in capsule form, is sometimes said toobviate the need for medical marihuana. Patients and physicianswho have tried both disagree. The dosage and duration of actionof marihuana are easier to control, and other cannabinoids inthe marihuana plant may modify the action of [delta-9]-THC. Thedevelopment of cannabinoids in pure form should certainly be encouraged,but the time and resources required are great and at present unavailable.In these circumstances, further isolation, testing, and developmentof individual cannabinoids should not be considered a substitutefor meeting the immediate needs of suffering people. Although it is often objected that the medical usefulness of marihuanahas not been demonstrated by controlled studies, several informalexperiments involving large numbers of subjects suggest an advantagefor marihuana over oral [delta-9]-THC and other medicines. Forexample, from 1978 through 1986 the state research program inNew Mexico provided marihuana or synthetic [delta-9]-THC to about250 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy after conventionalmedications failed to control their nausea and vomiting. A physicianwho worked with the program testified at a DEA hearing that forthese patients marihuana was clearly superior to both chlorpromazineand synthetic [delta-9]-THC.3 It is true that we do not have studiescontrolled according to the standards required by the FDA -- chieflybecause legal, bureaucratic, and financial obstacles are constantlyput in the way. The situation is ironical, since so much researchhas been done on marihuana, often in unsuccessful attempts toprove its dangerous and addictive character, that we know moreabout it than about most prescription drugs. Physicians should offer more encouragement to controlled research,but it too has limitations. Individual therapeutic responses canbe obscured by the statistical results of group experiments inwhich there is little effort to identify the specific featuresof a patient that affect the drug response. Furthermore, muchof our knowledge of synthetic medicines as well as plant derivativescomes from anecdotal evidence. For example, as early as 1976 severalsmall, methodologically imperfect, and relatively obscure studieshad shown that taking an aspirin a day could prevent a secondheart attack. In 1988 a large-scale experiment demonstrated dramaticeffects. This story is suggestive, because marihuana, like aspirin,is a substance known to be unusually safe and to have enormouspotential health benefits. Cannabis can also bring about immediate relief of suffering measurablein a study with only one subject. In the experimental method knownas the single patient randomized trial, active and placebo treatmentsare administered randomly in alternation or succession to a patient.The method is often useful when large scale controlled studiesare impossible or inappropriate because the disorder is rare,the patient is atypical, or the response to the treatment is idiosyncratic.Many patients, either deliberately or because of unreliable supplies,have informally carried out somewhat similar experiments by alternatingperiods of cannabis use with periods of no use in the treatmentof various disorders.2(pp.133-135) The American Medical Association was one of the few organizationsthat raised a voice in opposition to the Marihuana Tax Act of1937, yet today most physicians seem to take little active interestin the subject, and their silence is often cited by those whoare determined that marihuana shall remain a forbidden medicine.Meanwhile, many physicians pretend to ignore the fact that theirpatients with cancer, AIDS, or multiple sclerosis are smokingmarihuana for relief; some quietly encourage them. In a 1990 survey,44% of oncologists said they had suggested that a patient smokemarihuana for relief of the nausea induced by chemotherapy.4 Ifmarihuana were actually unsafe for use even under medical supervision,as its Schedule I status explicitly affirms, this recommendationwould be unthinkable. It is time for physicians to acknowledgemore openly that the present classification is scientifically,legally, and morally wrong. Physicians have both a right and a duty to be skeptical abouttherapeutic claims for any substance, but only after putting asidefears and doubts connected with the stigma of illicit nonmedicaldrug use. Advocates of medical use of marihuana are sometimescharged with using medicine as a wedge to open a way for "recreational"use. The accusation is false as applied to its target, but expressesin a distorted form a truth about some opponents of medical marihuana;they will not admit that it can be a safe and effective medicinelargely because they are stubbornly committed to exaggeratingits dangers when used for nonmedical purposes. We are not asking readers for immediate agreement with our affirmationthat marihuana is medically useful, but we hope they will do moreto encourage open and legal exploration of its potential. Theostensible indifference of physicians should no longer be usedas a justification for keeping this medicine in the shadows. Lester Grinspoon, MD James B. Bakalar, JD 1.

This is the first national conference to focus on providing scientifically based information on marijuana to dispel myths, increase public awareness of the rising trends in marijuana use, and educate the public about the consequences of marijuana use, especially for young people.  Another purpose is to educate the drug abuse prevention and treatment communities about research results that can assist in prevention and treatment efforts.This conference is one of the principal elements in the Marijuana Prevention Initiative, which the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, announced last December when she released the results of the 1994 Monitoring the Future study.  It responds to the significant upturns in marijuana use among 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students.The conference will present outcomes of NIDA/NIH research that focus on:  Extent of the Problem; What Marijuana Is, What It Does, and Where It Acts; Consequenses of Marijuana Use; and Research-Based Prevention and Treatment Approaches.  Scientists, the public, and practitioners will exchange information that can be disseminated through the media, national organizations, educators, juvenile justice authorities, and State and local antidrug coalitions.We are very concerned about the significant increased use of marijuana, especially by young people.  This conference will synthesize and begin to disseminate scientifically accurate information about the consequences of marijuana use.  We know it will be useful to all who attend.I encourage you to attend the conference.                                    Sincerely,                                    Alan I.

Patients with glaucoma, migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis paraplegia, quadriplegia, the AIDS wasting syndrome, or nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy for cancer have risked severe penalties to acquire cannabis, because they find it more useful than legally available medicines.1,2 The U.S. government has consistently refused to permit prescription sales of marijuana, insisting that the evidence of its safety and efficacy is inadequate. In response to a lawsuit brought by advocates of the medical use of marijuana, an administrative law judge with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recommended in 1988 that the federal legal classification of marijuana be changed so that physicians can prescribe it.3 The DEA did not implement the recommendation. In 1992, Richard Bonner, then DEA administrator, offered this suggestion: "Those who insist that marihuana has medical uses would serve society better by promoting or sponsoring more legitimate scientific research, rather than throwing their time, money, and rhetoric into lobbying, public relations campaigns, and perennial litigation."4 Encouraged by this declaration, Donald Abrams, of the University of California, San Francisco, sought permission to conduct a privately financed pilot study comparing three potencies of inhaled marijuana (high, medium, and low) with oral delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (dronabinol) capsules, which are available by prescription in the United States, for the treatment of weight loss associated with the AIDS wasting syndrome. Dr. Abrams's protocol (Investigational New Drug No. 43,542) was designed in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and approved by the FDA, the University of California, San Francisco, institutional review board, the California Research Advisory Panel, and the scientific advisory committee of the San Francisco Community Consortium. Unfortunately, the U.S. government will not allow Dr. Abrams to obtain a legal supply of marijuana. The DEA refused to permit him to import marijuana from Hortapharm, a company licensed by the government of the Netherlands to cultivate cannabis for botanical and pharmaceutical research. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which controls the domestic supply of marijuana for clinical research, rejected Dr. Abrams's request in April 1995. The letter of rejection, from NIDA director Alan I. Leshner, was sent nine months after Dr. Abrams had submitted his request. Given the limited sources of support for research on marijuana (pharmaceutical companies, for example, are not interested in supporting such research), the U.S. government by now should have taken note of the increasingly persuasive therapeutic claims and sponsored its own clinical trials through the National Institutes of Health. Instead, as Dr. Bonner's remark and the handling of Dr. Abrams's protocol indicate, the government has responded by urging others to investigate the medical potential of marijuana and then creating obstacles that make the research impossible to pursue.

Leshner and Abrams were offered the opportunity to respond. Dr. Leshner declined to do so. Dr. Abrams's reply follows. To the Editor: The San Francisco Community Consortium is an association of providers of care for patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the San Francisco Bay area. The consortium conducts community-based clinical trials of therapies of potential benefit to our patients. Inhaled marijuana is being used increasingly by people with HIV infection, especially for its purported benefit as an anti-emetic agent and an appetite stimulant in those with the AIDS wasting syndrome. Up to 2000 people infected with HIV are reported to be obtaining marijuana at a cannabis buyer's club in our area. The California State Assembly has recently endorsed legislation to make medicinal marijuana available to patients with life-threatening illnesses. In an effort to determine whether inhaled marijuana is truly of any potential benefit and, more important, to evaluate its safety in people with AIDS, the Community Consortium designed a pilot study. We thought it would be appropriate to conduct a small study of the overall feasibility of investigating inhaled marijuana use by such patients, before embarking on a full-scale trial of its efficacy. The pilot-drug-evaluation staff at the FDA provided valuable comments on the design of the protocol. Pulmonary-function tests, lymphocyte-sub-group analyses, and measurements of viral burden by the branched-DNA technique were to be performed serially for safety. Body composition was to be measured by state-of-the-art techniques to assess potential trends in the amelioration of wasting. The FDA and the institutional review board supported the study. Unfortunately, the DEA and the NIDA opposed it. Most disturbing was the absence of a response from either agency for an unacceptably long period, followed by the NIDA's outright rejection of the proposal without any opportunity for dialogue or compromise. Such behavior is offensive not only to the investigators but to the patients for whom we seek to find safe and effective treatments. San Francisco, CA 94143 DONALD I. ABRAMS, M.D. CARROLL C.

GRUBOR, Petitioner, vs. THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION BUREAU OF DRIVER LICENSING, Respondent. ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI Filed pro se by: John M. Grubor, J.D. P.O. Box 114 E. McKeesport, Pa. 15035 Petitioner QUESTIONS PRESENTED FOR REVIEW 1. Whether a State Court may rule that a Sanction (Driver's License Suspension) passed under a "Crimes Code" is merely a "collateral civil consequence" or an "additional civil penalty," thereby depriving a Defendant of his 5th Amendment Constitutional Rights, by being given the cruel and unusual punishment of being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense, and being deprived of his liberty and property without Due Process of Law. 2. Whether a State may deny Due Process of Law to a Defendant who has executed a plea bargain, by later demanding additional Penalties (Driver's License Suspension and over $10,000 in costs) which were not disclosed to the Defendant at the time of the court colloquy on the plea bargain agreement. 3. Whether a Defendant is denied Due Process of Law by being required to present his entire case within less than five minutes. (Defendant's entire Defense case is on pages 5 to 10 of the Lower Court Transcript.) 4. Whether a State may deprive a Defendant of his Liberty and inflict Cruel and Unusual Punishment (Driver's License Suspension) for a Defendant's justifiable use (Medical Necessity) of a controlled substance (Cannabis) which had nothing to do with an automobile or the State Motor Vehicle Code, and whether Due Process demands that the defense of "justification" be available at all proceedings that are derived from the original criminal conviction. 5. Whether a State may refuse to issue an "Occupational Limited License" thereby denying the fundamental right of Liberty to a Defendant who is in a "suspect class" of "Medical Necessity Users of a Controlled Substance," who's actions are "Justified" under Common Law, the Pennsylvania State Law and section 503 of the Model Penal Code, and whether Due Process demands that the "justification" defense be available at all proceedings that are derived from the original conviction.

GRUBOR, Petitioner, vs. THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION BUREAU OF DRIVER LICENSING, Respondent. ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI Petitioner, JOHN M. GRUBOR, J.D. respectfully requests that a Writ of Certiorari issue to review the Judgment and Order of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania denying Petitioner's Allocatur Petition for Allowance of Appeal from the Judgment and Order of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. 1 OPINIONS BELOW On November 4, 1993, after a five minute hearing, the Trial Court upheld thesuspension of Petitioner's Driver's license for an offense that had nothing to do with the Motor Vehicle Code. The Opinion of the Trial Court is attached to this Petition in the appendix, infra, and labeled as "Exhibit B." The Petitioner filed a timely appeal to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. The Opinion and Order of the Commonwealth Court are also in the appendix and labeled Exhibits "D" and "E," respectively. The Order of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, denying a review of the Commonwealth Court decision, is also attached in the appendix and labeled as "Exhibit F." JURISDICTION The Petitioner filed a timely Allocatur Petition for Allowance of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and on July 18, 1995, the PennsylvaniaSupreme Court denied Petitioner's Petition. The jurisdiction of this Honorable Supreme Court of the United States to review the final order of a State Supreme Court is vested in Title 28 UNITED STATES CODE Section 1257 and United States Supreme Court Rule 13. Thereby, Petitioner has 90 days from the State Supreme Court's Decision date within which to file a Petition for Certiorari. CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS AND STATUTES INVOLVED There are two Constitutional Provisions involved in the instant case. They are: "United States Constitution, Amendment V No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in 2 the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," and, "United States Constitution, Amendment VIII Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." There are two statutes involved in the instant case. The Primary Statute is the Pennsylvania State Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. section 780-113(m) which mandated a driver's license suspension for any conviction under the State Controlled Substance Act, the verbatim text of which is set forth in the Appendix, and marked as "Exhibit G." The Secondary Statute involved is of the Pennsylvania State Motor Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. Section 1553, which excludes the Petitioner from eligibility for the issuance of an "Occupational limited license," the verbatim text of which is set forth in the Appendix, and marked as "Exhibit H." STATEMENT OF THE CASE This Case involves the bona fide medical use of a controlled substance(Cannabis) for a "life or death" medical necessity. In January of 1982, Petitioner had an auto accident in which he received a severe impact injury to his head. Thereafter, Petitioner began having bloody nocturnal epileptic seizures. For almost five years, Petitioner was treated with Dilantin and other prescription drugs by three different Neurologists, but none of the Physicians or prescription drugs were able to stop the Petitioner's bloody seizures. Because of the 3 nocturnal seizures, Petitioner was in fear of his death for two reasons. The first was the possibility of ending a seizure on his back and thereby suffocating on the "swallowing of the tongue" effect. But he was also fearing death from "drowning in his own blood." On many a morning, Petitioner woke up with blood all over his pillow and sheets. His tongue was severely bitten into on both sides and the taste of blood would last for days. Sometime it would take weeks for the tongue to heal and the pain resulting from the back spasms during the seizures would last for months. In 1986, Petitioner read a book by a Harvard Physician, Dr. Lester Grinspoon, and the medical literature indicated that Cannabis was the only known substance to actually stop epileptic seizures from occurring. Because Petitioner had "no legal alternative," he began using Cannabis for his life threatening medical necessity in late 1986, and he has had no seizures ever since. In the spring of 1991, Petitioner was charged with the possession of 1/3 ounce the controlled substance Cannabis, and in March of 1992, Petitioner plead guilty to "possession" of Cannabis. The trial court was aware of the Petitioner's claim of a "medical necessity," and a plea bargain of "one year probation with NO other penalty" was agreed to by the parties. Neither during the plea bargain discussions with the Prosecution nor during the Trial Court Colloquy on the guilty plea was there ever any discussion of any "additional penalty" of a driver's license suspension, and the Petitioner was not aware of any "additional penalty." If Petitioner had been aware of an "additional penalty" at the time of the plea, he would not have entered into the plea bargain agreement with the Prosecutor. In April 1992, when the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's Bureau of Driver Licensing tried to suspend Petitioner's Driver's License, Petitioner filed a Statutory Appeal and was then scheduled for a de novo hearing on November 4, 1992. Before beginning the hearing, Petitioner was told by the Court "tipstaff" that he would be allowed only FIVE minutes to present his entire defense case to the trial court, and because of that pre-set limitation, Petitioner was not able tocall any other witnesses to testify but himself. Petitioner's defense began on page five of the hearing transcript. (See "Exhibit A" for the relevant sections of 4 the trial transcript.) Although Petitioner had five separate arguments to present, for the convenience of the Trial Court he told the Judge (page 6 of the transcript) that he would "get them in in five minutes." Only three minutes later, (at page 9 of the Transcript) the Judge said to the Petitioner: "Finish up, please." Petitioner's entire defense is contained in pages 5 to 10 of the trial transcript which is attached in the Appendix to this Petition and marked as "Exhibit A." Petitioner thereafter filed a timely appeal to the Commonwealth Court ofPennsylvania, and on October 28, 1994, the Commonwealth Court rendered anopinion on Petitioner's appeal, hereafter attached in the appendix to this Petition and marked as "Exhibit D." Thereafter, Petitioner filed a timely petition for reconsideration, which was denied. Finally, Petitioner filed an Allocatur Petition for Allowance of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania which was denied on July 18, 1995. This Certiorari Petition now requests a review of that Order. REASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT Under Rule 10 of the U.S. Supreme Court rules, there are stated three main"characters of compelling reasons" which are considered by this HonorableSupreme Court of the United States when considering review on a Writ ofCertiorari. Both the second and the third "characters of compelling reasons" are applicable to the instant case, and the third character is twice applicable. FIRST REASON FOR GRANTING THE WRIT: STATE vs. STATE CONFLICT. The second character of "compelling reason" stated in Rule 10 is when: "A state court of last resort has decided a federal question in a way that conflicts with the decision of another state court of last resort or of a United States Court of appeals;" That is exactly what has occurred in the instant case. Because of some 1989 Federal mandates to the States (updated Code found at Title 23 U.S.C. section 159), all 50 of the United States have been mandated to pass 5 some kind of "smoke a joint, lose your license" law to keep their share ofFederal Highway funds. The 50 different states have responded in scores of different ways (See Marijuana Policy Project Article at Exhibit K) and over 31 states have "opted-out" by legislative vote, and have decided to forego Federal Highway funds in amounts of up to $100 million dollars a year. (See 1995 California "Smoke a Joint, Lose your License Law" in Appendix as "Exhibit J) This option by the California Legislature creates a great indication of the "peoples' view" of these license suspension regulations' constitutionality or fairness, and the Courts of the States are just as divided. At the present time, only 18 States have opted to continue to follow this Federal mandate (See MPP Article, Exhibit K) and in the States that have, the States' Supreme Courts have been just as divided when rendering opinions directly opposite to other State Courts. The crux of the matter at issue in the instant case is whether Petitioner's driver's license suspension, as mandated by the Pennsylvania State Crimes Code, is actually a "criminal penalty" or a "collateral civil consequence" from which he is entitled to no constitutional protections. In the case at bar, the highest State Court of Pennsylvania has held the later, thus denying the Petitioner his constitutional rights in the instant driver's license suspension case. See Duffey v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 639 A.2d 1174 (1994). But other State Courts have held that this type of driver's license suspension was a "criminal penalty" and therefore any proceedings must be subjected to all Constitutional rights protections. See the very recent IOWA Supreme Court Decision in WANDA JOY HILLS vs. IOWA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND MOTOR VEHICLE DIVISION at No. 111/94-453 (Filed July 14, 1995 -- slip opinion not yet published.) The third "compelling reason" stated in U.S. Supreme Court Rule 10 is when: "A state court ... has decided an important question of federal law that has not been, but should be, settled by this Court, OR has decided a federal question in a way that conflicts with applicable decisions of this Court." BOTH are true in the case at bar. 6 SECOND REASON FOR GRANTING THE WRIT: STATE COURTS DECIDE IMPORTANT QUESTION OF FEDERAL LAW THAT SHOULD BE SETTLED BY THIS COURT. Initially, the very important decision of federal law, concerning the"constitutional rights applicability" to "federally mandated driver's license suspensions," has never been considered or decided by this Honorable Supreme Court of the United States. This may well be a 10th Amendment issue in all 50 States that sorely needs to be addressed and decided as quickly as possible. The backlog of criminal cases that this Federal driver's license mandate has created is a major national problem (See MPP article at Exhibit K) and it has all been caused by the Federal Statute at Title 23 U.S.C. Section 159, the constitutionality of which Statute has never been decided by this Honorable Court. However, that does not preclude this Honorable Supreme Court of the United States from taking plenary jurisdiction ab initio. THIRD REASON FOR GRANTING THE WRIT: STATE SUPREME COURT DECIDES A QUESTION OF FEDERAL LAW IN A WAY THAT CONFLICTS WITH APPLICABLE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISIONS. The second half of the U.S. Supreme Court's Rule 10 "third compelling reasoncriteria" is the most applicable in the instant case, because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decisions in Duffey v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 536 Pa. 436, 639 A.2d 1174, cert. denied (pre Kurth Ranch), 513 U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 223, 130 L.Ed.2d 149 (1994) and Plowman v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 535 Pa. 314, 635 A.2d 124 (1993) (1994) (which were cited by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania in deciding the instant case -- See opinion in Appendix as Exhibit D) are in DIRECT conflict with the recent United States Supreme Court decisions in United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 104 L.Ed 2d 487, 109 S.Ct. 1892 (1989) and Montana v. Kurth Ranch, ___ U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 1937 (1994). 7 The recent Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court case of Wylie v Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver's Licensing, 638 A.2d 433 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1994) points out the major problem in the case at bar, and a reading of that Court's opinion and it's following of the Plowman case, id, points out the gross conflict between the Pennsylvania Case Law in Plowman and this Honorable United States Supreme Court's controlling Federal Law decision rendered in U.S. v Halper, id. In Wylie, id, at pg. 435, when considering the "primary statute at issue" in the instant case, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court Held: "The due process constitutional challenge raised by Wylie is controlled by our Supreme Court's recent decision in Plowman, id.... -- the Supreme Court held that the DETERRENCE of illegal drug use was a legitimate state interest, and Section 13(m) was reasonably related to that end." (Emphasis supplied) From this we get the purpose of the "primary statute at issue" in the instant case, which was determined to be "deterrence," and indeed, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania states in the Plowman, id, Opinion at pg. 127: "the maximum PENALTY for the criminal violation of possession of marijuana is 30 days of imprisonment and/or a $500 fine. It is doubtful that such a PENALTY would be imposed for a first-time offense. In fact, a first offense may merit nothing more than a small fine. As such, the prospect of losing one's driver's license may DETER a potential drug user from committing that first drug offense. At least, that potential user may consider the loss of his/her license and it's effect on employment..." (emphasis supplied) From this Plowman holding, it seems clear that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court considers the primary statute at issue herein, 13(m), to have a legitimate state interest for the purpose of DETERRING the illegal use of drugs in Pennsylvania. But is the Pennsylvania Plowman case "good law" when tested by this Honorable Court's decision in Halper, id? The answer is a resounding NO! According to this Honorable United States Supreme Court, if the sanction is characterized as a "deterrent," it must be considered a double-jeopardy violation of due-process. 8 In Halper v. United States, at 490 US 435, 448 (1989), this Honorable Supreme Court of the United States held that: "... the determination whether a given civil sanction constitutes punishment in the relevant sense requires a particularized assessment of the penalty imposed and the purposes that the penalty may fairly be said to serve. Simply put, a civil as well as a criminal sanction constitutes punishment when the sanction applied in the individual case serves the goals of punishment." And finally, in Halper, id, at pgs. 448-449, this Honorable Supreme Court states: "a defendant who has already been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not be fairly characterized as remedial, but only as a DETERRENT or retribution." (emphasis supplied) The Pennsylvania Court in Plowman held that the purpose of the "primary statute at issue" in the instant case was "deterrence," and this Honorable United States Supreme Court held in Halper that if the purpose or characterization of a sanction was a "deterrent," that the defendant may not be subjected to the sanction. The Pennsylvania Plowman case, by which the decision in the instant case was supported, is in DIRECT conflict with this Honorable Court's ruling inthe Halper, id, and thereby creates some very valid grounds for the granting of the Writ of Certiorari to the Petitioner in the case at bar. In the lower court, Petitioner argued that his 90-day suspension in this case was a violation of due-process, because it took away his constitutional protections against equal protection denial and the cruel and unusual punishment of double jeopardy. Indeed the Commonwealth Court understood this very well when it stated that Petitioner asserted at the trial, "(1) that he was not advised that his driver's license would be suspended if he pleaded guilty," (a double-jeopardy assertion) and "(3) that the ninety-day suspension is cruel and unusual punishment and a violation of due process," (an assertion of both 5th and llth Amendment rights -- See pg. 3&4, Commonwealth Court Opinion, Exhibit D, Appendix.) Double Jeopardy is indeed a kind of "cruel and unusual punishment," and all of these issues were raised at the trial court in a "three minute rush" 9 defense, and they were preserved for appeal by that proceeding, as well as could be expected given the restrictions imposed by the trial court. The five issues that were preserved for review in both the trial and appellate courts were: 1. Whether a State may rule that a Sanction (Driver's License Suspension)passed under a "Crimes Code" is merely a "collateral civil consequence" or an "additional civil penalty," thereby depriving a Defendant of his 5th Amendment Constitutional Rights, by being given the cruel and unusual punishment of being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense, and being deprived of his liberty and property without Due Process of Law. 2. Whether a State may deny Due Process of Law to a Defendant who hasexecuted a plea bargain, by later demanding additional Penalties (Driver'sLicense Suspension and over $10,000 in costs) which were not disclosed to the Defendant at the time of the court colloquy on the plea bargain agreement. 3. Whether a Defendant is denied Due Process of Law by being required topresent his entire case within less than five minutes. (Defendant's entireDefense case is on pages 5 to 10 of the Lower Court Transcript.) 4. Whether a State may deprive a Defendant of his Liberty and inflict Cruel and Unusual Punishment (Driver's License Suspension) for a Defendant's justifiable use (Medical Necessity) of a controlled substance (Cannabis) which had nothing to do with an automobile or the State Motor Vehicle Code, and whether Due Process demands that the defense of "justification" be available at all proceedings that are derived from the original criminal conviction. 5. Whether a State may refuse to issue an "Occupational Limited License"thereby denying the fundamental right of Liberty to a Defendant who is in a"suspect class" of "Medical Necessity Users of a Controlled Substance," who's actions are "Justified" under Common Law, the State Pennsylvania Law and section 503 of the Model Penal Code, and whether Due Process demands that 10 the "justification" defense be available at all proceedings that are derived from the original conviction. All of these issues were presented to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, and a copy of the above five issues, in proposed Certiorari form, was attached to Petitioner's Allocatur Petition for Allowance of Appeal. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's finding that Petitioner's Driver's license was a "collateral civil consequence" or a "civil consequence of a criminal violation" is very hard to justify, when one examines the source of the sanction, which was the Pennsylvania "Crimes Code." In addition, the Plowman decision, upon which theCommonwealth Court relies, is in gross conflict with the Halper decision of this Honorable United States Supreme Court, and therefore it must be overruled. CONCLUSION This is a very valid case of some State Law being in conflict with other State Law, and that alone is sufficient reason for the granting of a Writ of Certiorari to Petitioner. However, it is clear from a reading of the Pennsylvania case law that the decisions of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court are in direct conflict with this Honorable Court's Halper decision, and therefore a writ of Certiorari to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is Petitioner's only effective remedy. WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays to this Honorable Supreme Court ofthe United States to issue a Writ of Certiorari to review the Judgment and Order of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, and the Judgment and Order of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

Encourages research of the therapeutic properties of various cannabinoids and combinations of cannabinoids; and 2. Encourages research on alternative methods of administration to decrease the harmfull effects related to smoking; and 3. Urges the Administration and Congress to move expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine where shown to be safe and effective and to immediately allow access to therapeutic cannibis through the Investigational New Drug Program.

(a) There is established in the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services an office to be known as the Office for the Supply of Internationally Controlled Drugs (hereinafter referred to in this section and sections 312 and 313 as the 'Office').  The Office shall be respon-sible for regulating, administering, and supervising the do-mestic production of marihuana and, in accordance with section 313, for the distribution of marihuana for medical, scientific, and research purposes.     "(b) The Office shall be under the direction of a Chief Officer who shall be appointed by the Secretary.  The Sec-retary is authorized to delegate his powers and responsibil-ities under sections 312 and 313 to the Chief Officer.     "PRODUCTION OF MEDICINAL MARIHUANA     "SEC. 312.  (a) The Secretary shall take all necessaryactions to secure and maintain a supply of marihuana ade-quate for the legitimate medical, research, scientific, and export needs of the United States.  The Secretary shall de-termine the total quantity of marihuana to be produced each calendar year to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, and research needs of the United States, for the establishment of reserve stocks, and for any lawful export requirements established by the Attorney General under section 1003.  Based on the determination under the pre-ceding sentence, the Secretary shall recommend to the At-torney General the aggregate production quotas that must be established for marihuana under section 306(a).

All bids submitted must specify the areas in which, and the land on which, cultivation of marihuana will be conducted.  All bids sub-mitted must be accompanied by an application for reg-istration under section 302.     "(2) The Secretary shall forward a copy of the reg-istration application to the Attorney General.  The Sec-retary, after consultation with the Attorney General, shall recommend to the Attorney General that the application for registration be granted or denied, taking into account the factors set forth in section 303(a).  The recommenda-tions of the Secretary concerning the registration of appli-cants to produce marihuana shall be binding on the Attor-ney General.     "(3) The Secretary may accept of reject any bid that is submitted by registered bidders, taking into consider-ation (A) the factors set forth in section 303(a), and (B) price.  Marihuana may be produced only by accepted bid-ders, solely on the land specified in the applicants' bids.  The Secretary shall provide persons whose bids have been accepted with marihuana seeds capable of germination.  Such seeds shall be obtained by the Secretary from legiti-mate commercial producers of marihuana or, if this is not feasible, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Attor-ney General through the Drug Enforcement Administra-tion, or the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide the Sec-retary with an adequate supply of seeds capable of germi-nation.     "(c) Upon acceptance of a bid for the production of marihuana, the Secretary shall establish an individual quota for the production of marihuana for the bidder and shall recommend to the Attorney General that this quota be assigned to the bidder where required under section 306.  The recommendations of the Secretary concerning in-dividual quotas for the production of marihuana, including recommendations that such a quota be decreased or in-creased, shall be binding on the Attorney General.     "(d) The Secretary may revoke or suspend the ac-ceptance of any bid for the production of marihuana prior to the expiration of the contract executed on the basis of the bid upon a finding by the Secretary (1) that the bidder has materially breached the terms of the contract relating to the maintenance of effective controls against diversion of marihuana into other than legitimate medical, scientific, and industrial channels; or (2) that any of the reasons specified in section 304(a) are applicable.  Upon such rev-ocation or suspension, the Secretary shall recommend to the Attorney General that the bidder's registration for the production of marihuana be revoked or suspended pursu-ant to section 304 and such recommendatios by the Sec-retary shall be binding on the Attorney General.     "(e) Within four months of the end of the harvest of marihuana grown by registered bidders pursuant to contract with the Office, the Office or its delegate or dele-gates shall take physical possession of the marihuana har-vested.     "(f)(1) The Secretary may, at his discretion, periodi-cally publish notices soliciting bids on a contract of con-tracts for the physical collection, processing, and shipping of marihuana crops produced under contracts entered into under subsection (b) or of imported or forfeited stocks de-scribed in subsections (g) and (h).  All bids submitted must be accompanied by an application for registration under section 302.     "(2) The Secretary shall forward a copy of the reg-istration application to the Attorney General.  The Sec-retary, after consultation with the Attorney General, shall recommend to the Attorney General that the application for registration be granted or denied, taking into account the factors set forth in section 303(b) and such rec-ommendatios of the Secretary shall be binding on the At-ttorney General.     "(3) The Secretary may accept or reject any bids sub-mitted by registered bidders, taking into consideration (A) the factors set forth in section 303(b); (B) the provisions in the bid for the processing of raw marihuana into medi-cally usable forms, including the provisions for the mainte-nance of controlled amounts of tetrahydrocannabinols in each dosage unit; and (C) price.     "(g) If a supply of marihuana adequate to meet do-mestic medical, scientific, and research needs is not ob-tained through contractual arrangements with domestic registered bidders, the Secretary shall declare that a state of emergency exists.  The declaration by the Secretary of a state of emergency due to inadequate domestic supplies of marihuana shall have the same effect as a finding by the Attorney General of an emergency due to inadequate domestic supplies under section 1002(a)(2)(A).  If no ap-plicants are registered to import marihuana under sections 1007 and 1008 within sixty days of the date of the dec-laration by the Secretary that a state of emergency exists, the Secretary shall make arrangements for the direct im-portation by the Office of a supply of marihuana adequate for domestic medical, scientific, and research needs.     "(h) If, while a state of emergency declared under subsection (g) exists, the Secretary finds that a supply of marihuana adequate for domestic medical, scientific, and research needs cannot be obtained through importation, then the Secretary may request that the Attorney General forward to the Office forfeited stocks of marihuana that are unadulterated with other substances, pursuant to sec-tion 511(e).

Approval of the phys-cian's application may be suspended or revoked by the Secretary for good cause shown.     "(c)(1) Upon certification of a physician as eligible under subsection (b), the Secretary shall issue serially numbered marihuana oder forms to all registered phar-macies or hospitals listed on the eligible physician's appli-cation form.  Whenever any such form is issued to a phar-macy or hospital the Secretary shall, before delivery there-of, insert therein the name of the pharmacy or hospital, and it shall be unlawful for any other person (A) to use such form for the purpose of obtaining controlled sub-stances; or (B) to furnish such form to any person with intent thereby to procure the distribution of such sun-stances.     "(2) It shall be unlawful for any person to obtain by means of order forms issued under this subsection con-trolled substances for any purpose other than their use, distribution, dispensing, or administration in the conduct of a lawful business in such substances or in the course or his professional practice or research.     "(3) Written orders made on marihuana order forms issued under this subsection shall satisfy the requirements of section 308(a).     "(4) The preservation and availability requirements of section 308(c) apply to orders made on forms issued under this subsection.     "(d) Hospitals and pharmacies may obtain supplies of marihuana only by forwarding a written order to the Secretary on the form issued in blank in accordance with subsection (c).  Upon receipt from a hospital or pharmacy of a properly completed marihuana order form requesting a supply of marihuana the Office or its delegate or dele-gates shall forward a supply of marihuana to the phar-macy or hospital within a reasonable time.  If notified by an eligible physician that there is a medical urgency for immediate shipment, the Office or its delegate or delegates shall forward a supply of marihuana within five days of such notice, or sooner if feasible.  Also, upon receipt by the Secretary of a written request of a person who has obtained approval of an investigational new drug applica-tion under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for research involving the use of marihuana, the Office or its delegate or delegates shall forward a sup-ply of marihuana to the specified pharmacy or hospital licensed to dispense schedule II drugs within a reasonable time.     "(e) The Secretary is directed to set a price for mari-huana that will recoup, within a reasonable time, all of the costs incurred by the Federal Government in produc-ing, processing, and distributing marihuana.     "(f) Within six months from the date of the enact-ment of this section, the Secretary, after consultation with the Attorney General, shall promulgate regulations con-sistent with public health and safety that are in accord with the provisions of this title to ensure adequate sup-ply of medically usable marihuana and to ensure proper safeguards regarding the production, storage, processing,distribution, and dispensing of marihuana so as to prevent its diversion into other than legitimate medical, scientific, or research channels.".

Yet this widely used substance is illegal just about everywhere. There have been numerous calls over the years for the legalisation, or at least decriminalisation, of soft drugs, among which cannabis remains the most popular with all social groups. In this highly contentious area, the Dutch attitude has been often mentioned as the voice of sanity. In the Netherlands, customers of coffee shops can buy up to 30 g of cannabis for about 10 pounds ($15) although the drug is technically illegal. The shops are not allowed to advertise, or to sell cannabis to individuals aged under 16 years. Prominent among those currently calling for legislative reform - and going further by making constructive proposals - are police chiefs and city medical officers, people who know only too well that the existing policies in most countries are ineffective and unworkable. Meanwhile, politicians have largely remained silent, seemingly afraid of offending powerful segments of the electorate or merely of being perceived as weak in the face of rising crime figures. When the occasional politician raises her head above the parapet - as the British opposition MP Clare Short did recently in calling for a fresh debate on decriminalisation of cannabis - the response is tediously predictable: widespread condemnation from political colleagues and overwhelming support from those who have to cope with the end result of political inertia. In the case of Ms Short, not only was she speedily reprimanded by the party leader, but also party officials claimed that their non-legalisation stance was entirely logical since legalisation of cannabis would "increase the supply, reduce the price, and increase the usage". According to a Home Office report earlier this year, the number of people taking cannabis has doubled in a decade - without any help from "liberal" measures. Perhaps the politicians' real fear was that freedom to use soft drugs would automatically progress to increased use of substances such as cocaine and heroin. If so, they must have overlooked the recent Dutch government review which pointed out that decriminalisation of possession of soft drugs has not led to a rise in the use of hard drugs. If the Dutch approach is so successful, why are changes afoot in The Hague to tighten up that country's drug policy? First Amsterdam's mayor proposed closing down half the city's coffee shops that sell cannabis, and in doing so he rejected a report by his health department in favour of legalisation of soft drugs. Then the Dutch government, which had made an election promise to legalise cannabis, last month issued a discussion paper which mirrored the Amsterdam plan. If, as expected, the Dutch parliament agrees the latest proposals, half the country's 4000 cannabis-selling coffee shops will close and the amount that can be sold to an individual will be cut to 5 g. Since the government's own review provides no ammunition for such a change in policy, the real reason behind the new measures must lie elsewhere. One need look no further than the Netherlands' neighbours and co-signatories of the Schengen agreement, which introduced a border-free zone between the Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain, Luxembourg, and Belgium. When France, in particular, threatened to end the agreement, claiming that the Netherlands was the major supplier of Europe's drugs, some action had to be taken and the coffee shops became the scapegoat. Leaving politics aside, where is the harm in decriminalising cannabis? There is none to the health of the consumers, and the criminal fraternity who depend for their succour on prohibition would hate it. But decriminalisation of possession does not go far enough in our view. That has to be accompanied by controls on source, distribution, and advertising, much as happens with tobacco. A system, in fact, remarkably close to the existing one in Dutch coffee shops. Cannabis has become a political football, and one that governments continually duck. Like footballs, however, it bounces back. Sooner or later politicians will have to stop running scared and address the evidence: cannabis per se is not a hazard to society but driving it further underground may well be.

Only one drug helps: marijuana.    "It makes life more bearable, and you can hang on and fight," said Getchell, who worked as a pediatric chemist at Massachusetts General Hospital before he became too sick.  "That's why I'm still alive."    But a bill to allow patients like Getchell to use medical necessity as a legal defense if they are arrested for possessing marijuana, passed early this month by the Legislature, has met unexpected resistance from Gov. Weld.    Weld has sent the bill back to the Legislature, requesting an amendment that would allow the legal defense only for certified participants in a Department of Public Health therapeutic research program - of which there are none.    The program, created by a 1991 law, has never enrolled anyone because the federal government has stopped providing a legal supply of medical marijuana, although the state has renewed efforts to get federal approval for supplying marijuana to patients.    Weld said in an interview that "unlike others, I do think that there's some evidence that marijuana has some value for treating some medical conditions," such as glaucoma, AIDS wasting syndrome, or the side effects of chemotherapy.    "I just think the bill is just too wide open.  The self-diagnosis approach is too wide open," he said.    Getchell, a fair-skinned redhead diagnosed in 1990 with melanoma, an aggressive skin cancer that resulted from severe sunburn when he was an adolescent, fought hard to get the bill passed.  He said he cannot understand Weld's action, pointing out that in 1992, the governor commuted the sentence of Joseph Hutchins, who was growing and using marijuana so that he could eat despite scleroderma, an incurable disease that hardened his esophagus and made it extremely hard to swallow.    "What I would want to say to Gov. Weld is that this is an issue of compassion," Getchell said.  "It's not about winning or not winning the drug war.  It's about sick and dying people and a way to help them under medical supervision."    Rep. Patricia D. Jehlen (D-Somerville), the bill's sponsor and Getchell's state representative, said she did not understand Weld's action either, since legislators have all along incorporated suggestions on the wording from the governor's office.  "All I know is that it doesn't make sense, given what he did with Hutchins," Jehlen said.    Hutchins has appealed his conviction, but the Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 1991 that he could not use a medical-necessity defense.  The Legislature pased the current bill to recognize such a defense in Massachusetts, giving patients like Getchell the ability to bring up medical evidence in court, Jehlen said.  She has filed an amendment that she believes would deal with Weld's concerns, but with this year's legislative session over, the bill will have to wait until January.    Hutchins now lives in Washington state, which recognizes the medical-necessity defense, according to Jon Holmes, a volunteer serving on the drug policy task force of the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts.    Weld said his thinking has not changed since he commuted Hutchins' sentence, but that the bill as passed does not have safeguards in place to ensure that only those with legitimate medical claims like Hutchins can use the medical-necessity defense.    "The bill I originally sent back didn't have the word 'doctor' anywhere near it," Weld said.  That suggests anyone arrested for marijuana possession would assert medical necessity "in virtually every case," he said.    Opponents of the medical use of marijuana have argued that there are legal alternatives to treat pain, nausea and other medical symptoms, and that legalizing just one use of the drug would open the door to marijuana becoming legal overall.  In the early 1990s, the Bush administration stopped taking new applications for a US-run medical marijuana program; only eight persons getting the drug legally through the program are still alive.  The Clinton administration has been unwilling to reopen the program.    Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who earlier this month filed a bill in Congress to permit doctors once again to prescribe marijuana to patients with certain diseases, said that the political climate in this country appears to be getting in the way of compassionate use of the drug.    "We are allowing the political impulses to apprea 'tough on drugs' to interfere with alleviating pain and suffering," said Frank, who noted that House Speaker Newt Gingrich had been a cosponsor to a 1982 bill that would also have allowed doctors to prescribe marijuana.    Dr. Lester Grinspoon - a Harvard psychiatrist whose book, "Marijuana: The Forbidden Medicine," is available in seven languages - said he believes Weld's amendment dooms the medical use of marijuana in this state.  "It's a cowardly way of vetoing, in my view," Grinspoon said, adding that he does not expect the state public health program ever to get federal approval for a supply.    David Mulligan, the state public health commissioner, disagreed, saying he is hopeful that within the next year the program can get approval to get a supply from the federal government or to grow its own marijuana under strict security.  The state does not want to jeopardize negotiations by appearing to condone illegal use of marijuana in the meantime, Mulligan said.    The stat also does not want to use marijuana seized in drug raids for medical purposes, he added, since it might have impurities that could be harmful to those with suppressed immune systems.    Aside from tying the medical necessity defense to participants in the state public health program, Weld's amendment expands the medical conditions that make patients eligible for the program by adding AIDS and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, Mulligan said.    Even if the state program were approved, it might not help Rhonda Lemoine, 39, who says she has been using marijuana to treat the chronic pain from muscle spasms and degenerative arthritis of the spine since a car accident in 1991.  Her condition is not one of the eligible medical conditions currently listed by the program.    "I couldn't work for a long time" with the pain and the loss of appetite, said Lemoine, the medical marijuana coordinator for the Massachusetts Cannabis Reform Coalition, which supports Jehlin's bill.  "I use marijuana as an appetite enhancer, and it helps with the muscle spasms.  I've gone from basically being bedridden to being functioning."    Lemoine, he husband and her son were arrested last year in an early morning raid at their central Massachusetts home, after an acquaintance who was arrested on crack cocaine charges turned them in as part of a plea bargain.  Lemoine was willing to plead guilty to a charge of possessing an ounce of marijuana, but she had to plead guilty to distribution as well to get charges against her husband dropped, Lemoine said.  Her husband paid a fine, her son got six months' probation and she got a suspended one-year sentence, with probation until February 1996.    "I want to stay healthy and do whatever I can," said Lemoine, who has been able to open her own business after beginning to use marijuana.  "It's the only law I'm breaking, and I'm trying to change that one."WT01-B18-286IA087-000628-B026-230http://206.61.184.43:80/olsen/MEDICAL/pate.html 206.61.184.43 19970122061137 text/html 20040HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 06:11:25 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 01-Dec-96 18:06:33 GMTContent-length: 19824 Potential medical uses of Cannabis Guide to the scientific literature on potential medical uses of Cannabis and the cannabinoids David W.

Journal of the International Hemp Association 2(2): 74-76. Marijuana and its component cannabinoids have been demonstrated to affect many medical conditions. However, original sources on this topic are often difficult to access, as they are diffusely distributed across a voluminous scientific literature. This bibliography gathers most of the primary (and some of the secondary) citations available, categorized according to medical indication. Introduction Widespread reports of self-medication with Cannabis have aroused medical and scientific interest in the potential application of cannabinoids for the treatment of a variely of diseases. Some limited human trials or case studies have revealed the safety and efficacy of this class of compounds for the symptomatic treatment of a broad number of ailments.

Drugs, says psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, have taken over the lead role from sex in the "the grand morality play of human existence. "No longer, says Szasz, "are men, women, and children tempted, corrupted, and ruined by the irresistibly sweet pleasures of sex; instead, they are tempted, corrupted, and ruined by the irresistibly sweet pleasures of drugs."1 Because dealing with drugs is viewed as a moral problem, politicians tend to compete in their zeal to banish the evil from the kingdom. Those who talk of legalisation are dismissed as mavericks, and whipped back into line. The British government's drug strategy for the next three years states baldly "There will be no legalisation of any currently controlled drugs."2 But some legalisation would help. The politicians fighting the jihad against drugs want to obliterate the enemy. They, of course, make an exception for legal drugs like alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine; indeed, British government last week recommended tee totallers take up drinking alcohol for the good of their health.3 Yet a world devoid of drugs seems as unlikely as a world devoid of poverty and sin. Thomas Sydenham observed 300 years ago "Among the remedies which it has pleased Almighty God to give to man to relieve his sufferings, none is so universal and so efficacious as opium"4; and Aldous Huxley wrote "That humanity at large will ever be able to dispense Artificial Paradises seems very unlikely. Most men women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best monotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape longing to transcend themselves if only for a few moments, is and has always been one of the principal appetites of the soul."5 If we accept that a world without drugs is unachievable (and probably intolerable) then the important question, argues drug policy expert Ethan Nadelmann, becomes "What are the best means to regulate the production, distribution and consumption of the great variety of psychoactive substances available today and in the foreseeable future?"6 To reduce the debate to arguments between "prohibitionists" and "legalisers" is to oversimplify, but it's a useful device for beginning to understand the issues. The case for legalising drugs begins with the failure of current prohibitionist policies. The United States has been conducting a "war on drugs" for seven decades, during which time there have been steady increases in seizures of illegal drugs, the numbers of people using drugs, and the health and social costs of drug taking. Economists argue from first principles that the war on drugs must fail. Any success in reducing the supply will raise the price of illegal drugs. Addicts must then commit more crime to feed their habit; and a rise in the profit margins of drug smugglers urges them on to greater efforts. The history of the drug trade is that supply always meets demand. Milton Friedman, the Nobel prize winning economist, puts it thus: "Illegality creates obscene profits that finance the murderous tactics of the drug lords; illegality leads to the corruption of law enforcement officials; illegality monopolises the efforts of honest law forces so that they are starved of resources to fight the simpler crimes of robbery, theft and assault."7 The main result of the United States war on drugs is a prison system bursting with petty drug offenders, most of them African-Americans. Britain has never been as warlike as the United States in efforts to control drugs. British policy is, however, essentially prohibitionist, and yet about seven million people in Britain have taken cannabis at some time in their lives.8 About a quarter to a third of young people have tried solvents or illegal drugs by their 20th birthday9, and in one survey the proportion of young people who had been offered drugs rose from 2% in 1969 to 41% in 1994.9 LSD and ecstasy have now also been absorbed into mainstream youth culture, with about 9% of those aged 16 to l9 having used ecstasy and about 8% LSD.9 These high reported prevalences are likely to be true because seizures of cannabis more than tripled from 23,592 in 1984 to 107,629 in 1994, ecstasy seizures increased from 39 in 1989 to 715 in 1994, and heroin seizures rose from 2,995 in 1984 to 4,480 in 1994.10 Time to consider going Dutch? Other countries have been more willing to experiment with decriminalisation and legalization. The Netherlands effectively decriminalised penal possession of drugs in 1976, and cannabis is sold in "coffee shops." The Dutch are now coming under great pressure to reverse their experiment from neighbouring countries, worried that they are being flooded with drugs from the Netherlands. Yet the 1976 changes in the Netherlands seem to have been followed by a fall in use of cannabis: from 13 % of those aged 17-18 in 1976 to 6% in 1985. Monthly prevalence of cannabis use among Dutch high school students is around 5.4% compared with 29% in the United States.11 Forbidden fruit may, indeed, be sweetest. One simple argument for criminalising drugs is often used by governments in the context of tobacco: that the state has no right to interfere with what individuals do in private so long as they don't harm others. Another argument is that legalisation would cut the huge costs of enforcement, prosecution, and imprisonment. Thirdly, a legal market could allow quality control of drugs and education on how to avoid them or use them more safely; drugs might more predictably be prevented from reaching the young and vulnerable. Finally, many of the adverse health effects of drugs stem from criminalisation rather than from the drugs themselves. Anyway, current policy is clearly not driven by totting up the good and bad effects of drugs: few are more harmful than tobacco. Although the arguments for legalisation can be expressed forcefully, almost nobody argues for a free, legal, unregulated market for all drugs, and clearly no single policy will cover all drugs. Nadelmann says: "It is imperative that any drug policy distinguishes between casual use that results in little or no harm to anyone, drug misuse that causes harm primarily to the consumer, and drug misuse that results in palpable harm to others - and then focuses primarily on the last of these, secondarily on preventing the misuse of drugs, and little at all on casual drug use."6 The key question is how the world would look if drugs were legal. The Australian National Task Force on Cannabis has identified five options for cannabis legislation: total prohibition; prohibition with civil penalties; partial prohibition; regulation of the production, distribution, and sale of cannabis; and free availability.12 The task force opted for keeping possession, cultivation, and sale in any quantity illegal but decriminalising "simple personal use or possession ... without compromising activities aimed at deterring cannabis use." Others - for instance, economist Richard Stevenson have tried to describe a world where large companies produce, distribute, and advertise drugs like heroin and cocaine and invest heavily in research designed to produce drugs that will satisfy customers' wants while making them safer.13 Much more work needs to be done on envisaging a world that includes some legalisation of drugs. But it's clear that purely prohibitionist policies don't work and make the problems of drug abuse worse. Governments worldwide have followed illogical and often counterproductive drug policies, primarily because drug use is seen in moral terms. Wars on drugs are doomed to failure, but experiments with decriminalising and even legalising drugs - as in the Netherlands - have shown promising results. Policies that allow some decriminalisation and legalisation are much more likely than prohibition to succeed in achieving everybody's aim of minimising the harm from drug abuse.
