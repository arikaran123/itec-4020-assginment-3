In 1991 state and federal governments planned $6.8 billion in new prison construction,at an average cost of $53,100 per cell. (National Council on Crime & Delinquency, CrimeReduction Policy, 1992) It costs $32,000 a year to jail juvenile offenders,but $4,200 to educate a student in K-12 schools. (Jerome Miller, National Center for Institutions andAlternatives) The collective operating expenditure of local policedepartments during fiscal year 1990 was $20.6 billion (employing 460,000 full-time people). This was 20 percent morethan in 1987, when local police expenditures were $17.2 billion. (LEMASprogram, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Department of Justice,1992) Law Enforcement Expenditures increased from $80million in 1938, to more than $3 billion in 1982, and to morethan $41.5 billion by 1990. Police share of total city budgetsincreased from 8 percent (1940) to 14 percent (1980). (UnequalJustice) The Human Cost of Punishment: People of Color Bear the Brunt If incarceration trends continue, we will have 7.5million people in prison before the turn of the century. Ofthose, four million will be Black. There are only 5.5 millionBlack men between 18 and 39 in the nation. (National Council on Crime and Delinquency, Crime ReductionPolicy, 1992) 23 percent of all Black men are caught up in thecriminal justice system: in prison, on probation or on parole.There are more Black men in prison today than in college. Forevery Latino male with a college degree, there are 24 behindbars. 60 percent of inmates are either Black or Latino. (WashingtonPost, 11/23/93) Where mandatory minimums apply, Black offenders were21 percent more likely and Latinos 28 percent more likely thanwhites to receive at least the mandatory minimum prison term. (FederalJudicial Center, 1992) 47 percent of state prisoners in 1990 were Black and12 percent were Latino; 61 percent of state prison inmates in1986 had not completed high school; 35 percent of jail inmates in1989 were unemployed prior to entering jail; 39 percent of jailinmates in 1989 free for at least one year prior to their arresthad incomes under $5,000. (Facts About Prisons and Prisoners,Bureau of Justice Statistics, June 1992) In analyzing police brutality cases from January 1990to May 1992, In These Times found out that 97 percent of victimswere African Americans or Latinos, and that white police officerswere centrally involved in 93 percent of these assaults. SocialNet vs. Dragnet: Punishment Strategy Fails to Reduce Crime Imprisonment and Crime The states with the lowest crime rates have thelowest imprisonment rates, and states with the highest crimerates have the highest imprisonment rates There is no evidencethat imprisonment reduces crime. (James Austin and Marc Mauer,USA Today, January 27, 1994) San Diego and Dallas have about the same rate ofpolice-to-population ratio, yet Dallas has twice as much crimereported to the police. Cleveland and San Diego, meanwhile, havecomparable crime rates even though Cleveland has twice as manypolice per capita. Moreover, Washington, D.C., has both thehighest murder rate and the most police per square foot of anycity in the Western world. There doesnt seem to be any directrelationship between the amount of police and the crime rate. Even if the nation's police forces were doubled from 1 to 2million, we could still expect, at best, only a modest decreasein crimes. My conclusion is that there is no law enforcementsolution to the crime problem. The factors that affect crime age,sex, race, social class, poverty, unemployment rates,illegitimacy, AFDC all those kinds of things are really beyondthe reach of a law enforcement community. And, therefore, crimecannot really be materially affected by the use of lawenforcement, or even correctional strategies.

Before applying a test of the nine criteria, the expert firstdetermines if the symptoms have persisted for at least a month orhave occurred repeatedly over a longer period of time. Asked about the tobacco executives' testimony on addiction,Dr. Kozlowski said, "In a way, I can see how they could saythat. It has to do with a mistaken image of what addiction is,and I have many well-educated, intelligent people say somethinglike that to me. People often think of a person taking oneinjection of heroin and becoming hopelessly addicted for the restof their lives. That is wrong." In addition, he said, when people tend to think of the highthat heroin produces, one that is about as intense as cocaine andalcohol, they cannot believe cigarettes are in the same category.And they are not. Even though in large doses nicotine can cause astrong high and hallucinations, the doses used in cigarettesproduce only a very mild high. But researchers now know, says Dr. Jack Henningfield, chief ofclinical pharmacology at the Addiction Research Center of theGovernment's National Institute on Drug Abuse, that manyqualities are related to a drug's addictiveness, and the level ofintoxication it produces may be one of the least important. If one merely asks how much pleasure the drugs produce, asresearchers used to do and tobacco companies still do, thenheroin or cocaine and nicotine do not seem to be in the samecategory. Dr. Kozlowki said, "It's not that cigarettes arewithout pleasure, but the pleasure is not in the same ball parkwith heroin." But now, he said, there are more questions to ask. "Ifthe question is How hard is it to stop? then nicotine a veryimpressive drug," he said. "Its urges are very similarto heroin." Among the properties of a psychoactive drug - how much cravingit can cause, how severe is the withdrawal, how intense a high itbrings - each addicting drug has its own profile. Heroin has a painful, powerful withdrawal, as does alcohol.But cocaine has little or no withdrawal. On the other hand,cocaine is more habit-forming in some respects, it is morereinforcing in the scientific terminology, meaning that animalsand humans will seek to use it frequently in short periods oftime, even over food and water. Drugs rank differently on the scale of how difficult they areto quit as well, with nicotine rated by most experts as the mostdifficult to quit. Moreover, it is not merely the drug that determines addiction,says Dr. john R. Hughes, an addiction expert at the University ofVermont. It is also the person, and the circumstances in theperson's life. A user may be able to resist dependence at onetime and not at another. A central property of addiction is the user's control over thesubstance. With all drugs. including heroin, many are occasionalusers. The addictive property of the substance can be measured byhow many users maintain a casual habit and how many arepersistent, regular users. According to large Government surveys of alcohol users, onlyabout 15 percent are regular. dependent drinkers. Among cocaineusers, about 8 percent become dependent. For cigarettes, thepercentage is reversed. About 90 percent of smokers arepersistent daily users, and 55 percent become dependent byofficial American Psychiatric Association criteria, according toa study by Dr. Naomi Breslau of the Henry Ford Health SciencesCenter in Detroit. Only 10 percent are occasional users. Surveys also indicate that two-thirds to four-fifths ofsmokers want to quit but cannot, even after a number of attempts.Dr. John Robinson, a psychologist who works for the R. J.Reynolds Tobacco Company, contests the consensus view of nicotineas addictive. Using the current standard definition of addiction,he said at a recent meeting on nicotine addiction, he could notdistinguish "crack smoking from coffee drinking, gluesniffing from jogging. heroin from carrots and cocaine fromcolas." It is not that Dr. Robinson and other scientists supported bytobacco companies disagree with the main points made bymainstream scientists. but that they define addictiondifferently. Dr. Robinson says intoxication that ispsychologically debilitating is the major defining trait of anaddicting substance. It is a feature that was part of standarddefinitions of the 1950's, and is still linked to popular ideasabout addiction, but which experts now say is too simplistic andhas been left behind as scientific evidence accumulates.

The drug problem in our society is clearly one which is veryserious and which concerns all Americans. Although substanceabuse cuts across all class and racial lines, the impact of thedrug problem has probably been greatest among lowincome andminority communities. In my testimony today, I would like tofocus in particular on the impact of the war on drugs as itaffects Black and Hispanic communities. YOUNG BLACK MEN AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM In February of this year, my organization released a reporton race and the criminal justice system. The report, "YoungBlack Men and the Criminal Justice System: A Growing NationalProblem," received extensive attention and shocked much ofthe nation. The report documented that almost one out of fourBlack men in the age group 2029 is under the control of thecriminal justice system prison, jail, probation or parole. Thiscontrasts with one in sixteen white males and one in ten Hispanicmales. These figures for Black males, shocking as they are, actuallyunderstate the extent of the problem since our study only did aoneday count of the criminal justice system. If we were able tocalculate the rates for an entire year, or tenyear period, thenumber of Black males under criminal justice control would beconsiderably higher than one in four. There is also strong reason to believe that the figures forHispanics represent an undercount. There has been a great deal ofinconsistency in the way in which Hispanics are counted incriminal justice populations, and for many categories, thereexist a large number of offenders for whom no data exist onethnicity. Because of this, it is reasonable to conclude that therate of criminal justice control for young Hispanic males ishigher than one in ten. Also, since Hispanics are counted in thewhite criminal justice populations, the rate of criminal justicecontrol for non-Hispanic whites is therefore less than the one insixteen which we were able to document. Our report further found that the number of young Black men inthe criminal justice system 609,690 far exceeded the number ofBlack men of all ages enrolled in higher education 436,000. Thesetwo figures taken together paint a very disturbing picture. As we noted in our report: For the Black community in general, nearly onefourth of its youngmen are under the control of the criminal justice system at atime when their peers are beginning families, learningconstructive life skills, and starting careers....Unless thecriminal justice system can be used to assist more young Blackmales in pursuing these objectives, any potential positivecontributions they can make to the community will be delayed, orlost forever. Our report estimated that the direct costs to the criminaljustice system for the control of the 609,000 Black men in theirtwenties was $2.5 billion. Each offender who is incarcerated in astate prison costs the taxpayers at least $16,000 a year.Corrections costs have now reached the point where they arehaving a serious impact on state funding for necessary socialservices. In Michigan, for example, state spending forcorrections increased from 2.8 percent of the budget in 1984 to7.2 percent in 1988. The National Conference of State Legislatorsreports that state spending on corrections increased by anaverage of 14.2 percent last year, contributing to "seriousbudget problems" that more than half the states will face in1990. WHY ARE SO MANY YOUNG BLACK MALES UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM? It is important to analyze the factors which have led us tothis distressing situation. The reasons behind this are complex.Many are longstanding problems; others are a result of morerecent criminal justice policies. I would like to outline some ofthe primary causes of this problem, and then to discuss theimpact which the war on drugs has had. 1. "Get Tough" Sentencing Policies The U.S. Sentencing Commission and legislatures in almost allfifty states have adopted a variety of increasingly harshsentencing laws in the past decade. In addition, parole releasepolicies have become more restrictive in many states. Thecombined impact of these policies is that our prison and jailpopulations have doubled in the past decade, to the point wherethere are now more than one million Americans behind bars.Prisons in 41 states are under court order regarding overcrowdingand conditions of confinement. Record numbers of offenders arenow also straining our probation and parole systems. Mandatory minimum drug sentencing laws have played a significantrole in leading to these higher rates of criminal justicecontrol, particularly in regard to prison populations. Two recenthighly publicized cases illustrate this: The American Lawyer reported on the case of Susana SanchezRobles, a migrant worker and mother of five whose husband hadleft her, leaving the family on welfare. Ms. Sanchez Robles drovea drug laden van across the border from Mexico, and received amandatory ten year prison term. Her five year old cries everyevening. Says Ms. Sanchez Robles: "I try to feel strong, butmy strength is just totally defeated when I remember my children. Richard Winrow is a 22year old Los Angeles man who was abandonedby his father as a boy. He and his seven siblings grew up poor,and Winrow ended up dropping out of high school and working atlow wage jobs. A recent conviction for possession of 5 1/2 ouncesof cocaine, a relatively small amount, was his third drugoffense. Under new federal drug laws, Winrow was sentenced tolife without the possibility of parole. The dramatic increases in incarceration, parole and probationrates resulting from our "get tough" policies haveaffected all segments of society. The increase, however, has beenmost significant for Blacks and other minorities, who werealready disproportionately represented in the system. The rise in criminal justice populations has occurred without anyclearcut relationship to the crime rate. FBI reports for the pastdecade indicate that crime rates have had periods of both declineand increase during these years, but that overall there was onlya 2 percent increase in crime rates between 197988. Crime ratesrose again in 1989, even though the nation recorded the highestincrease ever in its prison population. 2. Criminal Justice Focus on Crimes of the Poor The criminal justice system has historically been focusedmuch more on "crime in the streets" than "crime inthe suites." Although we have seen some change in recentyears in the prosecution of white collar offenses, crimes of thepoor have always received greater attention from the criminaljustice system. Since Blacks and Hispanics are disproportionatelyrepresented among lowincome people, this has contributed to theirover-representation in the criminal justice system. This does notimply that crimes of the poor are necessarily either more or lessserious than crimes of the wealthy, but rather, that we have asystem that functions at least in part in a very discretionarymanner. 3. Race and the Criminal Justice System There has been a good deal of debate about the extent towhich race influences criminal justice decisionmaking. A recentstudy by the RAND Corporation concludes that race was not afactor in sentencing decisions in California. It is important tonote, though, that California has a relatively rigid determinatesentencing system, which allows for less variability insentencing outcomes than in many other states. Our report found evidence that the criminal justice system may betreating Black offenders differently than white offenders. Thenumber of young white males who are incarcerated, 247,000,slightly exceeds the number of incarcerated Black males, 212,000.The number of white males receiving probation, though, 697,000,vastly exceeds the figure for Black males, 305,000. While thenature of the offense or prior criminal history may explain thesefigures, a close examination of this disparity should beundertaken to determine to what extent racial bias is a factor. As the authors of the RAND study point out, as well as manyothers, race may play a more prominent role at the level ofarrest and prosecution, where greater discretion may be exercisedby police and prosecutors. This discretion may not always beracially motivated, but it may have a racial impact. To theextent that this is the case, a task for the courts is to attemptto offset any disparity that may have occurred throughappropriate sentencing. 4. Declining Social and Economic Support in Black Communities The relationship between social and economic conditions andindividual crime rates is a complex one. Not all poor people orunemployed people commit crimes, nor do all wealthy or employedpersons refrain from committing crimes. Personality traits,family support, community constraints, and other factors allinfluence individual behavior and the propensity to commit crime. Yet, as criminologist Elliott Currie has noted, "Theevidence for a strong association between inequality and crime isoverwhelming ... It isn't accidental, then, that among developedcountries, the United States is afflicted simultaneously with theworst rates of violent crime, the widest spread of incomeinequality, and the most severe public policies toward thedisadvantaged." The stresses, strains, and lack of opportunity present in so manyminority communities increase the likelihood that individualswithin that community will engage in criminal activities, whetheras a means of obtaining money, to support a drug habit, for achallenge, or for other reasons. Given these factors, we need to look at the deteriorating socialand economic support in the Black community. Essentially, we findthat on a broad range of variables, the situation of Blacks inour society has declined over the past decade. The Center onBudget and Policy Priorities reports that total appropriationsfor low income programs that are not entitlements fell by 54percent from FY 81 to FY 88, when adjusted for inflation. Thisincluded support for job training, health and social services,and housing programs. Also, although the number of Americansliving below the poverty line increased by 3.2 million duringthis period, spending for food stamps decreased by 15 percentwhen adjusted for inflation. Black households make up 36 percentof all households receiving food stamps. Overall, these cutsaffect Blacks and other minorities disproportionately, since theyare disproportionately poor. 5. Lack of Opportunity and Sense of Hopelessness An additional factor contributing to this situation is themost difficult to quantify, yet in some ways the mostsignificant. In many communities today, young people growing uphave little hope for the future. It is one thing for a collegestudent to work at a fast food restaurant as a summer job. It isentirely different for a young person to take on this kind of jobwhen there is little expectation of rising above this entrylevel. The numbers in our report were not as shocking to most people inthe Black community. Instead, they confirmed what many haverecognized for years: for Black males, the criminal justicesystem has become almost an inevitable aspect of growing up. Thisis not to say that it is a "rite of passage," or anevent that is welcomed, but merely, that it is viewed as a partof the life cycle which is almost unavoidable. This is a very sadcommentary on our society. THE "WAR ON DRUGS" AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM A final factor contributing to increased involvement in thecriminal justice system, particularly among Black Americans, isthe war on drugs, and the means by which this war is being waged.This has been the result of two factors. First, the drug problem has been defined basically as a lawenforcement problem, and not a social problem. In terms of ourpolitical rhetoric, our funding priorities, and our policydiscussions, we have primarily chosen an approach whichemphasizes police and prisons over prevention and treatment. Thisis not a new approach, or one which Mr. Bennett's office hasinitiated unilaterally. Most states and localities have takenthis approach for many years, with unfortunately, little impacton either drug use, availability, or drug related crime. Second, although drug use and abuse occurs among all groups insociety, drug law enforcement is disproportionately weightedtoward inner city, low income drug use, again primarily affectingBlacks and Hispanics. A few statistics illustrate this problem.FBI data indicate that Blacks make up an increasing percentage ofdrug arrests, having increased from 30 to 38 percent of the totalbetween 1984 and 1988. According to the National Institute onDrug Abuse, Blacks make up only 12 percent of those who useillegal drugs. In Florida, Blacks now make up 73.3 percent of all prisonadmissions for drug offenses, compared to 53.6 percent for allother offenses. If the war on drugs continues in its present fashion, our prisonswill become increasingly filled with Black youth. The plight ofyoung Black men and the Black community which we described in ourreport will only worsen. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS I do not believe that the large number of Black males withinthe criminal justice system necessarily represents an intendedconsequence of our crime control policies. Unfortunately,however, as an unintended consequence of scores ofindividual sentencing laws, use of discretion in the criminaljustice system, and funding priorities, we have created a truecrisis for the Black community, for the criminal justice system,and for a nation that hopes to provide freedom and opportunityfor all citizens. A continuation of the war on drugs in themanner in which it has been fought, no matter how well intended,will only exacerbate this situation. If we wish to address this problem in a serious manner,policymakers and criminal justice leaders need to respond in acomprehensive manner. Elements of such a strategy include: 1. Increase Diversion from the Criminal Justice System Many young and minor offenders are only stigmatized by theircontact with the criminal justice system, without necessarilyreceiving either appropriate supervision or support.Opportunities exist to divert many of these offenders toorganizations and individuals who can better focus on theproblems of Black, Hispanic, and poor youth. As a result of our report, for example, Black community leadersin Memphis have formed a chapter of the 100 Black MenIncorporated. The group's goal is to reduce the number of Blackmen going into the criminal justice system. Its activities willinclude establishing mentor programs, developing mechanisms forkeeping Black youth in school, and working with young offendersin the juvenile justice system. Policymakers can encourage development of programs such as these,and court officials can divert more defendants into them, therebybeginning to reduce the extent of criminal justice control inmany communities. 2. Sentencing to Ameliorate Racial Disparities Judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and probation officersall have a unique and important opportunity to lessen the drasticimpact which the justice system has had on Blacks and Hispanics.That opportunity comes at the time of sentencing. The courtroomsentencing process should include a full examination of thecircumstances of both victim and offender, and an analysis ofcommunity support and supervision mechanisms which may be able tocontribute to appropriate sentencing options. The goals of thisprocess should be several: to assess public safety concerns; torestore victims to the extent possible; to order appropriate andconstructive sanctions in the community; and, to reduce thechances that offenders will return to the system. As anorganization familiar with sentencing programs and sentencingreform efforts throughout the country, our staff knows that theseare attainable goals. Court officials should also establish mechanisms to monitorwhether minority offenders are appropriately represented innon-incarcerative sentencing alternatives, such as communitycorrections programs, house arrest, and electronic monitoring. Ifdisparities exist, an analysis of the reasons for this should beundertaken. In the juvenile justice area, The National Council ofJuvenile and Family Court Judges is currently developing policyrecommendations to respond to the disproportionate incarcerationof minority youth. These may serve as a model which could beadopted for the criminal justice system. 3. Restore Appropriate Judicial Discretion White collar offenders such as Ivan Boesky and Oliver Northreceive a full consideration of appropriate sentencing options.For many of the indigent defendants filling up our nation'sprisons, mandatory and guideline sentencing virtually prohibitany consideration of alternative sentencing options. Abuse ofjudicial discretion needs to be carefully monitored, but use ofjudicial discretion to respond to individual and community needsat sentencing should be encouraged. 4. Encourage Courts to Make Greater Use of Alternatives toIncarceration Incarceration is by far the most costly component of thecriminal justice system. It has also not proved to be veryproductive as a means of reducing crime. A variety of communitybased sanctions exist which have been demonstrated to beappropriate punishments for a wide range of offenders. Theseinclude restitution to victims, community service work, intensiveprobation supervision, and provisions for treatment programs,education, and employment. My organization, The Sentencing Project, has helped develop manyprograms that offer courts alternatives to prison in a range ofcases, and we have seen courts accept these alternatives in wellover half the cases presented. We know that judges can and willmake more use of alternatives, if given the opportunity to do soat sentencing. 5. Reduce Lengthy and Inefficient Prison Terms Mandatory sentencing laws and lengthier prison terms haveresulted in high costs, with only relatively modest gains incrime control. Prisoners are prevented from committing crimes inthe community while they are locked up, but this represents onlya small fraction of all crimes. A 1978 report by the NationalAcademy of Sciences concluded that to achieve a 10 percentreduction in crime, New York would have had to increase itsprison population by 263 percent and Massachusetts by 310percent. The massive increase in incarceration and lengthening of prisonterms provides almost no long term benefits in reduction ofrecidivism. The most recent Justice Department study of thisissue shows that recidivism rates, while very high, are virtuallyidentical for prisoners who serve anywhere from one to fiveyears. Therefore, "getting tough" results in highcorrections costs, but leaves us with offenders who are no lesslikely to commit future crimes. Reducing lengthy prison terms by itself is not the answer tocrime. What it would accomplish though, is to relieve the burdenon an overcrowded system, to reduce the impact of the system onminorities, and to free up tax dollars to be used for prevention,a more effective means of crime control. 6. Require Racial/Ethnic Impact Statements from the Office ofNational Drug Control Policy Given the serious impact of drugs and the drug war onminority communities, I would suggest that the Office of NationalDrug Control Policy be required to submit an annual report on theimpact of its policies and funding priorities on racial andethnic communities. Such a report might include the degree towhich funding is made available to minority communities andorganizations, the impact of prosecution and incarceration onthese communities, and the number of persons receiving drugtreatment services. This type of analysis would help to provide afocus for policy considerations regarding minority communities. 7. Develop More Accurate Reporting Methods for Hispanics As noted above, there is reason to believe that Hispanics areundercounted in the criminal justice system due toinconsistencies in reporting methods and lack of data. It isimportant to develop policies and procedures that are consistentnationwide in order to assess the impact of criminal justicepolicies on Hispanic communities, and to enable the criminaljustice system to respond more appropriately to its variedpopulations. 8. Restore a Balanced Perspective on the Relative Role ofCriminal Justice Sanctions and Social and Economic Supports The criminal justice system does not necessarily provide thebest forum for reducing crime. As the American Bar AssociationCriminal Justice Section's Special Committee on Criminal Justicein a Free Society reported, of approximately 34 million seriouscrimes committed against persons or property in 1988, 31 millionnever resulted in arrest and only several hundred thousandresulted in felony convictions and imprisonment. Simply put, lawenforcement and court officials could, under the best ofconditions, effectively prosecute and punish only a small portionof overall criminal activity. Our continued excessive emphasis on a law enforcement strategy tofight drugs fails to address the root causes of the drug problem.Our emphasis on punitive criminal justice remedies distracts usfrom more fundamental and potentially far-reaching questions: whyis it that citizens of one of the wealthiest nations and of allsocial classes use illegal substances to the extent thatAmericans do today? For inner city and low income communities, these root causes arecertainly more closely tied to poverty, lack of opportunity, pooreducation and health care, and lack of hope for the future, thanto any lack of jail and prison cells. At the same time we have been waging a law enforcement war, withits own negative effects upon young Black males, conditions forBlack communities have worsened on other fronts as well. A newstudy by the National Center for Children in Poverty of ColumbiaUniversity documents that half of Black children and 40 percentof Hispanic children under the age of six now live in poverty. Itshould be clear to those of us within the criminal justice systemas well as others, that unless we effectively address issues ofpoverty immediately, we are likely to see the next generation ofBlack males enter the criminal justice system at a rate evenhigher than one in four. We have a choice. We can spend money on prisons, and on policiesthat are guaranteed to fill them with people who don't need to bein them, including many young Black men, or we can spendmore time, energy, creativity and money to keep more people outof the system entirely. Funding for poverty-fighting,crime-preventing programs should be viewed from the long-termperspective, as a preventive measure which will reduce criminaljustice costs in the future. CONCLUSION Of the scores of editorials which appeared in response to ourreport (see Appendix) almost all uniformly endorsed the range ofpolicy recommendations I have suggested here. This reaction showsthat the public may be much more ready for change than manypolicymakers have led us to believe. The funding and policy decisions we make today regarding ourapproach to the drug problem will have a direct impact on thenext generation of Black men. As an editorial in the Charleston(S.C.) Post/Courier noted, "If the festering cycle ofpoverty, violence and hate is not broken, more black men will bedoomed to lives of crime and years behind bars."

AMERICANS BEHIND BARS: THE INTERNATIONAL USE OF INCARCERATION, 1992-93 OVERVIEW Interest in international comparisons on the use of incarcerationhas increased in recent years. From the Singapore caning ofMichael Fay to changes in the use of prisons in eastern Europe tothe use of prison labor in China, attention has focused on theways in which nations utilize different sentencing policies. In recent years, we have issued two prior reports comparinginternational rates of incarceration. These reports documentedthat the United States had become the world leader in its rate ofincarceration, having surpassed South Africa and the formerSoviet Union, and that the black male rate of incarceration inthe U.S. far exceeded that of black males in South Africa. We now look again at these issues, in what is the mostcomprehensive survey to date on international rates ofincarceration. The main findings of this report are thefollowing: � Russia has now surpassed the United States to become the worldleader in its rate of incarceration, with 558 citizens per100,000 population in its prison system. The rise of organizedcrime, political instability, and the transition to an uncertaineconomic future have all played a factor in crime rates and theuse of imprisonment. � With 1.3 million Americans behind bars, the U.S. rate ofincarceration is 519 per 100,000, second in the world among the52 nations covered in this survey. The U.S. rate has increased by22 percent since 1989, and is generally 5-8 times the rate ofmost industrialized nations. � A racial breakdown of the U.S. inmate population shows thatAfrican-Americans are incarcerated at a rate that is more thansix times that of whites -- 1,947 per 100,000, compared to 306per 100,000. � Black males in the U.S. are incarcerated at more than fourtimes the rate of black males in South Africa -- 3,822 per100,000 versus 851 per 100,000. � The cost of incarceration nationally in the U.S. is estimatedat $26.8 billion annually. Estimated costs of incarceration forAfrican-American males are $11.6 billion annually. � The number of AfricanAmerican males in prisons and jails inthe U.S. 583,000 is greater than the number of AfricanAmericanmales enrolled in higher education 537,000. � Drug, property and public order offenders accounted for 84percent of the 155 percent increase in new court commitments tostate prison from 1980 to 1992, while violent offenders accountedfor only 16 percent of the increase. As we have stated in past reports, a nation's rate ofincarceration in itself only describes one aspect of its criminaljustice or social policies. For example, a nation with a highrate of incarceration might have a high rate of crime, a harshsentencing system, a politically repressive government, or somecombination of these and other factors. Similarly, one cannotassume that nations with low incarceration rates necessarily havelow crime rates or are respectful of civil liberties. Forexample, the cost of largescale incarceration is prohibitive formany Third World nations, so they maintain a low imprisonmentrate. Other nations maintain a relatively low incarceration rate,yet have brutal conditions of confinement. In Zaire, for example,although the incarceration rate is a relatively modest 88 per100,000, it has been reported that nearly 7.5 percent of theinmates in the prison system die each year due to malnutritionand poor health care. With these cautions in mind, we look at the dramatically highrate of incarceration in the United States and attempt to assessthe factors that have created the anomaly of one of thewealthiest nations in the world sharing the unenviable positionof incarceration leader with its former Cold War rival Russia.Whatever the mix of crime rates, criminal justice policies, orsocial policies that have led to this situation, the rate ofincarceration in the United States is so much higher than incomparable nations that it requires a close examination of thevarious causal factors. Given the renewed "law andorder" climate in the country, we also examine theanticipated impact of newlyadopted legislation and conclude withrecommendations for what we believe would be a more rationalcriminal justice policy.

Forcomparative purposes, estimates of the use of incarceration bythe Soviet Union in 1989 ranged from 268 to 353 per 100,000. A variety of factors have led to the increased use ofincarceration in Russia. News accounts have discussed the rise oforganized crime, coming at a time of much economic and politicalinstability. As the country moves toward a market economy, thesocial disruption and loss of a limited social "safetynet" for some may contribute to higher crime rates. It hasbeen reported that during the first quarter of 1994, there was anaverage of 84 murders a day in Russia, a per capita rate that isabout double that of the U.S. The use of the prison system forpolitical prisoners, both in the past and at present, is an issuefor which there are few precise figures. The State Department hasalso reported that because the court system does not have theresources to handle the increasing number of arrests, defendantsare often held in pretrial detention for more than a year withoutjudicial review. While comparative data are not readily available, some reportsindicate that the high rate of incarceration in Russia may be ingood part a result of harsher sentencing practices than othernations, and not primarily differences in crime rates. Comparingprison populations and sentencing practices in Russia to Englandand Wales, Roy D. King concluded that "it would seem thatmany offenders are swept into the prison system for much moretrivial offences, for much longer periods, and at much earlierpoints in their criminal careers [in Russia] than would be thecase in Britain." The rate of incarceration in South Africa continues to remain farabove that of most other nations as well, at 368 per 100,000population. It should be noted that these figures are from theend of 1993, prior to the historic change of government in 1994.Therefore, it is too early to know what changes, if any, will beinstituted by the new government. One early indication of apossible direction was a reduction of almost all prison sentencesby six months following a nationwide series of prisondisturbances in June, 1994. In a number of European countries, though not all, incarcerationrates have been rising in recent years. In the Netherlands, longconsidered a leader in the limited use of incarceration, the rateof incarceration doubled during the 1980s. Even with thisincrease, however, the country's current rate of 49 per 100,000still places it at onetenth the U.S. rate and far below mostindustrialized nations. Comparing data for 1989 from our first report, we find thatItaly's rate of incarceration increased by 33 percent in theperiod 198992, while Austria, Spain, and Switzerland registeredgains in the 1416 percent range, and France and Denmark werevirtually unchanged. In the U.S., which was the world leader in 1989, incarcerationrates have increased by 22 percent from 426 per 100,000 in 1989to 519 per 100,000 for 199293. Thus, the rate of incarceration inthe U.S. is approximately five to eight times the rate of Canadaand most European nations. With a total of 1.3 million inmates inthe U.S., at an estimated annual cost of incarceration of $20,000a year, the national cost of imprisonment in the U.S. isapproximately $26.8 billion. Costs of incarceration for the583,000 incarcerated African-American males are estimated at$11.6 billion annually. As has been seen in previous reports, the rate of incarcerationfor African-American males is a major component of the high U.S.rates.

It would appear logical in many respects to assume that ahigh rate of incarceration is a direct response to high crimerates. In recent years, though, many criminologists andpolicymakers have concluded that imprisonment rates are to agreat degree a function of criminal justice and social policiesthat either encourage or discourage the use of incarceration. Thecurrent wave of "Three Strikes and You're Out"proposals illustrates this well. States that have passed suchlegislation will soon experience an increase in their prisonpopulations of varying degrees depending on the scope of thelegislation. While one can debate whether or not these policiesare appropriate or will have an impact on crime, it is clear thatconscious policy choices are creating a higher rate ofimprisonment. We can see this as well by comparing incarceration rates amongthe states, where we find that a state's use of imprisonment isnot necessarily directly related to its crime rate. For example,while Louisiana had the nation's highest rate of incarceration in1992 and also had a high crime rate (fifth in the nation),Oklahoma was third in its imprisonment rate despite being just21st in its crime rate. At the other end of the spectrum, North Dakota was lowest in thenation in both crime and incarceration rates, but Mississippi was40th nationally in its rate of incarceration despite having the16th highest crime rate. Decisions made by legislators andcriminal justice officials, including sentencing legislation,parole policies, and the availability of sentencing options andcommunity resources, all play a role in determining incarcerationrates. In the following sections, we examine several factors that mightbe thought to contribute to the high rate of incarceration in theUnited States. These include: - overall crime rates - violent crime rates - severity of sentencing policies - cultural attitudes toward punishment Does the United States Have a High Rate of IncarcerationBecause of Higher Crime Rates Than Other Nations? As we have seen, high incarceration rates can be a functionof high crime rates, criminal justice policies, or socialpolicies in other areas that influence crime. Some personscontend that the United States has a high rate of incarcerationdue to its high rate of crime or violent crime rate, compared toother nations. Although there are a number of methodological problems involvedin comparing crime and incarceration rates among nations,criminologists have attempted to study this issue in a variety ofways. A recent survey of this issue looked at whetherincarceration rates in six industrialized nations (England andWales, West Germany, France, New Zealand, Netherlands, andSweden) could be explained by national crime rates. Theconclusion was that "only a small measure of the differencesin prison population between one jurisdiction and another or thechanges in prison populations within particular jurisdictionsseem to be related to crime rates." Further, the assumption that crime rates are substantially higherin the U.S. than in other industrialized nations is not true formost offenses. A comprehensive survey of victimization rates inthe industrialized world conducted by the Dutch Ministry ofJustice documented that rates of property crime and someassaultive crimes in the U.S. are not significantly differentthan in many comparable nations. The twenty nation survey foundthat four nations (New Zealand, Netherlands, Canada, andAustralia) exceeded the U.S. rate of victimization for the elevencrimes surveyed, including robbery, burglary, and car theft.Among individual offenses, the survey found that burglary ratesin the U.S. were exceeded by New Zealand, Czechoslovakia,Australia, and Canada; that England, Australia, and New Zealandhad higher rates of car theft; and that five nations(Czechoslovakia, Poland, Australia, Canada, and West Germany) hadhigher rates of sexual assault against women. The victimization survey also confirms that the commission of acrime is to a certain extent a result of opportunity. Forexample, car theft rates are highest in countries whereautomobile ownership is high (such as the U.S., Australia, andEngland), while bicycle thefts also correlate with high ownershiprates (as in the Netherlands and Sweden). Similarly, burglaryrates are highest in countries with a significant proportion ofsemidetached or detached homes (including the U.S., Poland,England, and Australia). These findings have implications forcrime prevention, such as making greater use of mass transit. The data on crime victimization overall, therefore, does notprovide an explanation for the high incarceration rate in theU.S. While it remains possible that crime rates account for partof the difference in rates of incarceration, the magnitude of thedifference between the U.S. and other nations is so great thatoverall crime rates cannot account for the disparity. Do Rates of Violent Crime Explain the High Rate ofIncarceration in the U.S.? Looking at rates of violent crime, we see sharperdistinctions between the U.S. and most industrialized nations, inlarge part due to the role of firearms in U.S. crime rates. Ratesof assault and murder with firearms are far higher in the U.S.than in comparable nations, with murder rates in the U.S.generally five to ten times the rate of most European nations.Since a violent offender is generally more likely to beincarcerated upon conviction than a nonviolent offender, a higherviolent crime rate would be expected to result in a higherimprisonment rate. We do not have sufficient data to analyze the relativeproportions of violent and nonviolent offenders in other prisonsystems, or to assess how they compare to the U.S. in thisregard. What is available, though, is information regarding theincrease in the American prison population in recent years.Examining these data demonstrates that the substantial rise inthe inmate population since 1980 was not primarily due toincarceration of violent offenders. As seen in Table 4 below, data from the Bureau of JusticeStatistics show that new court commitments to state prisonincreased by 155 percent from 1980 to 1992. A breakdown of thisincrease, though, shows that violent offenders accounted for only16 percent of this increase, with the remaining 84 percent beingdue to increased incarceration of drug and property offenders andpersons convicted of public order offenses. Thus, while it may betrue that part of the explanation for high incarceration rates inthe U.S. is due to higher rates of violent crime, this is clearlynot the primary factor behind the unprecedented increase in theprison population that we have seen in recent years.

Are Sentencing Policies in the U.S. Harsher Than in OtherNations? Another way to explore this issue is to examine relativesentences in different nations for convicted offenders. Those whocontend that the high rate of incarceration in the U.S. isprimarily a product of high crime rates suggest that a comparisonof sentencing policies is necessary in order to ascertain whetherthe U.S. is more punitive than other nations on a per crimebasis. The evidence on this issue is somewhat mixed, but does notnecessarily support the contention that high crime rates are thesole explanation for the high rate of incarceration in the U.S. A 1987 study conducted by the Justice Department examinedimprisonment decisions for the crimes of burglary, robbery, andtheft in the U.S. compared with Canada, England, and the formerWest Germany. The study found that the chances of receiving aprison term for an arrest on these offenses was roughlycomparable in the U.S., Canada, and England, but lower,particularly for theft, in West Germany. A key issue that was notaddressed in the study, though, was comparative length ofsentence. It is possible, for example, that while convictedoffenders in the U.S. are sentenced to prison atcomparable rates to these two other nations, sentence lengthsin the U.S. may be longer or shorter than in other countries. In fact, European comparisons by Young and Brown found thatsentence length was in fact a more critical variable than prisonadmissions in determining prison populations. In looking at theNetherlands and Sweden, both of which have low rates ofincarceration, they concluded that the rate of sentencing toprisons was comparable to other nations, but that shorter averagesentences accounted for the difference in incarceration rates. One of the few studies that have attempted to compare the U.S.with other nations, although with some methodologicallimitations, came to the conclusion that U.S. sentencingpractices were in fact more severe. In an examination ofsentencing practices in the U.S. and France, Richard Frase lookedat whether crime rates, and particularly violent crime, couldexplain the substantial difference in incarceration rates betweenthe two nations. His conclusion was that even controlling fordifferences in crime rates, American sentencing severity the useof prison as a sentence and the length of prison sentences wasalmost twice as high as in France. (By a somewhat moreconservative estimation technique, Frase still estimated thatAmerican sentencing severity was about 50 percent greater than inFrance.) One limitation of the U.S. studies is that they analyze data fromthe early 1980s. Sentencing patterns in the U.S. have changedsubstantially since that time, with there now being a greaterlikelihood of incarceration for many offenses. Bureau of JusticeStatistics data show that for every 1,000 arrests, the commitmentrate to state prison has increased by 6 percent for robbery, 29percent for aggravated assault, 49 percent for burglary, andfully 447 percent for drugs from 1980 to 1992. For drug offensesin particular, the length of imprisonment is also increasing inmany jurisdictions due to the impact of mandatory sentencinglaws. While we do not have data describing sentencing trends inother nations during this period, the changes in U.S. drug policyin particular suggest that the incarceration differential withother nations may continue to increase for some period of time. A Cross-National Look at Sentence Length If in fact sentence length is a key variable in understandingrelative rates of incarceration, then the question is whydifferent nations impose varying degrees of sentence length onoffenders. Recent research in this area, analyzed by Warren Youngand Mark Brown, provides some provocative conclusions. Afterreviewing explanations for harsher sentencing policies that lookat issues such as unemployment rates and public policy decisions,they conclude that these do not provide sufficient correlationsfor crossnational distinctions. They find instead that the mostsubstantial explanation lies in the cultural attitudes of asociety; that is, what most people would consider the"right" punishment. Attitudes toward punishment tend to be shared within a societyand affect decisionmaking regarding the harshness of sentencing.But why are some nations more punitive than others? Research byWilkins and Pease suggests that "a society's penal climateor its relative punitiveness is linked to its relativeegalitarianism: the greater a society's tolerance of inequality,the more extreme the scale of punishment utilized." Thus,sentencing severity is a type of negative reward for those at oneend of the spectrum, compared to the positive rewards of incomeand status. A society like the United States, therefore, premisedon a strong degree of individualism and with greater disparity ofwealth than most industrialized nations, will be more likely todisplay harsher cultural attitudes toward sentencing policy thana nation with a broader social welfare system. The implications of this analysis are quite profound, for itsuggests that changes in criminal justice policy alone will noteliminate the differential in international rates ofincarceration. This is not to deny the importance of changes incriminal justice policy, which can have a significant impact forsentencing of many offenders. The analysis tells us, though, thatif a society is committed to lowering its rate of incarceration,either on fiscal or moral grounds, an overall reevaluation ofcultural attitudes and values that determine sentencing policyneeds to be initiated. Summary: Toward an Understanding of Crime and Incarceration What can we conclude from this assessment of crime rates andincarceration? Several key themes emerge: 1. Crime rates for most property crimes and some assaultiveoffenses in the U.S. are not significantly greater than for otherindustrialized nations, and therefore are not a major explanationfor the high rate of incarceration in the U.S. 2. Higher rates of violent crime in the U.S. are responsible forat least part of the nation's high incarceration rate compared toother nations. The dramatic increase in the prison populationsince 1980, though, was not primarily a result of sentencinggreater numbers of violent offenders, since violent offendersrepresented only 16 percent of the increase in court commitmentsfrom 1980 to 1992. 3. The impact of the "war on drugs" has beenresponsible for much of the increase in the prison population,with 46 percent of new court commitments since 1980 being due todrug offenses. 4. Crossnational comparisons of rates of incarceration suggestthat the length of prison sentences, rather than the number ofpersons sentenced to prison is the main determinant of differingrates of incarceration. Thus, alternatives to incarceration mayhave some impact on lowering a jurisdiction's incarceration rate,but this will generally be of less magnitude than alteringsentence lengths. 5. Once prisons are built, they are in many respects aselfperpetuating entity. Prisons are constructed to last for50100 years and their continued use over time contributes to aculture that makes their use seem logical and rational. While fewpersons would argue with the necessity for a certain level ofimprisonment in society, it is far from clear that incarcerationis the only, or best, means of either preventing or controllingcrime. A broad range of policies both within and outside thecriminal justice system exist to accomplish these objectives, anddifferent nations make use of these resources to varying degrees.Unless incarceration is examined in this context, policymakerswill be confronted with a set of crime control options that ismuch more restrictive than necessary. WHAT HAS BEEN THE IMPACT OF INCREASED INCARCERATION ON CRIME? While there are a variety of reasons why judges sentenceoffenders to prison, the underlying goal is to reduce crime,whether accomplished through incapacitation, deterrence, orrehabilitation in prison. Given the enormous increase in the useof imprisonment in the past two decades, along with heightenedpublic concern about crime, it is critical to examine the effectthese policies have had on public safety. There is a small body of opinion, generally represented by theNational Rifle Association and its allies, that contends that theprison buildup of the 1980s had a dramatic effect on crime ratesand that "Incarceration works." This assertion turnsout to be based on serious distortions of criminal justice data.The NRA claims, for example, that the 150 percent increase inincarceration from 1980 to 1991 led to a 24 percent drop in"serious victimization." Upon closer examination,however, the NRA definition of "serious victimization"includes violent crimes, but also the nonviolent crime ofburglary, one of the FBI's seven Index offenses. While burglaryrates did decline during the 1980s their inclusion with violentcrimes distorts actual trends. Had the NRA included the Indexoffense of auto theft rather than burglary in its calculations,the results would have been very different, since auto theftvictimization increased by 33 percent during this period. Lookingonly at violent crime, we find that the more than doubling of theprison population paralleled a 4 percent decline in violent crimeduring this period. The "relationship" claimed by the NRA also turns out tobe one that is not consistent over time. By breaking down crimeand incarceration into two periods, 198086 and 198691, as seenbelow in Tables 5 and 6, we find that incarceration rates rose by65 percent and violent crime declined by 16 percent in the firstperiod, but that from 1986 to 1991, despite the fact thatimprisonment rose 51 percent, violent crime also increased, by 15percent. Clearly, no cause and effect relationship can bediscerned here.

What about crime rates overall, though, in addition to violentcrime? Here, too, we see no consistent impact. Some crimes, suchas burglary and larceny, have declined steadily since 1980.Others, such as auto theft, have increased significantly. Onemeasure of crime's impact on society is the financial harmsuffered by victims. In this regard, the increase in auto thefthas been far more costly, since the median loss to victims($3,600) is substantially greater than for victims of burglary orlarceny ($50 and $55 respectively). Again, any overall positivegains in crime control are difficult to discern. More sophisticated studies, such as those of Patrick A. Langan,have attempted to look at this issue as well, and have suggestedthat increased incarceration may have had some impact on crimerates. Yet in a comparative study of the use of incarceration inEngland and the United States he concludes that "Existingevidence does not suggest that crime can be dramatically reducedsimply by putting more offenders behind bars," and that"modest reductions in crime may be possible, but major andlasting reductions probably will require social interventiontechniques, such as parent training or preschool intellectualenrichment programs." Two other issues bear on this relationship as well. First, as wehave noted in previous reports, demographic issues play asignificant role in crime rates, since young males producedisproportionately high rates of crime. As criminologists DarrellSteffensmeier and Miles Harer have noted, most of the change incrime rates in the period 198088 can be explained by changes inthe proportion of the population in the age group 1524. Second, the impact of drug crimes and arrests adds anotherdimension to this analysis, since drug offenses are not coveredas part of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, or what isgenerally described as the "crime rate." Since thereare no data on the number of drug crimes that are committed, wecan only look to statistics on drug arrests for general trends,where we find that drug arrests doubled during the 1980s. Someexperts have speculated that the decline in some offenses such asburglary during this period may represent a shift in crimepatterns from burglary to lowlevel drug dealing, and notnecessarily an overall reduction in criminal activity. Finally, some advocates of increased incarceration contend thathad the large buildup of the prison population not taken place,crime rates would have been even higher than they already are.This type of speculation can be neither proved nor disproved, butif one believes that crime would have increased, then there musthave been some specific factors causing this. They may haveincluded poverty, drug abuse, poor education, and familybreakdown, among others. Addressing these problems should havemore of an impact on crime than continuing to expand the prisonpopulation. WHY HASN'T INCARCERATION HAD MORE IMPACT ON CRIME? Common sense would tell us that locking up offenders shouldhave an impact on crime. Certainly, some offenders areincapacitated or deterred through incarceration. What seemssurprising at first, though, is the relatively limited nature ofthis impact, particularly given the massive use of incarcerationin the United States. An examination of three key issues indemographics and criminal justice processing, though, reveals whythe prison system has such a modest impact on crime: 1. The "Criminal Justice Funnel" First, the criminal justice system operates as a"funnel." At the top of the funnel are all the crimesthat are committed, and at the bottom, the number of offenderssentenced to prison. The slope of the funnel is quite steep sincefor many offenses, the crime is never reported to the police, anarrest is not made, a conviction is not obtained, or an offenderis not sentenced to prison. Generally, fewer than 3 percent ofall serious crimes result in a prison sentence. One unknown variable is the fact that some convicted offendershave committed additional crimes which have gone undetected.Incarcerating these offenders therefore responds to more thanjust the single crime of conviction. Yet even if we multiply the3 percent figure by a factor of five or ten, it is clear that thesystem is still only able to use incarceration for a relativehandful of serious offenses. 2. The Impact of Demographics The prison system is also limited by the impact ofdemographics; in particular the fact that a disproportionatenumber of crimes is committed by 1518 yearold males. For thecrimes of burglary, robbery, and assault, for example, the peakage of crime commission is 18. Within six years, these rates arehalf their peak. This "aging out" of crime phenomenonhas two implications for policy: 1) for each succeeding year thatoffenders are locked up in prison, fewer crimes are beingprevented than the year before; and, 2) unless the factorsleading to high crime rates in the 1518 year age range areaddressed, incarceration will remain an "after thefact" response that fails to address the new annual cohortof potential offenders. 3. The "Replacement" Effect Finally, the "replacement" effect of crimecommission limits the utility of incarceration as a means ofcrime control. As we have seen most clearly for drug offenses,the massive increase in the use of imprisonment for drugoffenders in the 1980s had little discernible impact on drugabuse or drug crimes. As long as a market exists for drugs, newpotential sellers will emerge to take the place of those who arelocked up. WHY ARE AFRICANAMERICAN MALES INCARCERATED AT SUCH HIGH RATES? We and others have documented the dramatically high rate ofincarceration and criminal justice supervision of AfricanAmericanmales. As can be seen in the table below, the number ofincarcerated black males exceeds the number of black malesenrolled in higher education. This is clearly a sign of alongterm crisis in the making for both the black community andthe nation. TABLE 7 AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE TRENDS IN INCARCERATION AND HIGHER EDUCATION Year              # Incarcerated      Enrolled in Higher Education   1990                 499,000                     484,000             1992                 583,000*                    537,000             * Figure represents jail inmates for 1992 and prisoninmates for 1993. In recent years, the plight of AfricanAmerican males has been thesubject of much discussion. A 1990 report of The SentencingProject documenting that one in four young black men was undersome form of criminal justice control received widespreadnational attention. A variety of activities have been undertakento both study these issues and to address them programmatically.These have included Congressional hearings, the formation of taskforces, communitybased programs, and others. Despite this levelof activity, though, the number of incarcerated AfricanAmericanmales has increased from 499,000 in 1990 to 583,000 by 1992-93. An analysis of the causes of this distressing situation iscomplex. An examination of recent trends, though, points to bothsocial policy factors and criminal justice policies that relatedirectly to this problem. One of the key issues facing the nation today is the problem ofyouth violence, an area in which AfricanAmerican males areoverrepresented both as victims and perpetrators. Research inthis area by criminologist Delbert Elliott indicates a number ofdirections in which social policy plays a significant role inproducing differential outcomes by race. Elliott's review of comparative rates of youth violence findsthat rates of violence are high overall and that they cut acrossracial and class lines. Youth selfreport studies show that for1617 year old males, 2025 percent of the population report havingengaged in "serious violent offending," defined asaggravated assault, forcible rape, robbery, and homicide. Racialdifferences are relatively modest by age 18, the rate of reportedviolent offending among blacks is only 18 percent higher than forwhites. After the teen years, two trends emerge. First, the vast majorityof violent youth cease their involvement within a few years ofits onset. Of those youth who were engaged in violent behavior asteens, nearly 80 percent report discontinuing such behavior bytheir twenties. For black youth, though, nearly twice as many persist in theirviolent offending after age 21. The one significant exception tothis pattern, though, is among those males who are employed.Within this group, there are no discernible differences by race. Elliott concludes that the key to reducing adolescent violentbehavior lies in enabling these individuals to make a successfultransition to the adult roles of work, marriage, and parenting.He finds that: ...race and class differences in serious violent offending aresmall during adolescence, but become substantial during the earlyadult years. This difference does not appear to be the result ofdifferences in predispositions to violence, but in the continuityof violence once initiated. Race, in particular, is related tofinding and holding a job, and to marriage and stable cohabitingrates. In essence, race and poverty are related to successfullymaking the transition out of adolescence and into adult roles. While incarceration may be necessary to respond to certainviolent behaviors, its role in enabling young offenders to makethe transition to work and family is virtually nonexistent. Formiddle class youth who have access to resources, this transitionis far more likely to take place successfully with or without anyintervention by the criminal justice system. Compounding these problems in the larger community and economyare criminal justice policies of recent years which have furthermarginalized AfricanAmerican young males. As we have notedpreviously, the "war on drugs" in particular has playeda substantial role in exacerbating the continuously increasingrates of incarceration. The other major outcome of this"war" has been to increase the already substantialdisparity in incarceration suffered by AfricanAmericans. THE NEW "LAW AND ORDER" CLIMATE A visitor from another planet might be forgiven for beingutterly confused about the direction of American criminal justicepolicy. The observer would first note that two decades ofsteadily increasing rates of incarceration had not resulted inany Americans feeling safer from crime. He or she mightunderstandably then believe that a reconsideration ofincarceration policies would be in order. Looking at activities in Congress and state legislatures, though,it is clear that little of this is taking place. Congress and atleast a dozen states have passed "Three Strikes and You'reOut" laws mandating life without parole for certainthreetime offenders. Despite rising costs of corrections, prisonconstruction continues almost unabated in most parts of thecountry. And, public opinion polls show substantially heightenedconcern about crime along with support for various restrictivesentencing policies. How does one explain this seeming inconsistency between realityand public policy? Many criminal justice observers have noted thefact that fear of crime appears to be increasing even as crimerates remain about the same as ten years ago. Several factorsexplain this: 1. Crime rates compared to what? While it is true thatcrime rates are about the same as ten years ago, they aresignificantly higher than thirty years ago. Therefore, mostadults can remember a time in their early life when they felt,and were, significantly safer than they are today. So, whethercrime is up a little or down a little from year to year, there isan understandably greater concern about its impact on daily life. A second issue in this area regards the distinction between crimerates the proportion of crime for a given population andthe actual number of crimes. When one reads news accountsof cities experiencing record numbers of murders, forexample, it is often the case that the rate of murder islower than in previous years. While the murder rate in the U.S.is clearly intolerably high, distortions such as this onlycontribute to misperceptions and a heightened climate of fear. 2. Media access and sensationalism. Public policy in thearea of crime control has for a long time been overly influencedby a relative handful of sensational events. The Willie Hortonissue of the 1988 Presidential campaign was one of the mostprominent examples, along with more recent events such as the1993 tragic murder of 12year old Polly Klaas in California andthe killings on the Long Island RailRoad commuter train. Atypicalas these events may be, they create a distorted perception of theactual risks of violent crime. Another factor in this area is the broader variety of mediaoutlets that now exist and the more sensational forms ofreporting engaged in by many of them. The police highway trackingof O.J. Simpson and his subsequent court appearances illustrateways in which violent crime comes into the American home in amuch more direct way than in the past. 3. Political grandstanding. One of the more significantpolitical developments on crime policy in recent years is thatunder the Clinton administration, the Democrats have tried to"take the crime issue away" from Republicans. Publicopinion polls show this strategy to have been largely successful,with more respondents indicating confidence in the Democrats tocontrol crime. In large part, though, this has been little more than promotingthe "get tough" approach that the Republican party hasbeen perceived to offer for many years. The President's supportfor "Three Strikes and You're Out" in his State of theUnion message, Congressional support for more prisonconstruction, and the failure to make any significant inroads onthe issue of mandatory sentencing indicate a willingness topursue many of the major policy thrusts of the Reagan/Bush era. The primary distinction made by the Democratic leadership incontrast with the past has been the call for a "mix ofpunishment and prevention" approach to crime. Few personswould argue with the need for such a mix in general terms. Theflaw in this approach, though, is that it presupposes that an"equal" mix of punishment and prevention is what iscalled for today. As the history of the past twenty years hasdemonstrated, there has been absolutely no reluctance to engagein punishment, even to the point of becoming a world leader inthe use of incarceration. At the same time, due to budgetaryconstraints and a changing political climate, resources devotedto prevention in a broad sense have declined in many respects. Therefore, if a mix of punishment and prevention is what isactually needed, policymakers should begin to assess how toachieve that mix. Clearly, an emphasis on "frontend"preventive approaches and a decreased emphasis on"backend" reactive approaches should be pursued if thenation is to reach a balance between punishment and prevention. 4. Intersection of race and crime. One of the definingissues of American criminal justice policy for many years hasbeen the equation of crime with AfricanAmerican males. Thedynamics of this phenomenon are complex, but they center aroundthe vicious cycle that has been created in the nationalconsciousness. For violent offenses in particular, AfricanAmerican male rates ofoffending are considerably higher than for other groups. Thisfact is then portrayed in frequent media depictions of youngblack men as criminals, which lends support to policies designedto incarcerate ever larger numbers of them. Rarely in thisprocess is any attempt made to understand how a 15year old youthhas become a school dropout who is selling drugs and carrying agun, or what types of family and community responses might haveprevented these developments. Few middle class families wouldwillfully hand over their teenage children to the criminaljustice system for punishment or rehabilitation, yetAfricanAmerican males are processed into the system in historicnumbers with little questioning by the larger community. Lost in the process as well is the fact that for some offenses,AfricanAmericans are disproportionately represented in thecriminal justice system even though their rates of crimecommission are not responsible for the disparities. Thesentencing disparities between powder cocaine and crack cocainehave been well documented, showing that punishments for these twoforms of the same drug are correlated with the race of the userin large part. Finally, by looking only at prison populations for sources ofdisparity, we miss key aspects of the potential sources ofdisparity. For example, within the category of violent offenses,AfricanAmericans arrest rates are approximately the same as theproportion of AfricanAmericans in prison. If one were to look atwhite collar or corporate crimes, though, two issues wouldemerge. First, we would find that AfricanAmericans areunderrepresented as offenders, and second, that the system hashistorically put fewer resources into prosecuting these types ofcrimes. Thus, decisions regarding criminal justice prioritiesplay a role in determining the composition of prison populationsregardless of particular crime rates. The Impact of the New "Law and Order" Movement It is still too early to project the full impact of thevarious sentencing policies that have been adopted or are underconsideration at the national and state level. Much of the impactwill depend on how broadly the various proposals are crafted, andhow they are implemented in practice. It is already clear,though, that the new "get tough" movement has beensuccessful in producing a variety of harsh sentencing proposals,most notably, the "Three Strikes and You're Out"proposals. The impact of these proposals will be felt in both fiscal termsand potential disruptions to components of the criminal justicesystem. Much of this can be seen most clearly in the Californialegislation, which is by far the broadest to date. In addition toproviding life without parole for "threetime losers,"the California statutes also increase sentences for a broad rangeof offenses. The Department of Corrections has estimated that thelegislation will lead to an increase of 275,000 in the prisonpopulation over the next thirty years, with an additionaloperating cost of $5.7 billion annually. Further, the legislationwill necessitate an additional $21 billion in prison constructioncosts. The impact of "3 Strikes" laws has already beenobserved at trials and sentencing in a number of states: � One of the first offenders sentenced under the Washingtonstate law was 35year old Larry Fisher, whose third strikeinvolved robbing a sandwich shop of $151 by pretending that thefinger in his pocket was a gun. His previous two strikes involvedpushing his grandfather down and taking $390 from him, and a $100pizza parlor robbery that also did not involve a weapon. � In the case of the first defendant to be tried in SanFrancisco under the state's new law, the 71year old victim whosecar had been burglarized refused to testify in court because sheviewed the penalty as far too severe. � In the first case to be tried in Los Angeles, jurorsdeadlocked on a routine burglary charge, reportedly because threejurors believed life in prison was an overly harsh penalty for anonviolent crime. The new generation of harsh sentencing policies will also haveseveral lasting impacts: 1) prison construction required as aresult of their implementation will represent a commitment to useof these institutions for at least fifty years; 2) funds divertedto increased costs of corrections will not be available toaddress a variety of crime prevention measures; 3) the alreadytragic levels of incarceration for African-Americans males willbe increased; and, 4) political debate on crime will be furtherstifled and more focused on a narrow range of sentencingpolicies. The ultimate measure of these proposals, of course, is theirimpact on crime. In this area, too, there is no reason to believethat these proposals will be effective. The demographics of crimecommission show us that incarcerating a 50- or 60year oldoffender is an extremely expensive means for preventing very fewcrimes. Rather than providing more resources to prevention and amore effective juvenile justice system, funding will be divertedto the creation of geriatric prisons that will hurt taxpayersfinancially but not provide them with any increased publicsafety. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A MORE RATIONAL CRIME POLICY The analysis of crime and incarceration described in thisreport tells us that the high rate of incarceration in the UnitedStates is not solely a product of higher rates of crime thanother nations, nor has it achieved a substantial impact onreducing crime. Despite a quadrupling of the inmate populationsince 1973, Americans do not feel safer from crime and are stillvictimized by high rates of crime and violence. We have no illusions that the current tough climate on crimecontrol policies will recede in the near future. Too manysenseless crimes combined with too much media sensationalism andpolitical grandstanding have created an emotional and politicizedatmosphere that makes rational discussion of crime controlpolicies exceedingly difficult. Nevertheless, there remain many professionals and others who careabout the crime problem and are genuinely searching forconstructive responses. In addition, numerous public opinionsurveys have documented that the public is far more responsive toa broad range of solutions to crime than is commonly assumed. Theproblem is that the range of choices generally presented inpublic policy discussions is exceedingly narrow. In previous reports, we have suggested policy changes that couldhave an impact on rates of incarceration while providing moreappropriate sanctions and services to offenders. These include: �Repealing mandatory sentencing laws in order to restoreappropriate judicial discretion; �Treating the drug problem primarily as a public health problemrather than as a criminal justice problem; �Supporting the expansion of a broader range of alternatives toincarceration to provide judges and communities with viablecommunity based sentencing options; �Establishing a national commission to examine the high rate ofincarceration in the U.S., and of African American males inparticular. These and other policy changes would begin to control thespiralling rate of incarceration and associated costs.Implementing these policies, though, is a political problem, onein which there has been relatively little constructiveleadership. It is far from certain that the political climate oncrime can be altered significantly in the short run. If it is tochange in the long run, though, a framework such as the followingneeds to be presented: 1. No "anticrime" proposals enacted today whetherprison construction or prevention programs will have much impacton crime in the next several years. It is far more important tolook toward the generation of youth being born today and todevelop policies that will reduce their chances of becomingoffenders as they reach their teen years. 2. The criminal justice system, as a reactive system, can onlyhave a limited impact on crime. While a system of justice andsanctions is necessary, we should not look to the courts andprisons as the primary means of controlling or preventing crime. 3. Crime is a product of many factors, including individual,family, and community issues. Only an understanding of thecomplexity of these factors will enable us to develop acomprehensive strategy for responding to the problem. For too long, public debate on crime has been polarized andstifling. As a result, we are faced with the problems ofcontinuing high rates of crime, increasing rates ofincarceration, and continuing public dissatisfaction. Aftertwenty years of "getting tough," it is hard to imaginehow new "tough" proposals will succeed any better thantheir predecessors. It is time to publicly acknowledge thiscrisis and to initiate a more honest and open debate about thepressing problem of crime. METHODOLOGY FOR PRISONER DATA United States Data are for the years 199293 (the mostrecent available), and were derived from Bureau of JusticeStatistics (BJS) reports detailing the number of prison inmateson December 31, 1993 and the number of jail inmates on June 30,1992. From the total inmate figure, we excluded 2,804 juvenilesbeing held in local jails as well as 50,966 inmates under federalor state jurisdiction who were being held in local jails, so asto avoid duplication with the jail count. To calculate the racial composition of the state and federalinmate population, we used the figures of 47.9 percent black and46.8 percent white from Correctional Populations in the UnitedStates, 1991 (BJS). The racial composition of jail inmateswas derived in two steps. We first used the figures of 44.1percent black and 40.1 percent white nonHispanic from the 1992jail report. We then estimated the portion of the Hispanicpopulation (14.5 percent of jail inmates) by race, using CensusBureau estimates that the Hispanic population nationally is 95percent white, 2 percent black, and 2 percent other. Male inmatepopulations were calculated by race by using the 1991 proportionsfor state and federal inmates and the 1992 overall data forjails. All racial data represent a small undercount, since dataon race are not available for approximately 4 percent of stateand federal inmates. Overall population data were taken fromCensus Bureau estimates for 1993. A small margin of error is inevitable in these calculations. Itis possible, for example, that the racial composition of theHispanic inmate population is different than for the populationas a whole. There is no reason to believe, though, that theoverall inmate population estimates are off by a substantialmargin. Other Nations Sources for prisoner data include HumanRights Watch, Penal Reform International, Australian Institute ofCriminology, Corrections Compendium, and Professor NilsChristie. Data for Asian counties are all for 1993; for Europeand other continents, data are for either 1992 or 1993. Data for Russia are taken from three sources. The most current isfrom a report of a lecture given by the General Director of theRussian Prison System, as described by Nils Christie of theUniversity of Oslo in the 1994 edition of Crime Control asIndustry, documenting a total of 848,000 inmates. An April1993 article by Gary Hill appearing in Corrections Compendiumcites almost identical figures (845,000), and the StateDepartment's County Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993lists the prison population as 827,000. We have used Christie'sfigure as the most current, and from it have deducted the 19,000juveniles reported by Hill, so as to be comparable to the U.S.calculations. The South African figures are taken from the 1993 report of theSouth African Prisons Service. The South African categories of"black" and "colored" are combined to producethe black male rate of incarceration. In previous reports, wehave attempted to estimate the incarceration rate for the four"independent" homelands that were not recognized by anynation outside South Africa. This estimate was then incorporatedinto the overall figures for South Africa to derive a rate ofincarceration. Since there are no current reliable figures forthese homelands for 1993, we have not included them in either theprison data or the overall population data for South Africa.Therefore, the incarceration rates reported here are not entirelycomparable to those of past reports. Since the homelands are nowofficially part of South Africa, we hope that in future reportsdata will be available for the entire population. Although previous reports included data for China, there are nocurrent data that are considered reliable by most observers.

Sentencing advocates need to be aware oftreatment options in the community in order to argue persuasivelythat such clients can be effectively treated outside of prison.This article will describe both traditional and non-traditionaldrug treatment and how sentencing advocates can develop planswhich include community-based treatment. Community-based treatment may use the following methods:therapeutic interventions, support groups,detoxification/emergency treatment, pharmacologic assistance,acupuncture or homeopathic therapy. The settings for treatmentare outpatient, day treatment, in-patient, residential, ortherapeutic community. Methods of Treatment Therapeutic intervention includes individual or groupcounseling and psychotherapy, and treatment is usually providedby trained therapists. Most therapeutic intervention programsrely on cognitive-based therapy which addresses irrationalthinking and attempts to restructure thought processes. Support groups are usually conducted by a member of the groupwith the assistance of prepared materials by a nationalorganization. The most well known support groups are AlcoholicsAnonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. Most support groups aremodeled on the Twelve Steps of AA and rely on faith in a"higher power" to assist in achieving goals. Detoxification treatment is a program of planned withdrawal whichmay or may not include medication to assist in withdrawal. Lengthof detoxification depends on the substance ingested and themethods used for detoxification. Detoxification without othertreatment has not been found to be effective in maintainingsobriety. Acupuncture is gaining in popularity as a treatment foraddictions. In addition to its use in community-based treatmentprograms, more than 500 inmates are taking acupuncture treatmentsaround the country each day. For substance abusers, the processinvolves inserting three to five needles into precise points ofthe outer ear just beneath the skin for � The Sentencing Project, Inc., Washington, D.C.

The needlessignal neurotransmitters that release natural pain relievingendorphines which reduce cravings for drugs or alcohol and helpcalm the patient. Some programs use acupuncture in combinationwith other traditional forms of addiction treatment. Examples of pharmacological medications which are used to treataddictions are disulfiram, methadone, and ibogaine. Disulfiram,which is more commonly known by its trade name, Antabuse, istaken daily by mouth to deter the consumption of alcohol bycausing severe but temporary discomfort when combined withalcohol. Symptoms include weakness, vertigo, decrease in bloodpressure, throbbing head and neck, flushing of the face, chestpain, labored breathing, nausea and vomiting. For most people,the threat of such a noxious reaction is enough to deter alcoholconsumption. Disulfiram therapy is usually used in combinationwith a comprehensive treatment program. Calcium carbimide,marketed under the trade name Temposil, is also used as analcohol deterrent. Methadone is a narcotic analgesic similar in potency to morphine.Under a special license, some treatment facilities provide drugdependent persons with methadone as a substitute for heroin,morphine, or exycodone (Percodan). Initially, daily dosages ofmethadone are gradually increased until a stabilization doselevel is achieved. Users are maintained on the stabilized dosefor an extended period of time. The eventual goal of manymethadone programs is to decrease the daily dosage of methadoneto help the dependent person achieve a drug-free state withoutsuffering the distress of abrupt withdrawal. For most users,methadone suppresses withdrawal symptoms and the chronic"drug hunger" for other narcotics without renewingeuphoria. Nausea and vomiting are common side effects and must beendured until tolerance is developed. Constipation and physicaldependence on the drug are chronic, long term side effects. Ibogaine is a naturally-occurring hallucinogenic alkaloid whichcomes from the roots of a West African plant. Ibogaine hasreceived some media attention recently for its use in controllingaddiction to cocaine. Critics of its therapeutic use point outthat ibogaine is a hallucinogenic which produces early effects ofnausea, vomiting, sweating, weakness, dizziness, tremors, andnumbness. Users then become physically relaxed and tend to loseinterest completely in their surroundings. They experience longdreamlike sequences of vivid images and fantasies, dominated byspecific intense colors. The duration of the hallucinogenicactivity is approximately six hours. Proponents of ibogaine's therapeutic use point to the user'sdecrease in intense craving for cocaine. Some users of ibogaineassert that their dependency on crack is based on their inabilityto control their craving. By substituting ibogaine for crack,they are able to control their crack use and are able tore-establish productive lives. Another medication used to reducecocaine craving is Bromocriptine (Parlodel), a drug used to treatParkinson's disease. Bromocriptine mimics the action of dopamineby stimulating dopamine receptors. This may lead to reducedcraving for cocaine. Anti-depressants have also been used withsome limited success to treat the craving for cocaine.Pharmacologic approaches are almost always used in conjunctionwith other forms of drug treatment. Homeopathic treatment for drug and alcohol abuse is providedunder the care of a homeopath physician or practitioner.Homeopathy and naturopathy medicine rely on natural treatmentremedies such as herbs, along with diet and massage, to achievechemical balance in the body. Most homeopath physicians havedoctor of medicine degrees. Naturopathic physicians are notmedical doctors, but have a doctorate in naturopathy. A listingof homeopath physicians is found in the yellow pages under"Homeopaths." Not all homeopath physicians treatalcohol and drug dependence. Treatment Plans The best treatment for one client may differ from thetreatment intervention for another. The type of drug, theclient's background, length of abuse, motivation for treatment,environment and social support play a part in determining themost appropriate treatment intervention. When treatment is part of your sentencing proposal, advocatesshould make the treatment referral as early as possible.Sometimes, early intervention can be used as an indicator of the client's motivation for change. In addition, if the treatmentstaff have some history with the client, they may providetestimony on the progress of the client's treatment at thesentencing hearing. Early referrals also help address the problemof lengthy waiting lists. Some treatment agencies will not interview clients in the jail.Defense attorneys sometimes file a motion with the court askingthat the client be released to go to an agency for an assessmentinterview. Another option used by sentencing advocates is to finda person who will go to the jail to provide assessment. At thesentencing hearing, the attorney provides this information whichshows that if the client was assessed, he or she would likely beaccepted into the treatment program. If sentencing advocates use treatment agency personnel who arenot familiar with the interview practices in the jail, theyshould provide the interviewer with information such as whatidentification to bring, whether the interview can be arrangedwith direct contact with the inmate, and a copy of the jailrules, including time restrictions on jail visits. It is goodpractice to provide the jail with written notification of theinterview. Some jails require a background check of theinterviewer to be completed prior to a professional contactvisit. In some cases, sentencing advocates provide probation and paroleagents with information about their referrals to treatmentagencies. Frequently, agents do not have the time or interest inreferring clients to programs; however, they are often notopposed to others making referrals. Sentencing advocates'treatment plans are more likely to be accepted if they have jointagreement between the defense and probation agents. In some cases, probation officers are opposed to acommunity-based treatment plan, and they will not facilitate thereferral. In these cases, sentencing advocates should make thereferral themselves if the agency will accept the client, or askthe defense attorney to bring a motion before the judge to orderthe probation officer to make a referral. Funding Sources Funding for alcohol and drug treatment comes from a varietyof sources, including government, donations, insurance, privatepay, and gambling revenues. Some state and federal funding fortreatment is funneled through state agencies and then dispersedto the local level. Other sources of governmental funding for treatment are Title 19(Medicaid), veteran benefits, Treatment Alternatives to StreetCrime (TASC) grants, and legislatively-mandated specificappropriations. Sentencing advocates should find out if theirclients have Title 19 or veteran benefits. If they have orqualify for veteran benefits, they may refer their clients to thecounty veteran service office which will provide information onlocal services. If clients have Title 19, sentencing advocatesmay refer clients to private service providers, or any agencywhich accepted Title 19 funding. Frequently, your Department of Corrections (or ProbationDepartment) also has funds to purchase treatment services. Whenusing this source of funds, the agent preparing the presentencereport or the parole agent is usually required to make a formalreferral. Sentencing advocates may encourage agents to makereferrals for treatment by making the initial contact themselvesto treatment agencies, and providing information to the agentabout the feasibility of acceptance. Occasionally, staff oftreatment agencies will contact the agent, and encourage theagent to make the referral. Donations are used to augment funding for non-profit agenciessuch as United Way. Often, services in United Way agencies areprovided on a sliding-scale fee basis. Donations, usually fromthe participants, are used to fund support groups. Funds for treatment are often provided by an insurance carrier.In addition to insurance provided through employment or school,Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) insurance may be purchasedby counties for persons on general assistance. As part of thecontract, some HMO's provide treatment for persons receivinggeneral assistance. Gambling revenues are providing new sources of income for Indianatribes. Most tribes provide treatment for their members. Effectiveness of Treatment Studies conducted in the last fifteen years show that drugtreatment is effective in reducing drug abuse, increasingemployment, improving psychological adjustment, and decreasingcrime. The most persuasive evidence of the effectiveness oftreatment is found in the results of the Treatment OutcomeProspective Study (TOPS). See Robert L. Hubbard, et.al., DrugAbuse Treatment: A National Study of Effectiveness (ChapelHill, NC: U of North Carolina Press, 1989). TOPS studied 10,000 individuals admitted to 37 programs in 10cities. They found that "drug abuse treatment has beennotably effective in reducing drug abuse up to five years after asingle treatment episode." The study also reported, "Byserving as an alternative to incarceration, treatment can beparticularly beneficial for drug abusers identified in jails orprisons, and it can play a central role in combating the spreadof acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) by reducing theintravenous use of heroin and other drugs." The TOPS studyalso found that legal pressure tended to keep people in treatmentfor longer periods and that this coercion did not interfere withtreatment goals. The potential for reducing criminal behavior is one of the mostcompelling reasons in favor of drug treatment. The TOPS studyfound that "three to five years after leaving treatment, theproportion of clients who were involved in predatory crimes wasone-third to one-half of the pretreatment proportion."

The report isdesigned to present a comprehensive plan for responding to thenation's drug problem. Although final details of the plan werenot to be made public until then, a 235page draft submitted tothe President for review was "leaked" and circulatingin Washington in August 1989. The final report is expected to besimilar to the draft proposal. Following is a summary and analysis of the proposed drugstrategy. Highlights of the Drug Strategy Although the drug strategy calls for funding and programmingin several areas, its primary thrust is in the area of lawenforcement, with less focus on prevention, treatment, andeducation. Greater emphasis is also to be placed on "demandreduction" by imposing new sanctions on "casualusers." These sanctions will include such penalties asrevoking drivers' licenses, sentences to "boot camps,"and evictions from public housing. Law Enforcement/Prisons The Bennett plan proposes anincrease in federal aid to state and local governments fordrugrelated law enforcement from the current level of $150million to $350 million. In addition, funding levels for federalprison construction would be increased from $580 million to $1.2billion. Treatment Funding for drug treatment programs through theDepartment of Health and Human Resources would increase from $481million to $740 million. Education The Education Department would receive anincrease from $355 million to $392 million for antidrug programs. International Enforcement Between $300400 million would bemade available in economic and military assistance to LatinAmerican countries to combat the spread of cocaine. Other Features The drug strategy includes a variety ofother proposals, including the use of civil commitmentproceedings to force drug addicts into treatment, mandatoryimposition of user sanctions by colleges in order to receivefederal funds, and a crackdown on marijuana use. � The Sentencing Project, Inc., Washington, D.C.

Problems with the Drug Strategy The establishment of the drug policy position created anopportunity to conduct a broad examination of the reasons whydrug use pervades our society from innercity "crack"houses to suburban homes to professional athletics. In contrastto previous "wars on drugs," the drug "czar"position carried no mandate to adopt an exclusivelylawenforcement approach. Instead, there was the potential toexplore the range of social, economic, moral, and psychologicalfactors leading to drug use, and thereby creating the basis forproposing solutions to respond to the crisis. The Bennett plan,though, avoids asking these difficult questions, and insteadproposes "more of the same." 1. Contrary to some initial publicity, the Bennett strategycontinues a fifteenyear commitment to a law enforcement approach,and not to prevention, treatment, or education. The proposed budget increase for federal prisons alone $654million is greater than the total recommended increase of $565million for treatment and prevention. Total law enforcementfunding would outpace spending for treatment and prevention bymore than twotoone. In doing so, the plan continues a pattern of funding prioritiesthat began shifting in the mid1970s. From 197075, twothirds ofantidrug funding $1.92 billion of $3 billion was devoted toprevention, treatment, and education. Between 197681, 43 percentof the total $5.2 billion budget went to these categories.Beginning in 1982, the first full year of funding under theReagan administration, 80 percent of drug funding went to lawenforcement, with this pattern continuing until passage of the1988 AntiDrug Abuse Act. From 1981 through 1986, federal funding for law enforcement morethan doubled from $800 million in 1981 to $1.9 billion in 1986.At the same time, federal funding for prevention, education, andtreatment declined from $404 million in 1981 to $338 million in1985. When adjusted for inflation, this amounted to a 40 percentdecrease. The Bennett plan restores some of these funds that hadbeen cut over the years, but still maintains a primary emphasison a law enforcement approach. 2. The drug strategy represents a continuation of a failedapproach. Fighting the "war on drugs" primarily through lawenforcement more arrests, more prisons, and more prisoners ishardly a new approach. The past decade has seen a doubling in ournation's prison population at tremendous financial cost, much ofit due to drugrelated offenses. By the end of 1989, there will beone million prisoners in our nation's prisons and jails. Thismassive increase, though, has resulted in no appreciable drop inthe crime rate or the prevalence of drugs. As the Bennett papernotes, "drugs are potent, drugs are cheap, and drugs areavailable to almost anyone who wants them" (Draft, NationalDrug Control Strategy, pp. 34). As former Washington, D.C. Police Chief Maurice Turner hasremarked, even though District police made over 40,000 drugarrests in the past year, drug use in the nation's capitalremains rampant, along with the crime associated with it. As longas the conditions which breed drug use exist, there will be aconstant source of potential new users. 3. "Boot camps" recommended in the Bennett plan willlikely result in more prisoners, with no guarantee of any declinein crime or drug use. Although sometimes referred to as "alternatives" toprison, boot camps in fact are essentially prisons, albeitshortterm ones. States which currently operate boot camp programsgenerally use a model of a 36 month militarystyle regimen in aninstitution. In recommending the expansion of boot camps, thedrug strategy flies in the face of government reportsrecommending caution in their development. A 1988 GAO report("Prison Boot Camps: Too Early to MeasureEffectiveness") concluded that it was "too early tomeasure [the] effectiveness" of boot camps, while a recentNational Institute of Justice study ("Shock Incarceration:An Overview of Existing Programs") stated that, at present,"We don't know whether [boot camp] changes offenders'attitudes, or whether it deters or rehabilitates more or lesseffectively than other communitybased sanctions" (p. 35). 4. Locking up more drug offenders will only exacerbate theproblems in our prison system. Prison populations are at an alltime high, and prison systems inforty states are under court order to improve conditions. Addingadditional thousands of drug users will only add to this burden. The serious shortage of treatment programs in prisons has insuredthat incarceration cannot "cure" most drug addicts. Arecent Justice Department study of offenders released from stateprisons found that 62 percent of persons imprisoned for drugpossession were rearrested within three years of release. Asformer Watergate figure and prisoner Charles Colson has saidrecently, "Addicts leave prison just as likely to commit newcrimes as when they went in." If we cannot help drugoffenders who are already incarcerated, there is little hope ofproviding meaningful treatment to additional thousands ofprisoners. 5. The Bennett plan advocates increased incarceration, but themajor cost of this policy will be borne by state and localgovernments for decades to come. The vast majority of drug arrests are made at the state level.Increased funding to state and local governments for lawenforcement will lead to more arrests, convictions, and sentencesto prison. Yet, the Bennett plan includes no funding for stateprison construction or costs of incarceration. Each new prisoncell built to accommodate Bennett's strategy will cost about$50,000, plus approximately $20,000 a year for housing of eachnew prisoner. All of these costs will be the responsibility ofstate and local taxpayers, diverting funds from schools, roads,housing, and treatment programs. There is a Better Way Addressing the drug problem needs to begin with the premisethat drugs are a problem which society as a whole needs to dealwith, and not just the criminal justice system. As with otherissues, the criminal justice system may provide some measure ofjustice and safety, but it is not designed to resolve underlyingsocial and economic issues. A constructive approach to the drugproblem which the Bennett plan could have emphasized would havebeen the following: Social and Economic Issues Contrary to the contention of Bennett and others, addressingthe problem of poverty and "quality of life" are bothshortterm and longterm issues. Funds that will be used to buildand operate prisons could instead be devoted to programs of jobtraining and placement, school dropout prevention, child careprograms, and other needed services. Treatment As the Bennett plan notes, "treatment for drug addictioncan and often does work." Yet, in 1987, the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse estimated that publicly funded drugtreatment was available for only 4 percent of the estimated 6.5million drug users and addicts who needed help. Substance abuserswith financial resources have little trouble finding highqualitytreatment programs. For poor people seeking help, though, asixmonth waiting list for treatment is not unusual. No single drug program or approach will work for all drug users.What is needed is a funding commitment to develop a variety ofmodels to respond to the range of drugs and drug users. Prevention and Education From 1982 to 1985, only $23 million a year, 1 percent oftotal drug abuse funding, was spent on prevention and education.Although the 1988 AntiDrug Abuse Act increased funding in thisarea tenfold, more than threequarters of all funding stillremained in "supply reduction." With the important exception of "crack," drug use hasgenerally been declining over the past several years. Mostexperts believe this is primarily due to increased awarenessabout the hazards of drugs, and not through reduced availabilityor increased sanctions. Now is the time to build on thisprogress, and to design new methods of reaching young people. - - - - - - Much of the data in this briefing paper is taken from MatheaFalco, Winning the Drug War: A National Strategy, PriorityPress Publications, New York, 1989. 8/89 Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Other Publications related to drug policy Sentencing Project Reports WT01-B37-11IA088-000636-B016-176http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/other/sp/facts-pp.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122102137 text/html 4492HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 10:21:27 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Saturday, 28-Dec-96 05:13:59 GMTContent-length: 4275 Facts About Prisons and Prisoners Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Other Publications related to drug policy Sentencing Project Reports FACTS ABOUT PRISONS AND PRISONERS The Growing Corrections System � The number of inmates in state and federal prisons hasincreased more than five-fold from less than 200,000 in 1970 to1,053,000 by 1994.

Washington, D.C. 20004 (202) 628-0871 YOUNG BLACK MEN AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM: A GROWING NATIONAL PROBLEM Overview For close to two decades, the criminal justice systemin the United States has been undergoing a tremendous expansion.Beginning in 1973, the number of prisoners, criminal justicepersonnel, and taxpayer dollars spent has increased dramatically,with new record highs now being reached each year. Between 1973and 1988, the number of felons in state and federal prisonsalmost tripled from 204,000 to 603,000. By 1989, the total inmatepopulation in our nation's prisons and jails had passed the onemillion mark. Record numbers of persons are also being placed under probationor parole supervision. These aspects of the criminal justicesystem are sometimes overlooked when the problems of prison andjail populations and overcrowding are explored. The extended reach of the criminal justice system has been farfrom uniform in its effects upon different segments of thepopulation. Although the number of women prisoners has increasedin recent years at a more rapid pace than men, the criminaljustice system as a whole still remains overwhelmingly maleapproximately 87 percent. And, as has been true historically, buteven more so now, the criminal justice system disproportionatelyengages minorities and the poor. Impact of the Criminal Justice System This report looks at the impact of the criminal justicesystem as a whole on the new generation of adults those people inthe 2029 age group. In particular, it examines the devastatingimpact that the criminal justice system has had on the lives ofyoung Black men and Black communities. This report does not attempt to explain whether or why Blacks aredisproportionately involved in the criminal justice system. Otherstudies have attempted to document whether Black males commitmore crimes or different types of crimes than other groups, orwhether they are merely treated more harshly for their crimes bythe criminal justice system. Instead, this report looks at theend result of that large-scale involvement in the criminaljustice system, and highlights the implications this raises forcrime control policies. Using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Bureauof the Census, we have calculated the rates at which differentsegments of the 2029 age group come under the control of thecriminal justice system. The analysis looks at the total numberof persons in state and federal prisons, jails, probation, andparole, and compares rates of criminal justice control by race,sex, and ethnicity. Because of the unavailability of completedata in some categories of the analysis, the total rates ofcontrol should not be considered exact calculations, but rather,close approximations of the numbers of persons in the system. Asdescribed in "Methodology," in all cases where datawere lacking, conservative assumptions were used in makingcalculations. (Sufficient data were not available to analyzecriminal justice control rates for Native Americans or AsianAmericans.) Our findings, as displayed in Tables 1 and 2, are as follows: � Almost one in four (23 percent) Black men in the age group2029 is either in prison, jail, on probation, or parole on anygiven day. � For white men in the age group 2029, one in 16 (6.2 percent)is under the control of the criminal justice system. � Hispanic male rates fall between these two groups, with one in10 (10.4 percent within the criminal justice system on any givenday). � Although the number of women in the criminal justice system ismuch lower than for men, the racial disproportions are parallel.For women in their twenties, relative rates of criminal justicecontrol are: Black women one in 37 (2.7 percent) White women one in 100 (1 percent) Hispanic women one in 56 (1.8 percent) � The number of young Black men under the control of thecriminal justice system 609,690 is greater than the totalnumber of Black men of all ages enrolled in college436,000 as of 1986. For white males, the comparable figures are4,600,000 total in higher education and 1,054,508 ages 2029 inthe criminal justice system. � Direct criminal justice control costs for these 609,690 Blackmen are $2.5 billion a year. � Although crime rates increased by only 2 percent in the period1979-88, the number of prison inmates doubled during that time. These findings actually understate the impact of presentpolicies upon Black males ages 2029. This is because the analysispresented here covers criminal justice control rates for asingle day in mid1989. Since all components of the criminaljustice system admit and release persons each day, though, thetotal number of persons processed through the system in a givenyear is substantially higher than the single day counts. For thisreason, the proportion of young Black men processed by thecriminal justice system over the course of a year would beeven higher than one in four. Implications for Social Policy The findings of this study, particularly those pertainingto young Black men, should be disturbing to all Americans.Whatever the causes of crime be they individual or societal wenow have a situation where one in four Black men of the new adultgeneration is under the control of the criminal justice system. The implications of this analysis for social policy both withinand outside the criminal justice system are farreaching: 1. Impact on the life prospects for Black males The repercussions of these high rates of criminal justicecontrol upon young Black men are greater than their immediateloss of freedom. Few would claim that today's overcrowdedcorrections systems do much to assist offenders in becomingproductive citizens after release. Despite the ideal thatoffenders can "pay their debt to society," the fact isthat most carry the stigma of being exoffenders for some time tocome. Thus, given these escalating rates of control, we risk thepossibility of writing off an entire generation of Black men fromhaving the opportunity to lead productive lives in our society. 2. Impact on the Black community For the Black community in general, nearly onefourth of itsyoung men are under the control of the criminal justice system ata time when their peers are beginning families, learningconstructive life skills, and starting careers. The consequencesof this situation for family and community stability will beincreasingly debilitating. Unless the criminal justice system canbe used to assist more young Black males in pursuing theseobjectives, any potential positive contributions they can make tothe community will be delayed, or lost forever. A particularly ominous trend further emphasizes this point. Atthe same time that an increasing proportion of Black males ages2029 have come under the control of the criminal justice system,Black male college enrollment fell by 7 percent in the decadefrom 197686. The cumulative effect of these separate measures isthat fewer Black males are being prepared to assume leadershiproles in their community. 3. Failure of the "get tough" approach to crimecontrol In many respects, the past decade can be viewed as an"experiment" in the "get tough" approach tocrime. Proponents of this policy contend that cracking down oncrime through increased arrests, prosecutions, and lengthysentences will have a deterrent effect on potential lawbreakers.Yet even with a tripling of the prison population since 1973, attremendous financial cost, victimization rates since that timehave declined less than 5 percent. 4. Implications for the "war on drugs" National drug policy director William Bennett's drug strategysimilarly emphasizes a law enforcement approach to a socialproblem. This approach is likely to result in even higher ratesof incarceration for Blacks and Hispanics since drug lawenforcement is largely targeted against "crack," moreoften used by low-income Blacks and Hispanics. As drug offendersmake up an increasing share of the prison population, thenon-white prison population will become disproportionatelylarger. In Florida, for example, Blacks inmates now make up 73.3percent of all drug offenders, compared to 53.6 percent of prisonadmissions for other offenses. The Bennett proposal to lock up more offenders is hardly a novelone. For more than twenty years, politicians have campaigned onthis basic platform. A continued emphasis on law enforcement atthe expense of prevention and treatment has little hope ofachieving longterm results. 5. Strategies for more effective criminal justice policies andprograms While the reasons why Black men enter into the criminaljustice system are complex and need to be addressed with longtermvision, there are immediate opportunities for change through thecriminal justice system. The goals of such changes should be toreduce the harm caused by the system and to reduce the likelihoodof offenders returning to the system. The outlines of such astrategy are as follows: � Divert as many youthful, minor and firsttime offenders aspossible from the criminal justice system entirely. Diversionprograms, dispute resolution processes, counseling and other moresatisfactory means for modifying offensive behavior could be usedmore frequently than they are now. � Reverse the trend to "criminalize" sociallyundesirable acts and to increase criminal penalties as a means ofcontrolling public behavior. Mandatory and lengthy prison termsadd to correctional populations, but do little to reduce crime. � Jail and prison should be sanctions of last resort foroffenders who cannot be diverted from the system. A range ofcommunitybased sentencing options exist which are less costly andmore effective than incarceration. More could be made availablethrough legislative appropriations. These include: - restitution to victims - community service - intensive probation supervision - treatment programs - employment and education - community corrections programs � Utilize the sentencing process the one point in the systemwhen there is the opportunity to craft a meaningful response tothe needs of victims, offenders, and the community to counteractthe trend toward increasing criminal justice control over Blackmales. This can be accomplished by individual judges adoptingconstructive alternatives and by developing true rehabilitativeprograms designed to reverse current correctional priorities. 6. The need for a broad approach to crime and crime control The problem of crime is one that can not be solved entirelyby the criminal justice system. Even with the most resourcefulpolice, prosecutors, judges, and corrections officials, thecriminal justice system is designed to be only a reactivesystem, not one of prevention. At the same time that the nation has engaged in a criminaljustice control strategy over the past decade, funding to addressthe conditions that contribute to crime has declined. While thecriminal justice system has processed young Black men in greatnumbers, the official unemployment rate for Black men ages 1624remains at 24 percent. (Adding the numbers of persons discouragedfrom or not "officially" in the labor market wouldresult in a significantly higher figure.) It is time now to"experiment" in crime control by attacking those socialfactors that many believe provide a more direct link to crime,such as unemployment, poverty, and substance abuse. Conclusion The problem of crime is a complex one and will not beresolved overnight. Rather than viewing the solution as hopelessor too longterm, though, there are real and immediate actionswhich can be taken to prevent the next generation of Black malesfrom further swelling the ranks of correctional populations. Some of these steps involve a change in priorities and emphasiswithin the criminal justice system. Programs and policies existin jurisdictions around the country which offer models of moreconstructive resolution of criminal justice problems. Addressing the conditions which lead to crime in the first placeis a broad agenda which requires serious thought, attention, andaction. The decisions made today, though, in the areas of policy,programs, and funding, will determine whether the criminaljustice system exerts as much control over the next generation ofBlack males as it does for the current generation. Methodology The data on which these calculations are made are takenfrom reports of the Bureau of Justice Statistics of theDepartment of Justice, the Bureau of the Census, and theDepartment of Education. A breakdown of the incarceratedpopulation by age, sex, and race was available for state prisoninmates (1986) and jail inmates (1983). Data on sex and race, butnot age, were available for federal prisoners, probationers, andparolees (all 1986). Data for the age distribution for stateprisoners and jail inmates were used to develop a ratio of theproportion of each group of prisoners (i.e. male and femalewhites, Blacks, and Hispanics) in the 2029 age group. Theseproportions were as follows: White Males 49.6%; Black Males52.4%; Hispanic Males 51.6%; White Females 52.7%; Black Females52.8%; Hispanic Females 60.0%. This ratio was then used to develop estimates by age for federalprisoners, probationers, and parolees. While parolees and federalprisoners are probably older on average than the state prisonpopulation, probationers are probably younger. The greater numberof probationers would therefore make the overall estimate of the2029 age group a conservative one. While some margin of error isinevitable in these estimates, it seems reasonable to assume thatit is not of a substantial nature. Rates of criminal justice control were then developed for allparts of the system for 1986 (except for 1983 figures for jail).These figures were then extrapolated to June 1989, based on thepercentage increase for each component of the system. The mostrecent overall population figures available were: state andfederal prisons June 1989; jails June 1987; probation and paroleDecember 1988. Annual growth estimates of 5 percent forprobation, 10 percent for parole, and 6 percent for jails, basedon trends for the past two years, were used to derive June 1989population estimates based on the 1987 and 1988 data. The use of overall population increases results in someadditional margin of error in the total population figures. Forexample, available data appear to indicate that the rateof increase for prisoners for the period 198689 has been greaterfor Blacks, Hispanics, and women than for the population as awhole. Reports also indicate that Blacks make up an increasingshare of the total number of drug arrests, a major source of theincreasing criminal justice populations. Therefore, the totalcriminal justice control rate for Black males is probably understatedin the calculations. Cost figures for various components of the criminal justicesystem are those cited by the Department of Justice in Reportto the Nation on Crime and Justice: Second Edition, 1988.Many observers believe that current cost figures aresubstantially higher than those presented here. For example, wehave used the figure of $11,302 per year for state prisoners in1984 from the Report. Many current estimates for costs ofincarceration are in the range of $15,00025,000 per year. Population figures within each category are based on CensusBureau estimates of the U.S. resident population. As the available data for Hispanics are fairly limited in mostinstances, these results should be interpreted with caution.

McNamara The Washington Post - Sunday, May 19, 1996 President Clinton appointed the wrong generalas drug czar. There is no question of Gen. Barry McCaffrey'scourage, dedication to duty and ability. I experienced danger andwas injured a few times during my 35-year police career, but camenowhere close to being a hero like McCaffrey, who was woundedthree times in combat. I admire him. My questions about hisappointment result from what he said a few weeks ago in Miami. While accompanying the president to announce a'new' anti drug strategy, McCaffrey called the 'drug war' a badmetaphor. It is more appropriate, he said, to describe America'sdrug problem as a cancer. I concur. That's what leads me toconclude that Clinton should have appointed a surgeon general notan Army general, to head the campaign against drugs. Of course, responding to the zany politics ofdrug control, the president, in the past, fired a surgeon generalwho dared to suggest that drug abuse was more of a medical than acriminal problem Now, by appointing a man of McCaffrey's stature,Clinton finessed Republican efforts to nail him as being soft ondrugs. To complete the coup, the White House and its drug czarannounced yet another renewed effort against drugs. Each time public attention begins to focus onthe colossal costs and failures of drug prohibition, a 'new'program is announced or "new' progress is cited. Suchcampaigns and claims of victory have been endless since PresidentNixon first declared the drug war in 1972. Yet, despite frequentreports of the biggest bust or drug seizure ever or increasedcooperation from other nations, the public and law enforcementofficers across the country see the drug problem as unabated orworsening. In fact, the latest tactics coming from theWhite House are essentially the same strategies pursued by thegovernment for decades: encouraging other countries to stopproduction of drugs, interdicting drugs at the border, massivelaw enforcement and harsh mandatory sentences for drug crimesdomestically, coupled with aggressive seizure of private propertyconnected however tangentially to the 'drug trade.' And, ofcourse, increased prevention and treatment efforts. Equally troubling is the continuation of a kindof pharmacological McCarthyism. Those who question thegovernment's faded strategies are labeled traitors. These criticsare said to encourage drug use and undermine law enforcement.Consequently, William Bennett and his successors were quick toblame critics as being responsible for increases in drug use, notfailed government policies. Naturally, when there are periodicclaims of decreases in drug use, government takes the credit Still, one has to admire President Clinton'spolitical chutzpah. The one truly new announcement in Miami wasthat the government has concluded that Clinton's 'new' strategieswill take 10 years to succeed. After all, as Bennett (the firstdrug czar, appointed by President Bush to end the "scourgeof drugs"), said, "We're in this for the longhaul." He resigned and went on to other things 18 monthslater. McCaffrey, like his predecessor, Lee Brown,says that the answer is not to lock up another million Americans.Unfortunately, despite his dislike of the war metaphor, thegeneral will find, as Brown did, that this war will continue tolock up hundreds of thousands of people. A corrections administrator responsible forrunning San Francisco jails told me recently that when the countyof San Francisco decided that smoking would no longer allowed inpublic buildings, cigarettes were banned in the jail. Theimmediate consequence: The price of cigarettes the undergroundjail market went to $120 a pack. It sums up prohibition; $500worth of drugs in a foreign country can bring as much as $100,000on the streets of an American city merely because they areillegal. All of the armies, cops and prisons in the world can notstop that kind of economic force. It is said that the first casualty in any waris truth. At West Point, McCaffrey studied the wars and battlesof history so that during his career he would not repeat themistakes of past warriors. Even the greatest military leaders inhistory were defeated when they settled on a vision of what theywished instead of reality. It would be helpful to pursue the sameWest Point scholarship for the drug war. Most Americans are startled to hear that untilthe passage of the Harrison Act in 1914, drug use was viewed as amedical and social problem and was not against the criminal law.There was no billion-dollar black market. No violent drug tradeNo widespread official corruption. No widespread disrespect fordrug laws. Drug users went to their doctors if they neededtreatment. There were drug problems. In fact, around theturn of the century large numbers of housewives were addicted toopium. Nerve medicine for women, containing opium, was soldacross the counter at drug stores. Other addictive substanceswere sold as patent medicines. Gradually. the medical professionbecame more aware of the addictive nature of some drugs andsupported the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906,which required labeling and warnings for habit-formingsubstances. That law was a civil one; it did notcriminalize drug users. It is instructive. The number of addictsand users was greatly reduced by educating them, not by arrestingthem. Criminalizing drugs in the United States was aremarkable change in public policy. But it wasn't the police whowere lobbying for the passage of the Harrison Act, which was thecornerstone of increasingly punitive laws against drug users andsellers. The Protestant missionary societies in China, theWomen's Christian Temperance Union and the Anti-Saloon League andother organized religions were the prime movers. In their view,drug use was sinful and people had to be saved from their baserinstincts. In effect, they managed to get their version of sinenacted into the penal code, an old habit of power elites inAmerica. This view of drug users as M criminalscontinues to haunt us and makes rational political debateimpossible. It is too appealing for politicians to picturethemselves as the good guys fighting evil. A ear ago, some of the nation's top lawenforcement officials gathered at the Hoover Institution atStanford University for a two day seminar to ponder the drugproblem. They concluded that the drug war was a failure and thatmore education and prevention would be better than more arrestsand prisons. They recommended that a national commission beappointed to study the harm that the drug war causes and toconsider alternative approaches to discouraging drug use. The top cops were concerned about some of thecosts of the present policies as well as their failure to curbdrug use. For example, the arrest and imprisonment rates fornonwhites are four to five times greater than for whites,although 80 percent of drug crimes are committed by whites.Criminologist Alfred Blumstein describes it as an assault on theAfrican-American community. It is difficult enough to motivate youngstersin these areas to stay in school and find jobs in the fewlegitimate businesses in the inner cities. Easy drug money andglamour associated with the trade are creating well armed andvicious teenaged gangsters just as Prohibition did during thedays of Al Capone. Nobel-winning economist Milton Friedman, doinga comparative analysis with homicide rates during Prohibition,estimated that as many as 10,000 murders a year are caused by theillegality of drugs. In addition, corruption of law enforcement,the legal profession and even the armed forces related to drugmoney is spreading. Congress and the president should put asidetheir demagoguery and appoint an objective commission to reporton the costs and achievements of the drug war. We shouldimmediately stop arresting people whose only crime is possessingwall amounts of drugs for their own use. The Supreme Court hasruled that being a drug addict is not a crime. Putting a halt to demonizing drug users willallow us to pursue drug maintenance experiments similar to thosein other countries, In the United States, public health campaignscaused a reduction in smoking and consumption of hard liquor andhigh cholesterol foods, without putting people in jail andestablishing a black market. Marijuana should be treated the same as alcoholand cigarettes. There is much conflicting medical evidence as towhether pot is more dangerous than alcohol or nicotine, yet it isunthinkable that we would give the death penalty or fife inprison to those who sell booze or cigarettes. The claim thatmarijuana is a stepping stone to crime and harder drugs is notsupported by facts. Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, most of the cops Ihired during my 18 years as police chief and some 70 millionAmericans have tried marijuana. They have not gone on tomainlining heroin, snorting cocaine and robbing banks. At a timewhen the public is concerned about violent crime, the policeshould not be wasting scarce resources arresting a half millionor so people every year for marijuana offenses. One of the women in a Miami drug rehab programtold McCaffrey that Clinton's new policy excluding drug usersfrom public housing made it impossible for those trying to kickthe habit to get a place to live and a job. The general musedthat his gut told him it was like throwing one person in alifeboat overboard 'to save the other nine.' However, there is noevidence that throwing people overboard stops others from usingdrugs. More importantly, how could we throw 70 million Americansoverboard and remain the free nation that McCaffrey fought sovaliantly to preserve?

McNamara Los Angeles Times - September 17, 1995 Citizens are having trouble distinguishing thegood guys from the bad. Retired LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrmanspouts venomous racism and brags to an aspiring screenwriterabout torturing, beating and framing suspects. Cops across thecountry. murder people, pull armed robberies while in uniform,sell dope, steal drug-buy money, shake down criminals, acceptbribes and falsify evidence against criminal defendants. Thestandard defense coming from law enforcement is that only arelative handful of the 400,000 cops nationwide go bad. Forseveral reasons, the public is not reassured. First, the number of reported cases of bad copsis rising. Some L.A. County deputy sheriffs get caught robbingand extorting money from drug dealers. In New Orleans, auniformed cop is accused of murdering her partner and shop ownersduring a robbery committed while she was on patrol. InWashington, D.C., and in Atlanta, cops in drug stings arearrested for stealing and taking bribes. In Boston, two whitecops frame a black man for murdering a white woman. New YorkState troopers falsify evidence that sends people to prison. InSan Francisco, counterfeit evidence means hundreds of drugconvictions are likely to be overturned. Similar evidencetampering forces the prosecution to reopen many cases inPhiladelphia. It's not just the rank and file, either. Theformer police chief of Detroit is in prison for stealing drug-buymoney. In a small New England town. the chief steals drugs fromthe evidence locker for his own use. A number of Southernsheriffs are convicted of being in league with drug smugglers. Agencies thought to be untouchable are suddenlyreaping as many bad headlines as the perennially troubled NewYork City Police Department. The Drug Enforcement agent whoarrested Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega on drug- traffickingcharges is in jail for stealing laundered drug money. The FBIcatches one of its agents taking drugs from the evidencestockpile and trying to market them to regional drug dealers. Of course, police corruption is not new. Theheritage of cops in America includes corruption, racism, andabuse of power for political purposes. The urban police forcesstarted in the 1840s followed the.orders of political machineslike Tammany Hall. Aficionados of Raymond Chandler's private eye,Philip Marlowe, will recall his good luck in encountering anoccasional honest cop as he roamed Southern California in the1930s. Ironically, it was the LAPD-whose recent problems haveamplified police departments'- sins nationwide-under theleadership of William IL Parker, that first gained its freedomfrom politics to become a professional force. One, of the fundamental problems of Americanpolicing is the conflict between law-enforcement duties andmaintaining order in the streets. For example, the Los AngelesPolice Department is probably the most arrest-happy department inthe country. By contrast, cops in other cities send drunks home,overlook minor violations and seek to keep the streets calmwithout resorting to arrest. Also, the L.APD, as well as otherpolice forces, maintain control by aggressively policing minoritycommunities. Resisters are taught a lesson and, if necessary,punished physically, especially if they show "contempt ofcop". Politicians and officials whose careers depend ontough-on-crime rhetoric are reluctant to ask too many questionsabout what the cops are doing. Indeed. public fear of crime has made itincreasingly difficult for the relatively small number of policechiefs who really care to get civil-service commissions to upholddiscipline in their ranks. And the few district attorneys willingto prosecute cops for unnecessary use of force find it difficultto get juries to convict officers, especially when the victim ofa police beating is a minority. After all, in a war, you cannottie your soldiers' hands when the "enemy" is sodangerous. True, American policing has greatly improvedsince the civil rights movement directed attention to policeabuses. But the recent outbreak of bad-cop problems has costpolice forces a lot of the credibility they had gained amongminority groups with good policing. Still. there is one silverlining in the cloud of distrust created by the Fuhrman tapes andthe plethora of police scandals: more self scrutiny. We should not, however, make the mistake ofgetting lost in debates about such reform mechanisms ascivilian-review boards, community policing and specialprosecutors. Rather, the essential task is to create withinpolice agencies an incentive to break the code of silence amongthe rank and file and encourage cops to police themselves. Acorrupt, racist or brutal cop will abstain from misconduct onlywhen he looks at the cop next to him and believes that theofficer will -blow the whistle if he hits the suspect. The policevalue system is what permits the kind of behavior that gets bad.headlines. Real reform is possible only when that value systemchanges and cops come to realize that they must policethemselves. For mayors and chiefs, the first step is tostop telling cops they are engaged in war. Next, they andrank-and-file cops must also stop using the "few badapples" defense to obscure the fact that the code of silenceamong honest cops is allowing crooked and racist cops toflourish. Finally, leaders should be honest and acknowledge thatgood cops are now punished, instead of rewarded, if they exposebad cops. Politicians and chiefs must recognize that it is notnegative publicity to weed out misfits; it actually demonstratesto the public that it can trust the police to police themselves. Only when the community can tell the good guysfrom the bad will we be able to get tough on crime. Then, peoplewill report crime to the police, serve as witnesses and, whenthey sit on a jury, believe police testimony. Justice is notserved when juries spend as much time judging the police asdetermining the guilt or innocence of the person on trial.

McNamara Newsday - April 9, 1996 Police suicides, police corruption andmisconduct, high rates of alcoholism, divorce and mentalbreakdowns among cops all offer grim confirmation that policework is grueling and stressful. Gilbert & Sullivan said itbest a long time ago: "A policeman's lot is not a happy one,when the constabulary's duty is to be done." The constabulary's job is particularly hard inNew York City: A study last year reported a rate of 29 suicidesper 100,000 for the NYPD, versus 12 per 100,000 for the generalpopulation. And in a telling episode, off-duty OfficerChristopher Gargan of Merrick pulled out a Glock 9-mm. weapon ata St. Patrick's Day concert and fatally shot himself in the head.He was only 22. Nevertheless, in New York and elsewhere,departments are helping officers deal with psychological stress.These improvements not only benefit officers and their families,but spare citizens the consequences of unstable cops. Of course, a lot of the stress in policing isunavoidable. Cops aren't invited to birthday parties andweddings. People dial 911 only when someone's bleeding or dead.Cops get catapulted from tedious duties into moments of terrorand danger, and relentless closeups of human degradation. . Alongthe way, it becomes far too easy for the police culture to labelthe world as overrun by dirtbags, ingrates - and other cops. Evenentry-level police work is stressful because, unlike rookies inmost other large organizations, patrol officers have to makeinstant life or death decision. If those decisions are wrong, officers can endup in the morgue, the emergency room, the internal affairs unitor even prison, like the cops who assaulted Rodney King. During my years as a police chief, I discovereda number of strategies that helped dilute the strew, thusprotecting the-public from over-the-edge cops. First, pre-hiringpsychological screening is essential. Believe it or not, manypolice agencies still fail to do adequate backgroundinvestigations of recruits. Bad cops are hard to get rid of oncethey obtain civil service tenure. And people carrying badges and guns who don'tbelong in police work are under tremendous personal anxiety. Theyare also time bombs who raise apprehension throughout the ranks.People with a history of psychological problems should not behired as police officers, period. On the other hand, even stable people can comeunglued in police work. The beat police departments are the onesthat drop the John Wayne syndrome and train their personnel to beaware of the inevitability of stress and how to cope with it.Instruction. on proper diet, exercise and how to avoid financial,marital and family problems can all help cops cope with jobpressures. Training courses on these subjects are as important asthose on the law of arrest. Free confidential psychological consultation isanother essential for officers and their families. It turns outto be a bargain for the public in savings on disability pensionsand lawsuits resulting from police misconduct In addition, police management can take stepsto broaden a cop's world. Too often, departments allow officersto sink into a police culture that emphasizes the violence anddepravity cops see. In my experience, the overwhelming majorityof citizens are law-abiding and want to work with the police tomake their neighborhoods safer. But if officers simply respond to scenes ofcrime and violence, they miss the positive: owners' and renters'meetings, parent-teacher gatherings, student conferences andbusiness community meetings. They miss the opportunity, as well,to discover citizens who support good police work. The public,for it's part, loses the opportunity to discover that mostofficers are warm human beings eager to explain their jobs and toshow people how to prevent crime. Given a chance, ordinary citizens can come toappreciate what cops do; and this greatly increases publicconfidence. Relating to normal public values also encourages copsto break the police code of silence and to help in weeding badcops off the force. One ironic source of stress is that policeofficers consistently underrate how much the public respectsthem. The police would handle personal pressure better if theyknew that most people value their work. For example, a recentGallup poll showed that 52 percent of the public expressed highconfidence in the police, surpassed only by confidence in themilitary and organized religion. The police rating was muchhigher than that for business, Congress, the presidency or TV andother news organizations. And why not? What's wrong with a lineof work that aims to protect human life and to prevent innocentpeople from being victimized by law-breakers? Overall, the best way to minimize stress inpolicing is to run a good police department. That means adepartment that acts in partnership with community groups. Itmeans a department with the vision and courage to take the stepsnecessary to minimize public stress about both crime and badcops.

McNamara Wall Street Journal - May 5, 1995 Almost 35 years ago I was the first policemanto reach the scene of a fatal bombing. Someone known as theSunday Bomber had placed a powerful explosive under a seat in asubway car. The bomb went off on a quiet Sunday Morning in NewYork City at the West 125th Street station, a block from where I,a rookie patrolman, stood. I ran to the site and at the bottom ofthe subway stairs found a scene from hell. A huge hole had beentorn through the steel subway car and dozens of people stooddazed and bloody. I approached what appeared to be a bundle ofrags. It was a teenage girl blown almost in half. I leaned overto hear her feeble plea. 'Help me.' But no one could. She diedbefore reaching the hospital. It was nowhere near the scale of the OklahomaCity tragedy, but I remember the feeling of helplessness and rageat whoever had planted the bomb and the determination thatsomething extraordinary had to be done to protect other innocentvictims. Nevertheless, my experience in law enforcement duringthe following 35 years leads me to be nauseated and concerned bythe political posturing in Washington following the Oklahoma Citybombing. The public needs reassuring that the governmentwill not allow widespread terrorism and that government officialsshare the public grief for the innocent victims and theirfamilies. However, the eagerness of the president andcongressional leaders to move in front of TV cameras with hastyproposals for major increases in federal power rings ofself-aggrandizement and cheapens the nation's sincere moment ofsorrow. The hurried recommendations-to hire more federal agents,to change intelligence-gathering guidelines. to increase wiretapsurveillance, and to involve military personnel in investigationsor civilians-are hypocritical and potentially harmful. If our elected leaders truly believe thatincreased danger of terrorism warrants such extraordinary powers,how do they explain that few federal and government facilitieshave taken precautions to prevent attacks since the Oklahoma Citybombing?. I have inspected a number of facilities since theattack. Security personnel have not been on alert, nor has thegovernment taken the routine precaution of diverting vehiculartraffic to prevent car bombings. We should also remember that Timothy McVeigh,charged in the Oklahoma City bombing, was quickly apprehendedwithout the U.S. passing new laws and spending additionalbillions of dollars. It is also important to recall that duringthe 20 Years since reasonable guidelines were established forintelligence gathering by federal agents on citizens, the U.S.has not been overwhelmed by terrorist acts. The FBI can and doesgather intelligence on domestic groups when appropriate.Furthermore, despite our horror in viewing the Oklahoma Cityblast victims, we should remember that more than 25,000 Americansare murdered each year and less than 100 of the killings are byexplosives. More important, it is unlikely that any of thesuggested anti-terrorist legislation would have prevented theOklahoma City bombing. My own experience, which includes headingpolice forces of two of the nation's largest cities, is thatlaw-enforcement intelligence activities are only occasionallyimportant but require constant oversight. The Militia paranoidsare wrong in believing that law-enforcement officers areessentially fascist. Yet there have been countless examplesshowing that power can be abused by initially well meaningofficers given too much secret discretion. Recall Richard Nixon's involvement of theFederal Bureau of Investigation and near involvement of theCentral Intelligence Agency in the Watergate coverup. And. muchmore recently, there was President Clinton's slip in implyingthat radio talk-show hosts critical of his administration wereencouraging potential bombers. Would a president view criticism as potentiallyviolent and therefore worthy of secret FBI surveillance under thenew legislation? It would be most wise to temper our revulsionfor the killers responsible for the Oklahoma City murders and oursorrow for the victim with the realization that during thiscentury the greatest terrorists have been governments like NaziGermany. Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China, and Pol Pot'sCambodia. They murdered millions and millions of their owncitizens in the name of providing security. If terrorism increases here, it will benecessary to take additional precautions to protect the nationHowever, the most reliable way to prevent terrorism is byconducting government in a manner that wins the public's trustand destroys the appeal of the lunatic fringe. It would be ironicif anti-terrorist legislation helped destroy the protections ofour Constitution and turned the delusions of the paranoids intoreality.

McNamara Wall Street Journal - January 15, 1996 During my 35 years in law enforcement, I foundthat police officers were unabashed conservatives, vigorouslydenouncing welfare and other government handouts. Yet too oftencops display a liberal, big government mentality when it comes totheir own funding. A small example of this mindset can be found inthe latest newsletter from an association of retired New YorkCity police brass. The retired police supervisors were unhappythat under the Republican plan the "annual premium forMedicare would nearly double from the present $46 to $90 by theyear 2002." Keep in mind that patrol officers now makeapproximately $65,000 a year in New York City and that topexecutives receive at least twice that. After 20 years ofservice, cops retire at half pay and with generous medicalbenefits. Many (like me) then go on to second careers. It'srevealing that even an affluent bunch of retired cops is ready tosell out their conservative ideology for $44 over six years. So it should hardly be surprising that when thestakes are higher, the cops are willing to support a lawenforcement policy run out of Washington. Recall how many timeslast year you saw President Clinton denouncing crime whilestanding in front of ranks of uniformed cops gathered from aroundthe country. These cops were lending their support to PresidentClinton's plan to spend billions in federal money to hire 100,000more police officers around the country. Now, we don't hear manyof these officers speaking up for the House passed Republicancrime bill, which would offer "block grants". insteadof money earmarked for a specific number of officers. In fact these high-ranking police officersappear to be backing a program destined to do little, ifanything, for their stated mission-reducing crime. When evenchampions of the status quo like the police are turning to thewelfare state, it is a dire warning to the Republicans to staywith "block grants" and not yield to the Clintonadministration's quest for to pay for 100,000 more police withfederal funds. Empirical evidence suggests that anticrimelegislation emanating from Washington has done little more thancreate a fiscal crisis for state and local governments forced tobuild more prisons and hire more judges, prosecutors, publicdefenders and prison guards. From 1982 to 1992 total government expendituresfor the justice system increased by 162%. However, federaljustice expenditures increased by 291% while municipalitiesincreased justice spending by only 115%. These enormous increasesoccurred even before President Clinton's $33 billion dollar crimebill passed last year. Crime has declined during recent years butmost of that decline is due to changing demographics, not tohigher spending. The biggest increases occurred for i prisonexpenditures. Long mandatory sentences passed by Congress causeda 549% increase in the amount of tax dollars spent to lock peopleaway in federal prisons. As a former policeman, I applaud seeingmurderers, rapists, robbers and other violent criminals lockedup. Alas, more than 60% of the inmates in federal prisons areincarcerated for non-violent crimes. Many are there for drugcrimes, even though putting them behind bars has not led to anydiminution in drug trafficking or drug use. Instead, clogging thejustice system with drug offenders allows a number of violentcriminals to fall through the cracks and go on hurting people. Policing has always been a local business.Despite the publicity given to the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, there are only 11,000 FBI agents compared with600,000 local police. Some police departments need additionalofficers. Others are poorly managed and wasteful. It is stillcommon in many cities to see police stations full of cops whoshould be on the streets. New York City Police CommissionerWilliam Bratton has shown that simply redeploying existingofficers, and instituting new management techniques, can helpreduce crime. But when money comes from Washington, there islittle or no incentive for local governments to engage in thekind of priority-setting needed to effectively combat crime.During the 18 years that I spent as a police chief, I found thata locally elected city council would balance my requests for moreofficers with other needs. The police and other city departmentswere judged on how personnel were used and whether citizens hadgotten the kind of service they deserved. At times it waspainful, but this kind of local competition serves taxpayers alot better than getting funny money from Washington. That message doesn't seem to have gottenthrough to a lot of my former colleagues in law enforcement. Thuswe see cops traipsing off to Washington to serve as props forPresident Clinton's photo ops. (How can they afford this, anyway,if they claim they don't have enough money to combat crime?) Wealso see retired cops bellyaching about the Medicare cutbacksmentioned earlier. Instead of crying for more help from UncleSam, police executives should ask Washington to take less intaxes from localities to allow cities to hire and use policeaccording to local needs and not based on some grand plan fromfederal bureaucrats.

That's why research undertaken by JosephMcNamara, former police chief of San Jose, is especiallystartling. McNamara, now a research fellow at theconservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, surveyednearly 500 police chiefs, police officers, district attorneys,public defenders, lawyers, judges and Stanford students. Exceptfor the police, who hail from across the country, they live inNorthern California. He found that 95 percent of the police officersbelieved the United States was losing the war on drugs, and 98percent thought drug abuse was not primarily a police problem.Just over 90 percent of the cops said increased prevention andtreatment could control drugs more effectively. More than 30percent of the cops said that legalization or decriminalizationwould cause a decrease in drug use or else not affect it. A majority of a those surveyed said the answerwas not more military intervention, prisons, police orprosecutors. This newspaper has long urged a change innational drug priorities. More money needs to be spent onprevention and treatment. Less money should be blown on exoticenforcement boondoggles. Harsh prison sentences for minor drugoffenses waste private lives and public money. So, what gives with President Clinton and LeeBrown, his drug czar? During the 1992 campaign, Clinton promised toreverse the emphasis of President George Bush's 'war on drugs,'which waged battles using law enforcement "soldiers"with two of every three drug-fighting dollars. Includedwere-costly but inept crop eradication programs in foreigncountries and high-tech drug interdiction along U.S. borders. As president, however, Clinton tapped his $14billion-a-year drug war chest for about the same small portionfor prevention and treatment. Drug czar Brown has been nearly invisible. Heclaims drug use in America has declined markedly, but otherevidence just says no. One in five state prisoners across thecountry has been convicted of a drug offense. Crack cocaine issmoked openly on some city streets. One-quarter of U.S. highschool students said they had been offered, sold or given drugson campus. With a tin ear to the real solutions, thegovernment pursues its outdated, expensive and ineffectual drugwar. "Elected officials think it's political suicide to be'soft on drugs,'" says McNamara. A taste of the climate: "If socialspending prevents crime," says Phil Gramm, senator and GOPpresidential aspirant, "why is America not the safest nationon Earth?" Perhaps Gramm should ask some cops, then sharethe news with Clinton.

What can be done to break the cycle of despair in ourinner cities? What, especially, can be done for their lost youngmen? If we are prepared to look past shibboleths,one answer should come to mind. That is to end the so-called waron drugs. Drugs are terrible. But it is not drugs thathave done the real damage to our society. It is the misbegotteneffort to use the criminal law against them. We tried Prohibition to end alcohol abuse. Itbrought so much crime that we quickly gave up the NobleExperiment. Prohibition of drugs began in 1915. Theexperiment has been going for 80 years now. and by every rationaltest it is a ghastly failure. The huge amounts of money spent in recent yearson the drug war have not reduced addiction. Per capita use ofcocaine has in fact increased. And the effort to stop drug use by harsher andharsher criminal penalties has had devastating side effects. Ithas made importation and distribution of the forbidden productsimmensely profitable. That in turn has lured large numbers ofyoung men, even children, into the trade. "We're giving these kids a criminalidentity," Joseph D. McNamara, former police chief inCalif., said, "when we should be trying to find everypossible way to keep them in school and get them intoemployment!" Mr. McNamara is now a research fellow at theHoover Institution in Stanford, Calif. Last May, Hoover put on aconference about drug policy. The participants Included GeorgeShultz, the former Secretary of State, Milton Friedman, theeconomist - both also at the Hoover Institution - and dozens ofpolice officials. The participants ended by favoring.overwhelmingly, medical and educational alternatives to the waron drugs. "Any objective group that studies the war on drugshas to recognize that it's a disaster." Mr. McNamara toldThe Palo Alto (Calif.) Weekly. "It is not stopping thespread of drug abuse, It's causing a good deal more crime andviolence than we'd otherwise have, and it's having severenegative effects on race relations in America." Another terrible cost of the drug war is theincarceration of enormous numbers of people. This country now hasmore than one million prisoners, many of them sentenced to longterms, for nonviolent drug crimes. It costs upward of $20,000 ayear for each one - and it will cost hundreds of billions tobuild new prisons. The racial impact of the drug war isparticularly devastating.. One third of this country's black menbetween 20 and 29 are now in prison or under supervision of thecriminal justice system, most of them for drug crimes. Then there is the murderous quality of life inurban ghettos. Guns accompany the drug trade, and small childrenare incidental victims of the street battles that result. By oneestimate, we have 10,000 drug-related homicides a year. If we began to decriminalize our drug laws.there might be an increase, perhaps temporary, in casual use. Butagainst that possibility one has to weigh the great gains forsociety in taking the profit out of the trade. That is one point. made in a compelling pieceon drugs in the October issue of The Washington Monthly. byJoshua Wolf Shenk. It argues that we must try to limit drug use -but not use methods that do more harm than good. Cigarettes have been found to addict youngusers more than any other drug, Mr. Shenk points out; and 400,000Americans die prematurely each year because of tobacco use. Butwe fight that problem not by criminal prohibition but by rulesand, education, which have substantially reduced smoking. Politically, it is very hard to talk senseabout drugs. President Clinton has just signed legislationrejecting a recommendation of the Federal Sentencing Commissionto end the grotesque disparity of sentences for crack and regularcocaine: up to 100 times more for the former. But some day we may have political leadersbrave enough to do what most of the police authorities and judgeswho are on the front line-have concluded is essential - stop theself destruction of the war on drugs.

Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Other Publications | Joseph McNamara Collection Has the Drug War Created an Officer Liars'Club? By Joseph D. McNamara Los Angeles Times - February 11, 1996 Are the nation's police officers a bunch ofcongenital liars? Not many people took defense attorney Alan M.Dershowitz seriously when he charged that Los Angeles cops aretaught to lie at the birth of their careers at the PoliceAcademy. But as someone who spent 35 years wearing a policeuniform, I've come to believe that hundreds of thousands oflaw-enforcement officers commit felony perjury every yeartestifying about drug arrests. These are not cops who take bribes or commitother crimes. Other than routinely lying, they are law-abidingand dedicated. They don't feel lying under oath is wrong becausepoliticians tell them they are engaged in a "holy war"fighting evil. Then, too, the "enemy" these mostlywhite cops are testifying against are poor blacks and Latinos. The federal government reports that more than1.3 million drug arrests were made in 1994, 480,000 of whichinvolved marijuana. About 1 million of the total drug arrestswere for possession, not selling. Despite government drug-warpropaganda that big-time dealers are its targets, only 24% of thetotal drug arrests were for selling. Almost all those arrestedfor selling are small-timers, in large part, supporting their owndrug use. Often they are inveigled by undercover police to up theante. Many of the arrests for selling are made without searchwarrants and almost all the possession arrests are withoutwarrants. In other words, hundreds of thousands of policeofficers swear under oath that the drugs were in plain view orthat the defendant gave consent to a search. This may happenoccasionally but it defies belief that so many drug users arecareless enough to leave illegal drugs where the police can seethem or so dumb as to give cops consent to search them when theypossess drugs. But without this kind of police testimony. theevidence would be excluded under a 1961 U.S. Supreme Courtdecision, Mapp vs. Ohio. I became a New York City policeman five yearsbefore the Mapp decision. We were trained to search people whoappeared suspicious. I questioned the apparent contradictionposed by the 4th Amendment, which guaranteed that people would besecure in their person and house from a search without a warrant.The instructor said not to worry. A suspect could sue in a civilaction but no jury would find against a cop trying to stop dopefrom being sold. He went on to say that if the courts reallymeant it, they wouldn't allow such evidence into a criminaltrial. In its Mapp decision, the Supreme Court cited this policeattitude and the routine violations of the 4th Amendment asreasons enough to establish a national rule to exclude illegallyobtained evidence. Gradually, as police professionalizationincreased, police testimony became more honest. But the trendreversed in 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon declared a waragainst drugs and promised the nation that drug abuse would soonvanish. Succeeding presidents and Congresses repeated this falsepledge despite evidence that drug use, drug profits, and drugviolence increased regardless of expanded enforcement and harsherpenalties. Because the political rhetoric described a holy war inwhich evil had to be defeated, questioning police tactics wasequivalent to supporting drug abuse. Leaders of the drug war dehumanize their"enemy"-not just foreign drug traffickers but alsoAmerican users. This mentality pushes the police into making evermore arrests. Arrests that can only survive in court because ofperjured police testimony. The fact that enforcement falls mostheavily on people of color also encourages illegal policetactics. Non-whites are arrested at four to five timesthe rates whites are arrested for drug crimes, regardless of thefact that 80% of drug crimes are committed by whites. The"war" dehumanizes the cops as well as those theypursue. The eroding integrity of law-enforcementofficers and the resulting decrease in public credibility arecosts of the drug war yet to be acknowledged. Within the last fewyears, police departments in Los Angeles, Boston, New Orleans,San Francisco, Denver, New York and in other large cities havesuffered scandals involving police personnel lying under oathabout drug evidence. Some officers in the New York City policeand New York State police departments were convicted offalsifying drug evidence. Yet, President Bill Clinton appointedthe heads of those agencies to be drug czar and chief of the DrugEnforcement Agency, respectively, and they were confirmed in theSenate. The message that politicians seem to be sending to thenation's police chiefs is that we understand that police perjuryis a part of the drug war. But recently a number of police leaders haveconceded that racially disparate arrest rates and illegal policesearches and testimony are a problem. Last year, for example, NewYork Police Commissioner William J. Bratton warned his officersnot to lie about how they obtained evidence, saying that he wouldrather they lose the case than commit perjury. Last month,Baltimore Police Commissioner Thomas C. Frazier ordered his copsto stop arresting drug users and to concentrate on criminalscommitting gun crimes and other violence. The vast majority of police forces are stillbeing pushed into waging a war against drugs by politicians whoignore history and mislead the public into believing such a warcan be won. Consequently, hundreds of thousands of illegal policesearches take place and are lied about in court while drug-warhawks pontificate about the immorality of people putting certainkinds of chemicals into their bloodstream.

McNamara Los Angeles Times - October 8, 1995 It would be a profound mistake to believe thatthe acquittal of O.J. Simpson of double murder was simply thejury's response to the LAPD's sloppy investigation, faultyhandling and analysis of the evidence, or to the racism of MarkFuhrman. It certainly was that. But it was also much more-a voteof no confidence in the Los Angeles Police Department Once, when I was on foot patrol in Harlem, anAfrican American woman with a head wound approached me."Officer," she apologized. "I know you're verybusy. but I've just been robbed." I wasn't at all busy. butI wondered what we white cops were doing that caused a victim toapologize for reporting an armed robbery. The LAPD should view the Simpson verdict as asimilar call for self-scrutiny. If the Police Department were aprivate business, it would long ago have gone bankrupt becausesignificant numbers of its customers have no faith in itsproduct. Unfortunately, the LAPD, like the Postal Service, doesnot have to worry about customers taking their businesselsewhere. Yet, effective policing requires that the departmentunderstand why it is distrusted. why it is losing credibility,and try to stop it. When I was hired to run the San Jose PoliceDepartment, it was known as a little LAPD-a reference to amilitary style of policing that alienates minorities. There wasno communication between rank-and-file police and theneighborhoods they patrolled. Then, for a number of years, beat offices weredirected to leave their patrol cars and attend school andneighborhood meetings and to hear what the people thought ofthem. At times, it was painful. But in the end. mutual respectdeveloped; the public began to participate more in police issues. Officers learned what services were needed. Atthe same time, procedures were improved for receiving andinvestigating citizen complaints. A number of cops who refused toget the menage ended up in other occupations. Most important,officers began to realize that unless people reported crimes.provided evidence. served as witnesses and-when onjuries-believed police testimony, criminals would not beconvicted. Training was provided for the police to learnabout the diverse cultures that made up San Jose. This helpedeliminate some of the negative stereotypes that can all tooeasily flourish in departments. Interestingly enough. the policemade more arrests than ever. and crime decreased to the pointthat San Jose became one of the safest large cities in America, acity of minorities. There are no panaceas to prevent crime, but themilitary model of policing, which is supposed to scare criminalsinto obeying the law, is a failure. What the LAPD must realize isthat it is, above all, a service agency obligated to providecommunities with the kind of lawful policing they desire anddeserve. Community condemnation of crime is a stronger deterrentthan police-state methods. which create sympathy for criminals. In addition to establishing real communicationwith neighborhoods and a sense of partnership, the police shouldabandon drug-war tactics and strongly support campaigns to treatand educate drug users. Criminologist Alfred A. Blumstein hasdescribed the drug war as an assault on the African Americancommunity that would not be tolerated by whites. A study releasedby the Sentencing Project bears this out. African Americans andLatinos, the study concludes, constitute nearly 90% of offenderssentenced to state prison for drug possession. Ending the drugwar would eliminate many of the racial inequities in thecriminal-justice system and would be a step toward rehabilitatingthe image of officers in minority communities. The police did not create America's raceproblems and will not solve them. Nonetheless, denying that thepolice and law enforcement need to be improved only aggravates anopen sore. Disclosure of police abuses during the civil-rightsmovement forced a healthy self-scrutiny in law enforcement andled to increased community efforts to improve policing. Theresult was a steady improvement in police relations withminorities. It is time to acknowledge that much of thatprogress has eroded. The minority community, which has thehighest crime rates. must come to realize that it suffers themost when law enforcement fails to punish violent criminals. Itis not enough to merely criticize the police and celebrate policefailures. Minorities must work with the police to reduce racialpolarization by establishing trust in justice and better safetyin neighborhoods.

McNamara San Jose Mercury News November 5, 1993 Let's get real. Calling out the National Guardto police cities will not stop crime and violence any more thanchiding Hollywood about violent programming will we need to talkabout race and inner city culture and stop chasing diversions.Even in the United States, we have to be constantly vigilantagainst creeping totalitarianism. Sharon Pratt Kelly, the mayor of Washington,recently sought authority to call out the National Guard to helpstop the killings in the nation's capital. Fortunately, PresidentClinton denied the request. While the Guard has recently been used inPuerto Rico and Sumter, S.C., for policing, my own experience asa police officer in New York's Harlem during the 1960s riots and,later, as a police chief is that the National Guard isn't eventhat efficient in its traditional role of quelling disorder. Guardsmen panicked at Kent State University in1970 and fired into a crowd of demonstrating students, killingfour. During the urban riots of the 1960s, the Guard's record waseven worse. In Detroit, nervous Guardsmen fired at imaginarysnipers and 40 people died while the disorder continued for days.More recently, in Los Angeles after the first verdict in theRodney King beating case, the Guard, after being alerted well inadvance, took the field only after the game was over and smokefrom the burning city closed Los Angeles Airport for three days. This is not to fault individual Guardsmen - whoget only a few weeks training a year in military combat. Policingsimply isn't their job. We should remember what Gen. Colin LPowell said: "A soldier's duty is to kill the enemy."But the duty of a police officer is something far different: toprotect life and property and to arrest criminals within dueprocess of law. Under our democratic system, military personnelhave no legal or traditional basis for doing routine policing Forso many years, that was the image of Iron Curtain nations, whoneeded to clamp down on their own people. Just as it is unrealistic to expect the policeto stop violence flowing from the decay of inner-cityneighborhoods, it is silly to think that rifle-toting Guardsmen,riding around in jeeps with no idea of what they are expected todo, will make people safer. After the initial shock, the presenceof troops wears off. Street criminals quickly realize the Guardcan't use their military weaponry any more than cops are allowedto shoot without cause. In addition, soldiers are tooinexperienced to make arrests with the same savvy cops have. The truth America shirks from is that thenational rate of violence is high, but it is about the same as itwas 20 years ago. However, violence is much worse in poor,minority neighborhoods. The No. I cause of death for young, blackmen is homicide. While a few racists may think thatAfrican-Americans are predisposed to violence, the overwhelmingmajority of people know this a foolish idea. This means we shouldlook for root causes of violence in the culture of inner cities.It is clear that the curse of slavery and subsequentdiscrimination, along with unwise government policies on welfare,housing and education, encouraged the development of an urbanunderclass that commits much - but certainly not all - of today'stroubling violence. This is not to excuse such conduct. Foreveryone's safety, violent criminals need to be quickly andfirmly punished and separated from society. However, it is farbetter to avoid having innocent people victimized in the firstplace. That means we must do a better job in understanding theculture that produces so many young people with no respect forthe life and property of others. Declarations of wars against crime and drugs bypoliticians will not be any more effective than former LosAngeles Police Chief Daryl Gates threats against gang leaders.The sweep arrests accompanying such rhetoric get thrown out ofcourt and petty arrests take scarce police officers off thestreets. Worse still, such police tactics undermine what doeswork - partnerships between local people and the police to cleanup the neighborhoods. In the long run, it will be neighborhood peoplewho change the negative values leading kids to destructivebehavior. The government should cheer such local leadership andempower neighborhoods to change things. We tried thelaw-and-order model for the past decade - quadrupling the numberof people behind bars - but the crime rate is about the same.It's time to stop doing more of what hasn't worked. A couple of immediate suggestions that wouldhelp are to let local neighborhoods ban guns. Not only would itprevent senseless violence, it would repudiate the machomentality that causes so many assaults. In addition, we shouldstop continually asking for more police than we can afford andpay more attention to police-operations that take cops off thestreet. Many departments still have lots of cops doing clericaltasks that would be better accomplished by non-sworn personnel Of course, such simple solutions do not satisfythe political craving to. show voters you are "tougher"on crime than your opponents. On the other hand, if electedofficials really want to do something about crime, they have toreplace the hot air with cold logic.

Retired Los Angeles Police DepartmentDetective Mark Fuhrman spouts venomous racism and brags to anaspiring screenwriter about torturing, beating, and framingsuspects. Cops across the country pull robberies while inuniform, sell dope, steal drug-buy money, shake down criminals,accept bribes and falsify evidence against criminal defendants.The standard defense coming from law enforcement is that only arelative handful of the 400,000 cops nationwide go bad. Forseveral reasons, the public is not reassured. First, the number of reported cases of bad copsis rising. Some Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriffs get caughtrobbing and extorting money from drug dealers. In New Orleans, a uniformed cop is accused ofmurdering her partner and shop owners during a robbery committedwhile she was on patrol. In Washington, D.C, and in Atlanta, copsin drug stings are arrested for stealing and taking bribes. InBoston, two white cops frame a black man for murdering a whitewoman. In New York State troopers falsify evidence that sendspeople to prison. In San Francisco counterfeit evidence meanshundreds of drug convictions are likely to be overturned. Similarevidence tampering forces the prosecution to reopen many cases inPhiladelphia. It's not just the rank and file, either. Theformer police chief of Detroit, William Hait, is in prison forstealing drug-buy money. In a small New England town, the chiefsteals drugs from the evidence locker for his own use. A numberof southern sheriffs are convicted of being in league with drugsmugglers. Agencies thought to be untouchable are suddenly reaping as many bad headlinesas the perennially troubled New York CityPolice Depaitment. The Drug Enforcement agent who arrestedPanama's Gen. Manuel Noriega on drug-trafficking charges is injail for stealing laundered drug money. The FBI catches one of its agents taking drugsfrom the evidence stockpile and trying to market them to regionaldrug dealers. Of course, police corruption is not new. Theheritage of cops in America includes corruption, racism and abusefor political purposes. The urban police forces started in the1840s followed the orders of political machines like Tamany Hall. Aficionados of Raymond Chandler's private eye,Philip Marlowe, will recall his good luck in encountering anoccasional honest cop as he roamed Southern California in the1930s. Ironically, it was the LAPD - whose recent problems haveamplified police departments' sins nationwide - under theleadership of William F. Parker, that first gained its freedomfrom politics to become a professional force. One of the fundamental problems of Americanpolicing is the conflict between law-enforcement duties andmaintaining order in the streets. For example, the Los AngelesPolice Department is probably the most arrest-happy department inthe country. By contrast, cops in other cities send drunks home,overlook minor vio. lations and seek to keep the streets calmwithout resorting to arrest. Also, the LAPD, as well, as other Policeforces, maintain control by aggressively policing minoritycommunities. Resisters are taught a lesson and, if necessary,punished physically, they show "contempt of cop".Politicians and officials whose careers depend on tough-on-crimerhetoric are reluctant to ask too many questions about what thecops are doing. Indeed, public fear of crime has made it increasingly difficult for the relatively smallnumber of police chiefs who really care to get civil-servicecommissions to uphold discipline in their ranks. And the fewdistrict attorneys willing to prosecute cops for unnecessary useof force find it difficult to get juries to convict officers.especially when the victim of a police hearing is a minority.After all in a "war", "You cannot tie yoursoldiers' hands when the 'enemy' is so dangerous." American policing has greatly improved sincethe civil rights movement directed attention to police abuses.But the recent outbreak of bad-cop problems has cost policeforces a lot of the credibility they had gained among minoritygroups with good policing. Still, there is one silver lining inthe cloud of distrust craeted by the Fuhrman tapes and theplethora of police scandals: more self-scrutiny. We should not, however, make the mistake ofgetting lost in debates about such reform mechanisms asdvilian-review boards, community policing and specialprosecutors. Rather, the essential task is to create withinpolice agencies an incentive to break the code of silence amongthe rank and file and encourage cops to police themselves. A corrupt, racist or brutal cop will abstainfrom misconduct only when he looks at the cop next to him andbelieves that the officer will blow the wrhistle if he hits thesuspect. The police value system is what permits the kind ofbehavior that gets bad headlines. Real reform is possible onlywhen that value system cops come to realize that must policethemselves. For mayors and chiefs, the first step is tostop telling cops they are engaged in war. Next, they andrank-and-file cops must also stop using the "few badapples" defense to obscure the fact that the code of silenceamong honest cops is allowing crooked and racist cops toflourish. Finally, leaders should be honest andacknowledge that good cops are now punished, instead of rewarded,if they expose bad cops. Politicians and chiefs must recognizethat it is not negative publicity to weed out misfit; it actuallydemonstrates to the public that it can trust the police to policethemselves.. Only when the community can tell the g6od guysfrom the bad will we be able to get though on crime. Then, peoplewill-report crime to the police, serve as witnesses and, whenthey sit an a jury, believe police testimony. Justice is notserved when juries spend as much time judging the police asdetermining the guilt or innocence of the person on trial.

McNamara San Jose Mercury News April 7, 1996 The police officers who beat Rodney King haverecently been released from jail, yet, once again, the world isbeing sickened by videotaped pictures of uniformed Americanpolice officers savagely beating unresisting people. Last week, television cameras caught Riversidedeputy sheriffs swinging their batons in rage against a man andwoman who had led them on a high-speed chase while driving atruck full of suspected illegal aliens. A week earlier in a suburb of Los Angeles,police shot and killed the driver of a vehicle after he tried toelude them and drove at plainclothes officers brandishing theirguns. In South Carolina, an officer actually used his policecar's video equipment to record himself using unnecessary forceagainst a woman motorist. These, and similar cases raise troublingquestions. How much police brutality occurs that isn't recorded?Is it directed primarily against minorities because of policeracism? Is there something special about high speed chases?Finally, do police departments have appropriate policies on theuse of force? Immediately after the Rodney King incident thepolice chief of Los Angeles labeled the incident an"aberration." However, this view was contradicted bymany citizens and groups who complained that brutal treatment bythe LAPD was the norm not the exception. The Christopher Commission, appointed by themayor and city council, criticized the department for allowingracist comments, failing to adequately receive and investigatecomplaints of unnecessary force by the police, and notcontrolling a number of officers who had received an unusuallylarge number of complaints. A Los Angeles officer told the commission thatthe use of questionable force against suspects did not violatethe department' s value system. On the whole, allegations ofroutine brutality by the LAPD seemed more valid than the chief'sclaim of an aberration, But, recent cases of police brutality involvedifferent police departments spread across the nation.Frequently, a high-speed chase triggers the encounter andusually, although not always, the victim of the police batons isa member of a minority group. Only one thing is certain. Thepercentage of people of minority background who believe that thepolice are racist and brutal is much higher than in whiteAmerica. The same disparities in trust among races showed inpolls concerning the guilt or innocence of OJ Simpson and generalfairness of the criminal justice system. The chase I remember what it was like to be behind thewheel of a police car and involved in a high-speed chase. Thefleeing vehicle ignores your-emergency lights and siren, drivesrecklessly, creating great danger for innocent people as well aspursuing cops. It is the ultimate disrespect for your authorityas a police officer Everyone except a few weird militia groupiesaccept the authority of the police to regulate traffic. So, itbegins to build in your, mind that this person driving sorecklessly must have done something terrible in addition to thetraffic violations he is accumulating with abandon. Your angergrows into rage as the chase continues. However, we captured far more patheticmotorists with expired drivers' licenses or kids on a joy ridethan armed robbers, Panic, not a hardened criminal mentality, ledto the wild flight. Nevertheless, every cop is well aware of thatevery year more than a dozen police officers are fatally shotwhile investigating people in motor vehicles. Police officersneed to be cautious while simultaneously taking decisive actionto arrest the suspect. This is the danger point. The furiousflailing of a baton becomes a release of anger, satisfying a needto punish, rather than an application of necessary force to makean arrest. The law is quite clear. The police may usereasonable force necessary to defend themselves or to make anarrest. In the moment of encounter what may seem reasonable to anofficer may later be judged to have been excessive, yet this isquite rare. Society traditionally forgives an officer whofelt great danger when it later turns out to be absent.' However,repeated heavy blows to unresisting prisoners on the ground canhardly be excused in the name of self-defense. Solutions It seems to me that all police agencies need torevisit their policies on the use of force. In my early days as aNew York police officer we were allowed to use batons forself-defense, but not to bring about compliance. It is a subtlebut essential point. Most Western police departments allow officersto hit suspects with batons for not obeying the officer'sdirections to lie on the ground or assume some other searchposture even though the suspect has shown no aggression towardthe officer. The problem, as we have seen too often onvideotape, is that people being hit with a club try to coverthemselves in order to escape injury which can lead to more blowsfor not "complying." It would be a rare individual whotook no evasive or defensive action under such punishment. And,we must remember that they were pursued for minor violations, notserious crimes 4n which an officer would be justified in fearingthat the suspects were armed. The amount of force must be weighedagainst the seriousness of the suspected crime and the potentialdanger to the officers. Police agencies must vigorously train officersto recognize that they are likely to be excited and angry inchases and other arrest situations but as police officers theymust know how to control their emotions and how to stop othercops who are losing control. After all, most of the people thepolice arrest for criminal assaults and murders also felt thattheir rage was justified. In addition, police departments must ensurethat supervisors respond and take charge of sensitive incidents.The supervisors must be well trained in defusing anger amongtheir fellow workers. Some of the officers who got into troubleseemed to have no sense that they had done anything wrong andother officers standing around seemed not to know how tointervene. Clearly, their departments had failed to make it clearto these officers what policies they were expected to follow andwhat consequences they would face if they broke the rules. In the end, police departments must convincetheir officers that they are public servants acting inpartnership with the community to prevent crime. Despite thepronouncements of politicians, cops are not soldiers in warsagainst crime and drugs. There is no enemy for the police todestroy. The job of cops is to enforce the law for ourprotection. Those who are sworn to enforce the law are also swornto obey it. The overwhelming majority of cops deserve credit forliving by this code, but we must insist that they must do more toweed out those who don't.

My Question: In all my study and review of the information regarding thisissue, one question keeps coming back to me. Let's assume - forthe sake of argument - that marijuana has no medical valuewhatsoever, despite the fact that it has a several thousand yearhistory of medical use and that a prescription drug is made fromits primary active ingredient. Let's assume - for the sake ofargument - that all these medical marijuana patients are justfooling themselves. Even in that case, what would we stand to gain as a society bypunishing sick people and putting them through an alreadyoverloaded criminal justice system? Even if they are deludingthemselves -- what benefit is there to prosecuting sickpeople?

MEYERS, M.D. Professor of Pharmacology, University of California, SanFrancisco, Ca. The Drug Policy Foundation's CME Seminar Washington, D.C. November 13, 1992 Introduction Change in the laws regulating the use of marijuana-certainly aprimary goal of this group-has been effectively blocked by thesuccessful efforts of the enforcement industry to convince thecitizenry that the use of marijuana presents a terrible danger tothe user and to society. Efforts to rebut the claims of theprohibitionists have been enfeebled by the confusion that some ofus feel. Proselytizers insist not on an absence of significantdanger but on some positive, mystic and generally ineffablebenefit from the use of marijuana. Observers with less subjectiveoverlay also appear at a loss in formulating the pharmacology ofCannabis, and both groups thus play into the hand of those whoencoded marijuana as an hallucinogen or who plead for delayingaction pending further research. Even the technical or scientific reviews of the drug bynominal experts are little more than catalogues suffused withuncertainty, timidity and even error generated by the confusionimposed by law and street lore. The defects in the literature arenot due to a lack of data from research but to a failure orinability to apply any unifying or organizing concept to thefragments of information. It will not be difficult to supply youwith that key: cannabis in its several forms and essences is justanother member of a large group of drugs, call them for themoment general anesthetic-sedative-hypnotics, all of whichare used (and abused) at some time and in some form by sometechnique by some individuals to relieve anxiety, to providesurcease from memory and to cross the borders of consciousnessand sometimes even of life. Members of this group of drugs, exemplified by alcohol,Valium, and the other agents in the incomplete list in Figure 1,all have characteristic, identifying effects in common, Theydiffer one from another largely in their duration of action andspeed of onset of effect. Some of them, especially alcohol, haveimportant organic toxicity not seen in others. It will also benecessary to discuss the differences in the slope of thedose-response relationship, that is the margin of safety.However, the most important preliminary matter is the effect ofthe route of administration on the manifest actions of a drug. SMOKE AS A DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM Many people, including those smokers of marijuana who use wineor beer to reinforce and prolong the effect, will resist theconclusion, established below, that marijuana and alcohol arecomparable pharmacologically. Their intuitive feeling that therecan be no relation between the instantaneous, transient euphoriafrom a joint and the more slowly developing and persistent goodfeeling after a drink is understandable but mistaken. Before thesimilarity of effects can be convincingly presented, however, theinfluence of the route of administration on the temporalrelations of the response must be clarified by as brief aspossible a discussion of the distribution and transformation ofTHC, the active ingredient of cannabis, after it enters the bodywhether swallowed or inhaled. The differences claimed to exist between marijuana and alcohol(or Valium or whatever) virtually disappear if the reference drugis given by mouth and is compared with THC also orallyadministered. (Careful metabolic studies of crude drug usingspecial chocolate cookies are also available.) THC, it turns out,is actually much more slowly metabolized and excreted thanalcohol (Figure 3 and 6). THC, like phenobarbital orchlordiazepoxide (Librium), is best given as a cumulative drug,and the amount in the body at equilibration is enormous comparedto the amount provided by one cigarette. Why then does thecigarette provide such an immediate and intense effect? First of all, realize that the particles in the smoke thatcarry the drug are colloidal in size; so small that they arecarried by the inspired air to the depths of the lung where thedrug can be instantaneously absorbed across the alveolarmembrane. The efficiency of this process is already apparent toyou by analogy with the two common methods of cocaine delivery.Smoked free-based (crack) is absorbed with a velocity resultingin levels comparable to those seen after intravenous injection.In contrast, the particles of inhaled cocaine salt are relativelylarge, are deposited on the mucosa of the upper respiratory tractand absorption is not much more rapid than after swallowing thedrug. The THC in smoke is rapidly transferred to the essentiallyaqueous blood and carried immediately to the left heart and intothe arteries, that is, the liver is not included in this firstpass and the absorbed THC is diluted by a relatively small volumeof arterial blood that is pumped to the tissues. Differencevascular beds have differing blood flows. The cerebral blood flowis relatively large and the brain is a fatty organ in thechemical sense. THC is partitioned from the blood into the lipidsof the brain tissue. Immediately after inhalation, then, a highconcentration of THC is built up in the brain and the subjectiveexperience begins. The THC remaining in the blood undergoes two additionalprocesses. Some reaches the liver and a fraction is alteredchemically- some accumulates in other fatty organs especiallyordinary adipose tissue. This accumulation slowly removes THCfrom the blood. :The accumulation is slow because blood flow tothese depots is low. However, as THC is removed from the blood,the concentration in the blood falls below that in the brain andthe THC passes from the brain back into the blood and thebehavioral effects at least rapidly diminish (Figure 5). It is this rapid accumulation of agent in the brain and itssubsequent redistribution rather than its chemical transformationthat explains the brevity and intensity of the effect. The effectbegins before the subject exhales. As an illustration of theefficiency of smoking consider that in one trial 10-15 mg ofSmoked THC resulted in a peak concentration about eight times asgreat as followed 20 mg by mouth (Figure 3). There are some correlates of THC metabolism unrelated to ourimmediate discussion but worth mentioning in passing. THCaccumulates in fat to a concentration at least twenty fold thatin any other organ, and the slow release of the stored substanceexplains the persistent appearance of THC and its metabolite inthe urine for weeks. (Figures 4 and 6.) Unlike the blood levelsof the very water soluble alcohol, THC levels do not correlatewith its biological effects. Now that we are able to adjust to the different routes of theadministration, we can examine the effects of marijuana andcompare them with the effects of other sedatives. THE SEDATIVE -HYPNOTIC -GENERAL ANESTHETIC GROUP Physicians are conditioned at great expense by the drugindustry to think of available therapeutic agents as thousands ofindividual cases properly identified only by a euphonioustradename. However, the vast amount of information available canbe managed only if drugs are put into classes or categories. Thesame properties that make for a useful therapeutic agent may makefor an enticing social drug, and it is not surprising then thatmost social drugs fit into known categories. There are a very large number of drugs that have similareffects and are fairly included in the categorysedative-hypnotics or anxiolytics although sedative-hypnotic-generalanesthetics would be more accurate. Gases and volatileliquids are often selected for use as general anesthetics becausetheir use can be by inhalation and allow minute to minute controlof dosage and rapid recovery. Solids are more easily dispensedand administered as tablets or capsules and are chosen for use intreating anxiety or inducing sleep, but pharmacologicaly all aresimilar. Figure 1 lists some common drugs from this group. This exercise will now examine the pharmacology of marijuanaand establish that all of the properties of sedatives arepresent. Remember, please, throughout the discussion that effectsare described to establish the drug type. It does not follow thatthese effects are induced regularly or even at all as marijuanais used in our culture, but they are established by quantitativeexperiments in the animal laboratory and by controlled clinicalobservations. EFFECTS OF GRADED DOSE: The simplest way to characterize marijuana and equate theeffects with those of all other sedatives and general anestheticsis to study the effects of doses of increasing size. It isimportant to study the drug over a range of doses because theeffects manifested at a single dose level may mislead. Alcoholeven today is regarded as a stimulant by many people because theysee only the excitement and acting out; with larger or smallerdoses it becomes apparent that alcohol is a depressant and thatthe excitement is actually disinhibition. The sequence of changesare those still conveniently described as the stages ofanesthesia. These changes reflect a diffuse depression of theneuraxis that begins at the highest level of the cortex and atthe caudal segments of the cord. The depression descends andascends until it meets at the medulla and even vegetativefunction stops. Stage 1 was long called the stage of analgesia. With smalldoses, the subject experiences relief of anxiety or euphoria (apositively good feeling) and possibly a slight drowsiness.Psychomotor performance, concentration, short term memory areprogressively impaired in the laboratory situation. Actualperformance (driving on a test course) deteriorates if the doseis adequate and the timing consonant. The flight simulator is auseful tool and shows the same prolonged (24 hours) decrement inperformance seen after the acute effects of the barbiturates.Judgment is obviously difficult to test, but most observersconsider as evidence the inappropriate high humor and confidencein a fumbling, discursive subject. The one generalization that ishard for users of marijuana or of other sedatives to accept is thatusers, whose function and ability to judge their function areboth impaired, are the persons least competent to analyze theeffects of a downer. Stage 2 begins with the appearance of excitement. The degreeof excitement depends not alone on the dose but also on theexpectation of the subject and the setting, that is, on theamount and nature of stimuli from the surroundings. In a calmenvironment the subject may show only an intensification of thechanges listed for Stage 1. In another situation, the patient mayrespond to stimuli in an uncontrolled, exaggerated way. Thisexcitement must not be confused with stimulation. These"drunks" from whatever drug are disinhibited, that is,the highest cortical centers are depressed and lower centers andmore primitive behaviors are released from the inhibition fromabove that ordinarily controls them. The stage ends with the lossof consciousness. The flat dose response curve mentioned above now becomes ofcrucial importance in understanding why marijuana does not cause,as a direct drug effect, the same disinhibited criminal andantisocial activity as does alcohol. Marijuana is in part benignin this regard because the brief effect after smoking is achievedwith a small absolute dose. However, even if the subject isswallowing hashish or THC (which is now marketed), the dangerous(to self or others) dose is many multiples of the threshold doseand, so far as I can establish, never achieved in humans in thiscountry. (There never was any basis for the picture of thehash-crazed assassin. The assassins were a sect in Islam activeat the time of the crusades who were given to religio-politicalmurder but not under the influence of hashish. Theirassassinations were carefully planned and sometimes requiredyears of preparation while, for example, the designatedhit man learned a language and a trade and insinuated himselfinto the court of the victim.) Stage 3, the stage of surgical anesthesia, is easily reachedwith cannabis in the animal laboratory, but the dose-effect curveis so flat that is, so much is required, that it is doubtful ifanyone in the U.S. has ever been anesthetized by cannabis resinin any form. For our purpose, classification, however, the animaldata are enough. Stage 4, the stage of medullary paralysis, is demonstrablewith difficulty even in animals. The oral LD50 of THC in rats isin excess of 600 mg/kg. ANOTHER ACUTE EFFECT Dreamy, Fantasizing State The law thinks that marijuana is an hallucinogen, and anynumber of groups and individuals refer to marijuana as a"mild hallucinogen" and thus terribly confuse theperception of the drug by many citizens. What marijuana does is induce the same state that has beendescribed in association with every sedative-hypnotic that hashad wide use. The effect is most easily and commonly defined inhospitals or offices where sedated patients can make known todoctors and nurses their difficulty in distinguishing dreams andwaking fantasies from reality. The patient may complain bitterlyof the frightening nightmares or may accuse a staff member ofmolesting her. At home the nightmares may be equally frightening,but the erotic dreams cannot be projected onto an attendant andthe dreamy float may actually be pleasurable. The absence of anexact statement about the associated level of consciousness isnot accidental. The process appears separate from the developingconcept of lucid dreaming. This effect is also totally different than that of the nominalhallucinogens such as acid. I say "nominal" because thedreams of the sedated patient are by definition closer tohallucinations than the distortions of perception experiencedwith what, it appears, we will soon have to call rave drugs.These magic agents all have the properties of the sympathomimeticstimulants to a greater (MDA, MDMA) or lesser (LSD) degree. Where the misconceived labeling of marijuana as hallucinatoryoriginated, and how it is maintained is a question of interest tothose of us who hope to see the laws regulating marijuanarationalized. The 1937 enactment, designed to criminalizemarijuana use and thus provide continued federal employment forredundant prohibition agents and a fiefdom for Anslinger,classified marijuana as a narcotic. This irrationality, togetherwith the ruling by the Supreme Court that applying for a taxstamp to handle an illegal substance constituted selfincrimination and would not fly, forced some revisions at justabout the time the early proselytizers for LSD were active. Whenthe hallucinogens were added to the index, marijuana wastransferred to that category. The enforcement industry is, ofcourse, still happy to have it separated from anything familiar.Unfortunately several groups of professionals and marijuanaadvocates are as responsible for maintaining the fallacy as thosefrom the criminal justice system. EFFECTS DURING CONTINUOUS USE Tolerance and Withdrawal The tolerance and withdrawal expected of a sedative doesdevelop with the use of cannabis in concentrated forms. Tolerancestrictly defined has been demonstrated only with the use ofconcentrated forms of cannabis or of THC and an analogue.However, a learning process that is fairly called behavioraltolerance explains some otherwise puzzling observations that aremade on people who smoke grass. Behavioral Tolerance - The manifest expression ofsedative effect depends not alone on the pharmacological effectin the strict sense but also on the expectation of the user andon his reaction to the physiological and behavioral changesperceived. Taken at bedtime, a downer will shorten sleep latency;the same dose at five in the afternoon in a situation thatprovides stimulation and the need to continue to function maylead to excitement. An inexperienced user, notably a first timeuser or someone unexpectedly experiencing a larger than usualdose or someone using in an anxiety laden situation, may beseized by panic. We have no time for case histories, but thehypomania and paranoia that accompanies the disinhibition andanxiety can be alarming to all. If the episode is followed byfeelings of guilt or fear of consequences, the anxiety or paniccan be prolonged or recurrent. Possibly these incidents and thewithdrawal state to be described were the origin of the nowdiscredited claim of a marijuana psychosis. The experienced drinker or marijuana user will not show theseexaggerated reactions, indeed, he will be able to hide some minoreffects consistently. The effects on psychomotor function andcognition will not, however, be lessened, that is the toleranceis more apparent than real. Metabolic Tolerance.- Behavioral tolerance is usuallycontrasted with "real" or metabolic tolerance. However,it seems to me that, in this day of disproportionate interest inbiotransformation and P450, "real" tolerance should bedivided into the metabolic and physiologic. As we shall see, some kind of tolerance to marijuana clearlymust develop since its correlate, withdrawal, is easilydemonstrable. Tolerance, however, is quantitatively minor, and itis not necessary to use larger and larger doses to maintain thesame effect, nor do fixed doses lose their effect with continuedadministration. The point at this moment is that enzyme inductioncannot be important in this situation since frequent users ofmarijuana achieve higher plasma levels after a test dose andexcrete the dose over a longer period than do infrequent users(Figure 6). Physiologic Tolerance - Small but statisticallysignificant degrees of tolerance to the effects on cardiovascular function, amount of REM sleep,psychomotor performance, intraocular pressure, subjectivejudgment of intensity of effect and others developed rapidlywhen, to cite one specific paper, 210 mg per day of THC or theequivalent in the form of crude extract was given for 11-21 days. During the above period of drug administration, physicaldependence developed, for, to anticipate the next paragraph, theabrupt replacement of the drug with a placebo led to signs ofhyperexcitability or stimulation, that is, to withdrawal. Theconstant presence in the body of a depressant had led to theactivation of antagonizing, stimulant or excitatory physiologicsystems. Withdrawal - The signs of withdrawal or physicaldependence appear when the stimulant or excitatory adaptationspersist beyond the e effect of the depressant. In the abovetrial, weight loss, irritability and an increase in time spent inREM sleep were prominent and persisted for 96 hours. Anotherapparently well executed trial gave large doses of a syntheticanalogue of THC for a month. The withdrawal state described upondiscontinuing the drug was more in the expected pattern in thatit developed on the third day and was characterized byrestlessness and disturbed sleep although one subject did develophypomania. Under the same experimental conditions, subjects wereallowed free access to the drug as cigarettes; the averagepatient smoked seventeen cigarettes per day, but no withdrawalstate could be demonstrated. Insofar as our needs for classifying cannabis are concerned,there remains the question of whether withdrawal from strongcannabis could be as intense as the delirium tremens of alcoholwithdrawal and explain some of the "psychotic" episodesalleged to occur. Controlled trials, of course, are not going tobecome available. The clinical reports, notably those fromBritish physicians serving colonial troops, seem convincing tome. Potential for Abuse There is no drug of this category that has not been misusedeither episodically or compulsively. Relief of anxiety is aseductive pharmacological reward, and countless patients andnon-patients are unable to resist using a little more than isprescribed, a little oftener than is necessary. If one looksoutside of our culture to the Muslim world, it appears that acompulsive pattern of use is possible, but in this country themode is the "responsible use" that the consensusapplauds in the case of alcohol. The responsible use of the lessdangerous cannabis is not countenanced because some agency orforcehas convinced our legislators. that marijuana is somehowdifferent from all of its congeners. Other Effects There are a few other minor drug effects common to cannabisand all other sedatives. In the animal laboratory thetetrahydrocannabinols are anticonvulsant and comparable toPhenobarbital. Presumably THC could be used in the human as anantiepileptic, but also presumably the rapid down and up ofsmoked marijuana could destabilize a seizure prone patient. As is necessary to validate our thesis, marijuana depressespolysynaptic spinal cord reflexes. In the laboratory this effectcan be demonstrated independent of the behavioral sedation, butclinically the voluntary muscle relaxant effect of the sedativescannot be shown to be useful beyond or independent of theanxiolytic effect. A discussion of the therapeutic applications of marijuana orof THC, which is available on prescription, would contribute toour argument to the extent that the drug can be shown to act as asedative or anxiety relieving agent. The use of synhexyl as anantidepressant is often mention. Review of the paper by Stockingsusually cited in this regard will establish that he actually usedthe drug for the relief of anxiety. He clearly characterizes hisambulant patients as neurotic and describes the development afterthe administration of the analogue of THC of mild intoxication,euphoria, and dreamy apathy. Given a patient whose vision andocular structure has been destroyed by glaucoma no one wouldwithhold whatever subjective relief a joint would provide, but itwould be misleading to say that marijuana is acting on theglaucomatous process. Whether marijuana has important therapeuticapplications is an emotional issue that can be settled only bycontrolled clinical trials of each proposed application as isrequired for any other new drug or new application. In any case,the questions associated with the use of marijuana as a socialdrug are unrelated. MECHANISM OF ACTION The mechanism of action of this large group of drugs is, ashas been mentioned, a diffuse depression of the entire centralnervous system. However, one action is more specific and isuseful in developing our analogy. The ability of a sedative oranesthetic to cause loss of consciousness is due to thesensitivity of the reticular activating system to theirdepressant effects. When electrodes are implanted into thereticular formation and several functionally related areas in thebrain,, the effect of synhexyl cannot be distinguished from thatof thiopental (Pentothal), that is, the barbiturate and thecannabinoid have a similar mechanism of action. (Synhexyl is aclose analogue of THC that was available in pure form before THC.Careful, controlled double blind studies have shown that humansubjects are unable to distinguish between the two.) In summary then marijuana is a drug which is pharmacologiclysimilar to all other sedatives. There are differences between thevarious sedatives, but these are largely matters of onset andduration of action. The exception is alcohol which must beingested in grams rather than milligrams and which provides emptycalories that replace food that contains protein and vitamins.and in some people the thiamin deficiency can lead to atrophy ofthe brain. Alcohol also has direct toxic effects on the liver,upper GI and respiratory tracts and brain As a direct effect ofits persistent action and the ease with which a grosslydisinhibiting action can be reached, it is responsible formassive social and criminal problems. Having provided you with an outline or framework upon whichyou can hang your further studies and experience with marijuana,I have reached the boundary of my province as a Pharmacologist.In considering the social problems presented by our societalreaction to the use of marijuana, I am a citizen with one vote.However, I believe that the objective pharmacology that I havepresented suggests a well advised direction for change. People who prefer marijuana to alcohol as a social drug canfairly point out that the disinhibitory effect is brief, adangerously intense effect difficult to achieve and the organictoxicity infinitely less than is the case with alcohol. From whatI regard as an objective pharmacologic point of view, I do notsee how we can with any hope of useful outcome acknowledge thatprohibition failed in the case of alcohol and at the same timeapply the discredited remedy to marijuana. It would also beuseful to eliminate the market that bleeds dollars into othereconomies, and undeniably the criminal justice system wouldbecome more useful if relieved of the burden posed by the hugenumber of people who do not feel guilty. Yet I do not wish to encourage the use of marijuana; wecertainly must not reduce regulation to the point that anothercigarette or liquor industry develops. My suggestion is tolegalize cultivation for personal use. References For Figures 1. Huestis, et. al., Characterization of the absorption phaseof marijuana smoking Clin Pharmacol Therap 1992;52:31 2.

Various studies were done to tryto find "Amotivational Syndrome." Some claimed success.Others claimed that there was no such animal. But there was onetrend: the more successful studies were done on young persons. Slikker, Paule, et al. set out to find the effects ofmarijuana smoke on the brain, memory, learning, and motivation.They found that monkees who smoked even just on weekends did notdevelop normal clinical motivation -- defined by the willingnessto work for reward. The studies concentrated on adolescensespecifically for this reason, and were extremely well controlled. Does this mean that kids who smoke marijuana are lazy?Probably not. Rhesus monkees are very similar to humans, though,and it is very likely, especially given the previous empiricalevidence, that smoking marijuana during adolescense willtemporarily impair specific types of motivational development.The effect is permanantly reversible and normal motivationaldevelopment can be obtained by a 3-12 month period of abstinance(in monkeys -- no time period for humans is available.) Slikker did not find "amotivational syndrome" butsomething less severe which may be at the root of the commonperception that marijuana smokers are lazy. This is a good thingbecause it gives us a better argument *against* the existance offull blown amotivational syndrome. Among the other things Slikkerfound which we can be very excited about was no brain or cellulardamage, an actual stimulation of brain cell development bymarijuana smoking (which would fit with the current knowlege ofincreased alpha wave activity and blood flow while stoned), nopermanant effects on memory or mental capacity, and lots of goodreasons why marijuana should be more thoroughly researched ratherthan feared. So instead of being so defensive, read the study -- it is veryuseful.

Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Other Publications related to drug policy A Plea for Sanity ... � Michael Booth 1996 The thirty years or so since illicit drug use emerged as amodern social phenomenon have been marked by inquiry afterinquiry and report after report. Every one of these inquiries andreports has come to basically the same conclusion, that ourcurrent policy of prohibiting some drugs is not working, and,more to the point, that it cannot work. This week still moreAustralian politicians are about to consider another proposalthat has the potential to start us down a path that might well beable to circumvent the considerable costs that our current drugspolicies have burdened us with. The Ministerial Council on Drug Strategies, which is made upof Health and Police Ministers from every Parliament in Australiawill meet later this week in Hobart in order to consider aproposal put by the ACT government after four years of detailedresearch, a proposal for a trial with the aim of investigatingthe controlled supply of heroin as a treatment for dependentheroin users. This latest excursion by governments into the field of drugpolicy reform comes just after the failure of the VictorianPremier's Drug Advisory Council, or the Pennington Report, whichrecommended wholesale changes to marijuana laws. In fact the bulkof Pennington's report, which was drafted without any policeserving on the Advisory Council, was fairly innocuous. The reportmade eight general and some seventy two specific recommendationsthat address: sustained local and statewide action; lawenforcement; legislative change; support and treatment; andinformation and education. Most of these recommendations wereuncontroversial motherhood type statements which did not attractmuch comment at all, let alone any criticism. The conservative thinkers and anti-drug warriors who arestanding in the way of meaningful reform of drugs policy musthave had apoplexy when they read recommendation 7 of thePennington Report. This particular recommendation called on theVictorian government to amend the 1981 Drugs Poisons andControlled Substances Act must have given the anti-drug warriorsapoplexy. The twelve specific recommendations that detail theamendments to the Controlled Substances Act calls for the use andpossession of less than 25 grams of marijuana to no longer be anoffence, the cultivation of up to five plants per household nolonger be an offence, the trafficking of marijuana to an adult bedealt with by a caution, while trafficking to a minor continuesto be subject to heavy penalties. Local governments be given thepower to regulate offensive behaviour under the influence ofmarijuana under the Summary Offences Act 1966. All convictionsfor possession and use of small amounts of marijuana to beexpunged. The initial penalty for the use and possession of smallquantities of hard drugs to be a police caution and referral to adrug assessment and treatment service, with escalating penaltiesfor subsequent offences. Imprisonment should be used as a lastresort penalty for drug users. Drug trafficking offences shouldremain on the books, and be augmented by new penalties againstdriving under the influence of drugs. Despite the all too public focus on marijuana, the AdvisoryCouncil was originally established in the wake of a flood ofheroin onto the streets of Victoria, and a subsequent spate ofoverdose deaths. The Advisory Council noted the connectionbetween marijuana and heroin - they are both illegal - and basedtheir recommendations on the desirability of removing the mostwidely used illicit drug - marijuana - from the same channels ofdistribution and supply that also bring one of the least widelyused, but nevertheless destructive drugs - heroin - to youngAustralians. Sadly the Pennington report fell on largely deaf ears. TheVictorian Police Commissioner weighed into the debate, sayingthat to implement the findings of the Advisory Council reportwould be to "raise the white flag of surrender" in thewar on drugs. Disparaging remarks about the thrust of the report,and the general unwillingness of politicians to provide anyleadership on drugs policy saw Premier Kennett, despite hisreputation as a "can-do" leader who is not afraid totackle the hard questions, back pedal from his public commitmentto implement the findings of the report. Now there are more politicians considering a different aspectof reform to drug policy - the proposal to investigate theusefulness of heroin in the treatment of opiate dependent drugusers. No laws have to be changed, no international treatiesrepudiated. There is no proposal to make heroin freely availablethrough supermarkets. There is instead an extremely modest andconservative proposition before the Ministers to committhemselves to a research project. It says much for the politicsof drug policy reform that even the ACT heroin trial is likely tobe knocked back. In the last few years heroin use has emerged from the hiddendepths of the sub-culture that it has inhabited since KeithRichards and Lou Reed made it trendy and fashionable in the early1970s. The last six months or so have seen articles about heroinin publications like JUICE, Rolling Stone, the Sydney MorningHerald, as well as more conservative magazines like Marie Claireand Cosmopolitan, the latter with a lingerie clad model injectingherself. The films Pulp Fiction and Trainspotting has put thespotlight squarely on heroin use, and there is also the threepart documentary series currently being shown on ABC television,Dealing With The Demon. All of this public scrutiny of heroin has led somecommentators to argue that it is the attention paid to and thecoverage of heroin in popular culture that is responsible for theupswing in heroin use. Given the essentially conservative natureof our mass media it is much more likely that all the coverage ofheroin is a reflection of heroin use, and not a promotion of it.Regardless, Australia is indeed experiencing something of a surgein the use of heroin, and there is thus increased pressure onmany parties to do something about it. For most in society, "doing something about the drugproblem" has meant increased penalties for use andtrafficking, as well as associated legislation that canconfiscate any assets from accused drug dealers, the reporting ofcash transactions, increased police powers of surveillance anddetention, and so forth. Indeed, the Royal Commission into theNSW Police Service has heard evidence from one disgraced policeofficer after another that it was their ineffectiveness atkeeping drugs off the streets that led them to set themselves upas judge, jury, and executioner, and plant drugs on suspects,forge and falsify confessions, and finally, go into businessthemselves on the grounds that someone was always going to selldrugs, and it might as well be them. The report of the Victorian Premiers Drug Advisory Council isnot without flaws. It has a somewhat mechanical view of drugs anddrug use that overlooks the fact that drugs are first andforemost a phenomenon of culture and lifestyle, and that drugtaking behaviour is learned behaviour. Despite its defects,however, the report does implicitly recognise the futility oftrying to control drugs by placing an outright ban on them,arguing instead that in order to alter the impact of drugs onsociety we have to alter the circumstances in which people areintroduced to drugs, and the circumstances in which peoplepurchase and consume drugs. The vote later this week on the ACT heroin trial, as was thecase with the Pennington Report, has given a number ofopportunities to address much of the harm done by drugs insociety, the more so given that all that the politiciansconcerned have to do is to concur with the admittedly difficultdecisions and recommendations that have resulted from theindependent and scholarly inquiries that have examined drugspolicies. Those arguing for drugs policy reform will probably bedisappointed, though, as these latest carefully researched andthought out recommendations finish up following the findings andrecommendations of every other major inquiry into drug policies,findings and recommendations which have also recognised the sheerimpossibility of using a policy of prohibition to minimise thedamage done to our society by the use of drugs. Herein lies the real tragedy. The politics of drug law reformwill ensure the triumph of the irrational and illogical views ofthose like the Victorian Police Commissioner, who argued thatproposed new laws that permitted households to grow fivemarijuana plants for personal consumption were simplyunenforceable. The irony lies with the inability of theCommissioner to see that current drug laws that totally prohibitthe growing, possession and use of marijuana are similarlyunenforceable. The anti-drug warriors who are manning the barricades toprotect society against the flow of illicit drugs are somewhatlike the French generals who placed their faith in the MaginotLine to stop the German army. While the police and other socialconservatives are trying to argue that reforming the laws willopen up Australia to illicit drugs they are overlooking the factthat, like the Maginot Line, their own line in the "war ondrugs" has been breached in so many places as to bepractically and symbolically useless. Drugs are widespread insociety. There is no way that law reform can possibly make drugsany more widespread than they currently are now. Those opposing drug law reform might argue that changing thelaws will send the "wrong message to society, but they mustalso stop and consider what sort of message is sent to society bythe blind and stubborn refusal to even examine the evidence ondrug use, and to consider alternatives to a set of policies thathave manifestly failed, and must manifestly fail, in achievingtheir aims and objectives. No better argument against law enforcement can be imaginedthan to consider what might happen if the forces of prohibitionand law enforcement were to become stunningly successful. Imaginethat every drug dealer and drug user in Australia were to comeforward and line up outside Police Headquarters one morning, eachwith a bag of dope in one hand and a signed confession in theother. It sounds like a law enforcement officer's dream cometrue, they wouldn't even have to go to all the trouble oftracking down the drug users and dealers, all they would have todo would be to process the self confessed offenders, and punishthem according to the law. Drug problem solved. In fact such a scenario is the stuff of nightmares forAustralian Police Forces. During 1995 nearly forty per cent ofall Australian males admitted to having used illicit drugs, asdid nearly thirty per cent of females. State and Commonwealthlegal systems would collapse under the weight of a strategy thatactually detected and prosecuted all the millions of thoseAustralians, most of whom must be otherwise law abiding and taxpaying citizens. Assuming that the those arguing against drugpolicy reform are not asking Australians to write a blank chequeto detect and prosecute drug offences, they should be able to sayto what extent the law can, and should be enforceable. Even acursory examination of the figures will show that the lawsagainst drugs are not, and can never be enforceable. Even if theVictorian Police Commissioner wanted to argue that the policeconcentrate on those drugs that are demonstrably more dangerousthan marijuana, drugs like amphetamines, heroin, cocaine, andecstasy, he will still have to acknowledge that the policy he issupporting is trying to regulate the behaviour of an enormousnumber of Victorians, a number that would overwhelm his policeforce and the court system should his preferred strategy of lawenforcement actually be successful. Our current drug laws and policies are the result of amish-mash of historical accident, racial prejudice, internationalgeopolitics, outdated morals, misleading ideas about medicine andhealth, and the natural conservatism of Australian society andthe politicians who have resolutely refused to display anyleadership. It might be argued that our current laws andpolicies, given their origins, are just too hard to change. Itmight also be argued that it doesn't matter much anyway. Thosewho want drugs can get them, and the rest of us can hide behindthe ineffectual remnants of the Maginot Line in the war on drugs,secure in the knowledge that we are not sending the "wrongmessage", whatever that may be. It does matter, though. Hundreds of young Australians aresuffering and dying as a result of these laws, laws that cannotprevent a flood of impure heroin that is leading to increasednumbers of overdoses, and increased levels of hepatitis throughneedle sharing, laws that make marijuana the most profitable cashcrop in the country and ensure that the profits go to criminalfigures and corrupt cops, laws that ensure that some of thepeople who use a particular drug are punished and marginalised,while other users get off scot free, and users of other drugsaltogether are given the protection of the law and the assistanceof society. Isn't it time for a change. John Howard climbed ontop of thirty five dead Australians to introduce a politicallydifficult decision to ban semi-automatic weapons. Surely it isn'tasking too much of him to listen to the experts, and climb on topof the thousands and thousands casualties of the drug laws toargue for another politically difficult decision? finis Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Other Publications related to drug policy WT01-B37-31IA088-000636-B015-182http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/Other/other.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122101925 text/html 5070HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 10:19:14 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Sunday, 19-Jan-97 11:01:51 GMTContent-length: 4855 Other Publications of Interest Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | The Drug Legalization Debate Other Items of Interest Sentencing Project Reports The Collected Writings ofJoseph McNamara Joseph McNamara is a former police chief in Kansas City, Mo. and San Jose, Ca..

Mandatory sentencing is very popular with politicians whoposture themselves as "tough on crime," but these harshimprisonment polices have "not been effective in cuttingcrime," states Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Veronica S.McBeth. McBeth is one of three female jurists included in the 14judges interviewed in this book that has been described by onereviewer as a "seminal work." The incarceration of huge numbers of young black malesnationwide, resulting largely from mandatory sentencing laws, istermed "a quiet kind of genocide" by Joseph Brown ofMemphis, a trial court judge who trims his black judicial robesin African kente cloth. "Black Judges on Justice" is the first book topresent the views of leading African-American jurists serving onthe nation's federal and state benches. The black juristsinterviewed include: Famed federal jurist A. Leon Higginbotham, who authored thefamous letter attacking the anti-black attitudes of now U.S.Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; Bruce Wright, the feistyNew York City jurist who has won acclaim for his decades longfight against racism in the judiciary, and Constance BakerMotley, the first African-American female federal judge. The jurists forthrightly discuss the inequities of race andclass which too often stack the deck of the justice systemagainst blacks. For example, the subtle but pervasive prejudicesof judges and prosecutors, which impact on decisions like whogets probation and who goes to prison, are examined by TheodoreA. McKee, a Philadelphia judge who now sits on the federal ThirdCircuit Court of Appeals. The jurists in "Black Judges" provide rare insightsinto the judicial decision making process, exposing how thislife-impacting process is often arbitrary and wholly unrelated tolaws. Further, the jurists present intriguing autobiographicalsketches of their accomplishments, often in the face oftremendous adversity. The jurists were interviewed byPhiladelphia journalist (and STRONG advocate for Mumia!) LinnWashington, Jr., a graduate of the Yale Law Journalism Fellowshipprogram. "Black Judges on Justice," published by theNew Press, exposes many myths. It is widely believed in thissociety that Black leadership is soft on crime. But Washington,D.C. judge Reggie B. Walton served as President Bush's AssistantDrug Czar and Senior White House Advisor on Crime. Walton saysone of his major frustrations working for the Bush Administrationwas his inability to convince administration officials of thefact that fighting crime is ineffective without attacking socialcauses of crime. Abigail R. Rogers, a family court judge in South Carolina andthe first black female jurist in that state, reveals how she hasbeen victimized by racism and sexism from whites and blacksalike. The author of "Black Judges on Justice," LinnWashington, is an award-winning investigative reporter andeditorial writer. A graduate of Temple University who holds amasters degree from the Yale Law School, Washington has spentmuch of his 20-plus years in journalism specializing in issuesinvolving race and matters related to the justice system.Washington is a former assistant to the Chief Justice of theSupreme Court of Pennsylvania and former executive editor of"The Philadelphia Tribune." "Black Judges on Justice" is receiving favorablereviews. "The Quarterly Black Review" describes thebook as an "illuminating work ... that should be requiredreading for anyone interested in the relationship between blacksand the law." The magazine "Booklist" describesthe book as "well-written and insightful" while"Publisher's Weekly" termed the book"thoughtful." "Black Judges on Justice" is onthe recommended reading lists of "Essence" and"Emerge" magazines. Derrick Bell, the distinguished law professor and expert onracism in American law, has stated, "Beleagueredracial-equality forces will applaud Linn Washington's searinglycandid interviews with these courageous men and women who striveboth to alleviate unfairness in their courtrooms and to urgereforms that, if adopted, would move courts toward justice andaway from the cynicism, racism, and moral bankruptcy in whichthey are now mired."

Among the possiblereasons: Many of today's parents tried illegal drugs themselvesand may feel awkward warning their children away from them. An annual survey released Friday found that teen-age drug usehas risen steadily since 1992, raising fears that the dramaticdrop in drug use in the 1980s will eventually be wiped out. Marijuana use among eighth-graders has nearly doubled since1991, with 20 percent saying they have used it at least once.That's up from 17 percent just one year earlier. More than 48 percent of high school seniors in the class of1995 had used some type of illegal drug at least once, up almost3 percentage points from 1994. Seniors' drug use hit its lowestlevel in the 21-year-old survey in 1992, when under 41 percentsaid they had ever tried an illegal drug. Despite the upwardtrend, today's high school students remain much less likely totry illegal drugs than people who were in school during the 1970sor 1980s, said a director of the ``Monitoring the Future'' study. In an era when so many parents -- including even PresidentClinton -- have tried marijuana, some may feel awkward givingtheir children strong anti-drug lectures, said Lloyd D. Johnston,principal investigator for the University of Michigan study. Mostof them ``do not want their children involved in drugs, marijuanaor otherwise, but many have fallen silent on the issues becausethey feel quite conflicted about it,'' Johnston said.Nevertheless, he said, it's critical that these parents warntheir children of the hazards. What should they say? Johnston said they can make severalpoints: When they were young, less was known about the dangers ofdrugs. Many children and teens now begin using drugs at a youngerage, which carries more risks. And drugs widely available todayare stronger and more addictive. Also, the threats of AIDS and violent crime make drug use anddrinking more dangerous, said Donna Shalala, secretary of theDepartment of Health and Human Services. Another explanation for the increase, Johnston said, is adecline in news coverage and public service advertisements toeducate teens about the dangers of drugs since the end of NancyReagan's ``Just Say No'' campaign and President Bush's ``war ondrugs.'' Johnston also accused rock and rap songs of promotingdrug use. Shalala called for ``a broad national effort,'' includingparents, teachers, coaches, clergy and the government, to teachyoung people about the hazards of drugs. ``Or else,'' she said, ``in a few years, we're going to findourselves right back where we were in the old days, when childrenand teen-agers viewed drug, alcohol and tobacco use as perfectlynormal and acceptable behavior.'' She noted that more than 64 percent of high school seniorssaid they had smoked a cigarette, up more than 2 percentagepoints from the year before. Both the Clinton administration and Republican congressionalleaders blamed the opposition's policies for making the problemworse. The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,criticized the administration's ``ineffectual leadership andfailed federal policies.'' Shalala blasted the Republicans for cutting spending onfederal drug treatment and prevention efforts and on aschool-based anti-drug program. Drug use among teen-agers peaked around 1980, when about 65percent of high school seniors said they had used an illegaldrug, Johnston said. More than 50,000 students were surveyed last spring for the21st annual national study. It has a margin of error of plus orminus 2 percentage points. Other findings: --Nearly one in 20 high school seniors uses marijuana daily. --Among eighth-graders, 21 percent said they had used anillegal drug during the 12 months before the survey. --The percentage of high school seniors who have tried LSDincreased from 6.9 percent last year to 8.4 percent.

The Abraham Amendment passed byunanimous consent late Friday evening. "Drug pushers all across America were cheering at theSentencing Commission's proposal to lower prison sentences forcrack offenses," Abraham said. "As hard as it is tobelieve, there are some policy makers in Washington who actuallywant to lower prison sentences for drug pushers who target ourchildren. But tonight the Senate put an end to the drug dealers'celebration, and our children and neighborhoods are a littlesafer." "This is no way to be waging the war on drugs, and theSenate did the right thing by rejecting the proposal to lowerthese drug sentences," Abraham said. "The purpose ofthe bill is simple: to block implementation of proposals by theSentencing Commission that would lower sentences for crackdealers." On May 1, the Sentencing Commission, an independent agencyappointed by the President, proposed changes to the SentencingGuidelines that would lower crack distribution sentences tobetween 1/2 and 1/6 of their present length. This would mean thatsome crack dealers who under current law would get substantialsentences could end up serving no jail time at all. "I think this sends entirely the wrong message: that inthe war against crack, society blinked," Abraham said."That is not what we should be telling the crack dealers.And that is not what we should be telling the brave law abidingmembers of communities under attack by the crack dealers who arefighting back." Abraham's bill will stop those Sentencing Commission proposalswhich automatically go into effect on November 1 -- and make surethat any other guidelines which lower drug sentences don't getimplemented. The House must now take up similar action to defeatthe guidelines. The Sentencing Commission cited the reason for their proposalwas out of concern that because a majority of crack distributorssentenced are African-Americans, the higher crack sentencescreates a perception of unfairness. The Commission based theirconcern on the fact that sentences for powder cocaine sentencesare lower than crack sentences. "I agree with part of the Commission's concern, but theanswer is not to lower the crack sentences, but to toughen thepowder sentences," Abraham said. "That is why I hopeCongress will act soon on the bill I've introduced to raise thesentences for powder distribution by making the triggers formandatory minimums 100 grams for 5 years and 1000 grams for tenyears, rather than 500 and 5000 as they are now." "The Sentencing Commission's solution -- to address this'unfairness' by lowering the crack sentences -- is a trulyterrible idea. It is not fair to the vast majority of peopleliving in communities, like Detroit, under attack by the crackdealers and trying to defend them -- many of whom areAfrican-Americans. And I am sure it is the last thing in theworld that many of them would want," Abraham said.

Thearticle appeared in The Dayton Voice on September 20 and waswritten by Alan Prendergast, a Denver based free-lance writer. Copies of this issue of The Voice (Vol. 3, No. 38) can beobtained by sending $1.00 to: The Dayton Voice, 915 Salem Ave.,Dayton, OH 45406. Here's the summary: Sponsored by the American Correctional Association (ACA), thisCongress is the world's largest gathering of correctionsprofessionals -- roughly 5,000 prison guards and administrators,educators, halfway house operators, and probation and paroleofficers. It's also a flag-waving, back-patting, glad-handingtribute to the growing power and prestige of the booming prisonindustry. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, the keynote speaker,gushed, "You see the meanest, most vicious among us, and youprotect us from them...Well, I'm here today to tell you how muchthis nation owes you." And just how much does this nation owe the prison industry?Plenty, judging from the hordes of exhibitors who descend on theCongress every year, hoping to cash in on the prison boom. Evenas Reno spoke, more than 500 vendors were setting up shop in thecity's convention center, hawking everything from razor wire andfancy restaint beds to inmate phone services and modular cellsthat could be assembled like Lego blocks. "Business is great," reported Cathy Perry, anaccount manager with Access Catalog of St. Louis, that sellsapproved TVs, clothing, stereos and other personal items toinmates by mail order, raking in roughly $5 million in sales lastyear... Thanks to stiffer drug laws, tougher parole requirements,mandatory minimum sentences, "three strikes" laws andother legislation, the American prison population has tripledsince 1980...The growth has been particularly dramatic -- andpainful in Ohio, which now competes with California for thedubious honor of having the most overcrowded prison system in thecountry. Niki Schwartz, the Cleveland attorney who helpednegociate an end to the Lucasville riot, is fond of pointing outthat Ohio's prison budget was 1/6 of its higher education budgetin 1982; as of 1993, it has risen to 1/3. "Soon we'll bespending more on corrections than on higher education, and that'scrazy," Schartz declares. Punishment, not rehabilitation, is the name of the game... Atthe 125th congress there was no shortage of speeches denouncingthe current prison binge, an indication of the growing anxietyamong corrections professionals over swollen budgets, crowdedprisons, and increasing punitive legislation that is making thoseprisons harder to manage. Jim Gondles, the soft-spoken, genial executive director of theACA, says the biggest task facing the ACA is"educatingpeople who don't work in corrections" about the industriesgrowing professionalism and changing needs. One of the ACA's principal sources of revenue is theCommission on Accreditation for Corrections, which promotesprofessional standards and "audits" prisons as part ofthe accreditation process. Accreditation is no guarantee thatconditions within a prison are constitutional or even safe, butthe operators or more than 1,200 jails and prisons have investedmillions in training and renovation in an effort to meet ACAstandards. Gondles urged "a balanced" approach to corrections,meaning more of everything: more halfway houses, more rehabprograms, more boot camps, more prisons. And that's an agenda thecorrections' industry boosters can live with -- espeacilly itsgung-ho private sector constituency, which has expanded rapidlyas public monies invested in corrections have soared. Although private prisons are still a rarity, virtually everyaspect of corrections now involves some degree of public-privatepartnership. Some aspects of privitazation involve lucrative kickbacks tocorrections agencies, at the expense of prisoners and theirfamilies. Phone companies bid agressively for the right toprovide costly, hi-tech phone services to prisoners...thecompanies offer a commission on billing revenues to the prisonthat range as high as 35%. Inmate collect calls are a sore pointwith Charles Sullivan, director of CURE (Citizens United forRehabilitation of Errants), a national prison reform lobbyinggroup. The cost of an inmate phone call can vary widely from systemto system, depending on what the phone companies can slide pastthe regulators. "We don't think that kind of gouging isright," Sullivan says, "Why should prisons be makingmoney from families on inmate phone calls?" Even the building of prisons is not as straightforward as itonce was. Typically, the state corrections system will "lease"a new prison from a state authority, which issues bonds throughprivate underwriters such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, andPrudential. The investors receive a significantly higher rate ofinterest than that paid by general obligation bonds. "Prisonbonds are a good investment," reports Brad Sprague, aninvestment banker with Columbus office of A.G. Edwards Co."I put my kid's money in them. You get individual investors,bank trust departments, mutual funds, insurance companies -- theyall know the state of Ohio isn't going to go out of the prisonbusiness anytime soon." But Gondles senses that public concern about prison costs andconditions is rising. "We are going to see more citizensinterested in jails and prisons, "he predicts, "Therate of incarceration is becoming so high that we are going toreach a point where everyone knows someone who is in jail orprison."

Acknowledging that drug-related offences and links withorganised crime are on the increase, the government said itplanned to build more jail cells and step up existing mandatorydrug rehabilitation programmes. But it made clear it will continue to tolerate its famouscoffee shops, where marijuana and cannabis are sold openly, andthe growing of home-grown cannabis. The proposals will moderate a 20-year social experiment thatinvolved tolerating soft drugs and viewing hard-drug users aspeople needing help rather than as criminals. It turned Amsterdam into a mecca for Europe's drug-seekingyouth while critics said it allowed organised crime to flourish. It angered neighbouring countries and France threatened toblock the Schengen agreement on open borders because of the flowof drugs from the Netherlands. ``The cabinet rejects legalisation of soft and hard drugs,''the Dutch government said in a review of its drugs policy. ``Tracking and prosecuting drug traffickers, particularlythose with cross-border operations, will continue to be given toppriority by the Dutch police and the judiciary,'' it said. It signalled a tougher stand against so-called drug touristswho flock in to buy cheap, readily available heroin and cocaine.The cabinet insisted, however, that it would continue to treataddicts as people who need help rather than as criminals and willalso maintain distinct policies on hard and soft drugs. The proposals recommend providing free heroin to chronicaddicts under a trial scheme to be launched in Rotterdam. Justice Minister Winnie Sorgdrager told Dutch television:``None of us advocates the use of drugs, nor tobacco or alcohol,but we know that they are used.'' ``Bona fide coffee shops have proved their worth,'' thegovernment said, but it added that the amount of cannabis theseshops would be allowed to sell for personal use would be cut tofive grammes per transaction from 30 grammes. ``Provided the strictest conditions are met, the police andjudiciary will not take active action against the small-scalegrowing of Dutch-grown cannabis,'' the government said. Lovers of home-grown Dutch grass -- known as Nederweed or``skunk'' on the streets -- have claimed this will help keeporganised crime out of the soft drugs business. ``We have 675,000 regular soft drug users in The Netherlands,but even so there are only 25,000 hard drugs addicts,'' HealthMinister Els Borst said. ``These figures confirm our view that if one keeps the twomarkets separate it becomes possible that people use soft drugs,sometimes experimenting with them for years -- and then stop.'' ``Stopping (using soft drugs) is also easier because nophysical dependency is created. (Soft drug users) may do thiswithout stepping up to hard drugs,'' she said.

The good news is that Kitsap County Superior Court JudgeLeonard Kruse threw out the search warrant used in a May raidwhen police seized 162 marijuana plants from McKee's home. "lf the warrant's no good, then all the evidence is out.If the evidence is out, then we have no case to prosecute,"said Deputy Prosecutor Kevin Kelly. The bad news for McKee is that it doesn't look like thecounty plans to return her marijuana, estimated bydrug-enforcement officials to be worth about $300,000. "You can't give contraband back. The police would thenbe guilty of delivery," said Kelly. "You can't giveillegal drugs back to people." McKee--the first medicinal-marijuana supplier in the countryto be busted, according to the National Organization for theReform of Marijuana Laws-- said she's going to take Kitsap Countyto court. About 70 patients with AIDS, multiple sclerosis, cancer andother illnesses who had depended on The Green Cross for marijuanahave been on "basic rations" since the bust, she said. "We are going after the county for damages and for allof our stuff back," she said."We were not convicted ofa crime, and they have no right to take our edicine away. Theysaid they took $300,000 worth of medicine away from us. thinkthey owe us $300,000." She said she would sue for an additional $200,000 for"pain and suffering ... and spending three days in jail withno medication for my back." The judge ruled that the search warrant was invalid becauseit didn't limit the discretion of the officers, and didn't saywhich items were to be seized. Marijuana was never mentioned inthe warrant, and no specific crime was alleged. In addition toMcKee, other defendants included Ronald "Stitch" Millerand John Devin, who lived in the same household. "We're thrilled," said Andrew Subin, McKee'sattorney. "We knew there were problems with the searchwarrant; we're glad the judge saw those problems." Kelly said his office had not decided whether to appeal theruling.

But new statistics show that peer pressure isn't asimportant a factor in leading teens to drink alcohol as parentsmay believe. Instead, teens feel that alcohol helps them forgetabout their problems, according to a recent national surveyreleased today by the Minnesota-based Hazelden Foundation. According to the survey statistics, parents are much morelikely to believe that peer pressure plays an important role ininfluencing teens to drink or use drugs. Survey results show that87 percent of parents said teens drink or use drugs because"everybody else is doing it." Seventy-nine percent ofparents also pointed to the fact that "other kids will thinkthey're weird if they don't" as an important factor in whyteens drink. On the other hand, 79 percent of teens pointed to"the feeling of being drunk or high" as their topreason for drinking or using drugs. Teens (66.7 percent) alsosaid that drugs and alcohol "help them forget theirproblems." "The adolescent years are difficult for kids toexperience," says Cathy Seward, executive director ofHazelden's Center for Youth and Families (HCYF). "Parentsshouldn't rule out the possibility that their children could betempted to turn to alcohol and drugs to cope." HCYF is oneof the nation's only adolescent and young adult centersspecializing in alcoholism and chemical dependency treatment andeducation for youth ages 14-25. Last year, more than 550 youngadults from throughout the United States benefited from HCYFprograms and services. TEENS MORE REALISTIC ABOUT SUBSTANCE ABUSE According to HCYF professionals, alcohol abuse is a moreserious problem among youth today, and teens appear to agree.Fifty percent of the teens said alcohol is the most seriousproblem among youth today. Parents were more evenly divided, withonly 36.4 percent rating alcohol as the most serious and 38.5percent rating drugs to be a more serious problem. Twenty-four percent of parents rated both alcohol and drugs aserious problem in contrast to only six percent of teens. "Parents today seem to be most concerned about theeffect of hard drugs, such as marijuana and cocaine, on the livesof their kids," says Seward. "In reality, alcohol isstill overwhelmingly the primary drug of choice among teens. Kidswho start off experimenting with alcohol are often more likely toget hooked and turn to harder drugs to get the 'high' feelingsthat originally attracted them to drinking." PARENTS LIMIT DRUG USE MORE THAN ALCOHOL When asked to describe the kind of "ground rules"families had about drug and alcohol use, survey results showparents set more rigid guidelines for their kids when it comes todrug use. Both parents and teens agreed at a margin of two to onethat drug use isn't tolerated in the family. When it comes to outlining specific family rules aboutalcohol and drug consumption, parents are much more lenienttoward alcohol -- allowing their teenagers to see them drinkingalcohol and admitting their teens can drink alcohol in a varietyof settings. Specifically: 21.8 percent of the parents said alcoholconsumption is all right for parents but not teens; 8.3 percentof parents allow their kids to drink alcohol at home; and 4.7percent of parents said they allow their teens to drink alcoholat parties as long as he/she doesn't drive home. According to survey results, none of these "groundrules" is allowed when it comes to drug use. COMMUNICATION GAP EXISTS BETWEEN PARENTS AND TEENS Even when parents say they have discussed alcohol and druguse with their teens, survey results show that such discussionsmay not have the effect that the parents hoped for. According tothe survey statistics, nearly all of the parents (95.6 percent)said they have talked to their teenagers about alcohol use. Only84 percent of the teens surveyed agreed. While fewer parents -- 92.5 percent -- have discussed druguse with their teens, the discrepancy with teens is even higher-- with only 78.5 percent of the youth remembering a discussionabout drug use. "When talking with kids about alcohol and drug use,parents need to be extremely clear about the consequences andpotential dangers that can affect their teens," says Seward."It's best to sit down with your child and use real lifeexamples to illustrate some of the harm that comes to teens whocontinue to experiment with drugs." OTHER FINDINGS IN THE HAZELDEN SURVEY: -- When asked how they would react if they found out thattheir teen was drinking or using drugs, twice as many parents (87percent) said they would "sit down and talk it out" ascompared to other options such as grounding their teenager (44percent) or forbidding their teenager from "hanging aroundwith the friends who got him/her started in the firstplace," (41 percent). -- Despite the fact that almost 40 percent (38.1 percent) ofteens surveyed admit they have friends or classmates who bothdrink alcohol and use drugs, approximately one third (30 percent)of parents said they are unsure about whether their teenager hasfriends or classmates who use alcohol. An almost equal number ofparents -- an additional 28 percent -- said their teens havefriends who both drink alcohol and use drugs. -- Parents (36 percent) and teens (40 percent) agreed thatteens at school plan activities that revolve around alcohol anddrugs on a weekly basis. Yet 20 percent of the teens surveyedadmit that teens plan activities that revolve around alcohol ordrugs even more often -- on a daily basis. -- When asked to rank behaviors that would make them think afriend had a drug or alcohol problem, teens listed the following:personality changes (80.4 percent); pressuring others to use(75.6 percent); giving up favorite activities (69.3 percent);lying about things (68.5 percent); receiving falling grades (65.6percent) or avoiding friends (44.8 percent). -- When asked what they felt would be the top results ofongoing drug use, teenagers pointed to getting hooked (89.3percent); death (82.6 percent); and a car crash (81.1 percent) asprimary concerns. Teens ranked unprotected sex (58 percent) asthe least likely result of ongoing drug or alcohol use. TEENS COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT CHEMICAL USE BUT AVOID TOPIC When asked hypothetically about their comfort level intalking with friends about drinking or drug use, more thanthree-fourths (77 percent) of the teens said they felt very orsomewhat confident and comfortable discussing the topic. Yet inreality, less than half of the teens surveyed who know friends orclassmates who used alcohol and/or drugs (44 percent) have evertalked with them about their drug or alcohol use and tried tooffer help. Fifty-five percent of the teens surveyed said theyhad never broached the subject with their friends. "Teenagers tend to listen to the opinions of theirfriends more than their parents," says Seward. "Thismakes it very important that friends take any opportunities totalk to each other about worries associated with drug and alcoholabuse." HAZELDEN OFFERS HELP IN DISCUSSING DRUG USE To help parents and teens discuss the topic of alcohol anddrug use, Hazelden's Responsibility of Friendship program hasdeveloped "A Guide For Teens," a free booklet designedto help teens assist a friend who has a problem with alcohol orother related drugs. To get a copy of Hazelden's "A Guide For Teens,"call Hazelden's toll-free helpline, 800-I-DO-CARE. The helplinewas created by Hazelden in 1992 in response to a widespread needfor information. ABOUT THE SURVEY The telephone survey, conducted for the Minnesota-basedHazelden Center for Youth and Families and the HazeldenFoundation by Market Facts, Inc., polled a nationallyrepresentative sample of more than 300 parents and 270 teenagersto learn their opinions about drug and alcohol use and whether ornot kids ever talk to friends about usage. (The margin of errorfor the sample is plus or minus 6 percentage points). HCYF is a program of the Hazelden Foundation, aninternationally recognized nonprofit organization providinglow-cost, quality rehabilitation, education, prevention andprofessional services in chemical dependency and relatedaddictive disorders.

[T]he history of the narcotics legislation in the country"reveals the determination of congress to turn the screw ofthe criminal machinery -- detection, prosecution and punishment-- tighter and tighter." The U.S. Supreme Court in _Albernaz v. United States_, 450U.S. 333, 343 (1981) The chief cause of problems is solutions -- Eric Sevareid Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my appreciation to theCommittee for inviting me to participate in this importanthearing on U.S. Drug Policy. This hearing could be and should bethe start of a new beginning in the conception and execution ofour drug laws. Indeed, if there is one over-riding theme in myprepared statement, it is just that: more than anything else --more than revised laws or the commitment of new resources -- weneed a careful, comprehensive study of the costs and benefits ofpresent drug policy, followed by a clear articulation of thefundamental goals sought to be achieved by our drug policy. First, let me identify myself for the record. I am both alawyer and a law professor. I have been a full-time member of thelaw faculty of the Nova University Law Center since 1975. One of my primary areas of specialization is the criminaljustice system. Since the late 1970s, I have followeddevelopments in U.S. drug law. With the aid of a grant from theNova Law Center in 1982, I published what is to my knowledge thefirst critique of the U.S. War on Drugs, the substance of whichis clearly indicated by its title, 'Exposing the War on Cocaine:The Futility and Destructiveness of Prohibition', 1983 _WisconsinLaw Review_ 1305. (1) My published work in this field has been cited widely by thepress, being summarized, for example, in the _Atlantic Monthly_cover story on cocaine, of January 1986. I am most widely knownas the author of _Breaking the Impasse in the War on Drugs_,reviewed in the _New York Times_ Book Review Section in December1986. I have spoken on drug law and policy at many panels andconferences in the United States and in Europe. My prepared statement for this hearing addresses threefundamental questions. What is the state of the War on Drugs? Howdid we get there? Where should we go from here? The current 'War on Drugs' began on October 2nd, 1982, with aradio address by President Reagan to the Nation: "The moodtowards drugs is changing in this country and the momentum iswith us. We are making no excuses for drugs hard, soft, orotherwise. Drugs are bad and we are going after them".(2)Twelve days later, in a speech delivered at the Department ofJustice, the President followed with an "unshakable"commitment "to do what is necessary to end the drugmenace" and "to cripple the power of the mob inAmerica."(3) He cited the "unqualified success" ofthe Miami Task Force on Crime and Drugs as a model to buildon.(4) It is important to note that President Reagan was not thefirst to declare war on drugs. President Nixon had done the samein 1971. In a message to Congress he had described drug abuse asa "national emergency", denounced drugs as "publicenemy number one" and called for a "totaloffensive".(5) First Drug War or not, the President'sstatement about the mood of the country seemed accurate. At thetime of his October 1982 speeches, some 3,000 parents groups hadalready organized nationwide under the umbrella of the NationalFederation of Parents for Drug Free Youth.(6) Within thegovernment, the House Select Committee(7) and the attorneygeneral's Task Force on Violent Crime(8) had urged the Presidentto declare War on Drugs. The President's October 14th speech called for and got more ofnearly everything:(9) 1.more personnel -- 1,020 law enforcementagents for the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Federal Bureau ofInvestigation (FBI), and other agencies, 200 Assistant UnitedStates Attorneys, and 340 clerical staff; 2.more aggressive lawenforcement -- creating 12 (later 13) regional prosecutorial taskforces across the nation "to identify, investigate, andprosecute members of high-level drug trafficking enterprises, andto destroy the operations of those organizations"; 3.moremoney -- $127.5 million in additional funding and a substantialreallocation of the existing budget from prevention, treatment,and research programs to law enforcement programs; 4.more prisonbed space -- the addition of 1,260 beds at eleven federal prisonsto accommodate the increase in drug offenders to be incarcerated;5.more stringent laws -- a "legislative offensive designedto win approval of reforms" with respect to bail,sentencing, criminal forfeiture, and the exclusionary rule;6.better interagency coordination -- bringing together allfederal law enforcement agencies in "a comprehensive attackon drug trafficking and organized crime" under aCabinet-level committee chaired by the attorney general; and7.improved federal-state co-ordination, including federalassistance to state agencies by training their agents. Energized by the hardening attitude toward illegal drugs, theadministration acted aggressively, mobilizing an impressive arrayof federal bureaucracies and resources in a co-ordinated,although largely futile, attack on the supply of illegal drugs --principally cocaine, marijuana, and heroin. The administrationhired hundreds of drug agents and cut through bureaucraticrivalries with greater vigor than any administration before it.It acted to streamline operations and compel more co-operationamong enforcement agencies. It placed the FBI in charge of DEAand gave it major drug enforcement responsibility for the firsttime in its history.(10) And, as the centerpiece of itsprosecutorial strategy, it fielded a network of Organized CrimeDrug Enforcement Task Forces in 13 'core' cities across thenation.(11) To stop drugs from entering the country, the Administrationattempted to erect a contemporary anti-drug version of theMaginot Line: the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System(NNBIS), an intelligence network designed to co-ordinate radarsurveillance and interdiction efforts along the entire96,000-mile border of the United States. As part of thatinitiative, NNBIS floated radar balloons in the skies over Miami,the Florida Keys, and even the Bahamas to protect the nation'sperimeter against drug-smuggling incursions.(12) The CIA joined the war effort by supplying intelligence aboutforeign drug sources, and NASA assisted with satellite-basedsurveillance of coca and marijuana crops under cultivation.(13) The administration also initiated financial investigations,aided by computerized data banks and staffed by Treasury agentsspecially trained to trace money-laundering operations.(14) TheState Department pressured foreign governments to eradicateillegal coca and marijuana plants and financed pilot programs toprovide peasant farmers with alternative cash crops.(15) It alsonegotiated Mutual Assistance Treaties to expose 'dirty' moneysecreted in tax-haven nations and to extradite defendants accusedof drug conspiracies against the laws of the United States.(16) The government also literally militarized what had previouslybeen only a rhetorical war, deploying the armed forces of theUnited States to "assist" drug enforcement operations.The Department of Defense provided pursuit planes, helicopters,and other equipment to federal civilian enforcement agencies,while Navy E-2C 'Hawkeye' radar planes patrolled the coastalskies in search of smuggling aircraft and ships.(17) The CoastGuard, receiving new cutters and more personnel, intensified itscustomary task of interdicting drug-carrying vessels at sea. 1981 amendments to the Posse Comitatus Act relaxed thecentury-old ban on military enforcement of criminal laws andpermitted Coast Guard boarding parties to sail on Naval warshipsserving as 'platforms' for Coast Guard interdictions.(18)Finally, for the first time in American history, Navy vessels,including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, began directly tointerdict -- and in one case fired upon -- drug smuggling shipsin international waters.(19) On a purely technical level, theAdministration could rightly claim some success in focusing theresources of the federal government in a historically large andsingle-minded attack on the drug supply. What were the results of this extraordinary enforcementprogram? It set new records in every category of measurement --drug seizures, investigations, indictments, arrests, convictions,and asset forfeitures. For example, DEA, FBI and Customs seizednearly one-half billion dollars in drug-related assets in1986.(20) DEA arrested twice as many drug offenders in 1986(12,819) as in 1982, and the percentage of arrestees constitutinghigh-level traffickers also rose from roughly one-third toone-half.(21) DEA, FBI, and other federal agencies seized over100,000 lbs. Of cocaine in 1986.(22) From the end of 1980 to June30, 1987, the prison population (counting felonies only) soaredfrom 329,021 to 570,519. Roughly 40 percent of new prison inmatesnow go in for drug offenses. In recognition of this boom, the1989 budget submission of the President seeks a 48 percentincrease for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in order to accommodatean anticipated increase in prisoners from 44,000 today to 72,000by 1995. Despite the Administration's accumulation of impressivestatistics, domestic marijuana cultivation took off and the blackmarket in cocaine grew to record size. In 1980, the supply ofcocaine to the U.S. was estimated at 40 metric tons; by 1986 ithad risen to 140 tons. As a result of this abundant supply and amore-or-less stable pool of buyers, prices fell dramatically. In1980, a kilo of cocaine cost $50,000 - $55,000 delivered inMiami; by 1986, it had fallen to the range of $12,000 - $20,000;$14,000 was typical for much of 1988. In 1980-81, a gram ofcocaine cost $ 100 and averaged 12 percent purity at streetlevel. By 1986, the price had fallen to as low as $80 ($50 inMiami), and the purity had risen to more than 50 percent.(23)Around the nation, crack was marketed in $5 and $10 vials toreach the youth and low-income markets.(24) More than 22 millionAmericans report having tried cocaine; and roughly 5.8 millionreport having used it during the month preceding the 1985National Household Survey.(25) Cocaine-related hospitalemergencies rose from 4,277 in 1982 to 9,946 in 1985, and then tomore than 26,000 in 987.(26) As if to mock the aggressive efforts of the War on Drugs, thisrapid market growth occurred in the face of President Reagan'sdoubling and redoubling of the federal anti-drug enforcementbudget from $645 million in fiscal year 1981 to over $4 billionin fiscal year 1987.(27) Resources specifically devoted tointerdiction rose from $399 million to $ 1.3 billion, one thirdof the current budget; and military assistance rose from $5million to $405 million,(28) including the provision of (theservices of) Air Force AWAC'S and Navy E-2C radar planes; ArmyBlack Hawk helicopters used in Customs pursuit missions; and theCustoms Service's own purchases of P-3 radar planes, Citation jetinterceptors, and Blue Thunder interceptor boats. DEA personnelrose from 1,940 in 1981 to 2,875 special agents in 1988, withmore on request for 1989, along with a 47-position air wing forDEA. This budgetary expansion seems all the more remarkable whencompared to the 1969 anti-drug budget of $73.5 million.(29)Commenting specifically upon the interdiction budget, the Officeof Technology Assessment concluded: Despite a doubling of Federal expenditures on interdictionover the past five years, the quantity of drugs smuggled into theUnited States is greater than ever.... There is no clearcorrelation between the level of expenditures or effort devotedto interdiction and the long- term availability ofillegally-imported drugs in the domestic market.(30) The social 'return' on the extra billions spent during thattime has been a drug abuse problem of historic magnitude,accompanied by a drug trafficking parasite of internationaldimensions. This latter point is crucial. It is not simply that the War onDrugs has failed to work; it has in many respects made thingsworse. It has spun a spider's web of black market pathologies,including roughly 25 percent of all urban homicides, widespreadcorruption of police and other public officials, street crime byaddicts, and subversive 'narcoterrorist' alliances between LatinAmerican guerrillas and drug traffickers.(31) In the streets ofthe nation's major cities, violent gangs of young drug thugsengage in turf wars and open shoot-outs with automaticrifles.(32) Innocent bystanders are often shot. Corruptionpervades local police departments and foreign governments. SomeLatin American and Caribbean nations have been effectivelycaptured by drug traffickers.(33 ) Where capture is incomplete,intimidation reigns: one third of the Clombian supreme court wasassassinated in a (suspected) narco-terrorist raid. An estimated60 Colombian justices have been murdered in a recent five-yearperiod.(34) Of course, these pathologies were foreseeable. They are afunction of money. Drug law yields to a higher law: the law ofthe marketplace, the law of supply and demand. The naive attackon the drug supply through an aggressive program of enforcementat each step -- interdiction, arrest, prosecution, and punishment-- results in what Stanford Law School Professor Herbert Packerhas called a "crime tariff'.(35) The crime tariff is whatthe seller must charge the buyer in order to monetize the risk hetakes in breaking the law. It is in short a premium for takingrisks. The criminal law thereby maintains hyper-inflated pricesfor illegal drugs in the black market. For example, an ounce of pure pharmaceutical cocaine atroughly $80, just under $3.00 per gram, becomes worth about$4,480 if sold in the black market at $80 per diluted gram (at50% purity). The crime tariff is thus $4,400 per ounce. This typeof law enforcement succeeds to some unknown extent in makingdrugs less available -- to the extent (probably slight) thatdemand is elastic or sensitive to price. But because the crimetariff is paid to lawbreakers rather than the Government, itpumps vast sums of money into the black market, more than $100billion per year by government estimate.(36) The flow of theseillegal billions through the underground economy finances orsupplies the incentives for the pathologies described above:homicides, street crime, public corruption and internationalnarcoterrorism. If these phenomena were properly costed out, onemight well conclude that the War on Drugs makes a net negativecontribution to the safety, well-being and national securityinterests of the American people. Confronted by these threatening developments, both the publicand the politicians predictably react in fear and anger. Thespecter of uncontrolled and seemingly uncontrollable drug abuseand black marketeering leads to frustrated reaction against thedrug trade. The zeal to "turn the screw of the criminalmachinery -- detection, prosecution, and punishment -- tighterand tighter"(37) leads directly to the adoption ofrepressive and punitive measures that aggrandize governmentalpowers at the expense of individual rights. This reactive, almost reflexive growth of governmental powerand the correlative squelching of personal liberty occur as twoclosely related, if not inseparable, phenomena: 1.thegovernment's sustained attack, motivated by the perceivedimperatives of drug enforcement, on traditional protectionsafforded to criminal defendants under the Bill of Rights, and2.the gradual but perceptible rise of 'Big Brotherism' againstthe public at large in the form of drug testing, investigativedetention, eavesdropping, surveillance, monitoring, and otherintrusive enforcement methods. It may be difficult for those not familiar with criminal lawand procedure to understand the degree to which the War on Drugshas disempowered the criminal defendant, especially in drugcases. Perhaps by focusing on a few of the most important of themany restrictions that have been imposed, one may begin toappreciate the severity of the crackdown on the rights of thoseaccused of crime. First, let us consider pre-trial detention. It is important tounderstand that in the U.S. the law has always favored pre-trialrelease to reinforce the presumption of innocence and to allow adefendant to aid counsel in his defense. The Eighth Amendment tothe United States Constitution prohibits excessive bail; andwhile the cases do not establish a 'right' to bail, the law hasevolved as if there were a presumptive right to pre-trial releaseon bail (or other conditions) except in capital cases where"the proof is evident or the presumption great". Thiswas changed radically by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of1984,(38) which not only authorized pre-trial detention butcreated a statutory _presumption_ in favor of it in any case inwhich, _inter alia_, the defendant is charged with a drug offensepunishable by ten years or more in prison.(39) Although thepresumption is rebuttable, in the first seven months under theact, the government won 704 motions for pre-trial detention whiledefendants won only 185.(40) Pre-trial detention is a severe blowto the morale of a defendant and to his ability to assist in thepreparation of his defense.(41) Another major erosion in the rights of defendants is the morepermissive use of illegally seized evidence. Since 1914, theFourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution has been interpreted toexclude from use in court evidence obtained by federal lawenforcement authorities in an illegal search and seizure.(42)Many states voluntarily adhered to that ruling, and in 1961 theremaining states were required to do so by the decision of theSupreme Court in _Mapp v. Ohio_.(43) But under the relentlesspressure of drug prosecutions and the frequent attempts ofCongress to repeal or restrict the exclusionary rule, the Courtshave whittled away at the protections afforded to individualprivacy. Notwithstanding the independence of the judicial branch, theCourts have in effect joined the war on drugs. Most notably, theU.S. Supreme Court gave its approval to just about everychallenged drug enforcement technique. For example, the Courtupheld the power of drug agents to use the airport drug courierprofile to stop, detain and question citizens without probablecause;(44) to subject a traveller's luggage to a sniffingexamination by drug-detector dogs without probable cause;(45) tomake warrantless searches of automobiles and closed containerstherein;(46) to conduct surveillance of suspects by placingtransmitters or beepers in containers in vehicles;(47) to searchat will without cause ships in inland waterways;(48) and toobtain a search warrant based on an undisclosed informant'stip.(49) The Supreme Court also adopted a 'good-faith exception'to the exclusionary rule for evidence seized in searches madepursuant to defective warrants.(50) It authorized warrantlesssearches of open fields and barns adjacent to a residence.(51) Itsignificantly enlarged the powers of police to stop, question,and detain drivers of vehicles on the highways on suspicion lessthan probable cause(52) or with no suspicion at all at fixedcheckpoints or road blocks.(53) The Court also validatedwarrantless aerial surveillance, that is airplane overflights ofprivate property,(54) the warrantless search of a motor homeoccupied as a residence,(55) and the warrantless search of thepurse of a public school student.(56) In the realm of search andseizure, there is hardly a drug case that the government failedto win. Indeed, the Supreme Court in _Albernaz_ apparently placedits imprimatur on the turn-the-screw approach of the U.S.Congress. Thus, the crackdown mentality prevails not only in thepolitical realm but, to use Madison's phrase, in "the leastdangerous branch" as well. One further example of the crackdown atmosphere prevailing inthe U.S. comes from the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986,(57) in whichCongress not only created new crimes but added to the penaltieswhich already existed. The effect of the Act is that drug crimesnow rank among the most seriously punished offenses in the UnitedStates Criminal Code. For example, the Act provides mandatoryminimum penalties of five and ten years in prison depending upondrug and weight involved; in the case of possession with intentto distribute five kilograms of cocaine, the penalty is a minimumof ten years up to a maximum of life imprisonment. Even as littleas five grams of cocaine base require not less than five years inprison and a maximum of 40 years. In both cases, the range ofpenalties rises to a minimum of 20 years and a maximum of life ifdeath or serious bodily injury results from the use of suchsubstances. It should be emphasized that these penalties apply to_first-time_ drug offenders; those with a prior state or federaldrug conviction must receive a _mandatory life term_ under thesecircumstances. The fact that these penalties are so severe, more stringent infact than sentences typically meted out to robbers orrapists,(58) illustrates one of the themes of this statement:people in the U.S. are so fearful and angry about their inabilityto contain drug trafficking that they are resorting to extremist,desperation measures. More than one public official has proposedsimply shooting suspected drug-carrying planes out of the sky.The atmosphere is perhaps best conveyed by the judicial opinionof a respected federal judge in Miami who, in an order denyingbail pending appeal, condemned drug dealers as "merchants ofmisery, destruction, and death" whose greed has wrought"hideous evil" and "unimaginable sorrow" uponthe nation. Their crimes, he wrote, are "unforgivable".(59) Andif drug crimes are literally "unforgivable",traditional constitutional and statutory protections forindividual rights can be discounted or discarded. One congressmanin fact complained about the extent to which legal protectionsinterfered with the prosecution of drug cases: "[I]n the Waron Narcotics we have met the enemy and he is the U.S. code. Ihave never seen such a maze of laws and hangups..."(60) Inthat spirit, and in the spirit of the angry judge just quoted,the punitive measures I have described, along with dozens ofothers, such as forfeiture of defense attorney's fees,(61) havebecome 'logical' measures in an endless cycle of crackdowns andfailures. Perhaps if these repressive laws applied only to drugdefendants, who could be dismissed as an alien 'them', few wouldcare and fewer still would protest. But this kind of reactionaryforce cannot be contained, cannot apply only to those accused ofdrug crime. In fact, the tentacles of drug enforcement havealready spread out to reach into the lives of ordinary people,not just to those involved in the drug underworld. Theseintrusions into the lives of civilian society take many forms.One of the most obvious is the rapid proliferation of mandatorydrug testing of employees and job applicants in the U.S. CivilService,(62) state and local civil services, and in the privatesector as well. Some 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies nowsubject their applicants or employees to urinalysis.(63)Government surveillance is on the increase in the form ofwiretaps and the maintenance of 1.5 million or more names inNADDIS, a drug investigative data bank. On a more prosaic level,the War on Drugs hampers the mobility of travellers, who aresubjected to road blocks, detained for questioning at airports,and whose luggage can be diverted for sniffing by drug-detectordogs. One of the latest repressive anti-drug initiatives to emergefrom Washington is called 'zero tolerance', begun by the CustomsService on March 21st. It means, in a nutshell, punishing drugusers to promote 'user accountability' and to reduce 'the demandside of the equation'. One manifestation of this policy occurs inthe effort to promote federal criminal prosecution of personsfound in possession of small amounts of drugs for which theyformerly would have escaped prosecution or been referred to localauthorities for prosecution. On March 30th, 1988 Attorney GeneralMeese sent a memorandum to all United States Attorneysencouraging the selective prosecution of "middle and upperclass users" in order to "send the message that thereis no such thing as 'recreational' drug use..." More widely known is the seizure and forfeiture of cars,planes, or boats of persons found in possession of even traceamounts of illegal drugs; these forfeited assets in effect imposemassive fines far greater than would ordinarily be imposed upon acriminal conviction for drug possession; but as civil forfeitureis in _rem_, no conviction or prosecution is required at all. Some examples: On April 30th, the Coast Guard boarded andseized the motor yacht _Ark Royal_, valued at $25 million,because 10 marijuana _seeds_ and two stems were found aboard.Public criticism prompted a return of the boat upon payment of $1,600 in fines and fees by the owner. The 52-foot _Mindy_ wasimpounded for a week because of cocaine dust in a rolled-updollar bill. The $80 million oceanographic research vessel_Atlantis II_ was seized in San Diego whent he Coast Guard found0.01 ounce of marijuana in a crewman's shaving kit. It wasreturned also. But a Michigan couple returning from a Canadianvacation lost the wife's 1987 Cougar when Customs agents foundtwo marijuana cigarettes in the pocket of her husband. No chargeswere filed, but the car was kept by the government. In Key West,Florida, David Phelps, a shrimp fisherman, lost his 73-footshrimper to the coast guard who found three grams of cannabisseeds and stems aboard. Under the law, the boat is forfeitablewhether or not Phelps had any responsibility for the drugs. Threeweeks later, the boat had not been returned. There are many otherways, too numerous to mention in this statement, that the War onDrugs has choked off civil liberties in the U.S. In 1987, the United States celebrated the bicentennial of itsConstitution. The framers of the Constitution were animated bythe spirit of William Pitt's dictum that "unlimited power isapt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it."(64) Theytherefore created a constitutional structure in whichgovernmental power was limited in the first instance andconstrained in the second by the system of checks and balances.The Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution,were added in 1791 to further secure personal freedom fromgovernmental oppression. The War on Drugs has substantially undermined the Americantradition of limited government and personal autonomy. Since theearly 1980s, the prevailing attitude, both within Government andin the broader society, has been that the crackdown on drugs isso imperative that extraordinary measures are justified. The endhas come to justify the means. The result is that Americans havesignificantly less freedom than they did only five or six yearsago. DEVELOPMENTS IN 1988: POLARIZATION Election year politics continues to ratchet the War on Drugsmachinery tighter and tighter. In June the Administrationdeclared its goal of a "drug-free America".(65) Duringthe month of April, the Senate voted 93 to 0 to adopt theAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, creating a $2.6 billion specialreserve fund for anti-drug programs over and above the regularannual budget of three-plus billion dollars. (As noted above, theregular budget represents a manifold increase in the level offunding that prevailed when the war on drugs was declared.) Thefrustration of Congress with drug-producing nations of LatinAmerica, crystallized by the stalemate with General Noriega inPanama, has produced a number of controversial proposalsinvolving the threat of sanctions(66) and the use of militaryforce to destroy coca crops or to capture fugitives from U.S.drug charges. Secretary Carlucci's opposition to arrest powersfor the military services may tone down the final bill, but anexpanded military surveillance role seems likely. At the statelevel, the National Guard has already been deployed on anti-drugsearch and destroy missions. The President on April 19th "call[ed] upon the House andSenate to vote promptly on my bill providing for capitalpunishment when a death results from drug dealing, and when a...law enforcement officer is murdered." In the latest piece offundamentalist-style anti-drug zealotry, the House on September22nd voted 375-30 to adopt capital punishment, for a drugexception to the exclusionary rule, to deny college student loansto anyone convicted of possessing drugs, to impose without trialup to $10,000 in "civil fines" for a person caught inpossession of drugs, and to impose a mandatory five-year prisonsentence on anyone convicted of possession of crack cocaine.Other "zero tolerance" style bills abound. A HouseRepublican Task force has introduced a bill calling forconfiscation of 25 percent of the adjusted gross income and netassets of anyone caught possessing illegal substances. It wouldalso cut off federal highway funds to states that do not suspenddrivers' licenses of persons convicted of using drugs.(67) As weget closer to the November election, one can predict withconfidence that more of these proposals will surface and thattheir extremist nature will increase. But at the same time there is movement in the oppositedirection. Respected journalists and other opinion leaders havebegun to break ranks with the War on Drugs, in some casessuggesting that it be abandoned altogether. Here are some notableexamples. David Boaz, Vice President for public policy atlibertarian-oriented Cato Institute, wrote an op-ed piece for the_New York Times_ (March 17th) "Let's Quit the DrugWar". In it he denounced the war on drugs as"unwinnable" and destructive to other values such ascivil liberties and advocated a "withdrawal" from thewar. Edwin M. Yoder Jr. of the _Washington Post_ Writers Groupcalled the war on drugs "dumb" and compared it to theprohibition of alcohol for "encouraging and enrichingmobsters" (March 4th, 1988). On March 10th, 1988, RichardCohen of the _Los Angeles Times_ Syndicate published a pieceendorsing the idea of a plan for the government distribution ofdrugs in order to "recognize the drug problem is with us tostay -- a social and medical problem, but not necessarily alaw-enforcement one. We've been making war on drugs long enough.It's time we started making sense instead." By May and June,articles of this type became a staple item in newspapers all overthe country as editors hopped aboard the "legalization"bandwagon. This sample of articles shows the emergence of a significantbody of opinion opposed to the war on drugs. What is perhaps evenmore significant is that the opposition transcends theliberal/conservative split. Traditionally, conservatives haveadvocated strict law enforcement and liberals have beenidentified with a permissive approach to the drug issue. Nowhighly respected conservative spokesmen have also begun todissent from the War on Drugs. Even before the recent spate of articles described above,prominent conservative columnist William F . Buckley Jr. hadreversed his position and advocated the legalization of drugs asthe only effective course of governmental action. NobelPrize-winning economist Milton Friedman has made publicstatements advocating more market-oriented approaches to theregulation of drugs. _National Review_, the most prominent organof conservative opinion, through its editor Richard Vigilante,published a piece (December 5th, 1986) exposing the Anti DrugAbuse Act of 1986 as a manifestation of public panic andcriticizing the intrusiveness of drug testing and otherenforcement measures. He also rejected the war on drugs asintolerant and politically unwise: "Embracing the drughysteria requires a rejection of essential conservativeprinciples." In the same issue of NR is an article byRichard C. Cowan, entitled 'How the Narcs Created Crack', arguingas follows: "Any realistic approach to the drug problem mustbegin with the legalization of small scale cultivation and saleof marijuana so that it is separated from the other, moredangerous drugs.... We need not fear that if we stop the lyingand hypocrisy, the American people are going to destroythemselves with drugs." This debate has captured the attention of the mainstreammedia.(69) Clearly, the challenge to the monopoly status of theWar on Drugs is gaining ground. Nothing approaching this level ofdissent has been seen or heard since the War on Drugs started. The dissent has also begun to spill over to the politicalsector. For example, the _ABA Journal_ (January l st, l 988)reported that the New York County Lawyers Association Committeeon Law Reform published a report advocating the decriminalizationof heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. New York State Senator JosephL. Galiber, from a district in the drug-ravaged Bronx, introducedon April 18th a bill in the New York State legislature todecriminalize the possession, distribution, sale, and use of allforms of controlled substances under the aegis of aState-Controlled Substance Authority. At a speech at the NationalConference of Mayors and again on a May 10th, 1988, broadcast ofABC's 'Nightline', the Mayor of Baltimore called forcongressional hearings to study the issue. Other mayors and a fewcongressmen supported him. And, surprisingly, Congressman CharlesRangel, Chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuseand Control, scheduled a one-day hearing for September 29th,1988, clearly inadequate for the task at hand, yet perhaps aharbinger of the future. Even if nothing constructive can emergeamidst election year maneuvering, at least the genie of change isout of the bottle. There are also pressures beginning to come from abroad. Forexample, the attorney general of Colombia said in a telephoneinterview with the _Miami Herald_ (February 23rd, 1988) thatColombia's battles against drug-trafficking rings have been afailure, calling them "useless". He suggested thatlegalizing the drug trade is something that the government"may have to consider" in the future. _The Economist_magazine ran a cover story (April 2-8) called 'Getting GangstersOut of Drugs', advocating the legalized and taxed distribution ofcontrolled substances. It followed up with similar commentarieson May 21st and June 4th. _El Pais_, the most influential Spanishnewspaper, also recommended "La legalizacion de ladroga" in an editorial (May 22nd, 1988).What accounts forthis trend? Negative experience with the War on Drugs certainlyplays a role. In the _Structure of Scientific Revolutions_,Thomas S. Kuhn argued that "the process by which a newcandidate for paradigm replaces its predecessors" occurs"only after persistent failure to solve a noteworthy puzzlehas given rise to crisis" (pp.144-45). There is little doubtthat the perception that the War on Drugs is a failure atcontrolling drug supply has spread significantly. Uncritical acceptance of the War on Drugs is no longerpossible. And the perception that it has negative side effects,breeding crime, violence and corruption, has spread even to thecomic pages of the daily newspapers.(69) In a more serious vein,Ted Koppel's "Nightline" broadcast a special three-hour"National Town Forum" on the subject of legalization.Perhaps we have already reached Kuhn's stage of "persistentfailure and crisis", in which the war on drugs has beendislodged as the only conceivable paradigm for the control ofdrugs in the U.S. What now should be done?

(66) 1n February, the House Foreign Affairs Committee TaskForce on International Narcotics Control demanded that the StateDepartment impose sanctions against Colombia, Peru, Bolivia andother nations in order to force them to intensify their drugenforcement efforts. (67) 'The Drug Enforcement Report', June 23rd, 1988, p.2. (69) _Time_ magazine ran a cover story on the debate called'Thinking the Unthinkable' (May 30th, 1988). _Newsweek_ did asimilar piece. The _New York Times_ and the _Miami Herald_ bothran front page stories on the same subject in May. (69) The syndicated strip 'Bloom County', for example,satirized the issue on at least two separate occaslons. The April18th, 1988, strip portrayed a scenario in which a lobbyist forsmugglers makes contnbutions to anti-drug candidates forpolitical office as a way to keep drug prices high. "Nothingmakes us madder than some liberal talking druglegalization." TOWARD A NEW BEGINNING IN DRUG CONTROL One historically tested model of exploring policy reform isthe appointment of a National Study Commission of experts,politicians and lay leaders to make findings of fact, canvass afull range of policy options, and recommend further researchwhere needed. The precedent set by the National Commission onMarijuana and Drug Abuse in the early 1970s offers a model thatmight usefully be emulated in many respects. At the very least, aNational Commission performs a vital educational function: itspublic hearings and attendant media coverage inform the public,bringing to their attention vital facts and a broader array ofpolicy options. The level of public discourse is almost certainto be elevated. Only those who prefer ignorance to knowledgecould possibly oppose the commission process.What should be theagenda of such a commission? Its over-riding goal should be todevelop policies directed toward the objectives of 1.reducingdrug abuse and 2.reducing the black-market pathologies resultingfrom the billions in drug money generated by drug lawenforcement. In pursuit of these dual goals, the commission'sstudy might benefit from adherence to the following five points: I. DEFINE THE DRUG PROBLEM What exactly is the problem regarding drugs in the U.S.? Theabsence of an agreed-upon answer to this question is one of theprimary sources of incoherence in present law and policy. Peoplenow speak of "the drug problem" in referring to atleast five very different phenomena: 1. the mere use of anyillegal drugs; 2. especially by teenagers; 3. the abuse ofillegal drugs; 4. drug-induced misbehavior that endangers orharms others, such as driving while impaired; and 5.drug-trafficking phenomena (crime, violence, and corruption)arising from the vast sums of money generated in the black marketin drugs. This confusion in the very statement of the problemnecessarily engenders confusion in solving it. The "drugproblem" as Edward Brecher reminds us in his classic _Licitand Illicit Drugs_ is itself a problem. Therefore, it does notand cannot lead to the formulation of useful solutions. It wouldbe a real breakthrough if the Congress or the next Presidentwould generate a meaningful statement of the "drugproblem". Otherwise, we are condemned to confirm the truth of EricSevareid's quip that the chief cause of problems is solutions. II. STATE YOUR GOALS A creative definition or redefinition of the drug problemwould of itself carry us toward a (re)statement of goals.Rational policy-making is impossible without a clear articulationof the goals sought to be achieved. Part of that impossibilityarises from the inconsistency between, for example, pursuit ofexisting goal number one by an attack on the drug supply andpursuit of goal number five, the suppression of drug money. Pursuit of the first creates a crime tariff which makes thepursuit of the last more or less impossible. Instead, the resultof drug enforcement is a black market estimated by the governmentto be over $100 billion per year, money that funds or gives riseto homicidal violence, street corruption by addicts, corruptionof public officials and international narco-terrorism. It istherefore essential to distinguish between problems arising fromdrugs and problems arising from drug money. For example, how muchcriminality is attributable not to the psychopharmacology ofdrugs but to the excessive prices intentionally caused by theprohibition of drugs? Rational policy-makers have to distinguishbetween the two and acknowledge the trade-offs between the twolines of attack. III. SET REALISTIC AND PRINCIPLED PRIORITIES BASED ON TRUTH The suppression of drugs as an end to itself is frequentlyjustified by arguments that drugs cause addiction, injury, andeven death in the short or long run. Granted that all drug usehas the potential for harm, it is clear beyond any rationalargument that most drug use does not cause such harm. DEADirector John Lawn to the contrary ("Drugs are illegalbecause they are bad"), drugs are not harmful _per se_.Exposure to drugs is not the same as exposure to radioactivewaste.(70) Rather, the overwhelming majority of incidents of drug use arewithout lasting personal or social consequence, just as theoverwhelming majority of drinking causes no harm to the drinkeror to society. Accepting the truth of that premise means that notall drug use need be addressed by the criminal law, and thatsociety might actually benefit from a policy of benign neglectrespecting some forms of drug use. I have in mind the Dutchmodel, where nothing is legal but some things are simply ignored,cannabis in particular. NORML estimates that there areapproximately one half-million arrests per year for marijuana,almost all for simple possession or petty sale offenses.Depending upon the age of consent chosen, most of these arrestscould be eliminated from the criminal justice system, therebyachieving a massive freeing of resources for the policing of realcrime. Because we live in a world of limited resources, it is notpossible to do everything. It is therefore both logical andnecessary to make distinctions among things that are more or lessimportant. I have in mind at least five basic dichotomies: 1. drug use by children (top priority) versus drug use byadults (low priority); 2. marijuana smoking (low priority) versus use of harder drugs(higher priority); 3. public use of drugs (high priority) versus private use ofdrugs at home (low priority); 4. drug consumption (no priority) versus drug impairment (highpriority); 5. occasional use (low priority) versus chronic or dependentuse (higher priority). From these general criteria for drug policy, I would commendto the National Commission five specific goals for an effective,principled drug policy: 1._Protect the Children_. I think this priority isself-evident and needs no discussion. I would simply add thatthis is the only domain in which "zero tolerance" makesany sense at all and might even be feasible if enforcementresources were concentrated on this as a top priority. 2._Get Tough on the Legal Drugs_. It is common knowledge thatalcohol (100,000 annual deaths) and tobacco (360,000 annualdeaths) far exceed the illegal drugs as sources of death,disease, and dysfunction in the U.S. Everyone knows that alcoholand tobacco are big business -- the advertising budget alone foralcohol runs about $2 billion a year -- and, what is worse, thestates and federal government are in complicity with the sellersof these deadly drugs by virtue of the billions in tax revenuesthat they reap. I am not, however, suggesting prohibition of these drugs. Thatis wrong in principle and impossible in practice, as experienceteaches. Nonetheless, there are more restrictive measure that canand should be undertaken. One is to get rid of cigarette vendingmachines so that cigarettes are not so readily available tominors. A second is to require or recommend to the states andlocalities more restrictive hours of sale. A third is to levytaxes on these products that are consistent with their socialcosts -- billions of dollars in property damage, disease, andlost productivity.(71) Those costs should be financed largely bythe sale of these products; at present prices, society is clearlysubsidizing those products by providing police, fire, ambulanceservices for road accidents; medicare and medicaid reimbursementfor therapy, surgery, prosthesis or other medical care; and manyother hidden costs effectively externalized by the industriesfrom smoker and drinker to society as a whole. Precise numbers need to be derived from studies, but Iwouldn't be surprised to find cigarettes at, say, $10 a pack andhard liquor at, say, $30-$50 a bottle to be priced moreconsistently with their true social costs. Such taxes would havethe additional salutary effect of reducing the consumption ofthese dangerous products to the extent that their demand iselastic. 3. _Public Safety and Order_. Here we need policies directedtoward protection of the public from accident and injury on thehighway, in the workplace and from unruly disruptions in publicstreets, public transport, parks and other gathering places.Programs specifically tailored to accomplish this more focusedgoal make a lot more sense than futile and counter productive"zero tolerance" approaches. Street-level lawenforcement practices need to be reviewed to see to what extentthey may actually encourage hustling drugs in the street to avoidarrests and forfeitures that might follow from fixed points ofsale. Promotion of driving and workplace safety require moreknowledge. Nothing should be assumed. Drug use, as the AirForce's and Freud's examples show, does not automatically meanthat a pilot or driver is impaired. Even with marijuana there isambiguous evidence as to its effect on motor co-ordination.(72)Responsible research is required. 4. _Protect Public Health_. The emphasis here is on the word"public". Policy should be directed toward 1. treatmentof addicts on a voluntary basis and 2. true epidemiologicalconcerns such as the use of drugs by pregnant women and thepotential for transmission of AIDS by I.V. drug users. Addictiontreatment is now shamefully underfunded, with months-long waitinglists in many cities. Purely individualized risks are not inprinciple a public health matter and are in any case trivial inmagnitude compared to those now accepted from alcohol andtobacco. Judge Young found no known lethal dose of marijuana.Even with cocaine, which has lethal potential, less than 2,000deaths per year result even though billions of lines or puffs ofcocaine are consumed every year. (Other long-term harms mayresult but are not systematically known at this time.) In any event, harmfulness is not the sole touchstone ofregulation; the requirements of goal number five, listed below,demand considerable deference to individual choice in thisdomain. 5. _Respect the Value of Individual Liberty andResponsibility_. The current administration's goal of a drug-freeAmerica, except for children, is both ridiculous -- as absurd asa liquor-free America -- and wrong in principle. This is notfundamentalist Ayatollah Land after all. A democratic societymust respect the decisions made by its adult citizens, even thoseperceived to be foolish or risky. After all, is it different inprinciple to protect the right of gun ownership, which producessome ten to twelve thousand homicides per year and thousands morenon-fatal injuries? Is it different in principle to protect theright of motorcyclists, skydivers or mountain climbers to risktheir lives? Is it different to permit children to ride bicycleswhich "cause" tens of thousands of crippling injuriesand deaths per year? To say that something is"dangerous" does not automatically supply a reason tooutlaw it. Indeed, the general presumption in our society is thatcompetent adults, with access to necessary information, areentitled to take risks of this kind as part of the right to life,liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Why are drugs different? It would be truly totalitarian if thegovernment could decide these matters. After all, if thegovernment is conceded to have the power to prohibit what isdangerous, does it not then have the power to compel what issafe? More specifically, if one drug can be prohibited on theground that it is dangerous to the individual, would it then notbe permissible for the government to degree that beneficial dosesof some other drug must be taken at specified intervals.Thefreedom of American citizens has already been seriously eroded bythe War on Drugs.(73) More civil liberties hang in the balance ofthe 1988 Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act pending in Congress andfurther legislation in years to come. Is the defense of Americansfrom drugs to be analogized to the defense of the Vietnamese fromCommunism, that it was necessary to destroy the city of Hue inorder to save it? The National Commission should give seriousweight to this value in its policy recommendation. IV. FOCUS ON THE BIG PICTURE Present drug policy suffers from a kind of micro-think thatborders on irresponsibility and is sometimes downright silly.This typically manifests itself in proud administrationannouncements or reports to congressional committees of a newinitiative or new accomplishment without regard to its impact onthe bottom line. The examples are endless -- a joint strike forcewith the government of the Bahamas; shutdown of a source ofsupply; the Pizza Connection case, the largest organized crimeheroin trafficking case ever made by the federal government; anew bank secrecy agreement with the Caymans; a new cocaeradication program in Bolivia or Peru, and so on. But none ofthese programs or "accomplishments" has ever made anynoticeable or lasting impact on the drug supply. Even now, as theGodfather of Bolivian cocaine resides in a Bolivian prison, isthere any observable reduction in the supply of cocaine? The lack of insistence that enforcement programs should make adifference in the real world produces fatuous reports like this1979 report by GAO to the Congress: "Gains made inControlling Illegal Drugs, Yet The Drug TradeFlourishes."(74) In what sense is it meaningful to say that gains are made ifthe bottom line grows worse and worse? This is reprehensibledoubletalk or Newspeak that should not be tolerated byresponsible public officials. The whole drug enforcemententerprise needs to be put on a more businesslike basis, lookingto the bottom line and not to isolated "achievements"of the war on drugs. In fact, the investor analogy is a good oneto use: if the war on drugs were incorporated as a businessenterprise, with its profits to be determined by its success incontrolling drug abuse and drug trafficking, who would invest init? Even if its operating budget were to be doubled to $6 billionper year, or doubled again to $12 billion per year, would it be agood personal investment? If not, why is it a good socialinvestment? This kind of hard-headed thinking is exactly what is lackingand has been lacking throughout the War on Drugs. No attentionhas been paid to considerations of cause and effect, or totrade-offs, or to cost-benefit analysis. New anti-druginitiatives are not subjected to critical questioning: whatmarginal gains, if any, can be projected from new programs or anadditional commitment of resources? Conversely, how might thingsworsen? For example, many law enforcement officials believe thatthe coast guard's "successful" interdiction ofmarijuana coming from Jamaica and Colombia in the early 1980s hadtwo negative side-effects: the substitution of domesticcultivation of more potent marijuana in California (andthroughout the U.S.) and the diversion of smugglers into morecompact and more readily concealable cocaine. Was thatinterdiction initiative therefore truly successful? Weren't thoseside-effects reasonably foreseeable? There are other examples. Drug gangs are probably far more ruthlessly violent today thanin the 1970s because they have learned to adapt to aggressivelaw-enforcement methods. The friendly governments of Colombia,Peru, Bolivia are far weaker today, far more corrupt, and farmore subject to narco-terrorist subversion because of similaradaptations there by the drug cartel and its associates. Has ournational security been thus advanced by the War on Drugs? For these reasons, it is important to abjure meaningless,isolated "victories" in the war on drugs and to focuson whether a program or policy offers some meaningful overallimpact on the safety, security and well-being of the Americanpeople. In this respect, does it really matter that the DEA hasdoubled the number of drug arrests from 6,000 to 12,000 duringthe 1980s? Or that the Customs Service has dramatically increased itsdrug seizures to over 100,000 pounds of cocaine? Or that kingpinslike Carlos Lehder Rivas have been convicted and imprisoned forlife plus 135 years? Might it not be that the resources devotedto those anti-drug initiatives were not merely wasted butactually counterproductive? Similarly, it is critical to pay scrupulous attention to causeand effect. Throughout the war on drugs, administration officialshave been making absurd claims about the effects of anti-drugpolicies. Recently President Reagan asserted that the War onDrugs is working. His evidence? Marijuana smoking is down to 18million per year and experimentation with cocaine by high schoolseniors in the University of Michigan survey declined by 20percent. Everyone trained in logic knows that this is the fallacyof _post hoc ergo propter hoc_. But one need not be trained inlogic to realize that there is no provable correlation betweenlaw enforcement initiatives and levels of drug consumption.Indeed, the same University of Michigan survey shows thatmarijuana consumption peaked in 1979, three years before the Waron Drugs even began. Cocaine is purer, cheaper, and moreavailable than ever before. If use is down, it is not because ofsuccessful law enforcement. Most categories of drug use are downand will most likely continue to go down as people become moreeducated and more concerned about health and fitness, fueled insome immeasurable degree by media reports of celebrity overdosedeaths such as those of David Kennedy, John Belushi, Len Bias,and Don Rogers.(75) Another important factor is the aging of the baby boomgeneration. That demographic bulge leaves fewer young peoplebehind and thus contributes to the aging of the population as awhole. An older population is simply one that is less likely touse cocaine, marijuana, and heroin.To attribute these changes tolaw enforcement levels is at the least unprofessional. Theliberalization of marijuana laws in California, Oregon, Maine,and elsewhere in the early 1970s produced no observable rise inconsumption (either new users or increased frequency) ofmarijuana compared to other states.(76) The connection between law and individual behavior at thislevel is remote. Government policies are no more responsible forthe current decline in drug use than they were for the boom inthe 1970s and early 1980s. Drug use will almost certainly declinein the 1990s, no matter what law enforcement does, for roughlythe same reasons that cigarette smoking has declined dramaticallywithout any change in the law. V. SUBSTITUTE STUDY FOR SPECULATION The War on Drugs has produced a siege mentality. Senators fromlarge states speak of invasions and national security threats.Even professionals who should know better succumb to anti-drughysteria. A former director of the National Institute of DrugAbuse claimed that without the War on Drugs to restrain thepeople, we would have 60-100,000,000 users of cocaine in thiscountry.(77) Now this is extremely unlikely; because of thestimulant nature of the drug, it appeals mostly to youngerpeople, the population is aging, there is already a downwardtrend in cocaine except for crack, and so forth. But rather thantrading assertion and counter-assertion, the real question isepistemological: How does the Director know what he 'knows'? Clearly, there is no empirical basis for his claim. It musttherefore be an expression of fear or perhaps political maneuver,but clearly something other than a statement of fact. Why wouldthe Director of the public agency most responsible for informingthe public on drugs take that tack? Whatever his reasons, wildspeculation is not the path to informed judgment and intelligent,workable policy. Why not truly confront the question of what lessrestricted availability of cocaine would mean in terms ofincreased drug use, taking account of both prevalence andincidence.(78) There are a number of ways in which this might be done if wetruly want to know the answers. One way is market research. Astandard technique of market research is to conduct surveys andask people about what they desire in a product in terms of price,quality, and other features. How much w ill they buy at variousprices? The same techniques are adaptable, _mutatis mutandis_, toillegal drugs. What about the effects of the drug? Is it addictive?Longitudinal studies of the kind pioneered by Ronald Siegel ofUCLA should be encouraged.(79) NIDA Household Surveys registeronly gross numbers and do not track users. (They do not evencover group quarters, such as college dormitories and militarybarracks, where drug use may be higher than average.) At thepresent time we have almost no real-world knowledge of theexperience of past and present cocaine users, except thoseunrepresentative few who come forward as former or recoveringaddicts. Even NIDA has conceded that we lack any estimate of therelative proportions of addictive use versus experimental orother non-consequential use in the total population of cocaineusers.(80) Isn't that critical information in regulating thedrug? (Drug users should be systematically interviewed, but theywill be loath to step forward in the current climate ofrepression.) Useful experiments might also be performed using volunteersfrom the prison population (for instance, those serving lifesentences without parole) and perhaps volunteers from themilitary services. How would men behave and how would theirhealth fare with abundant access to cocaine? Would it be usedwidely or intensively or both? Finally, comparative studies fromcountries such as Holland can tell us a great deal about theeffects of more freely available cannabis and heroin, althoughnot so with respect to cocaine. We have a lot to learn from theDutch. CONCLUSION I endorse a substantial measure of relaxation of drug laws insome respects simultaneously with a substantial measure ofintensification in other respects: the enforcement of laws toprotect children, along with more stringent laws regarding thesale of liquor and tobacco. As to the first point, some measureof relaxation of drug laws is both correct in principle andpragmatically necessary in the real world of limited resources.But this is not a 'surrender' in the War on Drugs. There is aparadox here: that the use of less force may actually result inproducing more control over the drug situation in this country. Consider the analogy of a panic stop in an automobile. In atypical scenario, a driver observes a sudden obstruction in hispath and slams on the brakes in order to avoid a collision. If heuses too much force on the pedal, the sudden forward weighttransfer will very likely induce front-wheel lockup. At thatpoint, the car starts skidding out of control. If the driverturns the wheel left or right, the car will simply keep onskidding forward toward the very obstacle that he is trying toavoid. In this moment of panic, the 'logical' or instinctivething to do is to stomp the brake pedal even harder. But that isabsolutely wrong. The correct thing to do to stop the skid is tomodulate the brake pedal, releasing it just enough to permit thefront wheels to begin rolling again so that steering control isrestored. Thus, the correct and safe response is counterintuitive, whilethe instinctive response sends the driver skidding towarddisaster. I leave it to the Committee to decide whether this hasany relevance in the re-making of drug policy. (70) Truth-based legislation will also have to acknowledgethat 'recreational' drugs also have beneficial uses, most notablymedicinal ones. Respectable authorities in the U.S. and abroadendorse heroin for pain relief for terminally ill patients.Francis Young, the chief administrative law judge of the DEA,recommended this summer that marijuana be re-classified to permitdoctors to prescribe it for relief of nausea from chemotherapyand for other purposes. His opinion concludes that marijuana is"far safer than many foods we commonly consume." andthat its medical benefits are "clear beyond anyquestion". Judge Young had previously recommended that MDMA("ecstasy") be removed from Schedule I and be madelegally available to psychiatrists for use in treating theirpatients.Medical uses are not the only beneficial effects ofdrugs. An AP wire from Frankfurt reported that the U.S. Air Forceallows its pilots to take Dexedrine "so that they are ableto fly when they haven't gotten enough sleep or don't feel fitenough." Hundreds of thousands of 'drug abusers' similarlystimulate themselves with amphetamines and cocaine. Over acentury ago, Sigmund Freud discovered in self-experiments thatmoderate doses (one tenth of a gram) of cocaine improved hismuscular strength and reaction time. See Blyck, _Cocaine Papers:Sigmund Freud_ (New York: New American Library, 1974), pp. 98,103. (71) The Research Triangle Institute estimated the annualcosts of alcohol abuse to society at $116 billion in 1983.Conference Board, 'Corporate Strategies for Controlling SubstanceAbuse' 13 (Axel, ed., 1986). With 1,000 daily deaths from lungcancer and other diseases often preceded by years of medicaltreatment, there must be billions more in social costsattributable to tobacco. (72) See Knepper, 'Puff the Dangerous Drug', _Car and Driver_,June 1980, p.43. (73) See Wisotsky, 'Crackdown: The Emerging "DrugException" to the Bill of Rights', 38 _Hastings Law Journal_889 (1987). (74) GGD-80-4 (October 25th, 1979). (75) About the only category of drug use that appears to be upis crack, and even that may be confined in large part to urbanghettos. See the _New York Times_, July 10th, 1988. The overalldecline, of course, is a positive development so long as it isnot offset by a corresponding rise in other drug use, such asalcohol or tobacco, or suicide or other forms ofhealth-endangering behavior. In this regard, the NationalCommission should fund research directed toward the developmentof some meaningful index of health and well-being by somehowcombining total morbidity/mortality date from all major causes.It would be a true Big Picture accomplishment if we could somehowconfirm that specified demographic segments were not only usingdrugs less but were also happier and healthier. (76) Maloff, 'A Review of the Effects of the Decriminalizationof Marijuana', _Contemporary Drug Problems_, p.132 (Fall, 1981). (77) Brinkley, 'The War on Narcotics: Can It Be Won?', _NewYork Times_, September 14th, 1984. (78) To speak of a rise or fall in drug use is simplistic. Itis important to distinguish between prevalence (the number ofusers) and incidence (the frequency of use). In measurable healthconsequences, it may be meaningless if the number of people whotry cocaine goes up or down; conversely a change in the amountsand frequency of consumption may significantly alter morbidityand mortality. (79) In a 1984 paper for NIDA (Research Monograph 50), Siegelconcluded that the "hypothesis that long-term use of cocaineis inevitably associated with an escalating dependency marked bymore frequent patterns of use is not supported by thefindings." Instead he found that "social recreationaldrug users maintained relatively stable patterns of use" inthe face of ready supplies and increased income as they aged. (80) Jerome H. Jaffe, 'Foreword', _Cocaine Use In America:Epidemiologic and Clinical Perspectives_ (NIDA, 1985). Otherresearch agendas should include the possibility of addictionmaintenance treatment and other therapeutic uses of cocaine.

The drug problem in our society is clearly one which is veryserious and which concerns all Americans. Although substanceabuse cuts across all class and racial lines, the impact of thedrug problem has probably been greatest among lowincome andminority communities. In my testimony today, I would like tofocus in particular on the impact of the war on drugs as itaffects Black and Hispanic communities. YOUNG BLACK MEN AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM In February of this year, my organization released a reporton race and the criminal justice system. The report, "YoungBlack Men and the Criminal Justice System: A Growing NationalProblem," received extensive attention and shocked much ofthe nation. The report documented that almost one out of fourBlack men in the age group 2029 is under the control of thecriminal justice system prison, jail, probation or parole. Thiscontrasts with one in sixteen white males and one in ten Hispanicmales. These figures for Black males, shocking as they are, actuallyunderstate the extent of the problem since our study only did aoneday count of the criminal justice system. If we were able tocalculate the rates for an entire year, or tenyear period, thenumber of Black males under criminal justice control would beconsiderably higher than one in four. There is also strong reason to believe that the figures forHispanics represent an undercount. There has been a great deal ofinconsistency in the way in which Hispanics are counted incriminal justice populations, and for many categories, thereexist a large number of offenders for whom no data exist onethnicity. Because of this, it is reasonable to conclude that therate of criminal justice control for young Hispanic males ishigher than one in ten. Also, since Hispanics are counted in thewhite criminal justice populations, the rate of criminal justicecontrol for non-Hispanic whites is therefore less than the one insixteen which we were able to document. Our report further found that the number of young Black men inthe criminal justice system 609,690 far exceeded the number ofBlack men of all ages enrolled in higher education 436,000. Thesetwo figures taken together paint a very disturbing picture. As we noted in our report: For the Black community in general, nearly onefourth of its youngmen are under the control of the criminal justice system at atime when their peers are beginning families, learningconstructive life skills, and starting careers....Unless thecriminal justice system can be used to assist more young Blackmales in pursuing these objectives, any potential positivecontributions they can make to the community will be delayed, orlost forever. Our report estimated that the direct costs to the criminaljustice system for the control of the 609,000 Black men in theirtwenties was $2.5 billion. Each offender who is incarcerated in astate prison costs the taxpayers at least $16,000 a year.Corrections costs have now reached the point where they arehaving a serious impact on state funding for necessary socialservices. In Michigan, for example, state spending forcorrections increased from 2.8 percent of the budget in 1984 to7.2 percent in 1988. The National Conference of State Legislatorsreports that state spending on corrections increased by anaverage of 14.2 percent last year, contributing to "seriousbudget problems" that more than half the states will face in1990. WHY ARE SO MANY YOUNG BLACK MALES UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM? It is important to analyze the factors which have led us tothis distressing situation. The reasons behind this are complex.Many are longstanding problems; others are a result of morerecent criminal justice policies. I would like to outline some ofthe primary causes of this problem, and then to discuss theimpact which the war on drugs has had. 1. "Get Tough" Sentencing Policies The U.S. Sentencing Commission and legislatures in almost allfifty states have adopted a variety of increasingly harshsentencing laws in the past decade. In addition, parole releasepolicies have become more restrictive in many states. Thecombined impact of these policies is that our prison and jailpopulations have doubled in the past decade, to the point wherethere are now more than one million Americans behind bars.Prisons in 41 states are under court order regarding overcrowdingand conditions of confinement. Record numbers of offenders arenow also straining our probation and parole systems. Mandatory minimum drug sentencing laws have played a significantrole in leading to these higher rates of criminal justicecontrol, particularly in regard to prison populations. Two recenthighly publicized cases illustrate this: The American Lawyer reported on the case of Susana SanchezRobles, a migrant worker and mother of five whose husband hadleft her, leaving the family on welfare. Ms. Sanchez Robles drovea drug laden van across the border from Mexico, and received amandatory ten year prison term. Her five year old cries everyevening. Says Ms. Sanchez Robles: "I try to feel strong, butmy strength is just totally defeated when I remember my children. Richard Winrow is a 22year old Los Angeles man who was abandonedby his father as a boy. He and his seven siblings grew up poor,and Winrow ended up dropping out of high school and working atlow wage jobs. A recent conviction for possession of 5 1/2 ouncesof cocaine, a relatively small amount, was his third drugoffense. Under new federal drug laws, Winrow was sentenced tolife without the possibility of parole. The dramatic increases in incarceration, parole and probationrates resulting from our "get tough" policies haveaffected all segments of society. The increase, however, has beenmost significant for Blacks and other minorities, who werealready disproportionately represented in the system. The rise in criminal justice populations has occurred without anyclearcut relationship to the crime rate. FBI reports for the pastdecade indicate that crime rates have had periods of both declineand increase during these years, but that overall there was onlya 2 percent increase in crime rates between 197988. Crime ratesrose again in 1989, even though the nation recorded the highestincrease ever in its prison population. 2. Criminal Justice Focus on Crimes of the Poor The criminal justice system has historically been focusedmuch more on "crime in the streets" than "crime inthe suites." Although we have seen some change in recentyears in the prosecution of white collar offenses, crimes of thepoor have always received greater attention from the criminaljustice system. Since Blacks and Hispanics are disproportionatelyrepresented among lowincome people, this has contributed to theirover-representation in the criminal justice system. This does notimply that crimes of the poor are necessarily either more or lessserious than crimes of the wealthy, but rather, that we have asystem that functions at least in part in a very discretionarymanner. 3. Race and the Criminal Justice System There has been a good deal of debate about the extent towhich race influences criminal justice decisionmaking. A recentstudy by the RAND Corporation concludes that race was not afactor in sentencing decisions in California. It is important tonote, though, that California has a relatively rigid determinatesentencing system, which allows for less variability insentencing outcomes than in many other states. Our report found evidence that the criminal justice system may betreating Black offenders differently than white offenders. Thenumber of young white males who are incarcerated, 247,000,slightly exceeds the number of incarcerated Black males, 212,000.The number of white males receiving probation, though, 697,000,vastly exceeds the figure for Black males, 305,000. While thenature of the offense or prior criminal history may explain thesefigures, a close examination of this disparity should beundertaken to determine to what extent racial bias is a factor. As the authors of the RAND study point out, as well as manyothers, race may play a more prominent role at the level ofarrest and prosecution, where greater discretion may be exercisedby police and prosecutors. This discretion may not always beracially motivated, but it may have a racial impact. To theextent that this is the case, a task for the courts is to attemptto offset any disparity that may have occurred throughappropriate sentencing. 4. Declining Social and Economic Support in Black Communities The relationship between social and economic conditions andindividual crime rates is a complex one. Not all poor people orunemployed people commit crimes, nor do all wealthy or employedpersons refrain from committing crimes. Personality traits,family support, community constraints, and other factors allinfluence individual behavior and the propensity to commit crime. Yet, as criminologist Elliott Currie has noted, "Theevidence for a strong association between inequality and crime isoverwhelming ... It isn't accidental, then, that among developedcountries, the United States is afflicted simultaneously with theworst rates of violent crime, the widest spread of incomeinequality, and the most severe public policies toward thedisadvantaged." The stresses, strains, and lack of opportunity present in so manyminority communities increase the likelihood that individualswithin that community will engage in criminal activities, whetheras a means of obtaining money, to support a drug habit, for achallenge, or for other reasons. Given these factors, we need to look at the deteriorating socialand economic support in the Black community. Essentially, we findthat on a broad range of variables, the situation of Blacks inour society has declined over the past decade. The Center onBudget and Policy Priorities reports that total appropriationsfor low income programs that are not entitlements fell by 54percent from FY 81 to FY 88, when adjusted for inflation. Thisincluded support for job training, health and social services,and housing programs. Also, although the number of Americansliving below the poverty line increased by 3.2 million duringthis period, spending for food stamps decreased by 15 percentwhen adjusted for inflation. Black households make up 36 percentof all households receiving food stamps. Overall, these cutsaffect Blacks and other minorities disproportionately, since theyare disproportionately poor. 5. Lack of Opportunity and Sense of Hopelessness An additional factor contributing to this situation is themost difficult to quantify, yet in some ways the mostsignificant. In many communities today, young people growing uphave little hope for the future. It is one thing for a collegestudent to work at a fast food restaurant as a summer job. It isentirely different for a young person to take on this kind of jobwhen there is little expectation of rising above this entrylevel. The numbers in our report were not as shocking to most people inthe Black community. Instead, they confirmed what many haverecognized for years: for Black males, the criminal justicesystem has become almost an inevitable aspect of growing up. Thisis not to say that it is a "rite of passage," or anevent that is welcomed, but merely, that it is viewed as a partof the life cycle which is almost unavoidable. This is a very sadcommentary on our society. THE "WAR ON DRUGS" AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM A final factor contributing to increased involvement in thecriminal justice system, particularly among Black Americans, isthe war on drugs, and the means by which this war is being waged.This has been the result of two factors. First, the drug problem has been defined basically as a lawenforcement problem, and not a social problem. In terms of ourpolitical rhetoric, our funding priorities, and our policydiscussions, we have primarily chosen an approach whichemphasizes police and prisons over prevention and treatment. Thisis not a new approach, or one which Mr. Bennett's office hasinitiated unilaterally. Most states and localities have takenthis approach for many years, with unfortunately, little impacton either drug use, availability, or drug related crime. Second, although drug use and abuse occurs among all groups insociety, drug law enforcement is disproportionately weightedtoward inner city, low income drug use, again primarily affectingBlacks and Hispanics. A few statistics illustrate this problem.FBI data indicate that Blacks make up an increasing percentage ofdrug arrests, having increased from 30 to 38 percent of the totalbetween 1984 and 1988. According to the National Institute onDrug Abuse, Blacks make up only 12 percent of those who useillegal drugs. In Florida, Blacks now make up 73.3 percent of all prisonadmissions for drug offenses, compared to 53.6 percent for allother offenses. If the war on drugs continues in its present fashion, our prisonswill become increasingly filled with Black youth. The plight ofyoung Black men and the Black community which we described in ourreport will only worsen. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS I do not believe that the large number of Black males withinthe criminal justice system necessarily represents an intendedconsequence of our crime control policies. Unfortunately,however, as an unintended consequence of scores ofindividual sentencing laws, use of discretion in the criminaljustice system, and funding priorities, we have created a truecrisis for the Black community, for the criminal justice system,and for a nation that hopes to provide freedom and opportunityfor all citizens. A continuation of the war on drugs in themanner in which it has been fought, no matter how well intended,will only exacerbate this situation. If we wish to address this problem in a serious manner,policymakers and criminal justice leaders need to respond in acomprehensive manner. Elements of such a strategy include: 1. Increase Diversion from the Criminal Justice System Many young and minor offenders are only stigmatized by theircontact with the criminal justice system, without necessarilyreceiving either appropriate supervision or support.Opportunities exist to divert many of these offenders toorganizations and individuals who can better focus on theproblems of Black, Hispanic, and poor youth. As a result of our report, for example, Black community leadersin Memphis have formed a chapter of the 100 Black MenIncorporated. The group's goal is to reduce the number of Blackmen going into the criminal justice system. Its activities willinclude establishing mentor programs, developing mechanisms forkeeping Black youth in school, and working with young offendersin the juvenile justice system. Policymakers can encourage development of programs such as these,and court officials can divert more defendants into them, therebybeginning to reduce the extent of criminal justice control inmany communities. 2. Sentencing to Ameliorate Racial Disparities Judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and probation officersall have a unique and important opportunity to lessen the drasticimpact which the justice system has had on Blacks and Hispanics.That opportunity comes at the time of sentencing. The courtroomsentencing process should include a full examination of thecircumstances of both victim and offender, and an analysis ofcommunity support and supervision mechanisms which may be able tocontribute to appropriate sentencing options. The goals of thisprocess should be several: to assess public safety concerns; torestore victims to the extent possible; to order appropriate andconstructive sanctions in the community; and, to reduce thechances that offenders will return to the system. As anorganization familiar with sentencing programs and sentencingreform efforts throughout the country, our staff knows that theseare attainable goals. Court officials should also establish mechanisms to monitorwhether minority offenders are appropriately represented innon-incarcerative sentencing alternatives, such as communitycorrections programs, house arrest, and electronic monitoring. Ifdisparities exist, an analysis of the reasons for this should beundertaken. In the juvenile justice area, The National Council ofJuvenile and Family Court Judges is currently developing policyrecommendations to respond to the disproportionate incarcerationof minority youth. These may serve as a model which could beadopted for the criminal justice system. 3. Restore Appropriate Judicial Discretion White collar offenders such as Ivan Boesky and Oliver Northreceive a full consideration of appropriate sentencing options.For many of the indigent defendants filling up our nation'sprisons, mandatory and guideline sentencing virtually prohibitany consideration of alternative sentencing options. Abuse ofjudicial discretion needs to be carefully monitored, but use ofjudicial discretion to respond to individual and community needsat sentencing should be encouraged. 4. Encourage Courts to Make Greater Use of Alternatives toIncarceration Incarceration is by far the most costly component of thecriminal justice system. It has also not proved to be veryproductive as a means of reducing crime. A variety of communitybased sanctions exist which have been demonstrated to beappropriate punishments for a wide range of offenders. Theseinclude restitution to victims, community service work, intensiveprobation supervision, and provisions for treatment programs,education, and employment. My organization, The Sentencing Project, has helped develop manyprograms that offer courts alternatives to prison in a range ofcases, and we have seen courts accept these alternatives in wellover half the cases presented. We know that judges can and willmake more use of alternatives, if given the opportunity to do soat sentencing. 5. Reduce Lengthy and Inefficient Prison Terms Mandatory sentencing laws and lengthier prison terms haveresulted in high costs, with only relatively modest gains incrime control. Prisoners are prevented from committing crimes inthe community while they are locked up, but this represents onlya small fraction of all crimes. A 1978 report by the NationalAcademy of Sciences concluded that to achieve a 10 percentreduction in crime, New York would have had to increase itsprison population by 263 percent and Massachusetts by 310percent. The massive increase in incarceration and lengthening of prisonterms provides almost no long term benefits in reduction ofrecidivism. The most recent Justice Department study of thisissue shows that recidivism rates, while very high, are virtuallyidentical for prisoners who serve anywhere from one to fiveyears. Therefore, "getting tough" results in highcorrections costs, but leaves us with offenders who are no lesslikely to commit future crimes. Reducing lengthy prison terms by itself is not the answer tocrime. What it would accomplish though, is to relieve the burdenon an overcrowded system, to reduce the impact of the system onminorities, and to free up tax dollars to be used for prevention,a more effective means of crime control. 6. Require Racial/Ethnic Impact Statements from the Office ofNational Drug Control Policy Given the serious impact of drugs and the drug war onminority communities, I would suggest that the Office of NationalDrug Control Policy be required to submit an annual report on theimpact of its policies and funding priorities on racial andethnic communities. Such a report might include the degree towhich funding is made available to minority communities andorganizations, the impact of prosecution and incarceration onthese communities, and the number of persons receiving drugtreatment services. This type of analysis would help to provide afocus for policy considerations regarding minority communities. 7. Develop More Accurate Reporting Methods for Hispanics As noted above, there is reason to believe that Hispanics areundercounted in the criminal justice system due toinconsistencies in reporting methods and lack of data. It isimportant to develop policies and procedures that are consistentnationwide in order to assess the impact of criminal justicepolicies on Hispanic communities, and to enable the criminaljustice system to respond more appropriately to its variedpopulations. 8. Restore a Balanced Perspective on the Relative Role ofCriminal Justice Sanctions and Social and Economic Supports The criminal justice system does not necessarily provide thebest forum for reducing crime. As the American Bar AssociationCriminal Justice Section's Special Committee on Criminal Justicein a Free Society reported, of approximately 34 million seriouscrimes committed against persons or property in 1988, 31 millionnever resulted in arrest and only several hundred thousandresulted in felony convictions and imprisonment. Simply put, lawenforcement and court officials could, under the best ofconditions, effectively prosecute and punish only a small portionof overall criminal activity. Our continued excessive emphasis on a law enforcement strategy tofight drugs fails to address the root causes of the drug problem.Our emphasis on punitive criminal justice remedies distracts usfrom more fundamental and potentially far-reaching questions: whyis it that citizens of one of the wealthiest nations and of allsocial classes use illegal substances to the extent thatAmericans do today? For inner city and low income communities, these root causes arecertainly more closely tied to poverty, lack of opportunity, pooreducation and health care, and lack of hope for the future, thanto any lack of jail and prison cells. At the same time we have been waging a law enforcement war, withits own negative effects upon young Black males, conditions forBlack communities have worsened on other fronts as well. A newstudy by the National Center for Children in Poverty of ColumbiaUniversity documents that half of Black children and 40 percentof Hispanic children under the age of six now live in poverty. Itshould be clear to those of us within the criminal justice systemas well as others, that unless we effectively address issues ofpoverty immediately, we are likely to see the next generation ofBlack males enter the criminal justice system at a rate evenhigher than one in four. We have a choice. We can spend money on prisons, and on policiesthat are guaranteed to fill them with people who don't need to bein them, including many young Black men, or we can spendmore time, energy, creativity and money to keep more people outof the system entirely. Funding for poverty-fighting,crime-preventing programs should be viewed from the long-termperspective, as a preventive measure which will reduce criminaljustice costs in the future. CONCLUSION Of the scores of editorials which appeared in response to ourreport (see Appendix) almost all uniformly endorsed the range ofpolicy recommendations I have suggested here. This reaction showsthat the public may be much more ready for change than manypolicymakers have led us to believe. The funding and policy decisions we make today regarding ourapproach to the drug problem will have a direct impact on thenext generation of Black men. As an editorial in the Charleston(S.C.) Post/Courier noted, "If the festering cycle ofpoverty, violence and hate is not broken, more black men will bedoomed to lives of crime and years behind bars."

AMERICANS BEHIND BARS: THE INTERNATIONAL USE OF INCARCERATION, 1992-93 OVERVIEW Interest in international comparisons on the use of incarcerationhas increased in recent years. From the Singapore caning ofMichael Fay to changes in the use of prisons in eastern Europe tothe use of prison labor in China, attention has focused on theways in which nations utilize different sentencing policies. In recent years, we have issued two prior reports comparinginternational rates of incarceration. These reports documentedthat the United States had become the world leader in its rate ofincarceration, having surpassed South Africa and the formerSoviet Union, and that the black male rate of incarceration inthe U.S. far exceeded that of black males in South Africa. We now look again at these issues, in what is the mostcomprehensive survey to date on international rates ofincarceration. The main findings of this report are thefollowing: � Russia has now surpassed the United States to become the worldleader in its rate of incarceration, with 558 citizens per100,000 population in its prison system. The rise of organizedcrime, political instability, and the transition to an uncertaineconomic future have all played a factor in crime rates and theuse of imprisonment. � With 1.3 million Americans behind bars, the U.S. rate ofincarceration is 519 per 100,000, second in the world among the52 nations covered in this survey. The U.S. rate has increased by22 percent since 1989, and is generally 5-8 times the rate ofmost industrialized nations. � A racial breakdown of the U.S. inmate population shows thatAfrican-Americans are incarcerated at a rate that is more thansix times that of whites -- 1,947 per 100,000, compared to 306per 100,000. � Black males in the U.S. are incarcerated at more than fourtimes the rate of black males in South Africa -- 3,822 per100,000 versus 851 per 100,000. � The cost of incarceration nationally in the U.S. is estimatedat $26.8 billion annually. Estimated costs of incarceration forAfrican-American males are $11.6 billion annually. � The number of AfricanAmerican males in prisons and jails inthe U.S. 583,000 is greater than the number of AfricanAmericanmales enrolled in higher education 537,000. � Drug, property and public order offenders accounted for 84percent of the 155 percent increase in new court commitments tostate prison from 1980 to 1992, while violent offenders accountedfor only 16 percent of the increase. As we have stated in past reports, a nation's rate ofincarceration in itself only describes one aspect of its criminaljustice or social policies. For example, a nation with a highrate of incarceration might have a high rate of crime, a harshsentencing system, a politically repressive government, or somecombination of these and other factors. Similarly, one cannotassume that nations with low incarceration rates necessarily havelow crime rates or are respectful of civil liberties. Forexample, the cost of largescale incarceration is prohibitive formany Third World nations, so they maintain a low imprisonmentrate. Other nations maintain a relatively low incarceration rate,yet have brutal conditions of confinement. In Zaire, for example,although the incarceration rate is a relatively modest 88 per100,000, it has been reported that nearly 7.5 percent of theinmates in the prison system die each year due to malnutritionand poor health care. With these cautions in mind, we look at the dramatically highrate of incarceration in the United States and attempt to assessthe factors that have created the anomaly of one of thewealthiest nations in the world sharing the unenviable positionof incarceration leader with its former Cold War rival Russia.Whatever the mix of crime rates, criminal justice policies, orsocial policies that have led to this situation, the rate ofincarceration in the United States is so much higher than incomparable nations that it requires a close examination of thevarious causal factors. Given the renewed "law andorder" climate in the country, we also examine theanticipated impact of newlyadopted legislation and conclude withrecommendations for what we believe would be a more rationalcriminal justice policy.

Forcomparative purposes, estimates of the use of incarceration bythe Soviet Union in 1989 ranged from 268 to 353 per 100,000. A variety of factors have led to the increased use ofincarceration in Russia. News accounts have discussed the rise oforganized crime, coming at a time of much economic and politicalinstability. As the country moves toward a market economy, thesocial disruption and loss of a limited social "safetynet" for some may contribute to higher crime rates. It hasbeen reported that during the first quarter of 1994, there was anaverage of 84 murders a day in Russia, a per capita rate that isabout double that of the U.S. The use of the prison system forpolitical prisoners, both in the past and at present, is an issuefor which there are few precise figures. The State Department hasalso reported that because the court system does not have theresources to handle the increasing number of arrests, defendantsare often held in pretrial detention for more than a year withoutjudicial review. While comparative data are not readily available, some reportsindicate that the high rate of incarceration in Russia may be ingood part a result of harsher sentencing practices than othernations, and not primarily differences in crime rates. Comparingprison populations and sentencing practices in Russia to Englandand Wales, Roy D. King concluded that "it would seem thatmany offenders are swept into the prison system for much moretrivial offences, for much longer periods, and at much earlierpoints in their criminal careers [in Russia] than would be thecase in Britain." The rate of incarceration in South Africa continues to remain farabove that of most other nations as well, at 368 per 100,000population. It should be noted that these figures are from theend of 1993, prior to the historic change of government in 1994.Therefore, it is too early to know what changes, if any, will beinstituted by the new government. One early indication of apossible direction was a reduction of almost all prison sentencesby six months following a nationwide series of prisondisturbances in June, 1994. In a number of European countries, though not all, incarcerationrates have been rising in recent years. In the Netherlands, longconsidered a leader in the limited use of incarceration, the rateof incarceration doubled during the 1980s. Even with thisincrease, however, the country's current rate of 49 per 100,000still places it at onetenth the U.S. rate and far below mostindustrialized nations. Comparing data for 1989 from our first report, we find thatItaly's rate of incarceration increased by 33 percent in theperiod 198992, while Austria, Spain, and Switzerland registeredgains in the 1416 percent range, and France and Denmark werevirtually unchanged. In the U.S., which was the world leader in 1989, incarcerationrates have increased by 22 percent from 426 per 100,000 in 1989to 519 per 100,000 for 199293. Thus, the rate of incarceration inthe U.S. is approximately five to eight times the rate of Canadaand most European nations. With a total of 1.3 million inmates inthe U.S., at an estimated annual cost of incarceration of $20,000a year, the national cost of imprisonment in the U.S. isapproximately $26.8 billion. Costs of incarceration for the583,000 incarcerated African-American males are estimated at$11.6 billion annually. As has been seen in previous reports, the rate of incarcerationfor African-American males is a major component of the high U.S.rates. Tables 2 and 3 below compare racial differences inincarceration in the U.S. and South Africa while still underapartheid.

It would appear logical in many respects to assume that ahigh rate of incarceration is a direct response to high crimerates. In recent years, though, many criminologists andpolicymakers have concluded that imprisonment rates are to agreat degree a function of criminal justice and social policiesthat either encourage or discourage the use of incarceration. Thecurrent wave of "Three Strikes and You're Out"proposals illustrates this well. States that have passed suchlegislation will soon experience an increase in their prisonpopulations of varying degrees depending on the scope of thelegislation. While one can debate whether or not these policiesare appropriate or will have an impact on crime, it is clear thatconscious policy choices are creating a higher rate ofimprisonment. We can see this as well by comparing incarceration rates amongthe states, where we find that a state's use of imprisonment isnot necessarily directly related to its crime rate. For example,while Louisiana had the nation's highest rate of incarceration in1992 and also had a high crime rate (fifth in the nation),Oklahoma was third in its imprisonment rate despite being just21st in its crime rate. At the other end of the spectrum, North Dakota was lowest in thenation in both crime and incarceration rates, but Mississippi was40th nationally in its rate of incarceration despite having the16th highest crime rate. Decisions made by legislators andcriminal justice officials, including sentencing legislation,parole policies, and the availability of sentencing options andcommunity resources, all play a role in determining incarcerationrates. In the following sections, we examine several factors that mightbe thought to contribute to the high rate of incarceration in theUnited States. These include: - overall crime rates - violent crime rates - severity of sentencing policies - cultural attitudes toward punishment Does the United States Have a High Rate of IncarcerationBecause of Higher Crime Rates Than Other Nations? As we have seen, high incarceration rates can be a functionof high crime rates, criminal justice policies, or socialpolicies in other areas that influence crime. Some personscontend that the United States has a high rate of incarcerationdue to its high rate of crime or violent crime rate, compared toother nations. Although there are a number of methodological problems involvedin comparing crime and incarceration rates among nations,criminologists have attempted to study this issue in a variety ofways. A recent survey of this issue looked at whetherincarceration rates in six industrialized nations (England andWales, West Germany, France, New Zealand, Netherlands, andSweden) could be explained by national crime rates. Theconclusion was that "only a small measure of the differencesin prison population between one jurisdiction and another or thechanges in prison populations within particular jurisdictionsseem to be related to crime rates." Further, the assumption that crime rates are substantially higherin the U.S. than in other industrialized nations is not true formost offenses. A comprehensive survey of victimization rates inthe industrialized world conducted by the Dutch Ministry ofJustice documented that rates of property crime and someassaultive crimes in the U.S. are not significantly differentthan in many comparable nations. The twenty nation survey foundthat four nations (New Zealand, Netherlands, Canada, andAustralia) exceeded the U.S. rate of victimization for the elevencrimes surveyed, including robbery, burglary, and car theft.Among individual offenses, the survey found that burglary ratesin the U.S. were exceeded by New Zealand, Czechoslovakia,Australia, and Canada; that England, Australia, and New Zealandhad higher rates of car theft; and that five nations(Czechoslovakia, Poland, Australia, Canada, and West Germany) hadhigher rates of sexual assault against women. The victimization survey also confirms that the commission of acrime is to a certain extent a result of opportunity. Forexample, car theft rates are highest in countries whereautomobile ownership is high (such as the U.S., Australia, andEngland), while bicycle thefts also correlate with high ownershiprates (as in the Netherlands and Sweden). Similarly, burglaryrates are highest in countries with a significant proportion ofsemidetached or detached homes (including the U.S., Poland,England, and Australia). These findings have implications forcrime prevention, such as making greater use of mass transit. The data on crime victimization overall, therefore, does notprovide an explanation for the high incarceration rate in theU.S. While it remains possible that crime rates account for partof the difference in rates of incarceration, the magnitude of thedifference between the U.S. and other nations is so great thatoverall crime rates cannot account for the disparity. Do Rates of Violent Crime Explain the High Rate ofIncarceration in the U.S.? Looking at rates of violent crime, we see sharperdistinctions between the U.S. and most industrialized nations, inlarge part due to the role of firearms in U.S. crime rates. Ratesof assault and murder with firearms are far higher in the U.S.than in comparable nations, with murder rates in the U.S.generally five to ten times the rate of most European nations.Since a violent offender is generally more likely to beincarcerated upon conviction than a nonviolent offender, a higherviolent crime rate would be expected to result in a higherimprisonment rate. We do not have sufficient data to analyze the relativeproportions of violent and nonviolent offenders in other prisonsystems, or to assess how they compare to the U.S. in thisregard. What is available, though, is information regarding theincrease in the American prison population in recent years.Examining these data demonstrates that the substantial rise inthe inmate population since 1980 was not primarily due toincarceration of violent offenders. As seen in Table 4 below, data from the Bureau of JusticeStatistics show that new court commitments to state prisonincreased by 155 percent from 1980 to 1992. A breakdown of thisincrease, though, shows that violent offenders accounted for only16 percent of this increase, with the remaining 84 percent beingdue to increased incarceration of drug and property offenders andpersons convicted of public order offenses. Thus, while it may betrue that part of the explanation for high incarceration rates inthe U.S. is due to higher rates of violent crime, this is clearlynot the primary factor behind the unprecedented increase in theprison population that we have seen in recent years.

Are Sentencing Policies in the U.S. Harsher Than in OtherNations? Another way to explore this issue is to examine relativesentences in different nations for convicted offenders. Those whocontend that the high rate of incarceration in the U.S. isprimarily a product of high crime rates suggest that a comparisonof sentencing policies is necessary in order to ascertain whetherthe U.S. is more punitive than other nations on a per crimebasis. The evidence on this issue is somewhat mixed, but does notnecessarily support the contention that high crime rates are thesole explanation for the high rate of incarceration in the U.S. A 1987 study conducted by the Justice Department examinedimprisonment decisions for the crimes of burglary, robbery, andtheft in the U.S. compared with Canada, England, and the formerWest Germany. The study found that the chances of receiving aprison term for an arrest on these offenses was roughlycomparable in the U.S., Canada, and England, but lower,particularly for theft, in West Germany. A key issue that was notaddressed in the study, though, was comparative length ofsentence. It is possible, for example, that while convictedoffenders in the U.S. are sentenced to prison atcomparable rates to these two other nations, sentence lengthsin the U.S. may be longer or shorter than in other countries. In fact, European comparisons by Young and Brown found thatsentence length was in fact a more critical variable than prisonadmissions in determining prison populations. In looking at theNetherlands and Sweden, both of which have low rates ofincarceration, they concluded that the rate of sentencing toprisons was comparable to other nations, but that shorter averagesentences accounted for the difference in incarceration rates. One of the few studies that have attempted to compare the U.S.with other nations, although with some methodologicallimitations, came to the conclusion that U.S. sentencingpractices were in fact more severe. In an examination ofsentencing practices in the U.S. and France, Richard Frase lookedat whether crime rates, and particularly violent crime, couldexplain the substantial difference in incarceration rates betweenthe two nations. His conclusion was that even controlling fordifferences in crime rates, American sentencing severity the useof prison as a sentence and the length of prison sentences wasalmost twice as high as in France. (By a somewhat moreconservative estimation technique, Frase still estimated thatAmerican sentencing severity was about 50 percent greater than inFrance.) One limitation of the U.S. studies is that they analyze data fromthe early 1980s. Sentencing patterns in the U.S. have changedsubstantially since that time, with there now being a greaterlikelihood of incarceration for many offenses. Bureau of JusticeStatistics data show that for every 1,000 arrests, the commitmentrate to state prison has increased by 6 percent for robbery, 29percent for aggravated assault, 49 percent for burglary, andfully 447 percent for drugs from 1980 to 1992. For drug offensesin particular, the length of imprisonment is also increasing inmany jurisdictions due to the impact of mandatory sentencinglaws. While we do not have data describing sentencing trends inother nations during this period, the changes in U.S. drug policyin particular suggest that the incarceration differential withother nations may continue to increase for some period of time. A Cross-National Look at Sentence Length If in fact sentence length is a key variable in understandingrelative rates of incarceration, then the question is whydifferent nations impose varying degrees of sentence length onoffenders. Recent research in this area, analyzed by Warren Youngand Mark Brown, provides some provocative conclusions. Afterreviewing explanations for harsher sentencing policies that lookat issues such as unemployment rates and public policy decisions,they conclude that these do not provide sufficient correlationsfor crossnational distinctions. They find instead that the mostsubstantial explanation lies in the cultural attitudes of asociety; that is, what most people would consider the"right" punishment. Attitudes toward punishment tend to be shared within a societyand affect decisionmaking regarding the harshness of sentencing.But why are some nations more punitive than others? Research byWilkins and Pease suggests that "a society's penal climateor its relative punitiveness is linked to its relativeegalitarianism: the greater a society's tolerance of inequality,the more extreme the scale of punishment utilized." Thus,sentencing severity is a type of negative reward for those at oneend of the spectrum, compared to the positive rewards of incomeand status. A society like the United States, therefore, premisedon a strong degree of individualism and with greater disparity ofwealth than most industrialized nations, will be more likely todisplay harsher cultural attitudes toward sentencing policy thana nation with a broader social welfare system. The implications of this analysis are quite profound, for itsuggests that changes in criminal justice policy alone will noteliminate the differential in international rates ofincarceration. This is not to deny the importance of changes incriminal justice policy, which can have a significant impact forsentencing of many offenders. The analysis tells us, though, thatif a society is committed to lowering its rate of incarceration,either on fiscal or moral grounds, an overall reevaluation ofcultural attitudes and values that determine sentencing policyneeds to be initiated. Summary: Toward an Understanding of Crime and Incarceration What can we conclude from this assessment of crime rates andincarceration? Several key themes emerge: 1. Crime rates for most property crimes and some assaultiveoffenses in the U.S. are not significantly greater than for otherindustrialized nations, and therefore are not a major explanationfor the high rate of incarceration in the U.S. 2. Higher rates of violent crime in the U.S. are responsible forat least part of the nation's high incarceration rate compared toother nations. The dramatic increase in the prison populationsince 1980, though, was not primarily a result of sentencinggreater numbers of violent offenders, since violent offendersrepresented only 16 percent of the increase in court commitmentsfrom 1980 to 1992. 3. The impact of the "war on drugs" has beenresponsible for much of the increase in the prison population,with 46 percent of new court commitments since 1980 being due todrug offenses. 4. Crossnational comparisons of rates of incarceration suggestthat the length of prison sentences, rather than the number ofpersons sentenced to prison is the main determinant of differingrates of incarceration. Thus, alternatives to incarceration mayhave some impact on lowering a jurisdiction's incarceration rate,but this will generally be of less magnitude than alteringsentence lengths. 5. Once prisons are built, they are in many respects aselfperpetuating entity. Prisons are constructed to last for50100 years and their continued use over time contributes to aculture that makes their use seem logical and rational. While fewpersons would argue with the necessity for a certain level ofimprisonment in society, it is far from clear that incarcerationis the only, or best, means of either preventing or controllingcrime. A broad range of policies both within and outside thecriminal justice system exist to accomplish these objectives, anddifferent nations make use of these resources to varying degrees.Unless incarceration is examined in this context, policymakerswill be confronted with a set of crime control options that ismuch more restrictive than necessary. WHAT HAS BEEN THE IMPACT OF INCREASED INCARCERATION ON CRIME? While there are a variety of reasons why judges sentenceoffenders to prison, the underlying goal is to reduce crime,whether accomplished through incapacitation, deterrence, orrehabilitation in prison. Given the enormous increase in the useof imprisonment in the past two decades, along with heightenedpublic concern about crime, it is critical to examine the effectthese policies have had on public safety. There is a small body of opinion, generally represented by theNational Rifle Association and its allies, that contends that theprison buildup of the 1980s had a dramatic effect on crime ratesand that "Incarceration works." This assertion turnsout to be based on serious distortions of criminal justice data.The NRA claims, for example, that the 150 percent increase inincarceration from 1980 to 1991 led to a 24 percent drop in"serious victimization." Upon closer examination,however, the NRA definition of "serious victimization"includes violent crimes, but also the nonviolent crime ofburglary, one of the FBI's seven Index offenses. While burglaryrates did decline during the 1980s their inclusion with violentcrimes distorts actual trends. Had the NRA included the Indexoffense of auto theft rather than burglary in its calculations,the results would have been very different, since auto theftvictimization increased by 33 percent during this period. Lookingonly at violent crime, we find that the more than doubling of theprison population paralleled a 4 percent decline in violent crimeduring this period. The "relationship" claimed by the NRA also turns out tobe one that is not consistent over time. By breaking down crimeand incarceration into two periods, 198086 and 198691, as seenbelow in Tables 5 and 6, we find that incarceration rates rose by65 percent and violent crime declined by 16 percent in the firstperiod, but that from 1986 to 1991, despite the fact thatimprisonment rose 51 percent, violent crime also increased, by 15percent. Clearly, no cause and effect relationship can bediscerned here.

What about crime rates overall, though, in addition to violentcrime? Here, too, we see no consistent impact. Some crimes, suchas burglary and larceny, have declined steadily since 1980.Others, such as auto theft, have increased significantly. Onemeasure of crime's impact on society is the financial harmsuffered by victims. In this regard, the increase in auto thefthas been far more costly, since the median loss to victims($3,600) is substantially greater than for victims of burglary orlarceny ($50 and $55 respectively). Again, any overall positivegains in crime control are difficult to discern. More sophisticated studies, such as those of Patrick A. Langan,have attempted to look at this issue as well, and have suggestedthat increased incarceration may have had some impact on crimerates. Yet in a comparative study of the use of incarceration inEngland and the United States he concludes that "Existingevidence does not suggest that crime can be dramatically reducedsimply by putting more offenders behind bars," and that"modest reductions in crime may be possible, but major andlasting reductions probably will require social interventiontechniques, such as parent training or preschool intellectualenrichment programs." Two other issues bear on this relationship as well. First, as wehave noted in previous reports, demographic issues play asignificant role in crime rates, since young males producedisproportionately high rates of crime. As criminologists DarrellSteffensmeier and Miles Harer have noted, most of the change incrime rates in the period 198088 can be explained by changes inthe proportion of the population in the age group 1524. Second, the impact of drug crimes and arrests adds anotherdimension to this analysis, since drug offenses are not coveredas part of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, or what isgenerally described as the "crime rate." Since thereare no data on the number of drug crimes that are committed, wecan only look to statistics on drug arrests for general trends,where we find that drug arrests doubled during the 1980s. Someexperts have speculated that the decline in some offenses such asburglary during this period may represent a shift in crimepatterns from burglary to lowlevel drug dealing, and notnecessarily an overall reduction in criminal activity. Finally, some advocates of increased incarceration contend thathad the large buildup of the prison population not taken place,crime rates would have been even higher than they already are.This type of speculation can be neither proved nor disproved, butif one believes that crime would have increased, then there musthave been some specific factors causing this. They may haveincluded poverty, drug abuse, poor education, and familybreakdown, among others. Addressing these problems should havemore of an impact on crime than continuing to expand the prisonpopulation. WHY HASN'T INCARCERATION HAD MORE IMPACT ON CRIME? Common sense would tell us that locking up offenders shouldhave an impact on crime. Certainly, some offenders areincapacitated or deterred through incarceration. What seemssurprising at first, though, is the relatively limited nature ofthis impact, particularly given the massive use of incarcerationin the United States. An examination of three key issues indemographics and criminal justice processing, though, reveals whythe prison system has such a modest impact on crime: 1. The "Criminal Justice Funnel" First, the criminal justice system operates as a"funnel." At the top of the funnel are all the crimesthat are committed, and at the bottom, the number of offenderssentenced to prison. The slope of the funnel is quite steep sincefor many offenses, the crime is never reported to the police, anarrest is not made, a conviction is not obtained, or an offenderis not sentenced to prison. Generally, fewer than 3 percent ofall serious crimes result in a prison sentence. One unknown variable is the fact that some convicted offendershave committed additional crimes which have gone undetected.Incarcerating these offenders therefore responds to more thanjust the single crime of conviction. Yet even if we multiply the3 percent figure by a factor of five or ten, it is clear that thesystem is still only able to use incarceration for a relativehandful of serious offenses. 2. The Impact of Demographics The prison system is also limited by the impact ofdemographics; in particular the fact that a disproportionatenumber of crimes is committed by 1518 yearold males. For thecrimes of burglary, robbery, and assault, for example, the peakage of crime commission is 18. Within six years, these rates arehalf their peak. This "aging out" of crime phenomenonhas two implications for policy: 1) for each succeeding year thatoffenders are locked up in prison, fewer crimes are beingprevented than the year before; and, 2) unless the factorsleading to high crime rates in the 1518 year age range areaddressed, incarceration will remain an "after thefact" response that fails to address the new annual cohortof potential offenders. 3. The "Replacement" Effect Finally, the "replacement" effect of crimecommission limits the utility of incarceration as a means ofcrime control. As we have seen most clearly for drug offenses,the massive increase in the use of imprisonment for drugoffenders in the 1980s had little discernible impact on drugabuse or drug crimes. As long as a market exists for drugs, newpotential sellers will emerge to take the place of those who arelocked up. WHY ARE AFRICANAMERICAN MALES INCARCERATED AT SUCH HIGH RATES? We and others have documented the dramatically high rate ofincarceration and criminal justice supervision of AfricanAmericanmales. As can be seen in the table below, the number ofincarcerated black males exceeds the number of black malesenrolled in higher education. This is clearly a sign of alongterm crisis in the making for both the black community andthe nation. TABLE 7 AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE TRENDS IN INCARCERATION AND HIGHER EDUCATION Year              # Incarcerated      Enrolled in Higher Education   1990                 499,000                     484,000             1992                 583,000*                    537,000             * Figure represents jail inmates for 1992 and prisoninmates for 1993. In recent years, the plight of AfricanAmerican males has been thesubject of much discussion. A 1990 report of The SentencingProject documenting that one in four young black men was undersome form of criminal justice control received widespreadnational attention. A variety of activities have been undertakento both study these issues and to address them programmatically.These have included Congressional hearings, the formation of taskforces, communitybased programs, and others. Despite this levelof activity, though, the number of incarcerated AfricanAmericanmales has increased from 499,000 in 1990 to 583,000 by 1992-93. An analysis of the causes of this distressing situation iscomplex. An examination of recent trends, though, points to bothsocial policy factors and criminal justice policies that relatedirectly to this problem. One of the key issues facing the nation today is the problem ofyouth violence, an area in which AfricanAmerican males areoverrepresented both as victims and perpetrators. Research inthis area by criminologist Delbert Elliott indicates a number ofdirections in which social policy plays a significant role inproducing differential outcomes by race. Elliott's review of comparative rates of youth violence findsthat rates of violence are high overall and that they cut acrossracial and class lines. Youth selfreport studies show that for1617 year old males, 2025 percent of the population report havingengaged in "serious violent offending," defined asaggravated assault, forcible rape, robbery, and homicide. Racialdifferences are relatively modest by age 18, the rate of reportedviolent offending among blacks is only 18 percent higher than forwhites. After the teen years, two trends emerge. First, the vast majorityof violent youth cease their involvement within a few years ofits onset. Of those youth who were engaged in violent behavior asteens, nearly 80 percent report discontinuing such behavior bytheir twenties. For black youth, though, nearly twice as many persist in theirviolent offending after age 21. The one significant exception tothis pattern, though, is among those males who are employed.Within this group, there are no discernible differences by race. Elliott concludes that the key to reducing adolescent violentbehavior lies in enabling these individuals to make a successfultransition to the adult roles of work, marriage, and parenting.He finds that: ...race and class differences in serious violent offending aresmall during adolescence, but become substantial during the earlyadult years. This difference does not appear to be the result ofdifferences in predispositions to violence, but in the continuityof violence once initiated. Race, in particular, is related tofinding and holding a job, and to marriage and stable cohabitingrates. In essence, race and poverty are related to successfullymaking the transition out of adolescence and into adult roles. While incarceration may be necessary to respond to certainviolent behaviors, its role in enabling young offenders to makethe transition to work and family is virtually nonexistent. Formiddle class youth who have access to resources, this transitionis far more likely to take place successfully with or without anyintervention by the criminal justice system. Compounding these problems in the larger community and economyare criminal justice policies of recent years which have furthermarginalized AfricanAmerican young males. As we have notedpreviously, the "war on drugs" in particular has playeda substantial role in exacerbating the continuously increasingrates of incarceration. The other major outcome of this"war" has been to increase the already substantialdisparity in incarceration suffered by AfricanAmericans. THE NEW "LAW AND ORDER" CLIMATE A visitor from another planet might be forgiven for beingutterly confused about the direction of American criminal justicepolicy. The observer would first note that two decades ofsteadily increasing rates of incarceration had not resulted inany Americans feeling safer from crime. He or she mightunderstandably then believe that a reconsideration ofincarceration policies would be in order. Looking at activities in Congress and state legislatures, though,it is clear that little of this is taking place. Congress and atleast a dozen states have passed "Three Strikes and You'reOut" laws mandating life without parole for certainthreetime offenders. Despite rising costs of corrections, prisonconstruction continues almost unabated in most parts of thecountry. And, public opinion polls show substantially heightenedconcern about crime along with support for various restrictivesentencing policies. How does one explain this seeming inconsistency between realityand public policy? Many criminal justice observers have noted thefact that fear of crime appears to be increasing even as crimerates remain about the same as ten years ago. Several factorsexplain this: 1. Crime rates compared to what? While it is true thatcrime rates are about the same as ten years ago, they aresignificantly higher than thirty years ago. Therefore, mostadults can remember a time in their early life when they felt,and were, significantly safer than they are today. So, whethercrime is up a little or down a little from year to year, there isan understandably greater concern about its impact on daily life. A second issue in this area regards the distinction between crimerates the proportion of crime for a given population andthe actual number of crimes. When one reads news accountsof cities experiencing record numbers of murders, forexample, it is often the case that the rate of murder islower than in previous years. While the murder rate in the U.S.is clearly intolerably high, distortions such as this onlycontribute to misperceptions and a heightened climate of fear. 2. Media access and sensationalism. Public policy in thearea of crime control has for a long time been overly influencedby a relative handful of sensational events. The Willie Hortonissue of the 1988 Presidential campaign was one of the mostprominent examples, along with more recent events such as the1993 tragic murder of 12year old Polly Klaas in California andthe killings on the Long Island RailRoad commuter train. Atypicalas these events may be, they create a distorted perception of theactual risks of violent crime. Another factor in this area is the broader variety of mediaoutlets that now exist and the more sensational forms ofreporting engaged in by many of them. The police highway trackingof O.J. Simpson and his subsequent court appearances illustrateways in which violent crime comes into the American home in amuch more direct way than in the past. 3. Political grandstanding. One of the more significantpolitical developments on crime policy in recent years is thatunder the Clinton administration, the Democrats have tried to"take the crime issue away" from Republicans. Publicopinion polls show this strategy to have been largely successful,with more respondents indicating confidence in the Democrats tocontrol crime. In large part, though, this has been little more than promotingthe "get tough" approach that the Republican party hasbeen perceived to offer for many years. The President's supportfor "Three Strikes and You're Out" in his State of theUnion message, Congressional support for more prisonconstruction, and the failure to make any significant inroads onthe issue of mandatory sentencing indicate a willingness topursue many of the major policy thrusts of the Reagan/Bush era. The primary distinction made by the Democratic leadership incontrast with the past has been the call for a "mix ofpunishment and prevention" approach to crime. Few personswould argue with the need for such a mix in general terms. Theflaw in this approach, though, is that it presupposes that an"equal" mix of punishment and prevention is what iscalled for today. As the history of the past twenty years hasdemonstrated, there has been absolutely no reluctance to engagein punishment, even to the point of becoming a world leader inthe use of incarceration. At the same time, due to budgetaryconstraints and a changing political climate, resources devotedto prevention in a broad sense have declined in many respects. Therefore, if a mix of punishment and prevention is what isactually needed, policymakers should begin to assess how toachieve that mix. Clearly, an emphasis on "frontend"preventive approaches and a decreased emphasis on"backend" reactive approaches should be pursued if thenation is to reach a balance between punishment and prevention. 4. Intersection of race and crime. One of the definingissues of American criminal justice policy for many years hasbeen the equation of crime with AfricanAmerican males. Thedynamics of this phenomenon are complex, but they center aroundthe vicious cycle that has been created in the nationalconsciousness. For violent offenses in particular, AfricanAmerican male rates ofoffending are considerably higher than for other groups. Thisfact is then portrayed in frequent media depictions of youngblack men as criminals, which lends support to policies designedto incarcerate ever larger numbers of them. Rarely in thisprocess is any attempt made to understand how a 15year old youthhas become a school dropout who is selling drugs and carrying agun, or what types of family and community responses might haveprevented these developments. Few middle class families wouldwillfully hand over their teenage children to the criminaljustice system for punishment or rehabilitation, yetAfricanAmerican males are processed into the system in historicnumbers with little questioning by the larger community. Lost in the process as well is the fact that for some offenses,AfricanAmericans are disproportionately represented in thecriminal justice system even though their rates of crimecommission are not responsible for the disparities. Thesentencing disparities between powder cocaine and crack cocainehave been well documented, showing that punishments for these twoforms of the same drug are correlated with the race of the userin large part. Finally, by looking only at prison populations for sources ofdisparity, we miss key aspects of the potential sources ofdisparity. For example, within the category of violent offenses,AfricanAmericans arrest rates are approximately the same as theproportion of AfricanAmericans in prison. If one were to look atwhite collar or corporate crimes, though, two issues wouldemerge. First, we would find that AfricanAmericans areunderrepresented as offenders, and second, that the system hashistorically put fewer resources into prosecuting these types ofcrimes. Thus, decisions regarding criminal justice prioritiesplay a role in determining the composition of prison populationsregardless of particular crime rates. The Impact of the New "Law and Order" Movement It is still too early to project the full impact of thevarious sentencing policies that have been adopted or are underconsideration at the national and state level. Much of the impactwill depend on how broadly the various proposals are crafted, andhow they are implemented in practice. It is already clear,though, that the new "get tough" movement has beensuccessful in producing a variety of harsh sentencing proposals,most notably, the "Three Strikes and You're Out"proposals. The impact of these proposals will be felt in both fiscal termsand potential disruptions to components of the criminal justicesystem. Much of this can be seen most clearly in the Californialegislation, which is by far the broadest to date. In addition toproviding life without parole for "threetime losers,"the California statutes also increase sentences for a broad rangeof offenses. The Department of Corrections has estimated that thelegislation will lead to an increase of 275,000 in the prisonpopulation over the next thirty years, with an additionaloperating cost of $5.7 billion annually. Further, the legislationwill necessitate an additional $21 billion in prison constructioncosts. The impact of "3 Strikes" laws has already beenobserved at trials and sentencing in a number of states: � One of the first offenders sentenced under the Washingtonstate law was 35year old Larry Fisher, whose third strikeinvolved robbing a sandwich shop of $151 by pretending that thefinger in his pocket was a gun. His previous two strikes involvedpushing his grandfather down and taking $390 from him, and a $100pizza parlor robbery that also did not involve a weapon. � In the case of the first defendant to be tried in SanFrancisco under the state's new law, the 71year old victim whosecar had been burglarized refused to testify in court because sheviewed the penalty as far too severe. � In the first case to be tried in Los Angeles, jurorsdeadlocked on a routine burglary charge, reportedly because threejurors believed life in prison was an overly harsh penalty for anonviolent crime. The new generation of harsh sentencing policies will also haveseveral lasting impacts: 1) prison construction required as aresult of their implementation will represent a commitment to useof these institutions for at least fifty years; 2) funds divertedto increased costs of corrections will not be available toaddress a variety of crime prevention measures; 3) the alreadytragic levels of incarceration for African-Americans males willbe increased; and, 4) political debate on crime will be furtherstifled and more focused on a narrow range of sentencingpolicies. The ultimate measure of these proposals, of course, is theirimpact on crime. In this area, too, there is no reason to believethat these proposals will be effective. The demographics of crimecommission show us that incarcerating a 50- or 60year oldoffender is an extremely expensive means for preventing very fewcrimes. Rather than providing more resources to prevention and amore effective juvenile justice system, funding will be divertedto the creation of geriatric prisons that will hurt taxpayersfinancially but not provide them with any increased publicsafety. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A MORE RATIONAL CRIME POLICY The analysis of crime and incarceration described in thisreport tells us that the high rate of incarceration in the UnitedStates is not solely a product of higher rates of crime thanother nations, nor has it achieved a substantial impact onreducing crime. Despite a quadrupling of the inmate populationsince 1973, Americans do not feel safer from crime and are stillvictimized by high rates of crime and violence. We have no illusions that the current tough climate on crimecontrol policies will recede in the near future. Too manysenseless crimes combined with too much media sensationalism andpolitical grandstanding have created an emotional and politicizedatmosphere that makes rational discussion of crime controlpolicies exceedingly difficult. Nevertheless, there remain many professionals and others who careabout the crime problem and are genuinely searching forconstructive responses. In addition, numerous public opinionsurveys have documented that the public is far more responsive toa broad range of solutions to crime than is commonly assumed. Theproblem is that the range of choices generally presented inpublic policy discussions is exceedingly narrow. In previous reports, we have suggested policy changes that couldhave an impact on rates of incarceration while providing moreappropriate sanctions and services to offenders. These include: �Repealing mandatory sentencing laws in order to restoreappropriate judicial discretion; �Treating the drug problem primarily as a public health problemrather than as a criminal justice problem; �Supporting the expansion of a broader range of alternatives toincarceration to provide judges and communities with viablecommunity based sentencing options; �Establishing a national commission to examine the high rate ofincarceration in the U.S., and of African American males inparticular. These and other policy changes would begin to control thespiralling rate of incarceration and associated costs.Implementing these policies, though, is a political problem, onein which there has been relatively little constructiveleadership. It is far from certain that the political climate oncrime can be altered significantly in the short run. If it is tochange in the long run, though, a framework such as the followingneeds to be presented: 1. No "anticrime" proposals enacted today whetherprison construction or prevention programs will have much impacton crime in the next several years. It is far more important tolook toward the generation of youth being born today and todevelop policies that will reduce their chances of becomingoffenders as they reach their teen years. 2. The criminal justice system, as a reactive system, can onlyhave a limited impact on crime. While a system of justice andsanctions is necessary, we should not look to the courts andprisons as the primary means of controlling or preventing crime. 3. Crime is a product of many factors, including individual,family, and community issues. Only an understanding of thecomplexity of these factors will enable us to develop acomprehensive strategy for responding to the problem. For too long, public debate on crime has been polarized andstifling. As a result, we are faced with the problems ofcontinuing high rates of crime, increasing rates ofincarceration, and continuing public dissatisfaction. Aftertwenty years of "getting tough," it is hard to imaginehow new "tough" proposals will succeed any better thantheir predecessors. It is time to publicly acknowledge thiscrisis and to initiate a more honest and open debate about thepressing problem of crime. METHODOLOGY FOR PRISONER DATA United States Data are for the years 199293 (the mostrecent available), and were derived from Bureau of JusticeStatistics (BJS) reports detailing the number of prison inmateson December 31, 1993 and the number of jail inmates on June 30,1992. From the total inmate figure, we excluded 2,804 juvenilesbeing held in local jails as well as 50,966 inmates under federalor state jurisdiction who were being held in local jails, so asto avoid duplication with the jail count. To calculate the racial composition of the state and federalinmate population, we used the figures of 47.9 percent black and46.8 percent white from Correctional Populations in the UnitedStates, 1991 (BJS). The racial composition of jail inmateswas derived in two steps. We first used the figures of 44.1percent black and 40.1 percent white nonHispanic from the 1992jail report. We then estimated the portion of the Hispanicpopulation (14.5 percent of jail inmates) by race, using CensusBureau estimates that the Hispanic population nationally is 95percent white, 2 percent black, and 2 percent other. Male inmatepopulations were calculated by race by using the 1991 proportionsfor state and federal inmates and the 1992 overall data forjails. All racial data represent a small undercount, since dataon race are not available for approximately 4 percent of stateand federal inmates. Overall population data were taken fromCensus Bureau estimates for 1993. A small margin of error is inevitable in these calculations. Itis possible, for example, that the racial composition of theHispanic inmate population is different than for the populationas a whole. There is no reason to believe, though, that theoverall inmate population estimates are off by a substantialmargin. Other Nations Sources for prisoner data include HumanRights Watch, Penal Reform International, Australian Institute ofCriminology, Corrections Compendium, and Professor NilsChristie. Data for Asian counties are all for 1993; for Europeand other continents, data are for either 1992 or 1993. Data for Russia are taken from three sources. The most current isfrom a report of a lecture given by the General Director of theRussian Prison System, as described by Nils Christie of theUniversity of Oslo in the 1994 edition of Crime Control asIndustry, documenting a total of 848,000 inmates. An April1993 article by Gary Hill appearing in Corrections Compendiumcites almost identical figures (845,000), and the StateDepartment's County Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993lists the prison population as 827,000. We have used Christie'sfigure as the most current, and from it have deducted the 19,000juveniles reported by Hill, so as to be comparable to the U.S.calculations. The South African figures are taken from the 1993 report of theSouth African Prisons Service. The South African categories of"black" and "colored" are combined to producethe black male rate of incarceration. In previous reports, wehave attempted to estimate the incarceration rate for the four"independent" homelands that were not recognized by anynation outside South Africa. This estimate was then incorporatedinto the overall figures for South Africa to derive a rate ofincarceration. Since there are no current reliable figures forthese homelands for 1993, we have not included them in either theprison data or the overall population data for South Africa.Therefore, the incarceration rates reported here are not entirelycomparable to those of past reports. Since the homelands are nowofficially part of South Africa, we hope that in future reportsdata will be available for the entire population. Although previous reports included data for China, there are nocurrent data that are considered reliable by most observers.

Sentencing advocates need to be aware oftreatment options in the community in order to argue persuasivelythat such clients can be effectively treated outside of prison.This article will describe both traditional and non-traditionaldrug treatment and how sentencing advocates can develop planswhich include community-based treatment. Community-based treatment may use the following methods:therapeutic interventions, support groups,detoxification/emergency treatment, pharmacologic assistance,acupuncture or homeopathic therapy. The settings for treatmentare outpatient, day treatment, in-patient, residential, ortherapeutic community. Methods of Treatment Therapeutic intervention includes individual or groupcounseling and psychotherapy, and treatment is usually providedby trained therapists. Most therapeutic intervention programsrely on cognitive-based therapy which addresses irrationalthinking and attempts to restructure thought processes. Support groups are usually conducted by a member of the groupwith the assistance of prepared materials by a nationalorganization. The most well known support groups are AlcoholicsAnonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. Most support groups aremodeled on the Twelve Steps of AA and rely on faith in a"higher power" to assist in achieving goals. Detoxification treatment is a program of planned withdrawal whichmay or may not include medication to assist in withdrawal. Lengthof detoxification depends on the substance ingested and themethods used for detoxification. Detoxification without othertreatment has not been found to be effective in maintainingsobriety. Acupuncture is gaining in popularity as a treatment foraddictions. In addition to its use in community-based treatmentprograms, more than 500 inmates are taking acupuncture treatmentsaround the country each day. For substance abusers, the processinvolves inserting three to five needles into precise points ofthe outer ear just beneath the skin for � The Sentencing Project, Inc., Washington, D.C.

The needlessignal neurotransmitters that release natural pain relievingendorphines which reduce cravings for drugs or alcohol and helpcalm the patient. Some programs use acupuncture in combinationwith other traditional forms of addiction treatment. Examples of pharmacological medications which are used to treataddictions are disulfiram, methadone, and ibogaine. Disulfiram,which is more commonly known by its trade name, Antabuse, istaken daily by mouth to deter the consumption of alcohol bycausing severe but temporary discomfort when combined withalcohol. Symptoms include weakness, vertigo, decrease in bloodpressure, throbbing head and neck, flushing of the face, chestpain, labored breathing, nausea and vomiting. For most people,the threat of such a noxious reaction is enough to deter alcoholconsumption. Disulfiram therapy is usually used in combinationwith a comprehensive treatment program. Calcium carbimide,marketed under the trade name Temposil, is also used as analcohol deterrent. Methadone is a narcotic analgesic similar in potency to morphine.Under a special license, some treatment facilities provide drugdependent persons with methadone as a substitute for heroin,morphine, or exycodone (Percodan). Initially, daily dosages ofmethadone are gradually increased until a stabilization doselevel is achieved. Users are maintained on the stabilized dosefor an extended period of time. The eventual goal of manymethadone programs is to decrease the daily dosage of methadoneto help the dependent person achieve a drug-free state withoutsuffering the distress of abrupt withdrawal. For most users,methadone suppresses withdrawal symptoms and the chronic"drug hunger" for other narcotics without renewingeuphoria. Nausea and vomiting are common side effects and must beendured until tolerance is developed. Constipation and physicaldependence on the drug are chronic, long term side effects. Ibogaine is a naturally-occurring hallucinogenic alkaloid whichcomes from the roots of a West African plant. Ibogaine hasreceived some media attention recently for its use in controllingaddiction to cocaine. Critics of its therapeutic use point outthat ibogaine is a hallucinogenic which produces early effects ofnausea, vomiting, sweating, weakness, dizziness, tremors, andnumbness. Users then become physically relaxed and tend to loseinterest completely in their surroundings. They experience longdreamlike sequences of vivid images and fantasies, dominated byspecific intense colors. The duration of the hallucinogenicactivity is approximately six hours. Proponents of ibogaine's therapeutic use point to the user'sdecrease in intense craving for cocaine. Some users of ibogaineassert that their dependency on crack is based on their inabilityto control their craving. By substituting ibogaine for crack,they are able to control their crack use and are able tore-establish productive lives. Another medication used to reducecocaine craving is Bromocriptine (Parlodel), a drug used to treatParkinson's disease. Bromocriptine mimics the action of dopamineby stimulating dopamine receptors. This may lead to reducedcraving for cocaine. Anti-depressants have also been used withsome limited success to treat the craving for cocaine.Pharmacologic approaches are almost always used in conjunctionwith other forms of drug treatment. Homeopathic treatment for drug and alcohol abuse is providedunder the care of a homeopath physician or practitioner.Homeopathy and naturopathy medicine rely on natural treatmentremedies such as herbs, along with diet and massage, to achievechemical balance in the body. Most homeopath physicians havedoctor of medicine degrees. Naturopathic physicians are notmedical doctors, but have a doctorate in naturopathy. A listingof homeopath physicians is found in the yellow pages under"Homeopaths." Not all homeopath physicians treatalcohol and drug dependence. Treatment Plans The best treatment for one client may differ from thetreatment intervention for another. The type of drug, theclient's background, length of abuse, motivation for treatment,environment and social support play a part in determining themost appropriate treatment intervention. When treatment is part of your sentencing proposal, advocatesshould make the treatment referral as early as possible.Sometimes, early intervention can be used as an indicator of the client's motivation for change. In addition, if the treatmentstaff have some history with the client, they may providetestimony on the progress of the client's treatment at thesentencing hearing. Early referrals also help address the problemof lengthy waiting lists. Some treatment agencies will not interview clients in the jail.Defense attorneys sometimes file a motion with the court askingthat the client be released to go to an agency for an assessmentinterview. Another option used by sentencing advocates is to finda person who will go to the jail to provide assessment. At thesentencing hearing, the attorney provides this information whichshows that if the client was assessed, he or she would likely beaccepted into the treatment program. If sentencing advocates use treatment agency personnel who arenot familiar with the interview practices in the jail, theyshould provide the interviewer with information such as whatidentification to bring, whether the interview can be arrangedwith direct contact with the inmate, and a copy of the jailrules, including time restrictions on jail visits. It is goodpractice to provide the jail with written notification of theinterview. Some jails require a background check of theinterviewer to be completed prior to a professional contactvisit. In some cases, sentencing advocates provide probation and paroleagents with information about their referrals to treatmentagencies. Frequently, agents do not have the time or interest inreferring clients to programs; however, they are often notopposed to others making referrals. Sentencing advocates'treatment plans are more likely to be accepted if they have jointagreement between the defense and probation agents. In some cases, probation officers are opposed to acommunity-based treatment plan, and they will not facilitate thereferral. In these cases, sentencing advocates should make thereferral themselves if the agency will accept the client, or askthe defense attorney to bring a motion before the judge to orderthe probation officer to make a referral. Funding Sources Funding for alcohol and drug treatment comes from a varietyof sources, including government, donations, insurance, privatepay, and gambling revenues. Some state and federal funding fortreatment is funneled through state agencies and then dispersedto the local level. Other sources of governmental funding for treatment are Title 19(Medicaid), veteran benefits, Treatment Alternatives to StreetCrime (TASC) grants, and legislatively-mandated specificappropriations. Sentencing advocates should find out if theirclients have Title 19 or veteran benefits. If they have orqualify for veteran benefits, they may refer their clients to thecounty veteran service office which will provide information onlocal services. If clients have Title 19, sentencing advocatesmay refer clients to private service providers, or any agencywhich accepted Title 19 funding. Frequently, your Department of Corrections (or ProbationDepartment) also has funds to purchase treatment services. Whenusing this source of funds, the agent preparing the presentencereport or the parole agent is usually required to make a formalreferral. Sentencing advocates may encourage agents to makereferrals for treatment by making the initial contact themselvesto treatment agencies, and providing information to the agentabout the feasibility of acceptance. Occasionally, staff oftreatment agencies will contact the agent, and encourage theagent to make the referral. Donations are used to augment funding for non-profit agenciessuch as United Way. Often, services in United Way agencies areprovided on a sliding-scale fee basis. Donations, usually fromthe participants, are used to fund support groups. Funds for treatment are often provided by an insurance carrier.In addition to insurance provided through employment or school,Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) insurance may be purchasedby counties for persons on general assistance. As part of thecontract, some HMO's provide treatment for persons receivinggeneral assistance. Gambling revenues are providing new sources of income for Indianatribes. Most tribes provide treatment for their members. Effectiveness of Treatment Studies conducted in the last fifteen years show that drugtreatment is effective in reducing drug abuse, increasingemployment, improving psychological adjustment, and decreasingcrime. The most persuasive evidence of the effectiveness oftreatment is found in the results of the Treatment OutcomeProspective Study (TOPS). See Robert L. Hubbard, et.al., DrugAbuse Treatment: A National Study of Effectiveness (ChapelHill, NC: U of North Carolina Press, 1989). TOPS studied 10,000 individuals admitted to 37 programs in 10cities. They found that "drug abuse treatment has beennotably effective in reducing drug abuse up to five years after asingle treatment episode." The study also reported, "Byserving as an alternative to incarceration, treatment can beparticularly beneficial for drug abusers identified in jails orprisons, and it can play a central role in combating the spreadof acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) by reducing theintravenous use of heroin and other drugs." The TOPS studyalso found that legal pressure tended to keep people in treatmentfor longer periods and that this coercion did not interfere withtreatment goals. The potential for reducing criminal behavior is one of the mostcompelling reasons in favor of drug treatment. The TOPS studyfound that "three to five years after leaving treatment, theproportion of clients who were involved in predatory crimes wasone-third to one-half of the pretreatment proportion."

The report isdesigned to present a comprehensive plan for responding to thenation's drug problem. Although final details of the plan werenot to be made public until then, a 235page draft submitted tothe President for review was "leaked" and circulatingin Washington in August 1989. The final report is expected to besimilar to the draft proposal. Following is a summary and analysis of the proposed drugstrategy. Highlights of the Drug Strategy Although the drug strategy calls for funding and programmingin several areas, its primary thrust is in the area of lawenforcement, with less focus on prevention, treatment, andeducation. Greater emphasis is also to be placed on "demandreduction" by imposing new sanctions on "casualusers." These sanctions will include such penalties asrevoking drivers' licenses, sentences to "boot camps,"and evictions from public housing. Law Enforcement/Prisons The Bennett plan proposes anincrease in federal aid to state and local governments fordrugrelated law enforcement from the current level of $150million to $350 million. In addition, funding levels for federalprison construction would be increased from $580 million to $1.2billion. Treatment Funding for drug treatment programs through theDepartment of Health and Human Resources would increase from $481million to $740 million. Education The Education Department would receive anincrease from $355 million to $392 million for antidrug programs. International Enforcement Between $300400 million would bemade available in economic and military assistance to LatinAmerican countries to combat the spread of cocaine. Other Features The drug strategy includes a variety ofother proposals, including the use of civil commitmentproceedings to force drug addicts into treatment, mandatoryimposition of user sanctions by colleges in order to receivefederal funds, and a crackdown on marijuana use. � The Sentencing Project, Inc., Washington, D.C.

Problems with the Drug Strategy The establishment of the drug policy position created anopportunity to conduct a broad examination of the reasons whydrug use pervades our society from innercity "crack"houses to suburban homes to professional athletics. In contrastto previous "wars on drugs," the drug "czar"position carried no mandate to adopt an exclusivelylawenforcement approach. Instead, there was the potential toexplore the range of social, economic, moral, and psychologicalfactors leading to drug use, and thereby creating the basis forproposing solutions to respond to the crisis. The Bennett plan,though, avoids asking these difficult questions, and insteadproposes "more of the same." 1. Contrary to some initial publicity, the Bennett strategycontinues a fifteenyear commitment to a law enforcement approach,and not to prevention, treatment, or education. The proposed budget increase for federal prisons alone $654million is greater than the total recommended increase of $565million for treatment and prevention. Total law enforcementfunding would outpace spending for treatment and prevention bymore than twotoone. In doing so, the plan continues a pattern of funding prioritiesthat began shifting in the mid1970s. From 197075, twothirds ofantidrug funding $1.92 billion of $3 billion was devoted toprevention, treatment, and education. Between 197681, 43 percentof the total $5.2 billion budget went to these categories.Beginning in 1982, the first full year of funding under theReagan administration, 80 percent of drug funding went to lawenforcement, with this pattern continuing until passage of the1988 AntiDrug Abuse Act. From 1981 through 1986, federal funding for law enforcement morethan doubled from $800 million in 1981 to $1.9 billion in 1986.At the same time, federal funding for prevention, education, andtreatment declined from $404 million in 1981 to $338 million in1985. When adjusted for inflation, this amounted to a 40 percentdecrease. The Bennett plan restores some of these funds that hadbeen cut over the years, but still maintains a primary emphasison a law enforcement approach. 2. The drug strategy represents a continuation of a failedapproach. Fighting the "war on drugs" primarily through lawenforcement more arrests, more prisons, and more prisoners ishardly a new approach. The past decade has seen a doubling in ournation's prison population at tremendous financial cost, much ofit due to drugrelated offenses. By the end of 1989, there will beone million prisoners in our nation's prisons and jails. Thismassive increase, though, has resulted in no appreciable drop inthe crime rate or the prevalence of drugs. As the Bennett papernotes, "drugs are potent, drugs are cheap, and drugs areavailable to almost anyone who wants them" (Draft, NationalDrug Control Strategy, pp. 34). As former Washington, D.C. Police Chief Maurice Turner hasremarked, even though District police made over 40,000 drugarrests in the past year, drug use in the nation's capitalremains rampant, along with the crime associated with it. As longas the conditions which breed drug use exist, there will be aconstant source of potential new users. 3. "Boot camps" recommended in the Bennett plan willlikely result in more prisoners, with no guarantee of any declinein crime or drug use. Although sometimes referred to as "alternatives" toprison, boot camps in fact are essentially prisons, albeitshortterm ones. States which currently operate boot camp programsgenerally use a model of a 36 month militarystyle regimen in aninstitution. In recommending the expansion of boot camps, thedrug strategy flies in the face of government reportsrecommending caution in their development. A 1988 GAO report("Prison Boot Camps: Too Early to MeasureEffectiveness") concluded that it was "too early tomeasure [the] effectiveness" of boot camps, while a recentNational Institute of Justice study ("Shock Incarceration:An Overview of Existing Programs") stated that, at present,"We don't know whether [boot camp] changes offenders'attitudes, or whether it deters or rehabilitates more or lesseffectively than other communitybased sanctions" (p. 35). 4. Locking up more drug offenders will only exacerbate theproblems in our prison system. Prison populations are at an alltime high, and prison systems inforty states are under court order to improve conditions. Addingadditional thousands of drug users will only add to this burden. The serious shortage of treatment programs in prisons has insuredthat incarceration cannot "cure" most drug addicts. Arecent Justice Department study of offenders released from stateprisons found that 62 percent of persons imprisoned for drugpossession were rearrested within three years of release. Asformer Watergate figure and prisoner Charles Colson has saidrecently, "Addicts leave prison just as likely to commit newcrimes as when they went in." If we cannot help drugoffenders who are already incarcerated, there is little hope ofproviding meaningful treatment to additional thousands ofprisoners. 5. The Bennett plan advocates increased incarceration, but themajor cost of this policy will be borne by state and localgovernments for decades to come. The vast majority of drug arrests are made at the state level.Increased funding to state and local governments for lawenforcement will lead to more arrests, convictions, and sentencesto prison. Yet, the Bennett plan includes no funding for stateprison construction or costs of incarceration. Each new prisoncell built to accommodate Bennett's strategy will cost about$50,000, plus approximately $20,000 a year for housing of eachnew prisoner. All of these costs will be the responsibility ofstate and local taxpayers, diverting funds from schools, roads,housing, and treatment programs. There is a Better Way Addressing the drug problem needs to begin with the premisethat drugs are a problem which society as a whole needs to dealwith, and not just the criminal justice system. As with otherissues, the criminal justice system may provide some measure ofjustice and safety, but it is not designed to resolve underlyingsocial and economic issues. A constructive approach to the drugproblem which the Bennett plan could have emphasized would havebeen the following: Social and Economic Issues Contrary to the contention of Bennett and others, addressingthe problem of poverty and "quality of life" are bothshortterm and longterm issues. Funds that will be used to buildand operate prisons could instead be devoted to programs of jobtraining and placement, school dropout prevention, child careprograms, and other needed services. Treatment As the Bennett plan notes, "treatment for drug addictioncan and often does work." Yet, in 1987, the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse estimated that publicly funded drugtreatment was available for only 4 percent of the estimated 6.5million drug users and addicts who needed help. Substance abuserswith financial resources have little trouble finding highqualitytreatment programs. For poor people seeking help, though, asixmonth waiting list for treatment is not unusual. No single drug program or approach will work for all drug users.What is needed is a funding commitment to develop a variety ofmodels to respond to the range of drugs and drug users. Prevention and Education From 1982 to 1985, only $23 million a year, 1 percent oftotal drug abuse funding, was spent on prevention and education.Although the 1988 AntiDrug Abuse Act increased funding in thisarea tenfold, more than threequarters of all funding stillremained in "supply reduction." With the important exception of "crack," drug use hasgenerally been declining over the past several years. Mostexperts believe this is primarily due to increased awarenessabout the hazards of drugs, and not through reduced availabilityor increased sanctions. Now is the time to build on thisprogress, and to design new methods of reaching young people. - - - - - - Much of the data in this briefing paper is taken from MatheaFalco, Winning the Drug War: A National Strategy, PriorityPress Publications, New York, 1989. 8/89 Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Other Publications related to drug policy Sentencing Project Reports WT01-B37-46IA087-000625-B011-82http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/Other/sp/facts-pp.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122041117 text/html 4492HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:11:11 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Saturday, 28-Dec-96 05:13:59 GMTContent-length: 4275 Facts About Prisons and Prisoners Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Other Publications related to drug policy Sentencing Project Reports FACTS ABOUT PRISONS AND PRISONERS The Growing Corrections System � The number of inmates in state and federal prisons hasincreased more than five-fold from less than 200,000 in 1970 to1,053,000 by 1994.

Washington, D.C. 20004 (202) 628-0871 YOUNG BLACK MEN AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM: A GROWING NATIONAL PROBLEM Overview For close to two decades, the criminal justice systemin the United States has been undergoing a tremendous expansion.Beginning in 1973, the number of prisoners, criminal justicepersonnel, and taxpayer dollars spent has increased dramatically,with new record highs now being reached each year. Between 1973and 1988, the number of felons in state and federal prisonsalmost tripled from 204,000 to 603,000. By 1989, the total inmatepopulation in our nation's prisons and jails had passed the onemillion mark. Record numbers of persons are also being placed under probationor parole supervision. These aspects of the criminal justicesystem are sometimes overlooked when the problems of prison andjail populations and overcrowding are explored. The extended reach of the criminal justice system has been farfrom uniform in its effects upon different segments of thepopulation. Although the number of women prisoners has increasedin recent years at a more rapid pace than men, the criminaljustice system as a whole still remains overwhelmingly maleapproximately 87 percent. And, as has been true historically, buteven more so now, the criminal justice system disproportionatelyengages minorities and the poor. Impact of the Criminal Justice System This report looks at the impact of the criminal justicesystem as a whole on the new generation of adults those people inthe 2029 age group. In particular, it examines the devastatingimpact that the criminal justice system has had on the lives ofyoung Black men and Black communities. This report does not attempt to explain whether or why Blacks aredisproportionately involved in the criminal justice system. Otherstudies have attempted to document whether Black males commitmore crimes or different types of crimes than other groups, orwhether they are merely treated more harshly for their crimes bythe criminal justice system. Instead, this report looks at theend result of that large-scale involvement in the criminaljustice system, and highlights the implications this raises forcrime control policies. Using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Bureauof the Census, we have calculated the rates at which differentsegments of the 2029 age group come under the control of thecriminal justice system. The analysis looks at the total numberof persons in state and federal prisons, jails, probation, andparole, and compares rates of criminal justice control by race,sex, and ethnicity. Because of the unavailability of completedata in some categories of the analysis, the total rates ofcontrol should not be considered exact calculations, but rather,close approximations of the numbers of persons in the system. Asdescribed in "Methodology," in all cases where datawere lacking, conservative assumptions were used in makingcalculations. (Sufficient data were not available to analyzecriminal justice control rates for Native Americans or AsianAmericans.) Our findings, as displayed in Tables 1 and 2, are as follows: � Almost one in four (23 percent) Black men in the age group2029 is either in prison, jail, on probation, or parole on anygiven day. � For white men in the age group 2029, one in 16 (6.2 percent)is under the control of the criminal justice system. � Hispanic male rates fall between these two groups, with one in10 (10.4 percent within the criminal justice system on any givenday). � Although the number of women in the criminal justice system ismuch lower than for men, the racial disproportions are parallel.For women in their twenties, relative rates of criminal justicecontrol are: Black women one in 37 (2.7 percent) White women one in 100 (1 percent) Hispanic women one in 56 (1.8 percent) � The number of young Black men under the control of thecriminal justice system 609,690 is greater than the totalnumber of Black men of all ages enrolled in college436,000 as of 1986. For white males, the comparable figures are4,600,000 total in higher education and 1,054,508 ages 2029 inthe criminal justice system. � Direct criminal justice control costs for these 609,690 Blackmen are $2.5 billion a year. � Although crime rates increased by only 2 percent in the period1979-88, the number of prison inmates doubled during that time. These findings actually understate the impact of presentpolicies upon Black males ages 2029. This is because the analysispresented here covers criminal justice control rates for asingle day in mid1989. Since all components of the criminaljustice system admit and release persons each day, though, thetotal number of persons processed through the system in a givenyear is substantially higher than the single day counts. For thisreason, the proportion of young Black men processed by thecriminal justice system over the course of a year would beeven higher than one in four. Implications for Social Policy The findings of this study, particularly those pertainingto young Black men, should be disturbing to all Americans.Whatever the causes of crime be they individual or societal wenow have a situation where one in four Black men of the new adultgeneration is under the control of the criminal justice system. The implications of this analysis for social policy both withinand outside the criminal justice system are farreaching: 1. Impact on the life prospects for Black males The repercussions of these high rates of criminal justicecontrol upon young Black men are greater than their immediateloss of freedom. Few would claim that today's overcrowdedcorrections systems do much to assist offenders in becomingproductive citizens after release. Despite the ideal thatoffenders can "pay their debt to society," the fact isthat most carry the stigma of being exoffenders for some time tocome. Thus, given these escalating rates of control, we risk thepossibility of writing off an entire generation of Black men fromhaving the opportunity to lead productive lives in our society. 2. Impact on the Black community For the Black community in general, nearly onefourth of itsyoung men are under the control of the criminal justice system ata time when their peers are beginning families, learningconstructive life skills, and starting careers. The consequencesof this situation for family and community stability will beincreasingly debilitating. Unless the criminal justice system canbe used to assist more young Black males in pursuing theseobjectives, any potential positive contributions they can make tothe community will be delayed, or lost forever. A particularly ominous trend further emphasizes this point. Atthe same time that an increasing proportion of Black males ages2029 have come under the control of the criminal justice system,Black male college enrollment fell by 7 percent in the decadefrom 197686. The cumulative effect of these separate measures isthat fewer Black males are being prepared to assume leadershiproles in their community. 3. Failure of the "get tough" approach to crimecontrol In many respects, the past decade can be viewed as an"experiment" in the "get tough" approach tocrime. Proponents of this policy contend that cracking down oncrime through increased arrests, prosecutions, and lengthysentences will have a deterrent effect on potential lawbreakers.Yet even with a tripling of the prison population since 1973, attremendous financial cost, victimization rates since that timehave declined less than 5 percent. 4. Implications for the "war on drugs" National drug policy director William Bennett's drug strategysimilarly emphasizes a law enforcement approach to a socialproblem. This approach is likely to result in even higher ratesof incarceration for Blacks and Hispanics since drug lawenforcement is largely targeted against "crack," moreoften used by low-income Blacks and Hispanics. As drug offendersmake up an increasing share of the prison population, thenon-white prison population will become disproportionatelylarger. In Florida, for example, Blacks inmates now make up 73.3percent of all drug offenders, compared to 53.6 percent of prisonadmissions for other offenses. The Bennett proposal to lock up more offenders is hardly a novelone. For more than twenty years, politicians have campaigned onthis basic platform. A continued emphasis on law enforcement atthe expense of prevention and treatment has little hope ofachieving longterm results. 5. Strategies for more effective criminal justice policies andprograms While the reasons why Black men enter into the criminaljustice system are complex and need to be addressed with longtermvision, there are immediate opportunities for change through thecriminal justice system. The goals of such changes should be toreduce the harm caused by the system and to reduce the likelihoodof offenders returning to the system. The outlines of such astrategy are as follows: � Divert as many youthful, minor and firsttime offenders aspossible from the criminal justice system entirely. Diversionprograms, dispute resolution processes, counseling and other moresatisfactory means for modifying offensive behavior could be usedmore frequently than they are now. � Reverse the trend to "criminalize" sociallyundesirable acts and to increase criminal penalties as a means ofcontrolling public behavior. Mandatory and lengthy prison termsadd to correctional populations, but do little to reduce crime. � Jail and prison should be sanctions of last resort foroffenders who cannot be diverted from the system. A range ofcommunitybased sentencing options exist which are less costly andmore effective than incarceration. More could be made availablethrough legislative appropriations. These include: - restitution to victims - community service - intensive probation supervision - treatment programs - employment and education - community corrections programs � Utilize the sentencing process the one point in the systemwhen there is the opportunity to craft a meaningful response tothe needs of victims, offenders, and the community to counteractthe trend toward increasing criminal justice control over Blackmales. This can be accomplished by individual judges adoptingconstructive alternatives and by developing true rehabilitativeprograms designed to reverse current correctional priorities. 6. The need for a broad approach to crime and crime control The problem of crime is one that can not be solved entirelyby the criminal justice system. Even with the most resourcefulpolice, prosecutors, judges, and corrections officials, thecriminal justice system is designed to be only a reactivesystem, not one of prevention. At the same time that the nation has engaged in a criminaljustice control strategy over the past decade, funding to addressthe conditions that contribute to crime has declined. While thecriminal justice system has processed young Black men in greatnumbers, the official unemployment rate for Black men ages 1624remains at 24 percent. (Adding the numbers of persons discouragedfrom or not "officially" in the labor market wouldresult in a significantly higher figure.) It is time now to"experiment" in crime control by attacking those socialfactors that many believe provide a more direct link to crime,such as unemployment, poverty, and substance abuse. Conclusion The problem of crime is a complex one and will not beresolved overnight. Rather than viewing the solution as hopelessor too longterm, though, there are real and immediate actionswhich can be taken to prevent the next generation of Black malesfrom further swelling the ranks of correctional populations. Some of these steps involve a change in priorities and emphasiswithin the criminal justice system. Programs and policies existin jurisdictions around the country which offer models of moreconstructive resolution of criminal justice problems. Addressing the conditions which lead to crime in the first placeis a broad agenda which requires serious thought, attention, andaction. The decisions made today, though, in the areas of policy,programs, and funding, will determine whether the criminaljustice system exerts as much control over the next generation ofBlack males as it does for the current generation. Methodology The data on which these calculations are made are takenfrom reports of the Bureau of Justice Statistics of theDepartment of Justice, the Bureau of the Census, and theDepartment of Education. A breakdown of the incarceratedpopulation by age, sex, and race was available for state prisoninmates (1986) and jail inmates (1983). Data on sex and race, butnot age, were available for federal prisoners, probationers, andparolees (all 1986). Data for the age distribution for stateprisoners and jail inmates were used to develop a ratio of theproportion of each group of prisoners (i.e. male and femalewhites, Blacks, and Hispanics) in the 2029 age group. Theseproportions were as follows: White Males 49.6%; Black Males52.4%; Hispanic Males 51.6%; White Females 52.7%; Black Females52.8%; Hispanic Females 60.0%. This ratio was then used to develop estimates by age for federalprisoners, probationers, and parolees. While parolees and federalprisoners are probably older on average than the state prisonpopulation, probationers are probably younger. The greater numberof probationers would therefore make the overall estimate of the2029 age group a conservative one. While some margin of error isinevitable in these estimates, it seems reasonable to assume thatit is not of a substantial nature. Rates of criminal justice control were then developed for allparts of the system for 1986 (except for 1983 figures for jail).These figures were then extrapolated to June 1989, based on thepercentage increase for each component of the system. The mostrecent overall population figures available were: state andfederal prisons June 1989; jails June 1987; probation and paroleDecember 1988. Annual growth estimates of 5 percent forprobation, 10 percent for parole, and 6 percent for jails, basedon trends for the past two years, were used to derive June 1989population estimates based on the 1987 and 1988 data. The use of overall population increases results in someadditional margin of error in the total population figures. Forexample, available data appear to indicate that the rateof increase for prisoners for the period 198689 has been greaterfor Blacks, Hispanics, and women than for the population as awhole. Reports also indicate that Blacks make up an increasingshare of the total number of drug arrests, a major source of theincreasing criminal justice populations. Therefore, the totalcriminal justice control rate for Black males is probably understatedin the calculations. Cost figures for various components of the criminal justicesystem are those cited by the Department of Justice in Reportto the Nation on Crime and Justice: Second Edition, 1988.Many observers believe that current cost figures aresubstantially higher than those presented here. For example, wehave used the figure of $11,302 per year for state prisoners in1984 from the Report. Many current estimates for costs ofincarceration are in the range of $15,00025,000 per year. Population figures within each category are based on CensusBureau estimates of the U.S. resident population. As the available data for Hispanics are fairly limited in mostinstances, these results should be interpreted with caution.

It is a discussion betweenWilliam F. Buckley, Jr. And Professor Gazzaniga (the Andrew W.Thompson Jr. Professor of Psychiatry [Neuroscience] at DartmouthMedical School) which was originally published in the February 5,1990, issue of the National Review. Buckley: It is said that the drug crack issubstantively different from its parent drug, cocaine, in that itis, to use the term of Professor van den Haag,"crimogenic." In other words a certain (unspecified)percentage of those who take crack are prompted to--well, to goout and commit mayhem of some kind. Is that correct? Gazzaniga: No, not in the way you put it. What you areasking is: Is there something about how crack acts on the brainthat makes people who take it likelier to commit crime? Let'sbegin by making it clear what crack is. It is simply cocaine thathas been mixed with baking soda, water, and then boiled. Whatthis procedure does is to permit cocaine to be smoked. Now anydrug ingested in that way-- i.e., absorbed by the lungs--goesmore efficiently to the brain, and the result is a quicker, moreintense experience. That is what crack gives the consumer. Butits impact on the brain is the same as with plain cocaine and, asa matter of fact, amphetamines. No one has ever maintained thatthese drugs are "crimogenic.' The only study I know aboutthat inquires into the question of crack breeding crime reportsthat most homicides involving crack were the result NOT of theuse of crack, but of dealer disputes. Crack did not induce usersto commit crimes. Do some crack users commit crimes? Of course.After all, involvement in proscribed drug traffic is dangerous.Moreover, people who commit crimes tend to use drugs at a highrate, though which drug they prefer varies from one year to thenext. Buckley: You are telling us that an increase in the useof crack would not mean an increase in crime? Gazzaniga: I am saying that what increase there wouldbe in crime would not be simply the result of the pharmacology ofthat drug. Look, let's say there are 200,000 users/abusers ofcrack in New York City--a number that reflects one of the currentestimates. If so, and if the drug produced violent tendencies inall crack users, the health-care system would have to come to ascreeching halt. It hasn't. In fact, in 1988 the hospitals in NewYork City (the crack capital of the world) averaged only sevencrack-related admissions, city-wide, a day. The perception ofcrack-based misbehavior is exaggerated because it is the casesthat show up in the emergency rooms that receive public notice,and the whole picture begins to look very bleak. All of this isto say: when considering any aspect of the drug problem, keep inmind the matter of selection of evidence. It is prudent to recallthat, in the past, dangerous and criminal behavior has been saidto have been generated by other drugs, for instance marijuana(you remember "Reefer Madness"?). And bear it in mindthat since cocaine is available everywhere, so is crack availableeverywhere, since the means of converting the one into the otherare easy, and easily learned. It is important to note that only asmall percentage of cocaine users actually convert their stuff tocrack. Roughly one in six. Buckley: Then would it follow that even if there werean increase in the use of crack, the legalization of it wouldactually result in a decrease in crime? Gazzaniga: That is correct. Buckley: Isn't crack a drug whose addictive powerexceeds that of many other drugs? If that is the case, oneassumes that people who opt to take crack do so because it yieldsthe faster and more exhilarating satisfactions to which you makereference. Gazzaniga: That is certainly the current understanding,but there are no solid data on the question. Current observationsare confounded by certain economic variables. Crack is cheap- Buckley: Why? If cocaine is expensive, how can crack becheap? Gazzaniga: Cocaine costs $1,000 per ounce if bought inquantity. Once ounce can produce one thousand vials of crack,each of which sells for $5. The drug abuser is able to experiencemore drug episodes. Crack being cheap, the next high can come alot more quickly and since there is a down to every up, or high,the cycle can become intense. So yes, crack is addictive. So iscocaine. So are amphetamines. The special punch of crack, as theresult of going quickly via the lungs to the brain, may promptsome abusers to want more. By the way, it is the public knowledgethat crack acts in this way that, as several studies document,causes most regular cocaine users to be cautious about crack. Thecasual- to-moderate user very clearly wants to stay in thatcategory. So, all you can say is that there is a *perception*,widely shared, that crack is more addictive. Whether it is, isn'treally known. One thing we do know is that crack does not beginto approach tobacco as a nationwide health hazard. For everycrack-related death, there are three-hundred tobacco-relateddeaths. Another example of hyperbole is the recent claim thatthere were 375,000 "crack babies" born last year; howcould that possibly be, when the government (the NationalInstitutes on Drug Abuse) informs us that there were only 500,000crack "users" last year? Exaggeration andmisinformation run rampant on this subject. Buckley: Well, if crack were legally availablealongside cocaine and, say, marijuana, what would be the reasonfor a consumer to take crack? Gazzaniga: You need to keep your drug classificationsstraight. if your goal were, pure and simple, to get high, youmight try crack or cocaine, or some amphetamine. You wouldn't gofor marijuana, which is a mild hallucinogen and tranquilizer. So,if you wanted to be up and you didn't have much time, you mightgo to crack. But then if it were absolutely established thatthere was a higher addiction rate with crack, legalization could,paradoxically, diminish its use. This is so because if cocainewere reduced to the same price as crack, the abuser,acknowledging the higher rate of addiction, might forgo the moreintensive high of crack, opting for the slower high of cocaine.Crack was introduced years ago as offering an alluring newpsychoactive experience. But its special hold on the ghetto isthe result of its price. Remember that--on another front--we knowthat 120- proof alcohol doesn't sell as readily as 86 proof, notby a long shot, even though the higher the proof, the faster thepsychological effect that alcohol users are seeking.

As they entered Morningside Park, the older kids raced to theswings and slides. The younger ones clapped their hands andcheered them on. Within seconds, the children wereindistinguishable from the other youngsters in the park, swoopingdown slides and climbing monkey bars. Three-year-old Johnny scrambled up the slide so fast thatkids from a nearby school watching in awe. Two-year-old Tanikajumped onto the jungle gym like a tiny mountain goat. This wasn't supposed to happen. These children, on theirdaily outing from Hale House, were born exposed to crack. Inrecent years, the term "crack babies" has become anational buzzword, a riveting soundbite that conjures images ofmutant, monster children. Punchy headlines such as "Crack Babies: GeneticInferiors" and "Crack in the Cradle" have helpedshape the stereotype. But the children themselves may have the last word. Doctors,social workers and teachers involved with crack-exposed kidsindicate that many are rising above the dire predictions made forthem. "When people find out what I do, they say 'Ok, thosepoor crack babies,'" said Hale House nurse Anne Marie Neddas she chased active, giggling 18-month-old Daren around thepark. "I get so mad. I tell them, "There's nothingreally wrong with these kids!'" --- Since crack swept the country in 1985, children born to crackaddicts were thought to be physically and mentally damaged,doomed to a marginal life and an ongoing burden for taxpayers. The first wave of crack-exposed children entered first andsecond grades in New York City this fall, a year after one statereport estimated the cost of special care for them could total $2billion over the next 15 years. Harlem Hospital researchersestimated that the cost of caring for crack babies costs thecountry $500 million a year. Such statistics have fed the kind offear that led Ross Perot to invoke the dread specter of"crack babies" during the first presidential debate. "Again and again and again, the mother disappears inthree days and the child becomes a ward of the state because he'spermanently and geneticall damaged," Perot said. Permanently and genetically damaged. That's the kind ofdescription that angers Hale House program director Jackie Edmondas she feeds beaming, 6-month-old Quashia some apple sauce. HaleHouse cares for children 3 and under born addicted to drugs. LikeQuashia, almost all the kids there now were born addicted tocrack. "Tell me, what does a crack baby look like?" Edmondsays angrily as she recounts the stories she's read about crackbabies and the comments she hears from strangers. "Nobodywho talks about them ever comes in to see them. They'll come inhere and look at our kids any the look normal. So they says,'Where are the drug babies?' I tell them, 'They're righthere.'" Across town on Wards Island, watching a group of animated 3-and 4-year-olds reading aloud from workbooks in a sunny room atOdyssey House, Cheryl Nazario had the same reaction. "These kids were labeled a lost cause," saidNazario, who directs a residential program helping former crackaddicts and their children. "It was like everyone expectedthem to walk into schools like little androids. But they catchup. They really do catch up." --- While crack-exposed babies may develop more slowly thanothers, many experts say they often appear to grow out of earlyproblems if they receive proper care as infants and toddlers.Many believe their prognosis is as good as children borndrug-free if they get early intervention. Such children have to overcome a lot. The gripping image ofthe jittery, irritable baby who doesn't want to be touched andcries all the time is a reality, experts say. But kids born tomothers addicted to other drugs share the same symptoms, theresult of a disorganized nervous system. Programs all over the country, including Hale House andOdyssey House in New York and the Charles R. Drew Head Start inSouth-Central Los Angeles, have developed strategies to lessenthe symptoms, help kids adapt to their surroundings and teachparents how to better care for them. Many experts who have researched or worked with kids exposedto cocaine decry what some call the myth of "crackbabies." "It's nonsense," said Claire Coles, a clinicalpsychologist at Emory University in Atlanta who has studied crackkids. "There's no evidence of genetic damage, nothing likewhat was originally supposed. It's astonishing that so much fusshas been raised about cocaine when kids born with fetal alcoholsyndrome are so much worse off." The problems suffered by children exposed to cocaine stemfrom many factors, Coles said. Many were born prematurely tomothers who had little or no prenatal care and a returned to aneglectful environment. But cocaine itself has not been proven tobe any more damaging than any other drug used by pregnant woment,Coles said. Those familar with crack-exposed children also echoedColes' assertion that children with fetal alcohol syndrome aremuch more likely to suffer from mental retardation. Researchers at the National Association for PerinatalAddiction Research and Education in Chicago have tracked a groupof 300 children born exposed to crack for almost seven years,while helping the kids and their mothers. The association's president, Ira Chasnoff, said kids bornexposed to crack, or other drugs, often suffer from a decreasedattention span, more impulsive behavior and have difficultyconcentrating. But environment may play a more key role than drugexposure in the womb, he said. In NAPARE's study, researchers found that the IQ scores ofchildren born exposed to crack were the same as children who werenot crack-exposed but who lived in a similar environment. Chasnoff painted a dark picture behind society's morbidembrace of "crack babies." "The image of the crack baby really moved outthere," he said. "Politicians really picked it up. Itworked into the trend of writing about the underclass. It's sexy,it's interesting, it sells newspapers and it perpetuates theus-versus-them idea." In fact, said Chasnoff, "Poverty is the worst thing thatcan happen to a child."

Khalsa ME; Tashkin DP; Perrochet B. Smoked cocaine: patterns of use and pulmonary consequences.Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, 1992 Jul-Sep, 24(3):265-72. (UI:93058148) Abstract: This article offers a perspective on the use ofvolatilized alkaloidal cocaine in its freebase and crack formsand on the pulmonary consequences of such use. The inhalationalroute of administration of freebase and crack cocaine exposes thelung to their combustion products, raising concern about possibleadverse pulmonary effects. A brief historical review of cocaineand its methods of use precedes the presentation of dataconcerning current modes and patterns of use and some pulmonarycomplications of crack and freebase use. Results from asystematic study of a large sample of cocaine users document ahigh frequency of occurrence of acute respiratory symptoms intemporal association with cocaine smoking. No relationship wasdetected between the prevalence of acute pulmonary symptoms andidentifiable aspects of techniques of cocaine administration.These results suggest that the respiratory consequences ofalkaloidal cocaine are most likely attributable to the inhaledcocaine itself, rather than to variable characteristics of usage. 2. Oh PI; Balter MS. Cocaine induced eosinophilic lung disease. Thorax, 1992 Jun,47(6):478-9. (UI: 92358464) Abstract: A patient developed fever, bronchoconstriction,hypoxaemia, pulmonary infiltrates, and serum and bronchoalveolarlavage fluid eosinophilia on two occasions after inhaling crackcocaine. Transbronchial biopsy specimens showed normal lungparenchyma but a dense eosinophilic infiltrate within thebronchial wall. Both episodes resolved promptly after treatmentwith corticosteroids. Eosinophilic lung disease may be a steroidresponsive complication of crack cocaine abuse. 3. Perper JA; Van Thiel DH. Respiratory complications of cocaine abuse. RecentDevelopments in Alcoholism, 1992, 10:363-77. (UI: 92270885) Pub type: Journal Article; Review; Review, Tutorial. Abstract: Upper respiratory and pulmonary complications ofcocaine addiction have been increasingly reported in recentyears, with most of the patients being intravenous addicts, usersof freebase, or smokers of "crack." The toxicity ofcocaine is complex and is exerted via multiple central andperipheral pathways. Recurrent snorting of cocaine may result inischemia, necrosis, and infections of the nasal mucosa, sinuses,and adjacent structures. Pulmonary complications of cocainetoxicity include pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhages,pulmonary barotrauma, foreign body granulomas, cocaine relatedpulmonary infection, obliterative bronchiolitis, asthma, andpersistent gas-exchange abnormalities. Respiratory manifestations are nonspecific and includeshortness of breath, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, and chestpains. Severe respiratory difficulties have been reported inneonates of abusing mothers. In the absence of a cocaine-abusehistory, it may be difficult to recognize the etiological role ofcocaine, especially in the absence of needle tracks pointing toprevious intravenous drug abuse and/or negative toxicology. 5. Tashkin DP; Khalsa ME; Gorelick D; Chang P; Simmons MS;Coulson AH; Gong H Jr. Pulmonary status of habitual cocaine smokers. AmericanReview of Respiratory Disease, 1992 Jan, 145(1):92-100. (UI:92117426) Abstract: We determined the prevalence of respiratorysymptoms and lung dysfunction in a large sample of habitualsmokers of freebase cocaine ("crack") alone and incombination with tobacco and/or marijuana. In addition, wecompared these findings with those in an age- and race-matchedsample of nonusers of crack who did or did not smoke tobaccoand/or marijuana. A detailed respiratory and drug usequestionnaire and a battery of lung function tests wereadministered to (1) a convenience sample of 202 habitual smokersof cocaine (cases) who denied intravenous drug abuse and (2) areference sample of 99 nonusers of cocaine (control subjects).The cocaine smokers (85% black) included the following: 68never-smokers of marijuana, of whom 43 currently smoked tobaccoand 25 did not, and 134 ever-smokers of marijuana (42 current and92 former), of whom 92 currently smoked tobacco and 42 did not.The control subjects (96% black) included the following: 69never-smokers of marijuana, of whom 26 currently smoked tobaccoand 43 did not, and 30 ever-smokers of marijuana (18 current and12 former), of whom 21 currently smoked tobacco and 9 did not.Cases smoked an average of 6.5 g cocaine per week for a mean of53 months. The median time of the most recent use of crack priorto study was 19 days (range less than 1 to 180 days). Aftercontrolling for the use of other smoked substances, frequentcrack use was associated with: (1) a high prevalence of at leastoccasional occurrences of acute cardiorespiratory symptoms within1 to 12 h after smoking cocaine (cough productive of black sputum[43.7%], hemoptysis [5.7%], chest pain [38.5%], usually worsewith deep breathing, and cardiac palpitations [52.6%]) and (2) amild but significant impairment in the diffusing capacity of thelung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) 6.

(UI: 92006753) Abstract: A 33-year-old woman developed acute bilateralpulmonary infiltrates after the intense use of rock cocaine(crack). She subsequently had progressive deterioration ofpulmonary function to the point of being ventilator-dependent.Open lung biopsy showed a chronic interstitial pneumonia withextensive accumulation of free silica within histiocytesassociated with mild pulmonary fibrosis. This pattern ofinterstitial pneumonia has not been previously reported in crackusers. 7. Susskind H; Weber DA; Volkow ND; Hitzemann R. Increasedlung permeability following long-term use of free-base cocaine(crack). Chest, 1991 Oct, 100(4):903-9. (UI: 92006781) Abstract: The clearance of inhaled 99mTc DTPA aerosol fromthe lungs is used as an index of lung epithelial permeability.Using the radioaerosol method, we investigated the effects oflong-term "crack" (free-base cocaine) inhalation onlung permeability in 23 subjects. Eighteen control subjects (12nonsmokers and 6 cigarette smokers) with no history of drug usewere also studied. Subjects inhaled approximately 150 muCi(approximately 5.6 MBq) of 99mTc DTPA aerosol and quantitativegamma camera images of the lungs were acquired at 1-minincrements for 25 minutes. Regions of interest (ROIs) wereselected to include the following: (1) both lungs; (2) eachindividual lung; and (3) the upper, middle, and lower thirds ofeach lung. 99mTc DTPA lung clearance was determined from theslopes of the respective time-activity plots for the differentRIOs. Radioaerosol clearance half-times (T1/2) for the sevennonsmoking crack users (61.5 +/- 18.3 minutes) were longer thanfor the seven cigarette-smoking crack users (27.9 +/- 16.9minutes) and nine cigarette-smoking crack plus marijuana users(33.5 +/- 21.6 minutes). T1/2 for the nonsmoking crack users wassignificantly shorter (p less than 0.001) than for the nonsmokingcontrol group (123.8 +/- 28.7 minutes). T1/2 for thecigarette-smoking drug users was similar to that of thecigarette-smoking control group (33.1 +/- 17.8 minutes),suggesting a similar mechanism of damage from the smoke of crackand tobacco. From these groups, one nonsmoker and 11 cigarettesmokers displayed biexponential 99mTc DTPA clearances, indicativeof greater lung injury than found in the usual cases ofmonoexponential clearance. The upper lungs of all crack usersgroups cleared faster than the lower lungs. The faster andbiexponential clearance properties of inhaled 99mTc DTPA aerosolwere the principal functional abnormalities found in all the drugusers. In contrast, 19 of 23 crack users had normal spirometryand gas exchange. These results indicate that 99mTc DTPA mayprovide a sensitive and useful assay to evaluate the physiologiceffects of cocaine inhalation in the lung. 8. McCarroll KA; Roszler MH. Lung disorders due to drugabuse. Journal of Thoracic Imaging, 1991 Jan, 6(1):30-5. (UI:91116637) Pub type: Journal Article; Review; Review, Academic. Abstract: Drug-related diseases of the lungs have been notedwith increasing frequency in urban patients. These entities arealso being seen in smaller urban and suburban settings, however.The spectrum of pathology is also changing coincident with themarked increase in crack cocaine use. The incidence of abnormalchest radiographs in cocaine users admitted with pulmonarycomplaints has ranged from 12% to 55%. Findings have includedfocal air space disease, atelectasis, pneumothorax,pneumomediastinum, and pulmonary edema. Pulmonary complicationsrelated to injections of illicit drugs have included pulmonaryinfection, pulmonary edema, particulate embolism, and talcosis.The "pocket shot" places the patient at risk for aunique set of complications. Radiologists should be aware of thiswide spectrum of pulmonary disease that may be related to thisincreasingly frequent social problem. 9. Smart RG. Crack cocaine use: a review of prevalence andadverse effects. American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse,1991, 17(1):13-26. (UI: 91247446) Pub type: Journal Article; Review; Review, Tutorial. Abstract: Crack is a potent form of cocaine which results inrapid and striking stimulant effects when smoked. This paperreviews epidemiological research on the extent of use as well asreports of adverse effects. Crack is used by a small minority ofadult and student populations but by a large proportion ofcocaine users and heavy drug-using groups. Use does not appear tobe increasing in general populations, but there are no trendstudies for high-risk groups. Crack users tend to be young, heavypolydrug users, many of whom have serious drug abuse problems.The adverse reactions to crack are similar to those of cocaineand include effects on offspring, neurological and psychiatricproblems, as well as pulmonary and cardiac abnormalities.However, two adverse reactions unique to crack have beenreported. One relates to lung infiltrates and bronchospasm. Theother involves neurological symptoms among children living incrack smoke-filled rooms. There is a need for improved treatmentand preventive programs for crack use. 10. Forrester JM; Steele AW; Waldron JA; Parsons PE. Crack lung: an acute pulmonary syndrome with a spectrum ofclinical and histopathologic findings. American Review ofRespiratory Disease, 1990 Aug, 142(2):462-7. (UI: 90343162) Abstract: In this report, we review the hospital course offour patients who presented with an acute pulmonary syndromeafter inhaling freebase cocaine and compare them with previouslydescribed case reports. Two patients had prolonged inflammatorypulmonary injury associated with fever, hypoxemia, hemoptysis,respiratory failure, and diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Lungtissue specimens from both patients revealed diffuse alveolardamage, alveolar hemorrhage, and interstitial and intraalveolarinflammatory cell infiltration notable for the prominence ofeosinophils. Immunofluorescent staining performed on one of thebiopsy specimens showed a striking deposition of IgE in bothlymphocytes and alveolar macrophages. Both patients were treatedwith systemic corticosteroids and rapidly improved. In contrast,two patients presented acutely with diffuse pulmonary alveolarinfiltrates associated with dyspnea and hypoxemia, but withoutfever, and within 36 h of discontinuing cocaine their pulmonaryinfiltrates and symptoms had spontaneously resolved. Our reportfurther supports the finding that an acute pulmonary syndrome canoccur after inhalation of freebase cocaine. Furthermore, the lunginjury may respond to systemic corticosteroid therapy when it isassociated with a prominent inflammatory cell infiltration. 11. Hannan DJ; Adler AG. Crack abuse. Do you known enough about it? PostgraduateMedicine, 1990 Jul, 88(1):141-3, 146-7. (UI: 90310821) Pub type: Journal Article; Review; Review, Tutorial. Abstract: Crack use has increased dramatically because thedrug is cheap, highly addictive, and easy to use. As a result, anincreased frequency of cocaine-related medical problems has beennoted. The effects of crack abuse on fetal outcome andneurobehavioral development are becoming more apparent. Inaddition, the role of crack use in furthering transmission ofsexually transmitted diseases has been documented, and theimplications for AIDS transmission have been speculated on. Crackuse enhances social disorganization, particularly in poor urbanareas, where increased child abuse, neglect, and prostitution arecommon. Ever present are the financial incentives to increase thenumber of crack users. Cocaine was once considered a drug for theelite, rich, and famous. Crack clearly has changed that notion. 12. Tashkin DP. Pulmonary complications of smoked substanceabuse. Western Journal of Medicine, 1990 May, 152(5):525-30. (UI:90273700) Pub type: Journal Article; Review; Review, Tutorial. Abstract: After tobacco, marijuana is the most widely smokedsubstance in our society. Studies conducted within the past 15years in animals, isolated tissues, and humans indicate thatmarijuana smoke can injure the lungs. Habitual smoking ofmarijuana has been shown to be associated with chronicrespiratory tract symptoms, an increased frequency of acutebronchitic episodes, extensive tracheobronchial epithelialdisease, and abnormalities in the structure and function ofalveolar macrophages, key cells in the lungs' immune defensesystem. In addition, the available evidence strongly suggeststhat regularly smoking marijuana may predispose to thedevelopment of cancer of the respiratory tract. "Crack"smoking has become increasingly prevalent in our society,especially among habitual smokers of marijuana. New evidence isemerging implicating smoked cocaine as a cause of acuterespiratory tract symptoms, lung dysfunction, and, in some cases,serious, life-threatening acute lung injury. A strong physicianmessage to users of marijuana, cocaine, or both concerning theharmful effects of these smoked substances on the lungs and otherorgans may persuade some of them, especially those withdrug-related respiratory complications, to quit smoking. 13. Brody SL; Slovis CM; Wrenn KD. Cocaine-related medical problems: consecutive series of 233patients [see comments]. American Journal of Medicine, 1990 Apr, 88(4):325-31. (UI:90224989) Abstract: PURPOSE: Little information describing commoncocaine-related medical problems is available. This studyexamined the nature, frequency, treatment, incidence ofcomplications, and emergency department deaths of patientsseeking medical care for acute and chronic cocaine-associatedmedical problems. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of233 hospital visits by 216 cocaine-using patients over a 6-monthperiod during 1986 and 1987 was studied. Medical records wereretrospectively reviewed to determine patient characteristics,nature of complications, treatment, and outcome. RESULTS:Patients most commonly used cocaine intravenously (49%), butfreebase or crack use was also common (23.3%). Concomitant abuseof other intoxicants, especially alcohol, was frequently seen(48.5%). The vast majority of complaints were cardiopulmonary(56.2%), neurologic (39.1%), and psychiatric (35.8%); multiplesymptoms were often present (57.5%). The most common complaintwas chest pain though rarely was it believed to representischemia. Altered mental status was common (27.4%) and rangedfrom psychosis to coma. Short-term pharmacologic intervention wasnecessary in only 24% of patients, and only 9.9% of patients wereadmitted. Acute mortality was less than 1%. CONCLUSION: Mostmedical complications of cocaine are short-lived and appear to berelated to cocaine's hyperadrenergic effects. Patients usually donot require short-term therapy or hospital admission. Acutemorbidity and mortality rates from cocaine use in patientspresenting to the hospital are very low, suggesting that a majorfocus in the treatment of cocaine-related emergencies should bereferral for drug abuse detoxification and treatment. 14.

Chest pain and dyspnea related to "crack" cocainesmoking: value of chest radiography. Radiology, 1989 Aug, 172(2):459-62. (UI: 89316319) Abstract: The chest radiographs of 71 patients who had chestpain or shortness of breath following the smoking of highlypotent "crack" cocaine were retrospectively evaluated.Nine patients had abnormal findings on radiographs as follows:atelectasis or localized parenchymal opacification in four,pneumomediastinum in two, pneumothorax in one, hemopneumothoraxin one, and pulmonary edema in one. Radiographic detection ofthese abnormalities was important in the clinical management ofthese patients. This spectrum of findings is presented with adiscussion of the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible. 16. Cherukuri R; Minkoff H; Feldman J; Parekh A; Glass L. Acohort study of alkaloidal cocaine ("crack") inpregnancy. Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1988 Aug, 72(2):147-51. (UI: 88276400) Abstract: The recent dramatic increase in the use ofalkaloidal cocaine ("crack") has led to concern aboutpossible deleterious fetal effects associated with its use duringpregnancy. Crack, which is not destroyed by heating, can besmoked, and delivers a large quantity of cocaine to the vascularbed of the lung, producing an effect similar to that fromintravenous injection. To describe the association of crack usewith pregnancy outcome, we conducted a retrospective matchedcohort study of 55 women who admitted to the use of crack duringpregnancy and 55 non-drug-using women who delivered during thesame period. The groups were matched for age, parity,socioeconomic status, alcohol use, and presence or absence ofprenatal care. A significantly larger number of women using crackdelivered at 37 weeks or earlier (50.9 versus 16.4%; P = .001). Crack-exposed infants were 3.6 times more likely to haveintrauterine growth retardation (P less than .006) and 2.8 timesmore likely to have a head circumference less than the tenthpercentile for gestational age (P less than .007). Prematurerupture of the membranes was 1.8 times more common in the crackgroup (P less than .03). Sixty percent of crack-using mothersreceived no prenatal care. Abnormal neurobehavioral symptoms werepresent in a minority of infants and were usually mild. 17.

Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior, 1988Jan, 29(1):93-5. (UI: 88177036) Abstract: The smoking of cocaine base [corrected]("crack") has emerged as a significant substance abuseproblem. A detailed characterization of cocaine smoke is aprerequisite for studies of its pharmacokinetics, abuse potentialand toxicity. Model pipes were used to generate cocaine smokeanalogous to that inhaled by human "crack" abusers.Using procedures to minimize pyrolysis, cocaine base smoke wasdetermined to be 93.5% cocaine particles with the remainder beingcocaine vapor. The average particle size generated from all modelpipes was 2.3 mu which is small enough to ensure deposition intothe alveolar region of the human lung. Although this particlesize is eminently respirable [corrected] by primates, a muchsmaller fraction will reach the alveolar region of rodents.Special generating procedures would therefore be required toexpose rodents to meaningful doses of airborne cocaine that mimicthe rapid absorption achieved by "crack" smokers. .

K. Chen, who was looking for asubstitute for Adrenalin as an antiathsmatic. Chen was curiousabout Chinese herbal medicine, in particular ma huang. He andother Lilly chemists quickly isolated ephedrine, and verifiedthat it widened bronchial passages. Since Adrenalin couldn't betaken orally, and had a hell of a side-effect ephedrine seemedvastly preferable. The rarity of ma huang quickly sent chemistsscrambling for a synthetic ephedrine, and sometime in the 30's,one of them stumbled on Amphetamine. Amphetamine was also a bronchiodilator, and could be inhaleddirectly, delivering the relief within seconds. It was marketedunder the name Benzedrine and quickly became a legal, over thecounter, recreational drug. ..from a 1937 Journal of the American Medical Association "Benzedrine Tablets were used at the department forPsychology at the University of Minnesota to study ... effects onhuman thought. It was found that the substance increasedalertness...

Winston Churchill in hisyouth did it, and millions of peasant farmers in South America doit. So why not allow it in America? Why not let people chew on low-potency cocaine lozenges orgum? "Millions have used these products, and we have noevidence of harm associated with it," says Ethan Nadelmann,a professor at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School ofInternational and Public Affairs. "It may be less addictivethan coffee." Nadelmann and others who advocate changing the government'szero-tolerance approach to drugs want to create a weakenedversion of cocaine that could be sold over the counter as asubstitute for the hard stuff. Then potential consumers would have an alternative to crackcocaine, which is smoked, and high-purity regular cocaine, whichis snorted, the way beer and wine are alternatives to high-proofvodka. The idea of marketing cocaine-lite is not making muchhead-way at a time when the American public is fearful of crimeand when the crime bill moving through Congress is promising moreprisons and punishment for drug offenders. But raising the possibility of such a product goes to thecore of the debate over the best way to undercut criminal drugenterprises. Nadelmann and others argue that low-potency cocaine mightdraw potential customers away from drug-trafficking organizationssmuggling tons of cocaine from South America and violent streetgangs peddling crack. "If some people want to distill those products down tosomething more potent, let them," Nadelmann wrote in aneditorial with Rolling Stone Publisher Jann Wenner in the May 5issue of the magazine. "But most people won't want to buyit." However, Herbert Kleber, a psychiatrist and a White Houseanti-drug official in the Bush administration, says low-potencycocaine would not undercut criminal drug gangs because no onewould use it as an alternative. Now a vice president of Columbia University's Center onAddiction and Substance Abuse, Kleber calls the idea of a cocainesubstitute "scientifically naive," adding that it"totally misunderstands the reason why people use and misusedrugs." Kleber compares the temptation of low-potency cocaine for theuninitiated or the recovering addict with his experience inquitting smoking. "I smoked for 25 years and if i have just one, I'm backto two packs a day," he said. "It's the same withlow-dose cocaine." Dr. Andrew Weil of the University of Arizona medical schooldisagrees. He says the widespread chewing of coca leaves among Andeanpeasants suggests that, in low dosages, cocaine is not addictive. Weil also says that the product is good for treating stomachailments and motion sickness. "It's a shame that we've made disappear from our world aform of a drug that has a whole bunch of benefits," Weilsays. Watered-down cocaine was common in turn-of-the-centuryAmerica and Europe. Recently uncovered records in Scotlandsuggest that Queen Victoria and her young house guest, WinstonChurchill, consumed cocaine-filled lozenges for sore throats andother maladies contracted while staying at Balmoral Castle. At the same time, cocaine was an ingredient of Coca-Cola andseveral varieties of patent medicines sold in America. All thatchanged in 1914 with the Harrison Act, which banned cocainewithout a prescription. Drug-law defenders say cocaine was banned because it isdangerously addictive. "There are some genies you can't let out of thebottle," Kleber says. Low-potency cocaine differs from regular cocaine powder andcrack in terms of its purity level, and how fast and thoroughlyit alters brain chemistry. According to Weil, the coca leaf chewed by peasant farmers inBolivia and Peru is half of 1 percent pure cocaine. By contrast,cocaine smuggled in by traffickers is 50 percent to 60 percentpure. The effect of crack is even more intense because it is smokedand its chemicals reach the brain in seconds. Cocaine inhaledthrough the nose takes 30 minutes to be fully effective. Orallyingested cocaine in lozenges or gum takes an hour, according toKleber. John Gregich of the White House Office of National DrugControl Policy argues that "the notion you can create a safestimulant out of something as addictive as cocaine doesn't matchour experience." Still, the University of Arizona's Weil notes that decades oftough law enforcement measures against drug traffickers anddealers have "made worse what we want to make better,destroying the peasant society of South America and creating thecrack culture in American cities."

It was greatfun, and a very rewarding experience. In Guatamala I met an English guy named Nigel that had beenin Colombia. He said that he had traveled from England, going toBrazil, then through various countries, and ending up inColombia. Nigel told me that along the route he met locals thatbecame his friends, and often they used Cocaine. Nigel said he had been afraid of Cocaine, having been broughtup in the typical "drugs are bad" environment. He wasafraid that if he tried it he'd become addicted. Eventually hesaw that although his friends used it, they were not addicted. Hetried it, and he liked it. He told me that he used it daily for acouple of months. I asked him if it was hard to stop. He said itwasn't. Now I left him and I kept heading south. He told me of aplace called the Hotel Miramar in Santa Marta, Colombia. It'seast from Cartegena. He said it's a place where gringos can goand use cocaine, and not really be hassled. Somewhere along mytrip I decided I wanted to try cocaine if I had the opportunity. I made it to Colombia and ended up in Santa Marta. The HotelMiramar was a fantastic place because it's a gringo hangout. Myspanish was decent but I could never get close to the nativesbecause it was too cumbersome talking in their language, and veryfew Latins speak English. Colombia has a reputation of beingunsafe so not many tourists go there, so if you're travelingaround the country you feel like you're the only gringo. So it was nice to meet up with other travelers in the HotelMiramer. There were people that stayed there for months or years,and then the others that would come for just a day or two. Iended up staying there for a month. I was waiting for mail from home, and also I was enjoying thecompany of other travelers. During this time I tried cocaine, anddecided I liked it. I would snort the cocaine only. I'd typicallyuse it with other travellers, then a bunch of people would gettogether and just talk or hang out. I'd usually start using it inthe early evening, continue over about a 6 hour period, then I'dstop and go to sleep. I never used it as a pick-me-up in themorning. I got in the habit of only using it when I already feltpretty good. There were other people that used it a lotmore--they would keep going for more than a day or two. I thoughtthis was silly because even though you don't feel sleepy, youknow your body wants to sleep, and I didn't want to push it. Alsothere's not much point in using it for longer periods, as theeffect seems to diminish. I would build up a tolerance so that asthe time wore on I'd have to take it more and more frequently(over the 4 or 6 hour period in the evening). As I say, I'dusually be with other people when using it and we'd sometimes goout in the night for walks. While in the Hotel you feel perfectlysafe using it, it's not a good idea to carry it around town withyou--you never know. I figure that over the month I used the cocaine maybe 15 or20 times. I liked the feeling it gave me. It completelyeliminates any feelings of inhibition, so you feel comfortabletalking about anything. You also feel fascinated by what otherpeople are saying, although I would prefer to talk. You feelreally good, like the cocaine is tickling your pleasure center.You feel energetic. You wouldn't get hungry. After a month I decided that the surroundings were gettingstale, so I left to go to a neighboring beach called ParkTayrona. It's a really beautiful place and a lot of gringos hangout there as well. I didn't do any cocaine while here but Ididn't miss it either. There was no feeling of dependency. Cocaine was more of something you did when it seemed like agood idea-not because you felt you needed it. It was somethingthat you'd use when you're already having a good time--it wouldkick you up into the next level of enjoyment. There was immeasurable pot available also in Colombia. I usedto smoke a little but didn't really smoke enough to get over themunchy/can't concentrate stage. Other people constantly smokedthe stuff. I never really understood the allure. I figured thatthe best time to use it was when you were hungry and wanted thelocal food to taste like a king's banquet :^). The only problems I had with the cocaine was frequent pain inmy nose. I was told this was because it wasn't pure, or that itwas amphetamine and not cocaine. Over my trip I tried cocainemany more times and it seemed always a variable experience,depending on where I got it. Also my opinion of what"good" cocaine was never matched anyone else's. One guygave me some of what he said was the best he had ever used in hislife, and it had no effect at all on me. I later decided thatwhat I had called cocaine before was some kind of amphetamine,and what this guy called cocaine was really cocaine (pure), andthat for some reason it didn't work on me. This guy used to smokeit also (freebasing) and I tried that several times but neveronce had any significant effect, although he was flying. Afterseveral times when someone would tell me "try this, this isthe best" and it did nothing for me, I decided that thesubstance I had liked before was no longer available and Istopped testing. At no time did I ever feel any withdrawal symptoms. Also Inever used it every single day--I would stop for a day or twoafter each day or two of use. And I never used it for a periodlonger than 6 hours. I feel my experience with the drug hasn'tbeen harmful at all. Instead it destroyed a lot of myths I hadabsorbed in the United States culture. I learned that thesubstance had absolutely no addictive qualities at all. Then I decided that the biggest problem was since it wasillegal down there as well (at least if you got caught you'd haveto pay a bribe to make the cop go away) you never knew"exactly" what you were getting. The danger of the drugwas never the pure part but what you ended up getting that wascalled "cocaine". I believe my experience with thecocaine has improved me, and I believe everyone (provided they'readults) should have the same option to experiment. The onlyimprovement I could suggest would be fixing the situation so youknow what you're getting every time, instead of it being a crapshoot. Since Colombia is the source of this stuff, it's certainlygoing to be cheaper. I never paid more than $4 or $5 a gram, andtypically paid $3. Of course I believe it wasn't quite as pure because I'd use agram over an evening, and from what I've heard about stuff in USthat's A LOT. Since Colombia I've never used any of the stuff. Mythinking is I've heard prices in the US are $100 per gram. At thetime I was taking it I felt that it was barely worth the $4 agram. There's no way I'll pay 25 or 33 times what I could get itfor down there. Pot was also much cheaper. I saw a guy buy perhaps a halfpound for something like $7.00. It's truly a weed, and isn'treally illegal. Pot is so cheap you never have to buy it--it justgets passed around by people that keep their own supply. Wages in Colombia are so low compared to wages here, thelocals have to pay almost the same proportion of their income tobuy cocaine as Americans would have to in the US. I never reallysaw any evidence of massive drug addiction in Colombia. Almost100% of the drug use seemed to be by the gringos that werevisiting. I've decided that I believe drugs should be legalized. Ibelieve that we've all been victims of a horrible propagandacampaign. I believe it would be much better if drugs werelegalized, regulated (for purity), and also perhaps taxed alittle to cover costs of chronic abusers. I believe it is a goodidea to travel, because you find out interesting things, likeperhaps the USA isn't really as free as you might have thought.In Colombia the police don't really care if you use illegalsubstances--they just use it as an excuse to sweat a bribe out ofyou. They're not interested in throwing you in jail, they justwant some of your yanqui $$$. Yes, the system is very, verycorrupt. Colombians were probably my favorite people. The country isbeautiful and the people are very friendly. Although Colombia hasgotten a bad rap in the news, this is unjust. While a few drugkingpins control a lot of the politics in the country and areruthless murderers, the Colombian people are almost entirely verywarm, intelligent, friendly people. It is truly a great country. When I came back up through Mexico and went through theborder crossing at Tijuana, I told the officer that I had justflown up from Cartegena, Colombia. He then checked me out alittle more thoroughly than he would have if I'd only been inMexico--he checked my drivers licence and then looked at mybackpack in the xray machine. I don't think he had me unpack it.But the guy said that Colombia wasn't a good place, and thepeople were screwing us over. His statement simply is not at alltrue. One other interesting point: As I understand it if I'moutside the US I am no longer bound by US laws, but must obey thelaws of the country I'm in--but that country enforces them andthe US doesn't care anymore. I was told by Germans that theirlaws are binding on them no matter where they are. For example ifthey get caught in Colombia using drugs and are punished there,the Colombian government will inform the German government, andsend them home, and when they get to Germany the Germangovernment will then punish them again. I thought this wasridiculous. -- David Ashley dash@netcom.com Returnto Cliff Schaffer's Home Page WT01-B37-57IA087-000625-B015-49http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/cocaine/addhyp.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122042818 text/html 75818HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:28:08 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Saturday, 28-Dec-96 06:32:09 GMTContent-length: 75600 Cocaine Addiction -- Self Medication Hypothesis Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Cocaine and related drugs The Self MedicationHypothesis: ADHD & Chronic Cocaine Abuse A Literature Review By Daniela Plume B.A / April, 1995 TABLE of CONTENTS: Introduction SelfMedication Hypothesis: A Brief Overview CocaineAbuse: The Self Medication Hypothesis Sub-Types of CocaineUsers AttentionDeficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) & Cocaine Abuse: Attention DeficitHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Epidemiology DiagnosticCriteria Genetic Factors DiathesisStress theory & Outcome Studies Comorbid disorders Cocaine Abuse: A Brief Historyand Epidemiology ADHD inCocaine Abusing Populations Characteristicsof Substance Abusers with ADHD DiagnosticIssues: RetrospectiveDiagnoses & Confounding Variables ADHD,Anti-socialpersonality disorder & Conduct disorder CausalRelationship between Substance Abuse and Psychopathy Non-SpecificConfounding Variables: the 3rd Variable Problem MethodologicalIssues Criticisms of theSelf Medication Hypothesis More on the SelfMedication Hypothesis, ADHD, & Chronic Cocaine Abuse Case Studies The DuelDiagnosis: ADHD & Substance Abuse Ritalin AbuseConcerns Conclusions Bibliography Introduction Historically, drug and alcohol dependencies have beenattributed to sin, disease, maladaptive, self destructive, andantisocial behavioral patterns. Addicted substance abusers havefrequently been charged with poor motivation, lack of insight,escapism, and the development of self destructive tendencies.Khantzian (1985a) asserts these allegations stem from archaicmodels of therapy and rigid attitudes as to which paradigm bestjustifies substance abuse and subsequent treatment modalities.Many clinicians still hold that psychotropic medication forcoexisting pathology should not be administered until the patienthas attained abstinence for at least one year. However,coexisting disorders should be addressed concurrently, notignored until abstinence has been consolidated (Weiss &Colins, 1992; Zweben & Smith, 1989). Various studies have indicated a high degree of coexistingpsychopathology amongst both adolescent and adult substanceabusers. The most frequently seen include affective disorders(Dilsaver, 1987; Gawin & Ellinwood, Jr., 1988; Weiss, Mirin,Michael, & Sollogub, 1986), borderline personality disorder(Blume, 1989; Bukstein et al., Brent & Kaminer, 1989),antisocial personality disorder (Kleinman, Miller, Millman,Woody, Todd, Kemp, & Lipton, 1990), depression (Dorus &Senay, 1984; Kleinman et al., 1990; Lemere & Smith, 1990),anxiety disorders (Bukstein, 1989; Weiss & Rosenburg, 1985),conduct disorder (Dimilio, 1989; Milin, Halikas, Meller, &Morse, 1991), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder(Carroll & Rounsaville, 1993; Dimilio, 1989; Milin et al.,1991; Wilens, Biederman, Mick, & Faraone, 1995). Given the prevalence of comorbid psychopathy in substanceabusers observed in both clinical and treatment settings,Khantzian (1985b) postulated a theoretical model of selfmedication; a concept first raised by Freud (1884) upon notinganti-depressant properties of cocaine. Back To: Table of Contents The Self Medication Hypothesis: ABrief Overview On the basis of psychodynamic/psychiatric diagnostic findingsand clinical observations, Khantzian (1985b) proposed a model ofself medication as an etiological factor in substance abuse. Hesuggested psychotropic drug effects interact with psychiatricdisturbances and "painful affect states" to predisposesome individuals to addictive disorders. The addict's choice ofdrug is thought to be the result of the interaction between thepsychopharmacologic properties of the drug and the "primaryfeeling states" experienced. In this way, the drug effect isthought to substitute for defective or non-existent egomechanisms of defense (Khantzian, 1985b). A number of clinicalfindings have supported the hypothesis that the preference for aspecific drug is not random, but rather, appears to be a processof "self selection" (Dorus & Senay, 1980; Khantzian& Treece, 1985; Rounsaville, Weissman, Crits-Cristoph,Wilbur, & Kleber, 1982; Weissman, Slobetz, & Prusoff,1976; Wurmser, 1974; and others). This course of self selectionhas also been referred to as "preferential drug use"(Milkman & Frosch, 1973) and "the drug of choice"phenomenon (Wieder & Kaplan, 1969). Back To: Table of Contents Cocaine Abuse: The SelfMedication Hypothesis Cocaine is thought to help overcome fatigue and alleviatedepression in some depressed individuals (Freud, 1884; Schnoll,Daghestani, & Hansen, 1984; Khantzian, 1975), increasefeelings of self esteem, assertiveness, and frustration tolerance(Weider & Kaplan, 1969), overcome boredom and emptiness(Wurmser, 1974), and alleviate impulsive/hyperactive states inattention-deficit disordered individuals (Weiss, & Mirin,1986; Zweben & Smith, 1989, and others). Cyclical mooddisorders (manic depressive illness, cyclothymic disorders) havebeen shown to be more common in cocaine abusers than opiateaddicts (20 % vs 1%), suggesting such persons may preferentiallyselect stimulants over other illicit substances of abuse (Gawin& Ellinwood, Jr., 1988). Cocaine is a CNS stimulant withpharmacological properties similar to the stimulant medicationsRitalin�, Cylert�, and Dexedrine� that are commonly used totreat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Thus, it isthought that individuals with untreated ADHD may be using cocaineto "self medicate" these disease symptoms (Hallowell& Ratey, 1994; Milin, 1995; Weiss, et al., 1986). Back To: Table of Contents Sub-Types of Cocaine Abusers: On the basis of clinical observations, Khantzian (1984;Khantzian & Khantzian, 1984) proposed four categories or"subtypes" to explain how psychiatric/psychologicalfactors might predispose an individual to become and remaindependent on cocaine. These include pre-existent chronicdepression (dysthymic disorder), cocaine abstinence depression,hyperactive/restless/emotional lability syndromes, orattention-deficit disorder, and cyclothymic or bipolar illness.Other researchers have also speculated that individuals withchronic depression may value the euphorigenic effects of cocaine,whereas cyclothymic and bipolar disordered patients may usecocaine to maintain a hypomanic state and fend off depression(Lemere & Smith, 1990). Interestingly, individuals with ADHDfrequently report a paradoxically placid response to cocaine aswell as temporary relief from hyperactive symptoms (Cocores,Davies, Mueller, & Gold, 1987; Gawin & Kleber, 1986;Hallowell & Ratey, 1994; Khantzian, 1984; Weiss & Mirin,1986; Zweben & Smith 1989). Psychiatric disorders, particularly the affective disorders,are believed to increase susceptibility to stimulant abuse (Gawin& Kleber, 1986). In two unrelated studies, Weiss, et al.,(1986) and Gawin and Kleber (1986), each reported 50% ofinpatient cocaine abusers to have met the diagnostic criteria formood disorders. A number of researchers have also noted patientswith attention deficit disorders to be over-represented amongthose undergoing treatment for cocaine abuse (Cavanagh, Clifford,& Gregory., 1989; Khantzian, 1985b; Milin et al., 1991). Back To: Table of Contents Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD)& Cocaine Abuse: Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder:(ADHD) Epidemiology: Incidences of ADHD in adults have not been recognized untilrecently. In 1978, Leopold Bellack chaired a conference whichfocused on adult forms of ADHD, known then as "minimal braindysfunction". It would take more than 10 years before theclinical significance of ADHD in adulthood would be established(Hallowell & Ratey, 1994). It had previously been assumedthat children outgrew ADHD symptoms by adolescence. Recentstudies, however, have reported that upwards to 50-60% ofchildren with ADHD continue to experience residual or full blownmanifestations of this disorder in later life (Biederman,Faraone, Spencer, Wilens, Norman, et al., 1993; Gittleman,Mannuzza, Shenker, & Bonagur, 1985; Weiss & Hechtman,1986). In one such study, over 70% of children with ADHD werefound to have met criteria for the disorder in adolescence(Barkley et al., 1990). ADHD has also been shown to be moreprevalent in males than females by ratios ranging from 2:1 forgeneral populations, to 9:1 for clinics (Biederman et al., 1993;Kaplan & Sadock, 1991). ADHD is seen across a wide range ofcultures, although the incidence rates vary. This is thought toreflect differing diagnostic practices (American PsychiatricAssociation, 1994). There is also some evidence that ADHD occursmore frequently in lower socioeconomic groups (Biederman et al.,1993). Back To: Table of Contents Diagnostic Criteria: In accordance with the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria (APA, 1994),behavioral manifestations of ADHD must be seen before the age of7 and must clearly interfere with social and academic functioning(and in later life, occupational functioning). Previously, ADHDwas considered to be a single disorder comprised of three maincomponents: short attention span, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.A diagnosis of ADHD required meeting 8 of 14 criteria, such as, failsto listen, interrupts frequently, and fidgets or movesexcessively (Kaplan & Sadock, 1991). The terms"minimal brain dysfunction", "learningdisabilities", "hyperkinetic syndrome", and"hyperactivity" have all been used to reflect thispattern of overactivity, short attention span, and learningproblems (Ralph & Barr, 1989). The symptoms described in theDSM-III-R represented behaviors believed by many to be common tochildren in general, thus, the DSM-IV has returned to an earliersubgrouping system for ADHD diagnosis; separating those childrenwith both attentional deficits and hyperactivity (Davison &Neale, 1994 p.429). The DSM-IV presently recognizes three distinct classificationsof ADHD, with a clear delineation between ADHD combinedtype (requiring 6 of 9 criterion to be met in both theinattention and the hyperactivity/impulsivity categories), ADHD-PredominantlyInattentive Type (which requires 6of 9 criterion to be met in the inattentive category and lessthan 6 for hyperactivity), and ADHD-PredominantlyHyperactive Type (which requires 6 of 9 criterion to bemet for the hyperactivity category and less than 6 forinattention). As a requisite to diagnosis for all three of thesecategories, behavior must persist for at least 6 months (APA,1994). Back To: Table of Contents Genetic Factors: ADHD appears to have a strong genetic component and is seenmore frequently in first degree biological relatives (APA, 1994;Kaplan & Sadock, 1991). Goodman and Stevenson (1989) foundconcordance for clinically diagnosed hyperactivity in 51% ofidentical twins and 33% of fraternal twins. Adoption studies havealso shown strong support for a genetic constituent (Morrison& Stewart, 1973; Wender, Reimherr, &, Wood, 1981). Back To: Table of Contents Diathesis-Stress Theory &Outcome Studies: Weiss, Minde, and Werry (1971) conducted a 5 year prospectivefollow-up study of 91 subjects aged 10-18 years. They foundadolescents with ADHD tended to have lower self esteem, and mostcontinued to be distractible, impulsive, and emotionally immaturewhen compared with controls matched for age, sex, IQ, and socialclass. The results of this study suggest three main"outcomes" of childhood ADHD: individuals with ADHD whofunction normally in adulthood, individuals who as adultscontinue to have problems with concentration, irrationality,anxiety, and who experience general difficulties in work andpersonal life (most fall into this group), and those who developserious psychiatric and/or antisocial pathology, and mayexperience extreme depression, suicidal tendencies, becomeheavily involved with drugs and/or alcohol, and exhibitantisocial behavior. Outcome studies may aid in explaining whymany individuals with ADHD are successful in later adult life andconversely, why all individuals with ADHD do not developsubstance abuse problems. Research has strongly suggested thatchildren with both attentional deficits andhyperactivity (combined type) are most at risk to develop conductproblems, oppositional behavior, and other severe problems inlater life (Barkely, DuPaul, & McMurray, 1990). Bettleheim (1973) proposed a diathesis-stress theory toexplain the development of ADHD; suggesting that certain criticalfactors impinge on a child's life, which may in turn become acatalyst for the development of ADHD in those geneticallypredisposed. Studies employing multivariate stepwise regressiontechniques have identified a number of factors thought to predictadult outcome of children with ADHD (Hechtman, 1991; Hechtman,Weiss, Perlman, & Amsel, 1984). These potential predictorsinclude: factors specific to the individual child (health,temperament, intelligence, and psychological factors),characteristics of the family (socioeconomic status,emotional/psychological, and family composition), and the largersocial environment. All three of these areas have been shown tocontribute significantly to a child's resiliency/vulnerability. Children with fewer health problems either during pregnancy,perinatelly, or during infancy, are shown to be less likely todevelop ADHD (Hechtman et al., 1984). Individual characteristicsof the child may also influence outcome, as IQ and temperamentcontribute to the development of quality relationships withothers. Bettleheim (1973) posited temperamental differencesbetween child and parents as one possible stressor which maypromote the development of the disorder in a predisposed child. Ahyperactive child may also elicit negative reactions from his/herparents and in turn become more disruptive. Weiss et al., (1971)found children with higher IQs and lower scores of hyperactivityto be more adaptable, socially responsive, and able to elicitpositive responses from their environment. Having an internallocus of control, a good sense of autonomy, and positive selfesteem have also been shown to contribute to resiliency.Generally, the better the ego strengths, the less likelihood ofdeveloping ADHD (Ralph & Barr, 1989). Khantzian (1984, 1985a)emphasized the importance of ego development as a majorcontributor in predisposing individuals to self medicating foruncomfortable or painful feeling states. Werner and Smith (1982) found resilient children to come fromhomes that were more cohesive and supportive, with morestructure, regularity, supervision, and clearly defined rules, aswell as realistic expectations of the child. Socioeconomic statusappears to be another strong predictor of ADHD in adolescents(Loney, Kramer, & Milich, 1981). Higher family social statusenables greater physical, social, and educational benefits;whereas lower status may place undue stress on both the child andthe family. Finally, the larger social and physical environmentcan provide a beneficial extra-familial support system throughschool and church as extended family (Werner & Smith, 1982;Rutter, 1979). In one long term prospective follow-up study ofyoung adults with ADHD, when asked what had been most beneficialto them while growing up, the most common answer was havingsomeone in their lives who believed in them (Weiss &Hechtman, 1986). Back To: Table of Contents Comorbid Disorders: ADHD is usually characterized by impulsivity, lack ofemotional control, attentional deficits, and learningdisabilities, however, there may be no single critical attributeof ADHD (Wender, 1979). In fact, many researchers have identifiedthe most frequently seen characteristics of individuals with ADHDto be irritability, emotional lability, explosive personality,violent dyscontrol, depression, low self esteem, anxiety, andaggression (Hallowell & Ratey, 1994; Kaplan & Sadock,1991; Ralph & Barr, 1989; Turnquist, Frances, Rosenfeld,& Mobrak, 1983; Wender et al., 1981). In one study,depression was seen to be the most common symptom associated withADHD (Heussy, Cohen, Blair, & Rood, 1979), while Weiss andMirin (1986) identified frequent occurrences of borderlinepersonality and antisocial personality disorders. ADHD in childhood is associated with an increased frequency ofpsychopathology in later life (Wender, et al., 1981). Adults areseen to exhibit the same patterns as children with respect topsychiatric and cognitive features, as well as psychiatriccomorbidity. In childhood, ADHD frequently occurs with conductdisorder, antisocial personality disorder, oppositional defiancedisorder, and Tourette's syndrome (APA, 1994). Researchers haveconsistently found higher rates of antisocial personality,conduct, oppositional defiant, substance use, and anxietydisorders in adults with ADHD when compared to non-ADHD adults(Biederman et al., 1993; Carroll & Rounsaville, 1993). In onestudy, Gittleman et al., (1985) found conduct disorders in 48% ofadolescents with ADHD, in 13% of adolescents who had outgrownADHD, and in only 8% of controls without the disorder. In anotherstudy, Hinshaw (1987) reported a 30%-90% overlap between ADHD andconduct disorder. Incidences of major depression and anxietydisorders in childhood (which often persist into adulthood) havebeen documented as well (Hechtman et al., 1984). Adoption studies have indicated genetic origins associatedwith an increased risk of substance use, antisocial personality,and somatoform disorders in later adult life (APA, 1994; Morrison& Stewart, 1973; Cantwell, 1975). Higher rates of affectivedisorders have been noted in first degree relatives of cocaineabusers (Weiss & Mirin, 1986). Some studies have observed asmuch as 25% of children with family pathology to havesignificantly higher ratings of antisocial and aggressivebehaviors (Hinshaw, 1987; Weiss, 1986). The existence ofpsychopathology in the family of origin then, appears to be asignificant risk factor for substance abuse. A significant number of attentional disordered individualshave shown serious delinquent and psychological outcomes, andhave been shown to be at risk for chemical dependence (Clopton,Weddige, Contreras, Fliszar & Arrendondo, 1993; DeMilio,1989, Gittelman, Mannuzza, Shenker, & Bonagur, 1985; Milin etal., 1991; Wilens, et al., 1995). One study reported a lifetimeprevalence of between 15% - 18% for the substance use disorders,making them the "most common mental disorders in the generalpublic, especially amongst males" (Robins, Helzer, Weissman,Orvaschel, Gruenberg, Burke, & Reiger, 1984). Finally, Milinet al., (1991) noted the severity of substance abusing behaviorto be greater in the presence of a coexistent psychiatricdisorder. Hechtman, Weiss, and Perlman (1984) compared a clinical groupof 75 subjects (male and female) who had been diagnosed inchildhood as hyperactive, with 44 matched controls in a ten yearprospective follow-up study. They found a tendency foradolescents with ADHD to have greater drug use (75% vs 5%), andwere more likely to have experienced a period of dependency orabuse during the five years preceding evaluation. This differencewas seen to level out over the year following the study, perhapsindicating the attainment of similar levels of moral development.Gittleman and colleagues (1985) studied 101 adolescent males aged16-23 years. They found substance abuse disorders in 28% ofpatients with ADHD, 8% of ADHD children who no longer showedsymptoms in adolescence, and in only 3% of controls who had neverexhibited ADHD symptoms. Back To: Table of Contents Cocaine Abuse: A Brief History and Epidemiology: In the 1890's cocaine was considered safe. Use escalated butthen abated as serious problems were noted. This pattern wasrepeated in the 1920's, early 1950's, and again in the late1960's. Believing cocaine to be non-addictive, millions of peopletried it and abuse exploded. In fact, the Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders did not recognize cocaineas an addictive substance until the DSM-III-R was released in1980 (Kaplan & Sadock, 1992). In 1974 it was estimated that5.4 million Americans had tried cocaine; in 1982 this figured hadrisen to 21.6 million. By 1985, the National Institute on DrugAbuse estimated 5.8 million Americans abused cocaine regularly.This figure dropped in 1988, to an estimated 2.9 million abusersand a reported 1.6 million in 1990, with males out-numberingfemale users 2:1 (Kaplan & Sadock, 1992). Back To: Table of Contents ADHD in Cocaine AbusingPopulations: The relationship between cocaine dependence andattention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was first considered byKhantzian (1979) to be the possible extension or"augmentation" of a hyperactive, restless lifestyle bya select group of cocaine users. In recent years, ADHD has beenfrequently reported in cocaine abusing populations (Cavanagh, etal., 1989; Gawin, Riordan, & Kleber, 1985; Khantzian, 1983;Rounsaville et al., 1982; Weiss, Pope, & Mirin, 1985).Carroll and Rounsaville (1993) found 103 of 298 (35%) treatmentseeking cocaine addicts to have met the DSM-III-R criteria forADHD. In an assessment of 111 juvenile delinquents aged 11-17years, Milin and colleagues (1991) found attention-deficitdisorder with hyperactivity in 23% of the substance abusers andin no cases of the non-substance abusing sample; with 50% of theadolescents with ADHD indicating a preference for cocaine. Characteristics of SubstanceAbusers with ADHD: Cocaine abusers with ADHD tend to be younger at the time offirst treatment, and report more severe and frequent substanceuse, earlier onset of cocaine abuse, and more previous treatmentattempts (Carroll & Rounsaville, 1993). In one study,hyperactive adolescents were seen to be significantly youngerthan controls when they started, at the point of heaviest use,and when they stopped using cocaine (Hechtman, Weiss, &Perlman, 1984). Incidences of ADHD within treatment settings havealso been observed to be greater for male than female patients(Everett, Schaffer, & Parsons, 1988). Carroll and Rounsaville(1993) reported 78% male vs 23% female attentional disorderedtreatment seeking cocaine abusers in one treatment study, and asimilar ratio, 73% male vs 27% female was reported by Gawin andKleber (1985a). In work with chemically dependent adolescents, Ralph and Barr(1989) identified "explosive volatility" as a featureof ADHD behavior not usually included in the clinicaldescription. Individuals with ADHD in substance abuse treatmentsettings are often seen to be defiant, argumentative, verballyaggressive, and often verging on premature discharge fromtreatment facilities. This apparent escalation of negativebehaviors in patients with ADHD, is often attributed to theirhaving limited ego skills and resources to cope with lifestressors, as well as the additional stress placed on them by ahighly structured inpatient treatment setting (Ralph & Barr,1989). In studies comparing adolescents treated for ADHD withstimulant medications and adolescents without ADHD, treatment forADHD was seen to decrease the risk for future adult drug andalcohol use (Beck, Langford, MacKay, & Sum, 1975; Loney,Kramer, & Milich, 1981; Henker, Whalen, Bugental, &Barker, 1981). Adolescents appropriately treated for ADHD showedsimilar, and in some cases, less incidences of substance abusethan controls. Fewer studies comparing treated vs untreatedindividuals with ADHD have been conducted. In one such studyhowever, Kramer, Loney, & Whaley-Klahn (1981) found untreatedhyperactive boys tended towards greater drug use than thoseproperly treated for ADHD. Back To: Table of Contents Diagnostic Issues: Retrospective Diagnoses &Confounding Variables: The diagnostic criteria for ADHD in adults requires a historyof childhood ADHD; therefore, one major problem in determiningthe incidence of ADHD in adults is retrospective diagnosis. Ward,Wender, and Reimherr (1993) recently constructed the Wender-Utahrating scale (WURS) "in an attempt to surmount this problemof retrospectively establishing the childhood diagnosis of ADHDin adults." A "cutoff" score of 36 or higher onthe 61 item rating scale has been shown to accurately distinguish96% of individuals with ADHD from controls. The Utah criteria forADHD includes items of impulsivity, over-excitability, temperoutbursts, affective lability, stress intolerance, anddisorganization. Wender's diagnostic criteria for adults withADHD requires: a childhood history of attention deficits andhyperactivity with one of the following: problems in school,over-excitability, and temper outbursts, oran adult history of attention deficits and hyperactivity togetherwith two of the following: affective lability, explosive temper,stress intolerance, disorganization, and impulsivity.Individuals meeting other diagnoses such as schizophrenia,depressions, and borderline personality disorders, were excludedfrom test development studies. Back To: Table of Contents ADHD, Antisocial Personality Disorder,& Conduct Disorder: The Confounding Triad: The DSM does not purport closed or fixed categories. Indeed,ADHD itself does not appear to be a mutually exclusive categoryand has been seen to overlap significantly with oppositionaldefiant and conduct disorders (Demilio, 1989; Loney, 1988; Milin,et al., 1991; Ralph & Barr, 1989). Ward et al., (1993) foundseveral of the borderline personality disorder symptoms(affective lability, volatile temper, and impulsivity) to overlapwith ADHD as well. It would appear that although the DSM and theWender-Utah rating scale overlap, they may not necessarily targetthe same behaviors. For instance, the DSM does not acknowledgeemotional lability and volatile temper as components of ADHD,although many research studies have reported thesecharacteristics (Morrison, et al., 1973). As well, the Utahcriteria does not recognize ADHD without hyperactivity in itsdiagnosis. There is considerable disagreement as to what constitutes thedifferent diagnostic categories. Some researchers suggesthyperactivity and aggression are separate independent diagnosticcategories (Halikas, Meller, Morse, & Lyttle, 1990; Loney,1988); some feel they are intertwined (Faraone, Biederman,Keenan, & Tsuang, 1991; Printz, Connor, & Wilson, 1981),and others feel they are essentially the same thing (Quay, 1979). There has also been considerable disagreement as to which ofthe disorders is more likely to induce or contribute to latersubstance abuse problems. In substance abusing samples, ADHD wasfound in conjunction with conduct disorder and antisocialpersonality disorder (Carroll & Rounsaville, 1993; Gittlemanet al., 1985). Some researchers maintain that aggression orsociopathy, and not ADHD, is related to substance abuse (Halikaset al., 1990). However, Carroll and Rounsaville (1991) found ahigh incidence of ADHD in cocaine abusers that was not accountedfor by sociopathy. They also found notably more intense andearlier onset of cocaine abuse, irrespective of comorbidity withantisocial personality disorder. Finally, in a recent unpublishedstudy, Wilens, Biederman, Mick, and Faraone (1995) found ADHD byitself significantly increased the risk for substance usedisorders in adults, and even more so when compounded withantisocial, mood, and anxiety disorders. Back To: Table of Contents Causal Relationship betweenSubstance Abuse and Psychopathology: There is a difference between pre-existing (possiblypredisposing) personality disorders and coexistent disorders, orthose which may result out of the addiction itself. Meyer (1986)proposed five possible relationships between substance abuse andpsychopathology: the psychiatric disorder alters the course ofsubstance abuse, substance abuse alters the course of thepsychiatric disorder, psychiatric symptoms develop as a result ofsubstance abuse, psychopathology as a risk factor for substanceabuse, and substance abuse and psychopathology both originatingfrom a common vulnerability. Additionally, Bukstein et al.,(1989) suggest psychiatric disorders may contributenonspecifically to the severity and course of substance abuse byreducing treatment compliance. The issue of causality has been raised by many researchers whohave questioned the relationship between ADHD, anti-socialpersonality, conduct disorder, and substance abuse disorders.Weiss and Mirin (1986) suggest cocaine may be both a trigger forpsychological disorders and a form of self medication for them.Cocores et al., (1987) propose that ADHD may be reactivated bycocaine. Dackis and Gold (1985) hold that heavy cocaine use leadsto neurotransmitter changes and decreased dopamine secretion thatmay in turn, be mistaken for a depressive disorder. Still otherssuggest self medication and genetic predisposition as twoadditional possible explanations for the correlation betweensubstance abuse and psychopathology (Milin et al., 1991). A substantial number of adults presenting with ADHD symptomsmay also experience antisocial personality and conduct disordersas a residual of childhood ADHD. Gittleman et al., (1985) showedsubstance abuse to be more prevalent in adolescents diagnosed ashyperactive in childhood. Moreover, these researchers foundconduct disorder to have developed either before, or inconjunction with the onset of substance abuse. Depression, anxiety, and aggression have all been observed tooccur frequently in individuals with ADHD. Hechtman et al.,(1984) proposed that the incidences of lower self esteem anddepression frequently seen in follow-up studies of adolescentswith ADHD, may be the result of repeat frustrations at home andschool. Loney (1988) found high rates of aggression amongst ADHDadolescents, which she feels may predispose them toexperimentation with drugs as the major reason for theirover-representation in substance abuse samples. Anxiety,depression, and aggression (often associated with ADHD,adolescence, and substance abuse), have all been seen tofrequently occur prior to the onset of substance abuse andrelated problems (APA, 1994). In a review of longitudinal studiesof high school and college boys, Kandel (1978) also found thatmany of the behaviors and psychological symptoms previouslythought to be a result of drug use, actually predated drug use. Chemical dependency typically involves a noticeable decline inachievement motivation, as well as depressive and impulsivebehaviors. These behaviors largely subside with the cessation ofsubstance abusing behavior. The diagnosis of ADHD in chemicaldependency presents a particular challenge, as ADHD symptomologyincludes impulsiveness, inattention, and overactivity, andtherefore may be under-diagnosed if these symptoms are attributedto the chemical dependency alone (Ralph & Barr, 1989). Other diagnostic categories may also invite confusion. Forinstance, chemically dependent individuals with severe ADHD inconjunction with oppositional features may be mistaken as havingbipolar disorder (Casat, 1982; Cocores, Patel, Gold, &Pottash, 1987; Ralph & Barr, 1989). Dr. Edward Hallowell(1994) a psychiatrist specializing in ADHD (who has also beendiagnosed with the disorder) has noted a tendency for individualswith ADHD to often be incorrectly diagnosed as manic depressive.This he feels, is due to the tendency for individuals with ADHDto sometimes exhibit highly agitated behaviors which can befollowed by a depressive period. Mania however, can bedistinguished from highly active ADHD behaviors, by the sheerintensity of the manic episode and the "pressuredspeech" which is commonly associated with the manic phase ofbipolar illness. Furthermore, lithium, commonly used with bipolarillness, does not help those with ADHD. Many individuals withADHD may also be incorrectly diagnosed with borderline, conduct,antisocial personality, and oppositional defiance disorders.These individuals may meet the "technical requirements"for such diagnoses, but respond favorably to treatments specificto ADHD (Hallowell & Ratey, 1994). Confusion is also possiblewith schizophrenic disorders, as adolescents with ADHD mayexhibit a rapid, impulsive, poorly organized thinking styletypical of schizophrenoform disorders. Finally, ADHD may also bemistaken for anxiety disorders that occur frequently duringadolescence (Ralph & Barr, 1989). Stofflymayr, Benishek, Humphries, Lee, and Mavis (1989) agreethat many chemically dependent persons meet criteria for morethan one psychiatric diagnosis and that dual diagnosis indicatespoorer prognosis, however, they feel these findings do notjustify the inference that the additional psychiatric diagnosiscaused the addiction problem. They feel instead, that patientsranking high in psychiatric problems also function poorly in manyother areas of life; they have a poor prognosis even without theadditional psychiatric diagnosis. Back To: Table of Contents Non-Specific Confounding Variables: The 3rd Variable Problem: The issues surrounding the question of whether ADHD causes,potentiates, or predisposes to substance abuse, particularlycocaine abuse, is still under investigation. Compounding thisquery are the differing diagnostic measures used and thecomorbidity of other psychopathologic diagnoses in conjunctionwith ADHD and substance abuse (as previously discussed). Afurther quandary, is the possibility of the third variable, afactor unrelated to both ADHD and substance abuse that mayinfluence outcome. For instance, a treatment seeking bias mayexist making those presenting for treatment different somehowfrom non-treatment seeking individuals. Lower social status, seenmore frequently in ADHD populations (Biederman et al., 1993) maycontribute nonspecifically to both ADHD and substance abuse.Gender appears to have a strong relationship to both ADHD andsubstance abuse, with more males than females seen in treatmentprograms for substance abuse, and males out numbering females inincidence rates for ADHD. A number of studies have also indicatedage to be a possible contributing factor as well. Adolescentswith ADHD are commonly seen to use drugs and alcohol earlier thannon-ADHD adolescents. In one study comparing juvenile delinquentadolescents, Milin et al., (1991) found non-substance abusers tohave the oldest mean age for first use of substances and also theleast pathology. Carroll and Rounsaville (1993) found 25.3 yearsto be the mean age for treatment-seeking cocaine addicts withADHD and 28.5 years for those without ADHD. These researchersalso observed ADHD to be more common in white cocaine abusers,indicating that race and ethnicity may also be importantcontributing factors as well. Finally, personal characteristics or individual temperamentaltraits may contribute to the development of ADHD and substanceabusing behavior. Many factors seen in conjunction with ADHD,such as thrill-seeking behaviors, a need for high levels (and insome cases lower levels) of stimulation, or an individual'sinability to cope with stress may play an important role in theconnection between ADHD and cocaine abuse. Back To: Table of Contents Methodological Issues: There has been a tendency for earlier investigators toindicate there is little or no increased risk for individualswith ADHD to develop later substance abuse disorders. Loney(1988) noted that many of these studies typically looked at youngpeople ranging from 9 to 23 years. This age difference mayactually reflect the different developmental stages of theindividuals within the sample itself. Furthermore, the age rangemakes it difficult to generalize from these samples, as fewsubjects were actually old enough to be exposed to a full rangeof drugs or to generate a pattern of serious abuse. In one study,33 of 95 adolescents with ADHD had tried marijuana with only 70knowing of someone who used marijuana, and only 50 individualsreporting ever having the opportunity to smoke it (Hechtman etal., 1984). These earlier studies were concerned with establishing thelong term effects of stimulant medications on individuals withADHD. They frequently compared adolescents treated for ADHD toadolescents without the disorder. Those individuals who receivedstimulant medications as treatment for childhood ADHD were foundto have similar or less incidences of subsequent substance usethan controls (Henker, et al., 1981). Some researchers havesuggested of these findings, that ADHD was not found to be a riskfactor for later substance abuse (Weiss & Hechtman, 1992). Tomake this assertion however, it is necessary to examine bothtreated and untreated individuals with ADHD. Often, studies using hospitalized substance abusers have basedtheir findings on assessments made soon after admission. Buksteinet al., (1989) consider the timing of diagnosis to be crucial indetermining whether psychiatric symptoms were produced by thesubstance abuse or preceded them. These researchers also notethat the assessment of ADHD relies exclusively on retroactivestudies, and are therefore limited by the lack of appropriatecontrol or comparison groups, and also by the reliance on one'smemory of childhood and adolescence. Back To: Table of Contents Criticisms of the Self MedicationHypothesis Dackis and Gold (1984, 1985) assert that depression in cocaineaddicts is a direct result of abstinence symptomology encouragingincreased cocaine use, which in turn results in alterations inbrain chemistry (dopamine depletion). They conclude that theaddiction itself is the cause of painful emotional states. Thereis however, sufficient evidence suggesting that manypsychopathologies, including depression, occur prior to substanceabusing behavior, especially in childhood diagnosed ADHD. Whilethis model addresses the potent euphorogenic properties ofcocaine and its powerful reinforcing effects (both negative andpositive), it does not explain the paradoxical calming effect ofcocaine on individuals with ADHD. Cocores et al., (1987) also advance a dopamine deficiencyhypothesis to better account for the correlation between ADHD andchronic cocaine abuse. Cocaine is believed to deplete dopamine inalready dopamine compromised individuals. The resultant dopaminedeficiency may then induce a temporary and reversible ADHD (evenin those without a history of ADHD). There appears, however, tobe more evidence suggesting ADHD predisposes to substance abuse,rather than is reactivated by cocaine, as ADHD has been shown topersevere in more than half of all adults with this childhooddiagnosis. Cocores and colleagues (1987) hypothesized that sincepatients with ADHD respond to dopamine agonists such as thoseused to treat ADHD, bromocriptine might also reduce cocainecravings, as it too is a dopamine agonist. They report onesubject's restlessness and concentration to have improved aftertwo days and another patient to have shown a "markedimprovement" by the third day of bromocriptine trials.However, this study left many unanswered questions such as: Whatis "marked improvement"? Did the medication in factreduce cocaine cravings? What happened after the initial 2-3 daysof treatment? Did bromocriptine effectively treat the ADHDsymptoms, and finally, did the patients successfully achieveabstinence? Cavanagh et al., (1989) employed a double-blindresearch design to test the effectiveness of bromocriptine. Whilethe typical response to stimulant medication used in treatingindividuals with ADHD does in fact suggest an underlyingdopaminergic activity (Wender, 1979), the use of the dopaminereceptor agonist bromocriptine was not found to be effective(Cavanagh et al., 1989). There has been some concern that the stimulant medicationsused in treating ADHD causes or exacerbates subsequent substanceabuse (particularly cocaine and stimulant abuse). However, thereis no evidence supporting this notion, and a number ofstudies have indicated the opposite - that properly medicated,individuals with ADHD have a reduced risk of future substanceabuse (Beck et al., 1975; Loney et al., 1981; Henker et al.,1981). In fact, 10 and 15 year follow-up studies of adolescentswith ADHD showed no significant differences between appropriatelymedicated adolescents and controls for incidence of substanceabuse (Hechtman, Weiss, Perlman et al., 1984; Hechtman &Weiss, 1986). Crowley (1984) advocates non-pharmacologic-behavioralmodification treatments for substance abuse. In one study, hereported treating 67 outpatients with 32 individuals agreeing toa contingency contract. Crowley reported that over 90% remainedabstinent and in treatment at a 3 month follow-up. As furtherevidence of the success of this treatment, Crowley stated"one of our rather successful patients reported having used45g/week pure cocaine diverted from medical sources."However, it is unclear as to what constitutes"success". Contrary to the reported success of thisstudy, half of Crowley's patients were found to have relapsedfollowing the completion of the 3 month treatment/contract(Crowley, 1982; Kleber & Gawin, 1984a). 52% of Crowley'ssample (35 of 67) refused to take part in the contract portionand instead were treated with psychotherapy. Of these 35 whodeclined the contingency contracts, 90% dropped out or relapsedwithin 2-4 weeks. Kleber and Gawin (1984a) raised questions as tothe ethical nature of Crowley's study as it was based entirely onnegative reinforcement. The therapist held a letter, written inadvance by the participant, with the understanding that it wouldbe mailed if the participant relapsed or missed a urinescreening. The letter contained information that would causeirrevocable life-altering consequences, such as an admission ofsubstance abuse to an employer or professional licensing board. Clopton, et al., (1993) declared patients with personalitydisorders to be just as likely to maintain abstinence andcomplete aftercare programs for substance abuse than patientswithout personality disorders. Of 91 patients (18 withpersonality disorder, 24 with traits of personality disorder, and49 with no personality disorder), 27 did not complete the initialfirst phase. Of the 64 who completed both the inpatient andaftercare programs, 38 (59%) maintained abstinence while 26 (41%)did not. These investigators found no significant differencesbetween those who were in the personality disordered group andthe no-personality disorder group. The results of this studyhowever, are inconclusive, as patients were retrospectively andarbitrarily grouped into three indistinct categories, leaving itunclear as to what personality disorders where considered.Further, There is no data available for the 27 individuals whodid not complete the first phase and subsequently did notparticipate in the aftercare program. These individuals may havediffered somehow from those remaining in treatment. Back To: Table of Contents More on the Self Medication Hypothesis, ADHD,& Chronic Cocaine Abuse: Khantzian (1986) asserts that the nature/nurture, psychologyvs biology arguments can work effectively together. He proposes aself medication hypothesis as a potentially useful heuristic toolfor further understanding substance abuse and dependence.Khantzian's theory of self medication, the notion thatindividuals choose specific psychoactive substances to alleviatepainful feelings, has been based entirely on non-blind,non-placebo, clinical observations. Empirical support comesinstead from laboratory studies, surveys and biological modelswhich have shown cocaine to increase the activity of dopamine andnorepinephrine in the central nervous system (Weiss, et al.,1986). Milkman and Frosch (1973) provided early evidence thatstimulant abusers and narcotic addicts preferentially sought theeffects of amphetamines and opiates respectively, to augment"preferred models of adaptation". Finally, severalresearchers have found cocaine abusers with ADHD to exhibit manyof the characteristics first identified in early observationalcase studies. Back To: Table of Contents Case Studies Many of the patients treated by Khantzian reported historiesof psychopathology which predated their cocaine and othersubstance use. Some of these patients expressed how cocainehelped them to "overcome their anergia, become mobilized,and able to perform tasks" (Khantzian, Gawin, Kleber &Riordan, 1984). A number of patients also reported how cocainehad a paradoxically calming effect on them. Khantzian worked withone patient who presented a childhood history suggestive of ADHDand who's chronic cocaine abuse was clearly endangering her life(2 oz intravenous cocaine per week). Her ADHD symptoms weretreated with the stimulant medication methlyphenidate (Ritalin�). This patient was presented two years after her initialtreatment as the case of "Mrs. B." (Khantzian, Gawin,Kleber, & Riordan, 1984). This case was first presented as aone year follow-up report (Khantzian, 1983). In the followingcase studies, the stabilizing properties of methylphenidate wereobserved over time while patients were in a doctor's care and/orin a hospital/treatment setting. Mrs. B began abusing amphetamines in the eighth grade. She had been prescribed methlyphenidate in her early twenties (for depression) and reported feeling productive and well. She had refrained from abusing all substances during this period. When her therapy ended, methylphenidate was discontinued and she reverted back to her previous amphetamine, and then later, cocaine abuse. Khantzian started her on 15 mg of methlyphenidate 3 times a day while still toxic after a 6 day cocaine binge that had ended only 5 hours prior to her therapy appointment. Within 24 hours, she began to experience normal sleep and appetite, and her mood was reported to have improved significantly. Most striking was the disappearance of cocaine cravings. She experienced one minor relapse in the first year and continued weekly therapy sessions. At the time of Khantzian's report (Khantzian et al., 1984) she had not used cocaine in over 2 years. Her ulcers were reported to have healed, her blood pressure and pulse remained normal, and urine screens had been consistently negative for cocaine and its principle metabolite benzaylecgonine. Mr. Y. suffered from cocaine abuse as well as obsessive and compulsive behaviors (Khantzian et al., 1984). He reported using 1/2 g cocaine daily plus weekly binges. Although he had been participating in an out-patient treatment program for 18 months, he continued to increase his cocaine use. Khantzian started him on 15 mg of methylphenidate 3 times daily, but lowered this dose at the patient's request, as he did not like the "high" he was experiencing at the higher dose. He was then switched to 10 mg every 2 hours. From the first day of treatment, he reported feeling more calm, relaxed, and purposeful. He stopped craving cocaine, lost his obsession with pornography and gambling, and at the time of Khantzian's report, had been abstinent from cocaine for 2 years. Family reports corroborated his discontinuation of cocaine as well as his appropriate use of medication. Mr. A. (Khantzian et al. 1984) was treated by Gawin, Kleber, and Riordan (the four researchers then shared their results). Mr. A. met the DSM-III criteria for ADHD. He had a volatile temper, low frustration tolerance, and was prone to heated and impulsive arguments which frequently resulted in physical violence. He reported that cocaine enabled him to feel "normal"; facilitating impulse control, decreasing anxiety, increasing the organization of thoughts, and providing a sedation effect. Mr. A. preferred to use cocaine alone and reported using cocaine in anticipation of stressful events. He had five previous attempts at treatment, all unsuccessful, and was unable to remain cocaine-free even during the 24 hours before testing. He was started on methlyphenidate and within 3 days experienced an alleviation of ADHD symptoms as well as cocaine cravings. Although he experienced slight gastrointestinal discomfort, this decreased over the next five days. During the first week of treatment, his cocaine use decreased from 10 grams per week to 2.5 grams (he had missed one methlyphenidate dose and stayed up too late on another day, both of these days he resorted to using cocaine with friends). A fifth daily dose of methlyphenidate was added and his cocaine use decreased to 1.5 grams during the second week. He then requested that he be allowed to double his dose on evenings that he socialized to help him resist cocaine use with his friends. He was raised to 60 mg/day 2 days week and 50 mg/day the remainder of week. At the time of this report, he was cocaine free for over two years (verified by urine testing and family reports) and had gained successful employment. Weiss, Pope, and Mirin (1985) presented 2 additional casestudies of individuals with chronic cocaine abuse and ADHDsymptoms. Both individuals reported that cocaine facilitatedconcentration and helped them to control impulsive behavior andthoughts. All previous forms of medication and therapy hadfailed. Both were put on pemoline, experienced relief from ADHDsymptoms, and the desire to use cocaine; neither were found tohave abused their medication. Mr. A's hospital records and family interviews strongly indicated a childhood history of ADHD. All previous attempts at treatment for cocaine abuse had failed (including hospitalization 2 months previously) where he had relapsed within only 1 week of discharge. At the time that he was observed by Weiss and colleagues, he had been free of drugs for 4 weeks and was undergoing treatment in their inpatient drug treatment unit, but showed virtually no improvement and continued to "crave" cocaine. Mr. A. was almost prematurely discharged from the in-patient program because he was considered to be thoroughly disruptive and was thought to be "untreatable" by staff. A trial of magnesium pemoline (cylert �) was started at 75 mg/day. Within days he showed improvements in concentration and appearance and his desire for cocaine vanished. When the dose was raised to 112.5 mg, he experienced racing thoughts and insomnia. He was stabilized at 75 mg/daily and discharged 2 weeks later. He remained on pemoline for 8 months, cocaine free, with little desire for cocaine. After 6 months, he again experienced racing thoughts and requested a lower dosage. At the time of these author's report, he had been taking 37.5 mg/daily without abuse and had secured gainful employment (Weiss, Pope, & Mirin, 1985). Ms. B. had a 10 year history of poly-drug use with a primary preference for cocaine, which she used (4 grams/daily) for 2 years prior to admission to the treatment hospital. Her childhood history and prior hospital records were suggestive of ADHD. During a 5 week intensive inpatient treatment program she showed no improvement and was started on pemoline. Within 2 weeks she reported a decrease in cocaine craving. At a 16 month follow-up, she continued to have little desire to use cocaine. Although it was frequently available, she had only used cocaine twice. In an attempt to taper off pemoline she experienced a cocaine relapse. At the time of this report, she had successfully tapered and discontinued pemoline, and had returned to college where she was experiencing success and abstaining from cocaine use (Weiss, Pope, & Mirin, 1985). Turnquist, Rosenfeld, and Mobarak (1983) reported an earliercase of an individual with ADHD and severe alcohol dependency,antisocial personality, poor work and social history, and ahistory of poor treatment compliance. He was reported to haveused 2-3 pints of rum daily for 7 years prior to treatment. Hewas discharged from a previous treatment program for disruptivebehavior after only 2 weeks and immediately resumed drinking.Upon re-admittance to the treatment hospital, he again faceddischarge within only 2 weeks. As he met the DSM-III diagnosisfor ADHD, he was placed on a trial of pemoline 37.5 mg/daily.Within 3 weeks, he experienced improved concentration, feltcalmer, less restless, had fewer emotional outbursts, and wasable to participate in therapy. Neurological testing was doneboth before and after the 4 week program. Before the pemolinetrial, he "became frustrated, exploded into a tirade, andran from the testing room". During the second testing (afterpemoline treatment) his concentration, cognitive functioning, andfrustration tolerance were all seen to have improved. He remainedin treatment for 6 weeks, and at a 13 month follow-up, was stillabstaining from alcohol and taking medication regularly. Khantzian (1984) asserts the "normalizing effects ofmethylphenidate" observed in clinical conditions requiresfurther clinical study. Although supportive of the variousattempts by behavioral, supportive, and psychodynamic treatmentapproaches, Gawin and Kleber (1984b) assert that all threeapproaches are necessary when dealing with cocaine abusers,especially when the needs of the individual cocaine abuser aretaken into account at the time of treatment seeking. Back To: Table of Contents The Duel Diagnosis: ADHD &Substance Abuse Few Canadian substance abuse treatment programs addresscomorbid psychiatric problems in a comprehensive manner (Milin,1995). Comorbid disorders not easily distinguished may beunderdiagnosed and therefore untreated. ADHD is one disorder thatis commonly overlooked, misdiagnosed, or ignored (Cavanagh, 1989;Hallowell & Ratey, 1995; Milin, 1995). Carroll andRounsaville's (1993) study illustrates this point: In a 1 yearfollow-up interview, not one of the cocaine addicts diagnosedwith ADHD the year previously had received any form ofpharmacologic treatment during that year, even though about halfof them had reported periods of abstinence from cocaine duringthat time. The poorer outcome of individuals with ADHD clearlyillustrates the consequences of failing identification andtreatment of residual symptoms of ADHD in cocaine users.Psychiatric evaluation for residual attention-deficit disorder isessential as patients with this disorder have been seen torequire specialized treatment (Gawin & Ellinwood, 1988;Zweben & Smith, 1989). Medication can often make the difference between completing ornot completing drug treatment programs. Ralph and Barr (1989)found 70%-80% of individuals with ADHD show an improved responseto stimulant medication when compared to controls on placebo.These researchers maintain that therapeutic doses of stimulantmedications for individuals with ADHD do not produce euphoria,but rather, enhance behavior. Zweben and Smith (1989) have notedthat in some chemical dependence treatment settings and amongsome practitioners, all-or-none thinking about medications existsuch as: "never use benzodiazepines with recoveringalcoholics" or "never give psychoactive substances topsychoactive substance abusers". These kinds of thinking canimpede the proper treatment of ADHD in cocaine addicts. Treatmentof ADHD symptoms has been shown to improve self-control anddecrease impulsivity, emotional lability, and anxiety; enablingthe patient to become more actively involved in substance abuserehabilitation therapies (Zweben & Smith, 1989; Khantzian,1983, 1984). Cavanagh (1989) and Turnquist (1983) both assertthat the symptoms of ADHD compromise the quality of sobriety andmay also render such individuals at particularly high risk forrelapse due to their "innate discomfort". Anattitudinal shift towards a medical problem (as opposed to amoral one) may further aid in alleviating depression andimproving self-esteem through the reduction of guilt and blame(Turnquist et al., 1993). Careful diagnosis is extremely important, as some individualsmay attempt to present these symptoms in the hope of obtainingmethlyphenidate or other stimulant drugs. Yet, at the same time,clinicians must take care not to let preconceived notionsinterfere with their ability to provide treatment planning thatis responsive to the patient's unique needs (Zweben & Smith,1989). Blume (1989) intimates the importance of considering thestage of illness or recovery. Diagnosis should be considered astentative while patients are still under the influence ofsubstances, experiencing withdrawal or denial, and in earlyrecovery. From a treatment perspective however, there arebenefits to earlier identification and treatment (McKenna &Ross, 1994). The development of instruments or questionnaires canaid in identifying comorbid illness at initial assessment insteadof having to wait the requisite 4-6 week abstinent period as iscommon practice in many treatment settings. Although methylphenidate is an abusable substance, itsadvantages include medical dispensation through controlleddosages, decreased legal risk, economic stabilization, and thebreaking of street associations and secondary abuse reinforcers(Kleber & Gawin, 1984b). The half-life for cocaine euphoriais less than 45 minutes, with binges characterized byre-administration up to every 10 minutes (Gawin & Ellinwood,Jr., 1988). Cocaine addicted individuals may stabilize onmethlyphenidate due to its longer half-life, as typically,amphetamine plasma half-life is 4-8 times longer than that ofcocaine. Oral administration also provides slower, moreconsistent elevation of catecholamines, and a slower decline instimulant levels which may eliminate the euphoric rush associatedwith the more rapidly absorbed cocaine, and may also attenuatedesire for frequent re-administration (Khantzian, Gawin, Kleber,& Riordan, 1984). Wender et al., (1981) propose the use ofpemoline over methlyphenidate for treatment of ADHD in substanceabusers, as it has a longer onset and duration of action and istherefore less likely to be abused. Positive responses topemoline are similar to that of ritalin. However, some patientsrespond negatively, with reports of increased agitation anddecreased concentration. For these individuals, ritalin ordexidrine may be more beneficial. A number of researchers feelthat since the symptoms that appear to sustain cocaine use arereduced by conventional pharmacologic treatment, such treatmentsmay also facilitate abstinence in self-medicating patients (Gawin& Kleber, 1986; McKenna & Ross, 1994). Back To: Table of Contents Ritalin� Abuse Concerns: Haglund and Howerton (1982) reported an instance of ritalinabuse amongst opium addicts in one methadone treatment program.This has been the only report of abuse in the researchliterature, and was thought to have occurred due to inadequateurine screening procedures. Ritalin abuse has not been reportedin cocaine addicts. In fact, cocaine addicts with ADHD havetended to show no interest in abusing these stimulant medications(perhaps indicating an extinction of the need to self medicate)and cocaine addicts without ADHD were found to dislike the"high" these medications produce, thought to be due inpart to the slower onset of action (Gawin & Kleber, 1985b).An alternative explanation for reports of ritalin abuse amongstheroin addicts, may lie in the effects of the painkillerPentazocine (talwin) in combination with ritalin - known on thestreet as "T's & R's". This drug combination hasbeen reported by some addicts as producing an inexpensive opiateeffect. Leigh and Barrett (1981) found d-amphetamine,methlyphenidate, and cocaine to all produce quantitatively andqualitatively similar effects. In animal studies, followingchronic administration of d-amphetamine, tolerance to allthree drugs was seen, indicating a cross tolerance. Given thepossibility for cross tolerance, Kleber and Gawin (1984)suggested methlyphenidate might then lessen the effect of cocaineabuse similar to high-dose methadone maintenance (which causeslonger term tolerance to opiates, thereby reducing heroin-inducedeuphoria and abuse). Gawin, Riordan, and Kleber (1985) tested theeffects of methlyphenidate on 5 cocaine abusers without ADHD andfound it did not facilitate cocaine abstinence. These patientsshowed a brief positive effect, then the medication appeared tohave become ineffective. Methlyphenidate appeared to haveproduced a cross tolerance in these patients, as cocaine useincreased in parallel with the increasing methylphenidate dosage.Studies of the combined use of cocaine and stimulant medicationshave not indicted significant adverse or detrimental effects(Khantzian et al., 1984). Finally, there have recently been mediareports of ritalin abuse amongst adolescent populations in theUnited States. Ritalin is apparently being used, not for itsstimulant properties, but for its tolerance properties observed.These adolescents report ritalin enables them to consume largeramounts of alcohol over a longer period of time. Crowley (1984) raises legal and ethical concerns about doseescalation, as well as the possibility of patients obtainingconcurrent prescriptions from several doctors. Khantzian (1984)felt it was necessary to weigh the possibility of dose escalationand long term consumption against the consuming addiction. Hefelt his patients were extreme cases and ritalin was prescribedfor the target symptoms of ADHD. In this way, the administrationof ritalin (a schedule II substance in the United States, athoughnot a restricted substance in Canada) is both legal and ethical,even when the patient is a substance abuser. Clampit and Pirkle (1983) suggest strict parental control,locked medicine cabinets, weekly pill counting, and the use ofpemoline over methylphenidate as "risk-free" methods ofpreventing abuse by adolescents on stimulant medications.Schatzberg and Cole (1987) offer the following guidelines foradministration of stimulant medications to patients with ahistory of substance abuse: 1. when the stimulant drug has clearly been used to improvefunctioning rather than produce euphoria or to get high 2. when a good therapeutic alliance is available 3. when the medication can be closely monitored 4. when other approaches have failed 5. when patient's problems seriously interfere with lifefunctioning. Back To: Table of Contents Conclusions: The etiology of cocaine abuse and ADHD is not clear. What iscurrently known is that individuals with ADHD often showparadoxical reactions to both cocaine and stimulant medications,and a significant percentage of individuals with chronic cocaineabuse patterns suffer from ADHD and may be self medicating.Contrary to what had been thought previously, symptoms of ADHDappear to have more impact on the development of cocainedependence than antisocial personality disorder and othercomorbid illness associated with both substance abuse or ADHD(Wilens, et al., 1995). Symptom severity, psychiatric diagnosis, and poor response totraditional substance abuse treatments have all been found topredict treatment outcomes of patients with substance abusedisorders. Osher and Kofoed (1989) feel clinicians have aresponsibility to define, develop, implement, and scientificallyevaluate programs for the dually diagnosed patient. Therapiesspecific to cocaine may be educational, psychodynamic,supportive, and behavioral; but the first goal of treatmentshould be to interrupt the recurrent binges or daily use ofcocaine and to overcome drug craving (Karan, Haller, &Schnoll, 1991 p140; Khantzian, 1988). There have been frequentreports of stimulant medications removing or reducing cocainecravings in individuals. This is thought by many to result out ofthe removal of painful feeling states, thereby reducing the needto self medicate. However, the exact mechanisms by which thisappears to work is not as yet, understood. Although chroniccocaine abusers with ADHD are unlikely to discontinue cocaine useimmediately following stimulant treatment, proper treatment ofADHD symptoms may enable such individuals to benefit from thetherapeutic experience. email Daniela Plumeat Carleton University Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Cocaine and related drugs WT01-B37-58IA087-000625-B015-68http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/cocaine/clearurine.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122042834 text/html 4720HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:28:21 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Saturday, 28-Dec-96 06:31:52 GMTContent-length: 4503 How Long Does it Take for Cocaine to Clear Out of Urine? Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Cocaine and related drugs How long does it take for crack (or cocaine) to clear out ofurine? URINE TESTING FOR COCAINE: Metabolite Detectable Longer Than Expected In Some Cases "How long will it take for crack (or cocaine) to clearout of my urine?" is a question received many times a day bythe staff of the Drug & Poison Information Center. It is nota straightforward question. First, cocaine itself is metabolized too rapidly to bemeasured for routine screening. When urine is being screened forthe presence of cocaine, it is actually benzoylecgonine, ametabolite of cocaine, that is being measured. Second, as to how long it will take for this metabolite to beeliminated from the urine, in some cases the answer may be longerthan traditionally thought. Several studies suggest thatbenzoylecgonine can be detected in the urine of chronic, highdoseabusers for longer periods of time than originally expected.Urine screens currently required by many employers use theminimum cutoff levels set by the National Institute of Drug Abuse(NIDA) to establish a positive drug test. A urine level of 300nanograms per milliliter (or 300 micrograms per liter) ofbenzoylecgonine is considered a positive result for cocaine use.However, these levels can vary in the same individual dependingon when the test is done. For example, first void of the daysamples will yield the highest concentrations of drugmetabolites. Testing urine at other times of the day will yielddiffering results, just as the concentration of urine itselfchanges throughout the day. Due to these variations in urine concentration, positive testresults can occur following a negative test result, although noadditional cocaine was used. Many people try to avoid a positivetest result by "watering up," or drinking large amountsof fluids to dilute their urine. Ideally, a 24-hour sample shouldbe taken, but this is impossible in most work settings.Performing random urine sampling is about the only way to assurea representative specimen. The widely accepted time period for benzoylecgonine to becleared from the urine is three to five days. One study suggeststhat high dose users (i.e., 0.5 gram or greater for each episodeof use) can test positive after eight days. Another study claimsthat benzoylecgonine can be detected in heavy cocaine users for10-14 days. The longest time over which positive urine levels ofbenzoylecgonine were detected was 10-22 days. This was afterchronic use of extremely high doses of 112 grams per week. Sinceit is usually difficult to determine exactly how much cocaine isbeing abused by a caller, it seems that a broader range ofpotential detection times should be given when explaining cocainemetabolism in regard to urine testing.

IDENTIFICATION1.        The Issue     The coca and poppy cultivation in the Andean jungle issignificantly damaging the environment in the region.  The mainthreats to the environment are deforestation caused by clearingthe fields for cultivation, soil erosion caused by severalfactors, and chemical pollution from insecticides andfertilizers.  Additionally, the process of converting coca andpoppy into cocaine and heroine has adverse effects on theenvironment as well.  These environmental issues are difficult toaddress due to coca�s position as a traditional crop and tradeitem, the influence and wealth of the drug traffickers opposingrestrictions, and the issue of national sovereignty.  Mostrealize the social impact of the drug trade worldwide, but fewrealize the environmental impact.  Hopefully, this case studywill help bring the situation to light. 2.        Description     Coca has been an important cultivated crop in the Andeanregion for over 4,000 years and has been an integral component inthe trade between the highland areas and the coast for nearly aslong (see COCA case).  The cultural homogeneity of the regionswas first established and maintained through these traderelationships which are still largely in effect today. Archaeologists have discovered numerous artifacts indicating thatthe chewing of the coca leaf has been used by the inhabitants ofthe region from as far south as Chile to northern Central Americasince 2100 BC.  Traditionally, the coca leaf has been chewed torelieve fatigue and hunger, as it is a mild stimulant. Additionally, it has the medical applications of helping relievealtitude sickness and conserve body heat.  It also provides someessential vitamins when consumed.  Obviously, these threecharacteristics are particularly useful in the mountainous Andes. In the historical past the coca leaf has been integral to anumber of religious ceremonies, based on prehistoric usepatterns.  The use of coca has always figured prominently inAndean cultural and religious daily life and continues to do soeven today.     The coca leaf contains less than 1% cocaine and has much thesame effect as caffeine.  Therefore, even though cocaine isprocessed from coca leaves, the two products are dramaticallydifferent in effects and usage.  One of the challenges inlimiting coca growth is to satisfy this benign traditional demandwhile eliminating the cash crop business that supplies thecocaine producers.     The evolution of coca into the cash crop of the Andes hasbeen occurring for the last century.  From the commercial (CocaCola is widely known for past usage of the drug in their product)and medicinal (along with opium, cocaine was used to alleviatepain in the injured during the Civil War and afterward) sales ofthe early twentieth century to the multi-billion dollar drugbusiness that exists today, coca had and has a significantinfluence upon economic life in the Andes.  Strategies to arrestthe drug problem can be separated into two distinct approaches: reduction of demand and reduction of supply.     When considering the problems of the drug use, most of theattention of scholars and professionals focuses on the social andeconomic aspects of the situation.  Until recently very littlework has isolated the environmental consequences of theincreasing coca cultivation, which are considerable.  The Andeanregion is among the most ecologically diverse and sensitive areasof the Earth and it has been subjected to increasingly stressfulabuse in recent years as a result of drug crop cultivation. There are three primary environmental consequences of coca andpoppy cultivation: deforestation and the destruction of thehabitat, soil erosion, and pollution of both air and water. Additionally, the processing of the raw drug crops into theirrefined forms also has a destructive environmental consequence.     Easily the most visible environmentally destructive effectof coca and poppy cultivation is deforestation.  During a fifteenyear period beginning in the 1970�s, 700,000 hectares of rainforest in the Amazon basin was destroyed to clear land for cocagrowth.  The immediate effect of deforestation is the reductionof natural habitat and subsequent reduction in the bio-diversityof the region.  A secondary effect of the deforestation derivesfrom the typical method of preparing an area for cultivationthrough a slash and burn procedure.  This burning is the majorsource of air pollution in the jungle.  Though these consequencesare significant, the most critical effect of deforestation isthat it leads to soil erosion.     Due to the illegality of coca and poppy growth the farmersplace their fields on hillsides, which are more difficult for thegovernment agents to reach than fields located on the valleyfloors.  Because the government does pursue an active eradicationcampaign, the farmers rarely expect to enjoy long-termcultivation of their fields and, consequently, rarely employ soilconservation techniques.  The coca fields are planted along thecontours of the land with little terracing and the fields arekept bare of plants except for the coca or poppy plants.  Thesemethods, in combination with the steep slopes, serve to stripaway topsoil with every strong wind and heavy rain, very quicklymaking the fields infertile not only for further cultivation butfor jungle plant life as well.  Recent observers over-flying thejungle describe it as a patchwork quilt of green broken bypatches of gray desolation.  In addition to causing soilinfertility, the topsoil runoff fills waterways and rivers withsediment changing their courses, causing flooding, and killingfish and aquatic plant life by lowering the oxygen content of thewater and smothering the river bottoms.  Locals who used todepend on the large fish in the rivers for food, no longer findany fish large enough to eat.     Pollution is also a factor in the environmentaldestructiveness of coca and poppy cultivation.  The pesticidesused by the growers travel through the soil into the ground waterand eventually into the rivers and streams.  Pesticides areinherently toxic to the insects but they can also harm largeranimals and people in greater concentrations.  Fish and otheraquatic life are particularly susceptible to this contamination. Another source of pollution is the fertilizer used by thegrowers, which also enters the water systems after chemically"burning" the more sensitive vegetation of the region.  Thefertilizer in the water encourages the algae  to grow atincreased rates while killing the organisms that feed on it.  Asa result, the algae overwhelms other aquatic plant life andrestricts water flow.     The processing of coca leaves into coca paste and cocainehas its own environmentally damaging effects.  U.S. StateDepartment studies indicate that �10 million liters of sulfuricacid, 16 million liters of ethyl ether, 8 million liters ofacetone, and from 40-770 million liters of kerosene� are poureddirectly into the ground by cocaine processors working in theAndean region, mainly Colombia, yearly.  The consequences of thispollution are quickly felt in the small rivers where the aquaticlife is devastated.  The primary growing area in southernColombia, the Caqueta river basin, is particularly polluted. There have also been increasing reports of sickness among thepeople and livestock of these areas, who rely on the rivers andwell for water.      In addition to its standing as the world's premier cocaineproducer, Colombia now ranks as the world�s third largestproducer of opium, the largest in the western hemisphere.  NorthAmerica has been receiving an increasing amount of heroin inrecent years as the Cali cartel has taken advantage of the landless suitable for coca growth and planted it with poppies.  Thisincrease in heroin growth in Colombia appears to be unrelated tothe Opium Wars in Southeast Asia as the increase in U.S.consumption came about only after increased exports from Colombiahad been established.  Thus, the Colombians seem to haveincreased demand for their heroin in the U.S. through increasedsupply at lower prices and not through supplanting the previoussupply from Southeast Asia.  Estimations place total area underpoppy cultivation at 20,000 hectares, which has ideal growingconditions slightly hotter and dryer than coca requires.  Thoughthe effects of poppy growth in Colombia are largely unpublished,the same farmers are growing both crops and it can be assumedthat similar damage is being committed in poppy cultivation as isbeing done in coca cultivation.     During the last several years drug traffickers haveincreased their ownership of agriculturally suitable land four-fold; they now control through direct or intermediary ownership8%-11% of all agricultural land in Colombia.  This is extremelyalarming as this control gives the drug traffickers more directopportunity to utilize the land for drug crop cultivation, which,as stated above, is extremely destructive to the jungleenvironment.     In 1992, Colombia only produced 13 percent of the world'scoca, but its cartels now have a strangle-hold on the world'scocaine processing, at 70-80 percent of total production anddistribution world wide.  This concentration of business has hadan enormous effect in Colombia.  First, estimates place the totalof drug money repatriated into the Colombian economy to be ashigh as $7 billion, this is almost as large as the totallegitimate exports for Colombia which were $7.6 billion in 1993. These huge profits exert an enormous influence over every aspectof life in Colombia.  The trafficking organizations employthousands of people from the farmer in the field to irregulartroops and assassins to pilots, chemists, lawyers, and otherprofessionals.  These vast amounts of money give the traffickerssignificant means to protect themselves from the law both localand national.  Over $100 million is spent on bribes to Colombianofficials yearly according to estimates by U.S. law enforcementofficials.  This level of influence has led some to declare thatColombia is the world's first "Narco-Democracy."  Evidence ofbribery has extended throughout the Colombian government includingthe former president of the national congress, congressmen, judges,army officers, and policemen.  A comment by Cali cartel leaderGilberto Rodrigez Orejuela illustrates this, "We don't kill judgesor ministers, we buy them."  A former DEA officer states thesituation just as clearly when he says that he "cannot think of asingle political or judicial institution that has not beenpenetrated by the narco-traffickers."  Even more importantly, theColombian constitution forbids the extradition of criminals.3.

Draft Author:  Brett D. SchaeferB.        LEGAL Clusters5.        Discourse and Status:  DISagreement and INPROGress     Coca growth has been a part of the Andean economy forthousands of years, but its growth has never been wide spread asa cash crop until as recently as the 1970�s when the first largescale demand for cocaine occurred in the United States.  Largelythrough pressure from the United States, Colombia has adoptedU.S. counter-narcotics techniques to compliment their outlawingof the growth of coca and the production of cocaine.  ThoughColombia is the largest producer and trafficker in cocaine, Peruis largest grower of coca.     Despite its efforts, Colombia has not constrained the flowof cocaine.  Indeed, Colombia seems to have lost ground to thedrug traffickers in several key areas.  The traffickers haveexerted their influence over the new constitution in two ways. First,  the constitution forbids the extradition of drugtraffickers to the United States where they would receivelegitimate trials and severe sentencing if convicted.  The samedocument places a maximum of 12 years incarceration on drugtrafficking convictions.  The large amounts of money availableto the drug traffickers ensures that they will be able to affordthe best lawyers for their defense, many of whom are formerprosecutors.  This premium defense makes convictions difficult inthe United States and even more so in the corruptible courts ofColombia.     Though domestic law indisputably classifies coca growth andcocaine processing as illegal, there has been pervasive popularresistance towards its actual implementation.  This resistanceresulted in a provincial agreement by the government not todestroy coca fields smaller than 3 hectares.  This agreement wasbroken by the government due to pressure from the UnitedStates.  A second attack on government eradication policiescame from environmentalist groups, allegedly in the pay of thedrug cartels,  which objected to the government�s spraying of theherbicide glyphosate on the grounds that it destroys theenvironment and is harmful to the health of the people living inthe region.  The accusations of these groups are weakened by thefact that this herbicide is fully approved by the USEPA, is usedin over 100 nations world wide, and has received no similarcharges elsewhere.6.        Forum and Scope:  COLOMbia and REGIONal     The illegality of coca growth and cocaine production isofficially a strictly internal matter of the Colombiandetermination, which has decided to comply with the 1988 UnitedNations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs andPsycotropic Substances.  However, the reality of the situation isquite different.  The United States has considerable influenceover the drug policies pursued by Colombia, just as it hasconsiderable influence through out the Western Hemisphere,through the distribution of aid and economic agreements.  TheUnited States has also used limited military action to aid theDEA in crop destruction and drug seizures, but has withheld fullmilitary action because of the diplomatic complications. Colombia is not willing to give permission to the U.S. for an allout effort to eradicate the drug business.     The U.S. has passed judgment on drug producing nations since1986, essentially determining whether the country is contributingsufficient efforts towards counter-narcotics programs.  A failingrating strips the country of its foreign aid eligibility andpreferred trade status, both of these being strong deterrents todrug policy rebellion.7.        Decision Breadth:  Colombia and MANY8.        Legal Standing:  LAW and TREATY     It is against the law in Colombia to grow coca (since1947) and poppy or to produce cocaine or heroine, however thislaw is mostly enforced due to pressure induced by U.S. treatiesrequiring full compliance with the 1988 United Nations ConventionAgainst Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and PsycotropicSubstances.  The punishment for non-compliance with U.S. effortsor the UN Convention is the retraction of foreign aid and, forthe Andean Region, expulsion from the Andean Trade PreferencesAct (essentially an agreement allowing barrier free access toU.S. markets, for products made by industries not consideredthreatened by foreign trade or vital to U.S. interests, in returnfor full compliance with the UN Convention).C.

Indeed, thedamage in Peru is estimated to be higher than that in Colombia,as it is the world�s major producer of coca (see COCA case onthis).10.       Sub-National Factors:  No     A provincial agreement had been reached protecting fields ofdrug crops below a certain size from herbicidal spraying, butthis agreement was withdrawn. 11.       Type of Habitat:  TROPicalD.        TRADE Clusters12.       Type of Measure:  Export Ban [EXBAN]     Cocaine and heroin are controlled substances world-wide andany trafficking in them other than for specific medical purposesis strictly forbidden.13.

Not Related         :  NO     d.   Process Related     :  YES  DEFORestation      The coca and poppy fields are not directly destructive tothe environment, it is the methods utilized in their cultivationthat result in the destruction.  The deforestation committed inclearing the fields, the chemical pollution from insecticides andfertilizers, and the soil erosion are inevitable with the currentmethod of cultivation.  Additionally, the chemicals used inprocessing the raw crop into the narcotic are environmentallyharmful as well.     Indirectly related to the problem is the situation of foodcrops.  The farmers often have switched to growing drug crops foreconomic reasons, placing a greater stress on the environment asthe farmers hunt to supplement their diets.  If the farmers dogrow subsistence crops in addition to their drug crops, bothcrops are generally destroyed by drug enforcement officersthrough indiscriminate aerial spraying because the two fields areeither overlapping or adjacent to one another.15.       Trade Product Identification:  COCA and products 16.       Economic Data     In 1993 total legal exports from Colombia were $7.6billion, During that same year the DEA estimated that Colombiandrug traffickers repatriated up to $7 billion in laundered drugmoney into the Colombian economy.  Essentially, the drug tradeis returning as great a profit as the total exports of thecountry - with no recipients but the drug cartels who use thatwealth to sustain their enterprise.  Is it any wonder that theGovernment has difficulty handling the situation?   In 1993, cocareturned a greater profit than any legally cultivated crop inColombia by 15%.  In fact, the only crop to return a greaterprofit than coca was poppy, which returned a profit 22 percenthigher than coca.17.       Impact of Measure on Trade Competitiveness: MEDium     There are two arguments for the actual effects of the ban. First, that the ban raises the demand of the product to theextent that growing coca is too profitable for the farmer andtrafficker to forgo.  The opposing view believes that, withoutthe ban, demand for the product would skyrocket and, thus, itsremoval would have little effect on driving prices down.18.       Industrial Sector:  PHARMaceutical     Coca and poppy growth is agricultural in nature, while theprocessing of the raw material into the final products is done inwhat is essentially a light chemical manufacturing process.19.       Exporter and Importers: COLOMbia and USA     Up to 20 percent of the Andean region is suitable for cocaproduction with the primary producers of raw coca being Bolivia,Colombia, and Peru.  However, the primary exporter of processedcocaine products is Colombia.  Primary importers of processedcocaine are the United States, Western Europe, Japan, and morerecently Eastern Europe.E.        ENVIRONMENT Clusters20.       Environmental Problem Type:  DEFORestation     Deforestation is occurring at a staggering pace in Colombiaas coca and poppy growers increase the number of fields undercultivation and move from depleted land no longer able to supportthe crop.  The effects of the crop field expansion are compoundedby the fact that every planted hectare of coca or poppy requirestwo and one-half hectares of forest to be cut.  "At the presentrate of destruction... Colombia will lose a third of itsremaining forests and jungles by the end of the century."     The habitat loss resulting from the coca and poppycultivation stems from two characteristics of the farmer�scultivation techniques.  Because the drug crops return a greaterprofit than most legitimate crops, the farmers can purchasefertilizer that is not economical for legal crops.   Because thefertilizers create a greater yield, the farmers are not asconcerned about preserving the soil.  Also, the crop eradicationby the Colombian government and the DEA does not allow the farmerthe luxury of anticipating a long term occupation of his field,therefore the farmer is more concerned about short-term growththan about sustainability.  To make access more difficult, thefarmer's plant their crops on freshly cleared hillsides aidingheavy soil erosion from wind and rain.     Nitrates used by coca and poppy growers as fertilizerspollute the water ways causing fish deaths and spurring abnormalalgae growth.  The chemicals used in processing the raw productsinto the drugs range from sulfuric acid to gasoline to sevin(which has been used to create poison gas in Iraq).  Estimates ofchemical wastes dumped into the ground and streams are in excessof 200,000 tons per year.  21.       Name, Type, and Diversity of Species      Name:          Coca     Type:          Plant     Diversity:     51,220 higher plants                    per 10,000 km/sq                    (Colombia)     The damage comes from the effects of the deforestation andchemical pollutants introduced into the environment from theseactivities.  The waterways have been clogged with silt runningoff of the stripped hills and contaminated by the toxic chemicalsbeing dumped into streams by drug processing plants.  As aresult, the fish population and aquatic plants have beendecimated to the point that Dr. Urrelo, an environmentalistworking in the area for the past 20 years, has declared the"small rivers dead."      The deforestation and cultivation of drug crops is alsohaving an effect on the wildlife of the area, particularly birds. The lack of appropriate habitat has cut the diversity of the birdpopulation dramatically according to environmentalist Dr. Hern,who estimates it as low as 1 percent of its level 30 years ago. Compounding the reduction in habitat, the farmers of drug cropsoften do not grow subsistence crops and hunt the birds and otheranimals as food.  Plant diversity is also suffering severelywith estimates stating that 1/3 of Colombia�s total remainingforestry will be gone within the next five years.22.       Resource Impact and Effect: High and SCALE     Even at the current rate of deforestation over 1/3 of all ofColombia's forest will be gone in 5 years, much of the clearedland being abandoned after two or three seasons due to flaggingfertility.  Little wildlife exists in the rivers or the forestsnear populated areas making life more difficult for those notparticipating in the drug trade to prosper or even survive.  Thesoils in the tropical region of Colombia are sand and poor forplant growth underneath the thin topsoil.  The deforestationcaused by coca and poppy producers and non-existent soilconservation techniques they practice have led several experts totheorize that the region could end up in a situation similar tothat of Ethiopia or Somalia within 50 years, i.e. a fast growingpopulation that is larger than the food production can supportdue to poor agricultural soils or techniques.23.       Urgency and Lifetime:  MEDium and 100s of years     Tropical jungles are one of the most delicate ecosystems onthe planet, easily disrupted and extremely difficult to restoreonce harmed.  The jungle is being destroyed at a rapid rate andin a manner which makes recovery extremely difficult.  The soilerosion and destruction of soil microbes necessary for plantgrowth make this recovery process even longer and moredifficult.24.       Substitutes:  REHABilitation     In this case study there are two aspects to be addressed forsubstitutional products.  The first environmental effect of thecoca and poppy growth deals with deforestation, soil erosion, andreductions in bio-diversity.  The jungle environment of SouthAmerica contributes significant supplies of the world�s oxygenand includes a large proportion of the world�s species of bothplants and animals, neither of these can be substituted for. They can be nurtured back to health if given enough care andactive cooperation by the farmers and general industry that usethe forest land, including the coca and poppy growers.  Thesecond possibility is finding a substitute for cocaine, heroine,poppy or coca.  The substitution of the drug crops or theprocessed drugs would solve some of the environmentaldegradation, however, most would find this solution unacceptablebecause it would not solve the social problems related to drugabuse.  Rehabilitation has proven to be a problematic solution asmost of the patients require multiple sessions of treatment. Even though they do become "clean" for a time, upon leaving theconfines of the treatment center the circumstances whichencourage them to  abuse drugs remain unchanged.F.        OTHER FACTORS25.       Culture:  Yes     The traditional coca leaf use extends back at least to 2,100BC in the Andes, according to archaeological finds.  During thepast 4,000 years coca has established a solid niche in theeveryday life of rural Andean people, both Indian and thoseEuropeans living there for centuries.  The coca leaf containsless than 1% cocaine and has much the same effect as caffeine,therefore, even though cocaine is processed from coca leaves thetwo products are dramatically different in effects and usage. The use of the coca leaf may be mildly addictive, an effect suchas caffeine addiction, but not to the damaging level of cocaineor heroine consumption.  Traditionally, the coca leaf has beenchewed to relieve fatigue and hunger, as it is a mild stimulant. It also has medical applications through helping to relievealtitude sickness and conserve body heat.  It also provides someessential vitamins when consumed.  These three characteristicsare particularly useful in the mountainous Andes.  The coca leafis also integral to a number of religious and culturalceremonies. 26.       Trans-Boundary:  Yes     The drug trade is an international problem of both supplyand demand.  Cocaine and heroine permeates nearly every nation onthe globe, either as a grower, a consumer, or a routing nexusbetween the two.27.       Human Rights:  Yes     There is a basic freedom issue between the consumption ofdrugs and their growth or the protection of society as aresponsibility of the government to its citizens.28.

One feels a certainfurriness on the lips and palate, followed by a feeling of warmthin the same areas; if one now drinks cold water, it feels warm onthe lips and cold in the throat. One other occasions thepredominant feeling is a rather pleasant coolness in the mouthand throat. During this first trial I experienced a short period of toxiceffects, which did not recur in subsequent experiments. Breathingbecame slower and deeper and I felt tired and sleepy; I yawnedfrequently and felt somewhat dull. After a few minutes the actualcocaine euphoria began, introduced by repeated coolingeructation. Immediately after taking the cocaine I noticed aslight slackening of the pulse and later a moderate increase. I have observed the same physical signs of the effect ofcocaine in others, mostly people my own age. The most constantsymptom proved to be the repeated cooling eructation. This isoften accompanied by a rumbling which must originate from high upin the intestine; two of the people I observed, who said theywere able to recognize movements in their stomachs, declaredemphatically that they had repeatedly detected such movements.Often, at the outset of the cocaine effect, the subjects allegedthat they experienced an intense feeling of heat in the head. Inoticed this in myself as well in the course of some laterexperiments, but on other occasions it was absent. In only twocases did coca give rise to dizziness. On the whole the toxiceffects of coca are of short duration, and much less intense thanthose produced by effective doses of quinine or salicylate ofsoda; they seem to become even weaker after repeated use ofcocaine.

Company scientists and theircolleagues at Boston University demonstrated for the first timethat antibodies against cocaine can extinguish drug-seekingbehavior for cocaine in an animal model of addiction. The vaccinethat induces anti-cocaine antibodies was effective at minimizingpassage of cocaine into the brain in animals receivingintravenous administration of cocaine, a route comparable to thatused by human abusers of the drug. The vaccine was also effectiveagainst multiple doses of cocaine. ImmuLogic scientist and lead author of thepublication, Barbara Fox, Ph.D., commented, "Our resultsconfirm the potential of a cocaine vaccine as a valuable new toolin the treatment of cocaine addiction. To consider the vaccinefeasible for development as a human therapeutic, it was importantto show that the vaccine was effective when cocaine wasadministered in a clinically relevant manner, that it modifiedbehavior, and that vaccine- induced antibody levels weresufficient to minimize the passage of cocaine into the brain. Weare pleased to report that we have accomplished all of theseobjectives, and plan to move this vaccine into the clinic in1997." Dr. Fox added, "A cocaine vaccine willprovide a powerful new tool for the treatment of this seriousaddiction. The vaccine is intended to be used in humans toprevent relapse as part of a comprehensive treatmentprogram." The U.S. Institute of Medicine estimates that2.1 million people in the United States use cocaine on a weeklybasis, and several hundred thousand use it daily. Approximately400,000 patients seek medical treatment for cocaine abuse on ayearly basis in the U.S. Although there has been some success intreating heroin and alcohol addiction by pharmacological andbehavioral means, no effective treatment currently exists forcocaine addiction. The National Institute on Drug Abuse hasidentified cocaine addiction as a life-threatening condition andrecently awarded ImmuLogic an SBIR grant to complete preclinicaldevelopment of the vaccine. The ImmuLogic researchers first investigatedthe ability of mouse anti- cocaine antibodies to inhibitdrug-seeking behavior in a model of addiction. In this model,shown to accurately predict the likelihood that a drug will beabused in humans, rats are trained to self-administer intravenousdoses of cocaine at will. Varying the dose of cocaine given tothe rats in each mission leads to a steep dose-response curve forthe animal's behavioral response to the drug and the rate of druginfusion. In rats subsequently treated with anti-cocaineantibodies, both the response rate and the infusion ratedecreased, but remain unaffected in rats receiving a controlantibody. ImmuLogic's cocaine vaccine consists of acocaine derivative chemically joined to a vaccine carrierprotein. The vaccine induced high titers of cocaine-specificantibodies in mice, which persisted for months. Mice immunizedwith the cocaine vaccine and then challenged with the drug showeddecreased levels of cocaine in their brains only 30 seconds afterintravenous administration of the drug. Repeat administration ofcocaine to immunized mice did not appear to alter the antibody'sbeneficial effect on cocaine distribution. Anti-cocaine antibodies induced in animals canblock the entry of cocaine into the brain and thus reduce theability of directly injected cocaine to increase motorstimulation. Until now, however, questions remained whether thisapproach could reduce drug-seeking behavior and thereby, thedrug's addictive potential. In addition, it remained unknownuntil now whether the antibodies maintained their effect uponrepeated cocaine administration. ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical Corporation is abiopharmaceutical company, located in Waltham, Massachusetts,developing peptide therapeutics to treat allergies and autoimmunediseases. ALLERVAX(R) products to treat cat and ragweed allergiesare in clinical development. ImmuLogic's lead autoimmunecandidate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis is nearingcompletion of preclinical development. In addition to treatmentsfor allergies and autoimmune diseases, the Company is developinga poison ivy/poison oak therapeutic and a vaccine to treatcocaine abuse.

Wayburn, PhD Summary of My 1989 Paper and Some Retractions SUMMARY OF THE 1989 PAPER In Chapter 6 of Drug Policy 1989-1990(1), I made two important points: (1) according to strict logic,drugs are already legal; i.e., the laws against drugs areunconstitutional, and (2) prohibited drugs have many valid usesand do not constitute a threat to society. The laws against drugsviolate the rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness asretained by the people in accordance with the Ninth Amendment andthey violate the freedom of religion clause in the FirstAmendment because: (i) taking or not taking drugs is a moralchoice and moral choices are religious choices and (ii) takingdrugs can be construed to be a religious ritual. The idea thatthe illegal drugs have no legitimate uses and are a threat tosociety is an unstated assumption of prevention and treatmentproponents. Even if it is stated, it is incorrect and invalidatesarguments based upon it, as shown in my 1990 paper (2). In the 1989 paper, I impugned the motives ofsome of the anti-drug crowd, I enumerated some of the lies toldby drug prevention people, and I expressed skepticism oftreatment programs. I pointed out that psychiatrists, psychiatricassistants, psychologists, social workers, counselors,therapists, etc. have a great deal to lose if the drug problemgoes away. SOME RETRACTIONS But, some of my ideas on the drug problem haveevolved over the past years. I no longer believe that thegovernment should be entrusted with the task of disseminatinginformation or educating the public on drugs. Look whatgovernment has done with the public schools, where teachers andprevention specialists tell terrible lies about drugs andpromulgate biased political, economic, and metaphysical views oflife (2). The job of informing can be handled adequately byprivate groups of drug users who are in a position to teach theresponsible, safe, and rewarding uses of drugs, to warn of thedangers of drugs, and to counteract the propaganda of otherprivate organizations who wish to limit freedom. Also, whereas Isaid that the repeal of prohibition "would return manytalented people to the workplace", I am now convinced thatthe workplace will have to change substantially, creatingopportunities for all kinds of people rather than exclusively forclones of the "ideal worker", before talented peoplepossessed of genuine individuality will return. In 1989, I said that people must be allowed totake drugs "in the privacy of their own homes or in otherplaces set aside for that purpose". Many people labor underthe incorrect assumption that people use drugs merely to gethigh, whereas, in many cases, they use drugs to achieve animportant goal. I now believe the using of drugs must befacilitated nearly everywhere (so long as the rights ofnonsmokers are protected), particularly in workplaces, schools,concert halls, museums, etc. Isn't it a little hypocritical toenjoy, in a place where drugs are prohibited, the works of peoplewho took drugs to produce art! The Defeat of Prevention and TreatmentProponents at the 1990 Meeting of the Drug Policy Foundation Alex Stuart (3) wants to re-instill moralvalues but couldn't name one. His arguments that drugs aremorally wrong were refuted soundly by a young Harvard student.Christina Johns (4), Raymond Brown (5), Jerri Husch (6), andEllen Luff (7) pointed out, independently, that most preventionand treatment efforts divert much needed attention from festeringsocial problems that result in anomie, as Art Hilgart (8) termedit. (Anomie is the breakdown of social norms due to theincapacity of people to meet them.) This view was supported to acertain extent by Clark Hosmer (9) as well. Rufus King declared"drug abuse" to be a "nonproblem". Behavior modification and other authoritarianmethods advocated by Ray Jeffery (10), Patricia Ritter (11), andRonald Farrell (11) were not accepted by the audience, whereasthe papers by Wayburn (2) and Luff (7) could not be refuted.Farrell himself expressed serious doubts about what he is doing.The "cult of ibogaine" as represented by Howard Lotsof(12) is discussed below. One of Lotsof's "cured""drug addicts" interrupted the meeting repeatedly toprotest that the "cure" had been found and all furtherdiscussion was unwarranted. I didn't get a chance to tell herthat not everyone wants to be "cured". The cult-likebehavior of the "cured" person probably harmed Lotsof'scase more than it helped it. The public-health model gained some credibilityfrom the independent remarks of Steve Jonas and Mary Lynn Mathre(13), but it is clear that many disease theorists intend to poseas public-health workers. Henry Blansfield (14) claimed thatthere is some scientific evidence that the use of drugs causesirreversible physiological changes. I pointed out that, even if"drug abuse" were a disease, and it's not at all clearthat it is, the etiology might belong to medicine, but thetreatment not, particularly if there is none, due to theirreversible nature of the damage. On the other hand, if sciencecan supply us with a work-around drug, i.e., a drug that providesa new mechanism for the body to achieve whatever it could notpreviously achieve because of the irreversible damage, we willtake it, but first let's see the drug. In the meantime, anydoctor who claimed to be reversing an irreversible condition,i.e., curing "drug addiction", was a quack. The political-economic-social system of theU.S. creates ghastly conflicts in living. Every quack, grifter,and flim-flam artist wants a piece of the action. Granted, a fewsincere and generous souls, free of the desire for private gain,wish to help, but political problems don't have long-rangepersonal or psychological solutions. Of course, those who areable to ignore the general suffering might improve their own lotmarginally. Bruce Alexander (15) and Jeffrey Schaler (16)completed the rout of the disease theory of "drugaddiction", while Robert Goodman (17) called into questionthe concept of "addiction" itself. If there is a genefor "drug addiction", let's find it quickly so thatthose of us who don't carry it can use drugs without worryingabout "getting hooked". Thus, in the 1990 meeting of the Drug PolicyFoundation (DPF), advocates of prevention by authoritarian meansrather than by transforming society and advocates of treatmentwere fairly well defeated in debate by those who don't accept thepopular notion that drug use is a problem that needs to beprevented or an illness that needs to be treated. Therefore, theDPF should abandon its policy of advocating prevention andtreatment as an alternative to law enforcement. One of theplenary speakers actually addressed the problem of the limits ofwhat a political person can say publicly. I would have liked toask, "Are these talks (the plenary talks), then, to be takenas true or false? I mean, do you people really believe whatyou're saying or are you saying what is merely politicallyexpedient?" I believe that the important thing is toproduce a body of statements that have meaning and to approachthe truth (the congruence of statements with events) as closelyas possible. This, then, will be disseminated into the collectiveconsciousness of humanity and affect the way people think andact. When enough people think and act appropriately, appropriatechange will be inevitable. We must always refer to an ideal toknow what to think and do. It doesn't help to create a politicswith no philosophical basis. Being "realistic" is justan excuse for being wrong. We need to understand without worryingabout what is "acceptable" and what is not. Then, weneed to find a felicitous way to speak the truth recognizing thatwe are fallible. Instead of accepting the monopoly of thecontrol of drugs by the medical profession, we should say we willnever accept such a state of affairs and would rather see nochange in national policy until that eventuality is swept out ofthe collective mind. In the meantime, we can lend our ownpersonal aid to those who are the most abused in the most acuteways by the status quo, whether our help lies inside or outsidethe law. Presumably, what some members of the ACLU are doingrenders aid within the law as far as it can be rendered in case aperson's liberty be violated. My Seven-Point Plan My new plan for post-prohibition societyconsists of the following: (1) an equal-rights amendment for drugusers, (2) teaching people how to live with drugs, to choose themwisely, and to use them properly (to get the most out of them andto prevent accidents, disease, and unpleasant side-effects), (3)new opportunities for drug users, heteroclites, and other peoplewho are "different" to make contributions to society inappropriate nonstandard settings including settings where one canwork while using drugs, (4) during the transition, reparationsfor victims of the laws against drugs amounting to whatever theyneed to live abundantly, and (5) free informal counseling fortroubled or troublesome drug users by drug users. Since, it must be admitted, some people who aretaking drugs might like to stop - even in a normalized society, Ipropose two additional "points": (6) institutions likecommercial hotels that cost no more than hotels and that have allthe amenities of hotels and more, e.g, VCRs and videotapelibraries and books, except that the (voluntary) guest may notleave for a fixed period of time agreed upon in advance (by theguest) nor indulge in certain drugs beyond agreed upon limits,which might be monotonically decreasing. Rural locations mightprovide better settings with lower real estate costs offset byhigher transportation costs. Only one "medical""professional" per shift would be needed, namely, todispense medicine. I can say truthfully that I would trust anydrug dealer I have known to perform that job - except for one,who was generous to a fault. Vouchers could be provided for thosewho can't pay. And, finally, (7) new drugs that preventwithdrawal symptoms and cravings may be used (voluntarily), ifthey exist. Such claims have been made lately for the drugibogaine (12), but, unless the costs are reduced or borne by thestate, it will not be widely used. Also, the claims may not betrue - or not true in an acceptable mode; i.e., the effectivenessof ibogaine may depend on "religious" faith, whichmight diminish the humanity of the patient. Moreover, those whohave been "cured" by ibogaine may have merelytransferred their allegiance to a new drug, which, in the case ofibogaine, is long lasting (six months or longer) - at first, butwhich, after repeated doses, might "need" to be usedmore frequently. Lately, similar effects have been ascribed tothe South American drug yage or one of its derivatives. Actually,the possibility of switching to a new drug is included underpoints (2) and (5) above.

The Persuasive Strategies- Answers to Specific Questions- Showstopper Questions -These are the debate strategies which blew the drug warriors outof the debate so badly that the DEA felt compelled to hold aconference in August, 1994, to write the following book. Speaking Out Against DrugLegalization -- This is the DEA debate manual which waswritten in response to the success of the Persuasive Strategies.It was originally titled "How to Hold Your Own in a DrugLegalization Debate," but the title was changed because thefirst title seemed to assume they would get their butts kicked nomatter what and the best they could hope to do is survive.

Now even ordinary discussion has becomedangerous. The Competition One of the main differences between me and the"competition" (those who support the drug war) is thatI am fully devoted to airing all the facts and arguments on theissue, regardless of whether they favor my point of view. Ifirmly believe that any honest comparison of their evidence (suchas they have presented - not much) and arguments (generally weak,emotional, and illogical) will lead any intelligent, reasonableperson to the truth. Therefore, I am including links to all theother sites on the web which seem to be opposed to mine. Read andcompare yourself. I recommend to all my opponents that they dothe same, in order to make it easier for all interested partiesto get to the truth. However, I expect that none of them will.The truth is that our opponents aren't much interested in thetruth. Please Note: We have invited all of the following listedparties to come out for a live debate at which their evidence andarguments could be presented against ours in an open forum.Though we have made repeated invitations, none of the groups andpeople listed below have had the courage to come out for an opendebate. We stand ready to debate them at any time they are ready. DEA Home Page Dr.Kim Edward Light's Home Page - Dr. Light presents some short,poorly documented, and fundamentally illogical arguments against"legalization" (he seems to have his own definition for"legalization" which doesn't quite match up with what Ihave heard other people suggest).

What debate? In the last year or so, the people andorganizations who support the War on Some Drugs have realizedthat they simply cannot win an open and honest debate on drugpolicy. As a rational matter, there is no rational defense forour current policy. As a result, they have gone into ahunkered-down mode where they are refusing to engage in anydialogue at all on drug policy - because they realize they willlose badly. We think it is important to point out and name all the peopleand organizations who want to try to tell the world what we oughtto be doing about drugs, but then refuse to engage inconstructive debate or dialogue with anyone who might propose anymodification to the current system. In short, they have pushedthemselves into an extremist corner, and we think it ought to bepublicly known. Therefore, we are listing below the people and organizationswho have been invited for a polite, open, and honest publicdebate on drug policy but have so far refused. We think they arechicken - afraid to debate because they know they will be soundlybeaten. We feel that the media and everyone else who reads thispage should call it to their attention that their refusal todiscuss drug policy is unreasonable and counter-productive. Ifthey are really interested in finding a drug policy which works,then we ought to be talking together, not hiding as these peopleare doing. PLEASE NOTE: We wholeheartedly invite any of the people or organizationslisted below to respond and participate in this debate by postingtheir responses, arguments, or whatever. We have alreadyestablished links to their web pages so readers may compare therespective arguments, and understand why these people don't wantto debate. We will post whatever responses they want to make. The Chickens The Drug Enforcement Administration The DEA refuses to discuss drug policy in any environmentwhere they might be subjected to either honest debate or direct,probing questions about our drug policies. This is despite thefact that they held a major conference in August, 1994, to try toteach their people how to survive in a drug policy debate andeven wrote a book called "How to Hold Your Own in a DrugLegalization Debate". Why do they refuse to debate? Verysimple - they know from past history that they will get theirbutts kicked without any question. Prove it to yourself. Call your local DEA office andtell them you are setting up a public forum and would like themto come to speak to whatever community group. They will gladlyvolunteer - because they have public relations officers with thatspecific task - until they hear the rest. Then tell them thatthere will be people from the drug policy reform movement there,and you would like to set up an open and honestdiscussion/debate. Their answer will be short and simple:"We don't debate." If you ask them why, they will tellyou it is because it would lend credibility to the other side. Ofcourse, they will still refuse even if you have recognizedmedical authorities, Nobel prize winners, or anyone else whoalready has credibility. The real reason is: They are chicken! Thomas Constantine Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration After putting his pretty face on the book he masterminded -"How to Hold Your Own in a Drug Legalization Debate" -Mr. Constantine has apparently wisely decided not to try ithimself. We have posted his book, along with our reply which,among other things, found that they had cited books which didn'teven exist. That's no way to win a debate! In recent months hehas openly admitted that the drug war of the 1980s has hadlittle, if any, effect on the flow of drugs despite all thebillions spent. Mr. Constantine may now be frightened to come outand debate this policy on any rational basis, or he may just begetting his resume ready because he realizes that, sooner orlater, the jig is up. Robert Bonner Former Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration Mr. Bonner relies on the same standard old arguments insupporting the drug war but, curiously, doesn't want to puthimself in a position where anyone can question him about what hesays. He has been given numerous opportunities to debate credibleproponents of drug policy reform but rarely accepts anyinvitation where he has any opposition at all. We believe it isbecause he realizes he really can't "hold his own" inthe drug policy debate. Senator Joseph Biden of the US Senate "What we do not need is a debate that treats our nation's serious drug problem as a political football; what we do not need are more charges of who should do more and who hasn't done enough." -Sen Joseph Biden April 28, 1996 Wilmington News Journal page A8 Joe, you really don't get the point, do you? The point, Joe,is your fundamental ignorance of many facets of the issues. Thepurpose of a debate is to educate people like you. Open andhonest discussion of the issues has always been a fundamentalpart of the American political process - clear back to the dayswhen George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were still growinghemp. The following are some of his quotes, or close to them: (Mostof this section is supplied by Scott Ehlers.) "General McCaffrey, you should take this administration by the ears...If they don't give you real power, then you should quit"; (That ought to be a short job.) "this war must be fought on the streets of every community"; (That's OUR community you are talking about fighting a war in, Joe.) "hard-core addicts must face swift and tough punishment even if they are first-time or nonviolent offenders"; (OK, there are about 2.7 million of them and not a single available jail cell. Tell me how that works out, Joe.) "gratuituous violence is due to cocaine users...you can bet they're on cocaine" (Joe, you just proved you haven't read the Federal Government's own reports on this issue. Start with Psychoactive Substances and Violence by the Department of Justice, -- click on the title there and you can read the whole thing.) "Bill Bennett was the best drug czar because he hollered, and I hope you'll holler as well Gen. McCaffrey" (Personally, I want more out of Government officials than the ability to holler - especially when what he is hollering doesn't make any sense anyway.) "Just act, we don't need any more studies...we've done plenty of studies...don't listen to the people." (Would you care to share with us any of those studies that you have read? I have a number of them on these web pages and not one of them agrees with this drug policy. See the list - Major Studies of Drug Policy) Biden also added some interesting new "facts" to therecord that I was not aware of, namely: the Harrison Act waspassed in 1917; there was more drug education in 1923 than thereis today; and 10 to 20 times more drugs were confiscated underMcCaffrey than under his predecessors. (Yes, this is a U.S.Senator and according to him, he's been studying the drug problemfor 20 years!) Joe Biden has been a major supporter of the War on Some Drugsfor many years. His obvious ignorance of the basic facts aboutthe issue is all the more shocking, considering he is one of themajor congressional leaders and has been ranting about this foryears. He has admitted on several occasions that our drug policyclearly leaves something to be desired but, for Joe at least, anhonest discussion of the issues - and how to make our policybetter - is out of the question. Unless you already agree withhis preconceived notions, don't bother to call. Joe Biden is up for re-election again in 1996, so the obviousquestions come up: Will Joe Biden ever have the courage to face someone from the"legalization" camp in an open and honest debate? Iseriously doubt it. An open and honest debate would mean thatthose long, rambling, say-nothing statements he makes would besubject to some real examination. My personal opinion is that hewould look like a major fool in short order against any of thetop advocates for reform. Who should you vote for if you live in Delaware? Clearly,anybody more honest and forthright on the issue than Joe Biden -such as any candidate who is willing to discuss his ideas in anopen forum and put them to an honest test. I have included links to a page on Joe Biden, and another pageby one of his opponents so you can judge for yourself. JoeBiden's Vote Smart Page Mark Jones for Senate Send Joe Biden somee-mail - Tell him he is listed here, and Cliff Schaffer iscalling him out for a debate. The only thing you will get inresponse is a massive clucking sound. Dr. Eric Voth Dr. Voth's List of Research - whereinhe finds support for his position. The list is most curiousbecause much of the information listed plainly does not supporthis point of view. Dr. Voth is one of the Grand Poobahs of Drug WatchInternational and a few other pro-prison organizations and iswell-known for histrionic appearances before congressionalcommittees where, to hear him tell it, the entire future ofcivilization rests on the grand plan to incarcerate every potsmoker. (Dr. Voth, when you read this, please remember that Iwill be glad to post any statements you want to make about theissue, including a rebuttal of everything I say here - but lookout, because that will probably start the debate you are tryingso hard to avoid.) I have had several private e-mail conversations with him andit is quite clear that Dr. Voth would be no match for me oranyone I have trained and would quickly look quite foolish infront of all but the most extreme audiences. Dr. Voth's initial tactic, like those of the Drug WatchInternational folks in general, is to try to turn the wholedebate into a series of personal attacks. I had extremedifficulty in getting him to address any substantive issue aboutdrugs because he kept making accusations against everyone in thedrug-policy reform movement. For example: He said that the drug policy reform movement was composed of a bunch of drug addicts. I pointed out to him that simple logic should tell him this was wrong. Why would anyone want to try to organize a bunch of drug addicts? The reasons they would not be good activists seem pretty obvious to me. He said that the real force behind the movement was a bunch of people like Dick Cowan (formerly head of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) who wanted the laws changed just so they could get stoned and so they could get rich selling pot after the laws were changed. I can't tell you all of Dick Cowan's reasoning for wanting the laws changed but it is my clear impression that neither one of these two reasons are high up on the list. As for making money from pot after it is legal, I don't think Dick Cowan is stupid enough to believe that he could. (Dick can correct me, if I am wrong.) If anyone wanted to make money from pot, the best time to do it would be under the current policy. But, the bottom line is that Dick Cowan's motives (or any other individual's motives) don't really have much to do with the issue of whether it makes sense to incarcerate millions of people for drug offenses. As I pointed out to Dr. Voth, Dick Cowan may not know any more about this issue than Dr. Voth does. Dr. Voth persisted in this kind of routine for quite sometime, until I finally hit him with a long list of corruption anddishonesty on the other side, starting with the lies told byHarry Anslinger starting in 1937. People who live in glass housesshouldn't throw stones. Once I hit him back, he stopped that routine (a little) and wewent on to some *real* issues, but the conversation was marked byhis inability to answer almost any question I asked him. Forexample: He claims he is a "world-renowned expert" on marijuana, and especially marijuana addiction. Yet, it is obvious to me that he has never read many of the basic research texts that I have posted on this web page and is woefully ignorant of many other facets of the subject. As one small example, he is not familiar with the various ways in which cannabis can be consumed medically. I pointed him to the web pages, especially the work of Dr. Tod Mikuriya, but it is doubtful if he will ever bother to read it. I asked him to provide me with his credentials and the full text of any research he has done on the issue, or that he thinks is important to understanding the issue. I assured him that I would post anything he sends me unaltered. So far he hasn't come forth with a single page of anything but his personal opinions. On the other hand, I have received reams of information from many other "experts" on the issue, including people with better medical credentials than Dr. Voth. He says that he supports the use of cannabinoids as medicine but wants people to use "medicines", not "potions." It occurred to me that, since the active ingredient in Marinol, an FDA-approved prescription drug, comes directly from the marijuana plant, that the difference between a "medicine" and a "potion", was very much the same as the difference between a Vitamin C tablet and an orange. Some patients, it would seem, would naturally prefer the "medicine" (the tablet), while others would prefer the "potion" (the orange). I asked him to explain what I had missed, but he had no response. Most interesting is Dr. Voth's response to my request for adebate. He said the conditions would have to be right. I told himthat my conditions were pretty simple: Any time, any place, anyaudience, any rules - just show up. Dr. Voth's terms for a debate were quite a bit different. Theyare: The forum needs to be high visibility such as a major media event like national talk show, news show, etc. I suggested any number of possible forums, including online, taped radio or TV appearances, etc. He said all of them could be edited to make him look foolish. (No editing required for that.) I even suggested that we do it online and then post matching transcripts on our respective web pages with links to each other - just so we could make sure that neither one of us had done any editing. No dice. No pro-legalization forum. Either a totally neutral audience or something on his turf. (One should note that a totally neutral audience would be almost impossible to find. I don't really see what the audience has to do with it anyway - they just watch, they don't participate.) He wants all his costs covered. (That shouldn't be a problem, I know lots of people who would buy tickets just to watch him fall). In short, Dr. Voth just isn't very eager for a public debatewith any knowledgeable opponent. He seems to have a lot to saywhen nobody has the microphone but him, but he quickly craps outwhen faced with any significant opposition. If you happen to read about Dr. Voth in the newspaper, or seehim on the media, make it a point to write to the media sourceand include a copy of this segment of the Chicken Page. Dr. Kim Edward Light Dr. Light has a relatively small (by comparison to any ofours) web site devoted to a few articles making poorly documentedand plainly illogical arguments against "legalization."His web page invites responses and even purports to maintain acommentary area where people can comment, but he has neverresponded to any invitation to debate, or even any comments onhis web page that anyone can determine. We invite Dr. Light tojoin us in debate. We don't expect that he will do so any timesoon.

Mercer Street, Suite 104 Seattle, Washington 98119 May 12, 1994 Dear Friends, Law enforcement has a responsibility to be involved in theprevention of all illegal or harmful activities. At this time inour nation's history, there is no crime problem of graverconsequence than the drug problem. While law enforcement acts asa deterrent to drug abuse and drug trafficking, we know that thelong-term answer to the drug problem goes beyond traditional lawenforcement actions. In 1987, the Drug Enforcement Administration initiated a drugprevention and education program when Special Agents wereassigned as Demand Reduction Coordinators in each of the agency's19 field divisions. With limited resources they have providedsupport, assistance and training to grassroots organizations.Many requests are for information on the issue of druglegalization. Lee P. Brown, the Director of the Office of National DrugControl Policy stated in the 1993 Interim National Drug ControlStrategy, "Drug use among our nation's youth has droppedsince its peak in 1985 and 1986, prompting some to conclude thatthe drug problem, if not over, is no longer a crisis. Thisconclusion is as dangerous as it is wrong. The loss of publicfocus has also allowed the voices of those who would promotelegalization to ring more loudly and be heard more clearly. Thedeclines thus far in the use of drugs are in part because theyare illegal. Legalization is a formula for self-destruction. The[Clinton] Administration is unequivocally opposed to any 'reform'that is certain to increase drug use." S/A Tom Pool has compiled and edited a list of the most commonarguments used by proponents of drug legalization. Thesearguments fall into eleven general areas, hence the elevenchapters in the attached manual. These arguments are analyzed andinformation is provided to defeat these arguments. This manual will be revised and expanded. I solicit thereaders to assist us by submitting comments, position papers,research, and documented sources of information to: S/A Tom Pool - Demand Reduction Coordinator Drug Enforcement Administration 220 West Mercer Street, Suite 104 Seattle, WA 98119 Tel: (206) 553-5443 I hope that this "debate manual" will proveuseful to the police officers, parents, teachers, and othersfaced with the myths and misconceptions of drug legalization.

Schaffer July 15, 1993 On December 28, 1992 I wrote to Judge James P. Gray of OrangeCounty, California to ask him to help me draft a letter whichprominent people could sign, and ask others to sign, to show thatthey were united in demanding major reform of our national drugpolicy. Judge Gray, Dr. Clarke Smith, and I, wrote the bulk ofthe wording of what was to become known as the Hoover Resolution.By happy coincidence, Kathy Smith, the wife of Dr. Clarke Smith,arranged a meeting with Dr. Milton Friedman and Joseph McNamarato discuss the resolution. News of the meeting spread farther andmore quickly than even we had intended and, before we knew it, wehad a list of attendees for the meeting which included some ofthe world's most prominent citizens and internationallyrecognized experts on drug abuse, some of whom have been in thefield for more than fifty years. On February 26, 1992 we met at the Hoover Institution atStanford University, finalized the wording, and signed theresolution which calls for an objective Federal Commission toreview the evidence on drug policy and to form a new drug policywhich does not do so much harm. A list of these signers isenclosed. The purpose of the resolution is to 1) draft a statement whichall fair-minded people would agree with, and thus build aconsensus for reform and 2) call for concrete action for reform. Reaction to the resolution has been beyond our wildest dreams.The mayors and chiefs of police of San Francisco, Oakland, andSan Jose held an unprecedented joint press conference to publiclysign the resolution. Major medical organizations, religiousorganizations, and literally dozens of judges, law enforcementofficials, and others have publicly announced their support ofthe Hoover Resolution and the call for a Federal Commission toreview and rewrite drug policy. We are also beginning to receivemajor support for the resolution from around the world. Therewill be more news about this later. The resolution has received major news coverage across thenation, including an excellent article by Federal Judge Jack B.Weinstein in the NY Times, July 8, 1993, and a call for theFederal Commission by three Federal judges on Nightline on (orabout) July 10, 1993. It has also received a combined total ofseveral complete pages of coverage in the LA Times, the SanFrancisco Examiner, and the SF Chronicle, the Oakland Tribune,the San Jose News-Mercury, the Baltimore Sun, Newsweek (June 14,1993), and many, many others. It has received more favorable newscoverage for drug policy reform than any other single event ofthe last twenty-five years. Some of the original signers of the resolution support"legalization" or "decriminalization".However, we do not ask anyone to support or endorse anyparticular approach to the drug problem. We simply ask everyoneto admit that the current drug policy has not worked and that itis time to review the evidence in an open and honest commissionand to form a new drug policy which does not do so much harm --whatever that policy may be. Let's lay the facts on the table,and let the chips fall where they may. I have enclosed a copy of the resolution, along with a list ofsigners, and some of the more important facts relative to drugpolicy. We (the signers of the Hoover Resolution), ask that you signthe Resolution and send a copy to President Bill Clinton, TheWhite House, Washington, DC. We also ask that you ask others tosign the resolution and send it in to Bill Clinton. If theResolution is signed or endorsed by any groups or organizationswe ask that you send those endorsements to: C. A. Schaffer, P.O.Box 1430, Canyon Country, CA 91386-1430. Please remember that we are not asking you to endorselegalization, or decriminalization, or any other approach todrugs. We are simply asking you to admit that the time has cometo re-examine the facts and fairly investigate other possibleapproaches.

Therefore be it resolved that our society mustrecognize drug use and abuse as the medical and social problemsthat they are and that they must be treated with medical andsocial solutions; and Further be it resolved that an objective commission beimmediately empowered by the President and by Congress torecommend revision of the drug laws of these United States inorder to reduce the harm our current policies are causing.

Resolution Whereas, the overall situation regarding the use of drugs inour society and the crime and misery that accompanies it hascontinued to deteriorate for several decades; and Whereas, our society has continued to attempt, at enormousfinancial cost, and loss of civil liberties, to resolve drugabuse problems through the criminal justice system, with theaccompanying increases of prisons and numbers of inmates; and Whereas, the huge untaxed revenues generated by the illicitdrug trade are undermining legitimate governments world-wide; and Whereas, the present system has spawned a cycle of hostilityby the incarceration of disproportionate numbers ofAfrican-Americans, Hispanics, and other minority groups; and Whereas, the number of people who have contracted AIDS,hepatitis, and other diseases from contaminated hypodermicneedles is epidemic under our present system; and Whereas, in our society's zeal to pursue our criminalapproach, legitimate medical uses for the relief of pain andsuffering of patients have been suppressed. Therefore be it resolved that our society must recognize druguse and abuse as the medical and social problems that they areand that they must be treated with medical and social solutions;and Further be it resolved that an objective commission beimmediately empowered by the President and by Congress torecommend revision of the drug laws of these United States inorder to reduce the harm our current policies are causing.

Drug use and addictioncontribute to the breakdown of our families, the abuse of adultsand children, the spread of HIV/AIDS, school dropouts and thedeclining quality of education, homelessness, urban decay, highhealth care costs, and low economic productivity that compromisesour ability to compete in the global marketplace. We must reducethe number of people who use drugs and the number of people withthe disease of addiction to significantly improve the mostpressing domestic issues we face. Drug use is a preventablebehavior and drug addiction is a treatable disease. 1. We, the nation's mayors, reject all proposals tolegalize illicit drugs. This is not the answer to the drugproblem in our cities. We reject legalization, and othersimplistic forms such as decriminalization, because it is morallyreprehensible to consider an action that would a) simultaneouslyerode our children's anti-drug attitudes of perceived risk andsocial disapproval and b) make harmful and addictive drugs farmore accessible to far more people. We support the medical use ofany drug that research proves is safe and effective underguidelines established by the Food and Drug Administration. Whilewe support attempts to reduce harm, we believe that the way todecrease such problems is to prevent drug use from starting andto help those who are already in trouble with drugs. 2. Prevention works: We have achieved real progressin decreasing drug use and in understanding what works. Since1979, dramatic increases in public attitudes of perceived riskand social disapproval toward illicit drugs produced a decline ofnearly 50 percent in the number of first-time users andnonaddicted users through all segments of the population.Throughout the nation, drug prevention efforts came together atthe community level-in families, schools, the media, lawenforcement, youth groups and workplaces-to establish nonuse asthe behavioral standard and social norm. This progress inprevention has also significantly reduced the numbor of peoplewho would have become addicted. 3. However, diminishing resources and public focusnow threaten future success. The gains so preciously earnedin anti-drug attitudes and declining use are now threatened.Since the early 1990s there has been decreased attention to thedrug issue and increased pro-drug and pro-legalization publicity.This has contributed to a reversal in the attitudes ofperceived risk and social disapproval that distinguish nonusersfrom users, and significant increases in the number ofyoung people using illicit drugs. Finally, and despiteincreasing evidence of the cost-effectiveness of drug treatment,we have made little progress in reducing the number of peoplealready addicted. This reflects a current system that can treatonly one-fifth of the estimated 6 million people in trouble withdrugs. 4. We must provide significantly greater resourcesand leadership-from governmental, corporate and nonprofit sectorsat national, state and local levels-for the demand reductionefforts of prevention, intervention, treatment and research. Effectivedrug policy requires investment in both supply and demandreduction, but our nation is not providing enough funding forprevention or treatment. These are proven, cost-effectivesolutions for reducing both drug use and addiction and theirimpact on other critical domestic problems. Initial drug use is amatter of choice, and with sufficient resources, we can influencethat choice positively. When addiction overtakes choice, we cantreat addiction for those who require it. Our focus must combineefforts to reduce both the number of people who use and thenumber of people who are addicted to illicit drugs. a) Preventing drug use by young people, and by allwho influence them, must be the cornerstone of national, stateand local drug strategies and resources if we are to build safeand healthy families and communities. We must reestablish andaffirm the individual choice to remain drug-free. We mustconsistently reinforce the message that drug use is harmful andunacceptable. This message is vital to preventing drugexperimentation and reducing drug use before it becomesaddiction. We must effectively influence the decisions our youngpeople make about illicit drugs by providing drug education athome and in school and by involving local law enforcementofficers and judges, the faith community, health careprofessionals, the media, employers, and other communityresources. Comprehensive community prevention programssignificantly reduce adolescent drug use. We support the recentlycreated National Prevention League, designed to coordinateprevention efforts and to emphasize the need for prevention asthe first priority in reducing substance abuse. b) We must make treatment more available, more effectiveand more accessible if we are to reduce the impact of drugs inour cities. Treatment is critical to reducing the socialpathology conveyed by those already addicted to drugs. Most acuteis the lack of treatment for those who are least able to functionor whose drug involvement has profound implications forthemselves, their families and society at large. People in thecriminal justice system, pregnant women and women with children,the homeless, and those infected with HlV/AlDS face intolerableshortages of treatment slots. Early intervention in the drugabuse process, aimed especially at adolescents but includingadults as well, decreases harm and increases rehabilitation. c) Law enforcement must remain a strongcomponent of, and be better linked to, demand reduction efforts. Onthe national, state and especially the local level, lawenforcement and the judicial system are critical to the successof preventing and treatingdrug abuse. We need to increasecooperation among law enforcement agencies and between lawenforcement and prevention and treatment programs within thecommunity. d) Research is critical to understanding,replicating and improving the effectiveness and cost efficiencyof demand reduction efforts. Research, not ideology, mustprovide the foundation for drug policies and practices. Moreresearch is needed to improve our understanding of the ways drugsaffect the brain and change behavior, of the reasons forreversing drug attitude and use trends, of the importance ofcommunity-based prevention programs, and of why particulartreatment approaches are more successful than others. e) Worldwide cooperation in reducing illicit drugabuse will not only help the international community, butalso will reduce the flow of drugs into our cities. Thespread of illicit drugs throughout Europe and other parts of theworld imperils our ability to reduce drug abuse in our cities. Wesupport European Cities Against Drugs, which organized last yearto fight the legalization movement abroad. Today, we announce theformation of American Cities Against Drugs to support our sisterorganization in Europe and similar organizations that may formthroughout the world. We believe that reducing drug abuse is essential to themost important things all Americans care about: our childrenand families, our safety, our neighborhoods and communities,our health, our economy, our freedom to grow and prosper and ourobligation as citizens to help each other build healthy familiesand communities. We must maintain our public will. We must elicitleadership from all segments of society, especially fromindividuals and communities. We must recognize that each of ushas a role to play in the solution and all of us have a stake inthe outcome. Drug abuse is a preventable behavior and drugaddiction is a treatable disease. We, the Mayors of the UnitedStates of America, commit ourselves to reducing drug abuse bymobilizing our citizens and concentrating our resources toprevent this behavior and treat this disease.

Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | The Drug Legalization Debate The Drug Legalization Debate: What's the Real Issue? By Clifford A. Schaffer This document attempts to define the real areas of agreementand disagreement between those who support the war on drugs, andthose who do not. The statements I make below about the beliefsof the respective sides are based on my personal experience withtalking and debating with literally thousands of people over thelast several years. While the opinions I give below will varyfrom person to person, they hold true for the vast majority ofpeople I have encountered on each side. Why I wrote this. Debates about drug policy can get to be pretty complicatedpretty quickly. Some of the reasons for this are obvious - drugabuse is a problem with many causes and effects throughoutsociety. It would be perfectly easy to get involved in discussingthe details of one aspect of the drug problem and to lose sightof the problem as a whole. Also, I have noticed a consistent tendency among supporters ofthe drug war to be confused about the real issues. For example,they often tend to assume that anyone who supports drug policyreform must be a drug user, or someone who favors or wants topromote the use of drugs. This, of course, is not the case atall. Many of the supporters of reform are people who have neverused illegal drugs and have no intention of using them. Or theytend to ask things like "Why do you want to make more crackbabies?" The truth is that no one in their right mind wantsto see more crack babies and those who support reform do sobecause they believe that better policies could reduce the numberof crack babies. In this document I will attempt to summarize the variousfacets of our approach to drug policy and define where thereseems to be agreement or disagreement between those who supportreform, and those who support the drug war. Is drug use immoral? Opinion varies on both sides, although drug war supporters areclearly more likely to feel that drug use is intrinsicallyimmoral. But there are also people on the side of reform who haveessentially the same feelings about drug use. That is, many supporters of reform ("legalization")do not approve of drug use or abuse in any way and even feel thatit is "immoral". Are drugs dangerous? Both sides agree that drugs can be dangerous to some people.Supporters of reform will point out that the legal drugs are moredangerous than the illegal drugs, so the laws don't relate tothis argument anyway. Supporters of the drug war seem to make the illogical leapthat because drugs are dangerous or immoral, therefore the bestapproach to the problem is to throw people in prison. This, ofcourse, is illogical. There are lots of problems in society whichare either dangerous and/or immoral, but that doesn't mean thatprison is the best solution to all of them. Should we have more treatment? Both sides seem to agree that there should be more and betterdrug treatment. Should we have more education? Both sides seem to agree that there should be more and bettereducation on drugs. Should we have better prevention efforts? Both sides seem to agree that we should have more and betterefforts to prevent people from becoming involved with drugs inthe first place. (As long as "prevention" does notinclude criminal punishment.) What about the medical uses? For recognized medicines, such as morphine, both sides agreethat doctors should be free to prescribe it where necessary. Thesupporters of the drug war generally don't seem to recognize orunderstand why it is not being prescribed where necessary. For marijuana, the supporters of the drug war are of mixedopinion. Some support the medical use of marijuana, or at leastsee the futility in persecuting people who are sick, even if itwasn't good for them. Others, the more extreme drug warriors,maintain that marijuana has no medical uses at all, or that otherdrugs would do better. Criminal Punishment This is the only area where there is clear and consistentdisagreement between the two sides. Supporters of the drug war tend to feel that some drugs oughtto be illegal (people ought to be put in jail), in order todiscourage use, or to express society's disapproval. Supporters of reform say that criminal penalties for privatedrug possession and use are senseless and destructive.

I am appending the companion notes to the end. Textbetween brackets [] is description or commentary and not part ofthe actual transcript. I'd like to draw your attention to companion notes that I puttogether for this talk. They're located on the tables out backthere, and I think that those of you who are doing CLE have themin your manuals. Well, I'm going to attempt to descend into the murky depthsof political philosophy and Constitutional analysis. At theoutset, I do have a caveat: the arguments I am going to bepresenting have never been endorsed by Congress or the courts andI hope that during the question and answer session we can getinto this in a little bit more detail. The thesis that I want to advance today is that the drug warand the laws that prohibit the private consumption of certaindrugs are un-Constitutional. Prohibition laws, themselves,violate every tenet of limited government that is embodied in ourConstitution. To begin, let me pose a question: why was it necessary toamend the Constitution in order to prohibit the drug alcohol?And, while you are cogitating on that: how is it possible toprohibit other drugs without going through the formal amendmentprocess? Well, I think, in order to answer these questions, it'snecessary to take a look at what the Constitution is supposed tobe. At the recent confirmation hearings of Judge Clarence Thomas(uh, Clarence Thomas, by the way, -- he and I have at least twothings in common: we're both ex marijuana users [chuckles fromthe audience], and we're both married to attorneys) -- in anycase, there was a lot of discussion at the hearings about naturallaw and natural rights. Just about all of the participants seemedto agree that our system recognizes the existence of"inalienable" natural rights and that government existsto "secure" those rights for its citizens. It's just aswell that they agreed on that -- the architects of our system ofgovernment, in fact, had that principle in mind, and they viewedthe Constitution as being a blueprint for a limited government inwhich those powers that were to be made available to the federalgovernment would be listed. If a power is not listed in theConstitution, it is not supposed to be available to the Federalgovernment. Two hundred odd years ago, when the Bill of Rights --which we're here to celebrate -- was being debated, there werethose who opposed the Bill of Rights on the grounds that, uh,they're completely unnecessary. It's redundant -- the rightsalready exist and therefore they don't have a place in theConstitution. In fact, they made the argument that a Bill ofRights is dangerous because at some future point in time, peoplewould get the idea that if a right wasn't to be found in theConstitution -- like privacy -- it did not exist. Perhaps thebest articulation I've ever seen of this principle is to be foundin _The Federalist Papers_. [I hold up a paperback of _The Federalist Papers_.] Alexander Hamilton writing in Federalistnumber 84 -- and I'll just read some of this out to you. He says: "... bills of rights, in the sense and in the extent inwhich they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in theproposed constitution, but would even be dangerous." And then his argument is: "For why declare that things shall not be done whichthere is no power to do? Why for instance, should it be said,that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when nopower is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will notcontend that such a provision would confer a regulating power;but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed tousurp, a plausible pretence for claiming that power. They mighturge with a semblance of reason, that the constitution ought notto be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuseof an authority, which was not given, and that the provisionagainst restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clearimplication, that a power to prescribe proper regulationsconcerning it, was intended to be vested in the nationalgovernment. This", he concluded, "may serve as aspecimen of the numerous handles which would be given to thedoctrine of constructive powers, by the indulgence of aninjudicious zeal for bills of rights." Good writer, Mr. Hamilton. [I gestured with the book and putit aside.] Well, anyway, as we know, Hamilton's view did notprevail and 10 of the 12 Amendments that were proposed as a Billof Rights were ratified in December of 1791. In order to mollify critics and meet the arguments of peoplelike Hamilton, language was added to the Bill of Rights toaddress this idea of limited government and natural rights. I just happen to have a copy of the Constitution here --don't leave home without it [I hold up my pocket copy of theConstitution]-- and I'll read the language that bears on this. "The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rightsshall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained bythe people." That's the 9th Amendment, this lays out that whole idea ofrights existing apart from the Constitution. And then we have: "The powers not delegated to the United States by theConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved tothe States respectively, or to the people." That's the 10th Amendment and that has to do with delegationof powers and the idea of limited government. Well, let's go back to those questions. I think the answer tothe first question is fairly straightforward -- this idea ofalcohol prohibition. We were talking about a new power that wasbeing acquired -- surrendered by the people and the states - andso the 18th Amendment was passed to give that power to theFederal government. In the case of our second question --prohibiting other drugs -- I would argue that we are talkingabout new powers being granted to the Federal government thathave never been surrendered by the people and the states. Ergo,the drug war, prohibition laws, the DEA, the whole ball of wax,are all unconstitutional. I think what we have here is a primeexample of the illegal acquisition of powers by a centralgovernment through a process of slow accretion. And this wasexactly the sort of thing Hamilton was warning against back in1787. If it is the case the federal government can't get involvedin the prohibition business, what about the state governments?Uh, I think one answer to this is to look at the right of privacywhich is protected by the 9th Amendment and extended to thestates by the 14th. The right has been invoked to protect privacyin such areas as family planning -- birth control -- and, atleast so far, the right of privacy seems to be protecting awoman's choice whether or not to have an abortion. Furthermore,this same right should apply in matters involving an individual'sdecision to consume, privately, a recreational drug in his or herhome. One argument that might militate against this idea of a rightof privacy taking precedence might be -- uh, well, what if thepeople who use drugs are infringing on the rights of otherpeople. For example, users of cocaine and opiates. Is there acompelling state interest -- is there some kind of balancing testthat we can apply that gives the state the right to intervene? I'd like to pose a hypothetical here that we can use for thepurposes of analysis. Let's posit the existence of a drug that is100% addicting and potentiates violence in its users 100% of thetime. I think we'd have a very clear case of there being acompelling state interest to get itself involved in prohibitingthis drug on the grounds that the state is protecting the rightsof the non-users. Well, suppose we begin reducing thosepercentages. Let's suppose that we're talking about a drug thatis 15% addictive and potentiates violence in some lesserpercentage of its users. We have an empirical answer for that: I've just described alcohol. And, just for another forinstance, let's suppose that we have a drug that is 90% addictivebut doesn't seem to correlate with violence at all. Again,empirically we have an answer: I've just described cigarettes. I would argue that pharmacological and population data can beadduced to compare alcohol and tobacco with other drugs likeopiates and cocaine derivatives. And, if we do this, we find thatalcohol is, in fact, more addictive than many forms of opiatesand many forms of cocaine although less addictive than crackcocaine. Furthermore, smoked tobacco is generally recognized asbeing the most addictive drug around. That other area, having todo with violence and anti-social behavior, once again we findthat the drug that is the greatest potentiator of violentbehavior is alcohol. And if we look at the other drugs likeopiates and cocaine, we find that most of the violence that isassociated with these drugs is associated with the blackmarket/organized crime component of the drug trade and is not apharmacological feature of the drug itself. Well, I'm the political coordinator of the Hoosier CannabisRe-legalization Coalition, and I haven't said a word aboutmarijuana yet and I probably should -- uh -- marijuana, which isthe Nation's number one illegal drug, which is estimated to havebeen used by over 60 million people, is recognized as beingrelatively non-addictive. For a point of comparison, if we lookat the common drug caffeine -- which I was dosing myself withearlier today -- caffeine, which is in coffee and soft drinks, isgenerally recognized as being more addictive than marijuana. Furthermore, no scientific evidence has ever been broughtforth that would support the idea that marijuana leads toviolent, anti-social behavior. Thus, by no stretch of theimagination is there a rational or scientific justification formarijuana prohibition and, perforce, there is no marijuanaprohibition law that passes Constitutional muster. Moreover,using alcohol and tobacco as our metrics, even heroin and crackprohibition cannot be justified. At this point, it's probably time to boldly go where noConstitutional interpreter has gone before and so I'm going tomove into more speculative areas. The 1st Amendment, whichprotects religion and speech, I think also by extension protectsthought and belief. Well, what is the seat of religion, thoughtand belief? [A pregnant pause.] The brain, right? [Tapping mycranium.] In fact, speech and belief are manifestations of theinternal state of a person's brain. Science is beginning toinform us as to how chemicals and neurotransmitters, indeed thephysical "wiring" of our brain defines who we are andhow we think. Unless we get involved in metaphysics I think wehave to recognize that there is physical basis for belief. WhereI'm heading with this is that, if it is the case that yourphysical brain state determines whether you are a Methodist, anagnostic, or a Nazi then clearly the state of your brain isprotected in some sense. The question I'd like to put to you is:if it is the case that the 1st Amendment allows a person to alterhis or her cognitive system by reading "Mein Kampf" --which might well alter it permanently, you might become a Nazifor the rest of your life -- then how is it possible for thegovernment to step in and say that a person may not temporarilyalter his or her cognitive system for two or three hours bysmoking a marijuana joint? [Scattered applause.] Also, anotherway of looking at this same thing is, what is the rationale forsaying that programming your brain across the visual or auralpathways is OK but programming your brain _chemically_ across theblood-brain barrier is not? And finally -- uh, and I think that this is the mostfrightening prospect in this whole thing -- consider this: if astate government can come up to you and can say, you may not passdelta-9-THC -- the principal intoxicant in marijuana - you cannotpass that across your blood-brain barrier, what is to prevent astate from saying at some point in the future, you _must_ passdrug X -- let's call it soma like in _Brave New World_ -- youmust pass soma across your blood-brain barrier? I guess what I'marguing is that the government has intruded into your biochemicaland physiological brain and in principle, once the government cando this, then in principle the government can control any part ofyour body. I think I've just about wrapped up the general comments Iwanted to make. One thing I might suggest: we might also talkabout some specific areas where government has been in violationof Constitutional rights all at the behest of this drug war. Thank you. ---------------------companion notes totalk------------------- The Drug War and the Constitution by Paul Hager Companion Notes By focusing on the Constitutional dimension of drugprohibition, I've attempted to approach the issue from adifferent perspective. In claiming that the drug war and drugprohibition violate the U.S. Constitution and fundamentalprinciples of civil liberty I am aware that there is a dearth ofpresent day case law to support my arguments. Instead, I haverelied on the writings of Hamilton, Madison, and Jay in TheFederalist Papers and, to a lesser extent, selected writings ofThomas Jefferson that appear in Jefferson: Writings (Merrill D.Peterson wrote the notes and selected text, ISBN 0-940450-16-X). I assert that current prohibitionist policy entails a grantof power to government that was never contemplated and was, infact, explicitly rejected by the framers of the Constitution. The Harrison Act of 1914 was the first major step by theFederal government in the direction of drug prohibition. The 18thAmendment and the enabling legislation of the Volsted Act were tocome later, in 1919 and 1920 respectively. An excellent analysisof the case law interpreting the Harrison Act is to be found inArnold S. Trebach's book, The Heroin Solution (Yale UniversityPress, 1982, ISBN 0-300-02773-7), chapter 6. For a short overviewof drug prohibition "cycles" in U.S. History, and theplace of the Harrison Act in them, see "Opium, Cocaine, andMarijuana in American History", by David F. Musto,Scientific American, July 1991, volume 265, number 1. An excellent source on the "heroin problem" andpossible solutions is The Hardest Drug: Heroin and Public Policy, by John Kaplan (University of Chicago Press, 1983, ISBN0-226-42427-8). Professor Kaplan devotes the first two chaptersof the book to exploding the myths about heroin's addictivenessand dangers that have been used to justify its prohibition.Kaplan also argues that the Harrison Act was in large partresponsible for the development of many of the social problemsthat we now associate with heroin use and considers the Act tohave been a mistake. Unaccountably (given the foundation helays), Kaplan shies away from legalization strategies completelyand offers heroin maintenance programs with possible coercivetreatment as his alternative to the present approach. ArnoldTrebach, on the other hand, argues in his book that doctorsshould be allowed to prescribe heroin to addicts as needed and toinclude heroin in their pharmacopoeia. Trebach's legal analysisof the Harrison Act (mentioned above) is used to buttress hisargument in favor of a liberal interpretion of the Act.Interestingly, Kaplan, who considers the Act to have been amistake, favors a much more restrictive solution than doesTrebach who considers the Harrison Act to have been anappropriate piece of social engineering. On the subject of marijuana, John Kaplan is also the authorof a book entitled Marijuana -- the New Prohibition (1970).Kaplan argued convincingly for marijuana decriminalization inthis book. Arnold Trebach is currently the head of the DrugPolicy Foundation, an organization that seeks alternatives to thedrug war. The organization generally favors full legalization ofmarijuana but embraces a variety of opinion regarding changes inthe legal status of other drugs. The issue of "addictiveness" of drugs iscomplicated. The term itself has fallen into disfavor among thescientific establishment and "drug dependence" isgenerally preferred. I will stick with the more common term forsimplicity. It turns out that the picture of addiction that is afavorite with police departments and drug czars is far fromaccurate. In "The Tragedy of Needless Pain", (by RonaldMelzack, February 1990, Scientific American), scientific evidenceis presented that morphine used for pain relief is not addictive.Trebach notes statistics that gave a rate of 500,000 heroinaddicts and 3,500,000 "chippers" or non-addictedoccasional users in the late 1970's which would mean a 12.5%addiction rate. Laboratory studies show a higher rate but thesestudies use medical grade, pure heroin. In Health Consequences ofSmoking: Nicotine Addiction (Surgeon General's Report, 1988), acomparison is made of the relative addictiveness of smokedtobacco and several other drugs (the 15% figure for alcohol comesfrom this source). The Surgeon General's Report observes that ofservice men who became addicted to heroin in Vietnam,aproximatedly 90% were able to avoid readdiction upon return tothe U.S. The report also mentions the frequency of"chipping" in heroin use but notes that nonaddictedcigarette users are exceedingly rare. The addiction rate of 90%for cigarette smokers also derives from the Surgeon General'sReport. Other sources that give some picture of comparative addictioninclude "Drug Prohibition in the United States: Costs,Consequences, and Alternatives" by Ethan Nadelmann (Science,September 1, 1989). In building his case for drug legalization,Nadelmann cites National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) researchthat gives a surprisingly low value for cocaine addiction rates. A more complete comparision of addictive potentional is to befound in the magazine, In Health, in an article entitled"Hooked, not Hooked" by Deborah Franklin (Nov/Dec1990). Franklin cites addiction experts' rankings of variouslegal and illegal drugs as follows (p. 41): 1) Nicotine 2) "Ice" (smoked methamphetamine) 3) Crack 4) Crystal Meth (injected methamphetamine) 5) Valium (diazepam) 6-8) Quaalude 6-8) Seconal (secobarbital) 6-8) Alcohol 9-10) Crank (snorted methamphetamine) 9-10) Heroin 11) Cocaine 12) Caffeine 13) PCP 14) Marijuana 15) Ecstasy (MDMA) 16-18) Psilocybin Mushrooms 16-18) LSD 16-18) Mescaline (The rankings as they appear in the magazine are in the formof a bar graph -- I've converted them to a rank ordering. Notealso that, although amphetamine is broken down according to themethod of administration, other drugs with multiple modes ofadministration are not. I.V. injection will, for a number ofreasons, be more addicting than oral ingestion. Concentration isalso an important factor as well. Although the"potency" of heroin is considered to be 3 to 4 timesthat of morphine, heroin is actually diacetylmorphine -- morphinereacted with acetic anhydride. In the body, heroin breaks down tomorphine in order to produce its effect. Apparently, the"potency" of heroin is the result of the ease withwhich heroin crosses the blood-brain barrier before it breaksdown to morphine.) The Drug Policy Letter, Vol II, number 2, Mar/Apr 1990 (anewsletter published by the Drug Policy Foundation) uses a back-of-the-envelope calculation to expose the myth that "crackis the most addictive drug known to man." It is often saidthat if one uses crack just once, a person is addicted. Accordingto the NIDA-sponsored National Household Survey, 2.5 millionpeople have tried crack, and 480,000 used it in the month priorto the survey. Even if one assumed that anyone who used the drugin the past month was an addict, that would still give anaddiction rate of only 19%. Using this same method for alcoholwould give a 62% rate and, for powdered cocaine a 13% addictionrate. Though this is not the sort of analysis that should be usedto gauge addiction rates, it does give the lie to the "onepuff and you're hooked" claim. A number of the sources cited above present evidence thatviolent criminal activity associated with heroin and cocaine useis actually the result of the high cost of the drugs coupled withthe low socio-economic status of inner-city addicts. In otherwords, violent crime is not a pharmacological feature of the drugitself but a reflection of black market economics. The same DrugPolicy Letter cited above also reports on research done byGoldstein, Brownstein, Ryan, and Bellucci on the drug componentof violence in New York City. They found that only a very smallproportion of drug-related murders were a function of the drugitself and most of those were caused by alcohol. Heroin and otheropiates, in particular, are well known to not provoke aggressiveor violent behavior in people under the influence. Two monographs by Professor Bruce L. Benson and ProfessorDavid W. Rasmussen of the Policy Sciences Program of FloridaState University in Tallahassee give another view of drug use andviolent crime from the perspective of incarceration rates inFlorida. Benson and Rasmussen find that the overwhelming numberof people who have been arrested for a drug offense have noarrest history for a violent or property crime. (See "DrugOffenders in Florida", July 1990, and "Drug Crime andFlorida's Criminal Justice Problem", December 1990.) This isnot the result one would expect if the drug-violent crimeconnection were as intertwined as apologists for the drug warwould have us believe. Notes on Additional Materials Along with these notes, I'm including two additional items.The first is "Marijuana Myths", a collection of sometypical anti-marijuana and D.A.R.E. Program falsehoods and theirrefutation. Each of the numbered refutation sections has anassociated reference section which will allow readers to check mysources. The second item is Report #126 of the ABA Law StudentDivision which recommended that the ABA reverse its 18 yearposition favoring marijuana decriminalization. Report #126 offersno references of any kind, scientific or otherwise. This isunderstandable because most of its assertions are withoutscientific foundation. If this represents the sort of evidencethat is considered acceptable for a major policy reversal of theABA, I believe it reflects badly on the level of scholarshippracticed by the national organization. One item that appears in #126 deserves a comment. Much ismade of the increased potency of marijuana. In the Journal ofPsychoactive Drugs, Vol. 20(1), Jan-Mar 1988, Tod Mikuriya, M.D.and Michael Aldrich, Ph.D. address this matter in "Cannabis1988 Old Drug, New Dangers The Potency Question." In acareful piece of research, Mikuriya and Aldrich demonstrate thata review of independent, contemporary assays of importedmarijuana from the early 70's show it was every bit as potent asmodern domestic sensimilla varieties. (Anyone who has personalexperience with Thai Sticks, Panama Red, and Oaxacan in theperiod from the late 60's to early 70's can attest to the potencyof the imports.) They also reveal that improper DEA and policeevidence handling techniques (e.g., no refrigeration of seizedmarijuana) led to an underestimate of street potency in the 1970sbecause samples degraded rather quickly in evidence warehouses.Besides the country's illicit experience with marijuana, Mikuryaand Aldrich point to the extremely potent forms of cannabis(i.e., marijuana) tonics that were in common use in the UnitedStates prior to marijuana prohibition in the 1930's. Such tonicswere frequently given to children with no reported ill effects.Eli-Lilly and Parke, Davis, & Co. entered into a"joint" venture to produce a potent strain of domesticcannabis sativa for their cannabis pharmaceuticals which theycalled cannabis americana (note: a picture of the 1929Parke-Davis catalogue for "Cannabis U.S.P." can befound on page 113 of Dr. Andrew Weil's book, Chocolate toMorphine: Understanding Mind-Active Drugs, written with WinifredRosen, 1983, ISBN 0-395 -33108-0). Parke-Davis claimed uniformeffectiveness for their cannabis extract at a 10 milligram doselevel (the effective dose of pure delta-9-THC, the maincannabinoid, is between 25 and 50 micrograms per kilogram). Forthose who appreciate irony, take note that Parke-Davis, whichused to make a profit from selling legal cannabis, now makesmoney from marketing drug testing kits which primarily detectmarijuana use.

Cundiff,Ph.D. Appeared in: Claustrophobia, August 1994 In 1907, when Georgia and Oklahoma made the manufacture, sale,or transportation of intoxicating liquors illegal state wide, thehomicide rate in the United States was 1 person per 100,000 peryear.[2] Before the end of the decade, 13 states plusAlaska, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia had gone dry.[6]By 1919--when the 18th amendment was passed, making alcohol useillegal nationwide--the homicide rate had grown to 8 per 100,000.The murder rate climbed steadily until it peaked at 10 per100,000 around 1933, when our nation admitted its mistake, andrepealed the 18th amendment. By 1943 the homicide rate haddrastically shrunk to 5 per 100,000 and stayed near that leveluntil 1964 when the United States made the same mistake all overagain (see graphic).[2] In December of 1964, having been ratified by 40 countries, theSingle Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 went into effectrestricting narcotic drug use to medical and scientific purposes.It also internationally banned narcotic drug trade outside ofgovernment monopolies.[8] History was about to repeatitself. From 1964 to 1970 in the United States, the number ofstate prisoners incarcerated for drug offenses more than doubledfrom 3,079 to 6,596 (it was 90,000 in 1989)[9], and thenew concentration on enforcing victimless crimes caused thehomicide rate to skyrocket. Between 1964 and 1970 the homiciderate doubled from 5 per 100,000 to 10 per 100,000, where it hasremained, with minor fluctuations, until today.[2] LyndonJohnson had declared war on drugs, to be followed by RichardNixon declaring War on Drugs in 1969, Ronald Reagan declaring Waron Drugs in 1982, and George Bush declaring War on Drugs in 1989.[4] At the turn of the century, both heroin and aspirin werelegally available and sold for approximately the same amount.Today aspirin can be purchased at the corner drug store for 20cents per gram; heroin costs $50 per gram. [p. 33, 3] Theprice of heroin rose drastically after it was made illegal due tothe dangers involved in its sale. Dealers are willing to killeach other for profits obtained from such a lucrative market;junkies are willing to rob and kill for money to support theirhabit--money, if drugs were legal and cheap, that they couldeasily obtain by working at McDonald's. You and I, through highcrime rates caused by the War on Drugs and high tax rates used tosupport the War on Drugs, pay the price. During prohibition"liquor store" owners murdered each other to protecttheir turf just as drug dealers do today. Today, liquor storeowners are generally peaceful. Eliminating the enormous profitsinvolved in black-market businesses eliminates the motive forviolent crime, and therefore the violent crime. More law enforcement is commonly touted as the answer toAmerica's violent crime problem. Since 1970 the percentage of theAmerican population in prison has tripled with no noticeableeffect on the homicide rate.[2] More than 1.3 millioncitizens are now in jail.[p. 24, 3] The United States hasa larger percentage of its population in prison than any othernation[2], and still maintains the highest homicide ratein the industralized world. [1] We have even thrown away parts ofour constitution in the name of fighting crime. Asset forfeiturelaws allow law enforcement officers to seize the property ofAmerican citizens without even charging them with a crime, eventhough the 5th amendment to the constitution clearly states"No person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, orproperty, without due process of law..." Of course if youwant your property back you do have the right to post a bond andtry to prove yourself innocent, of a crime you have not even beencharged with, in a court of law. No attorney will be provided foryou if you cannot afford one. Over $2.4 billion worth of assetshave been seized since 1985, $664 million in 1991 alone--and in80% of the cases no charges were ever filed.[7] Disparities between the poor and the rich are often consideredcauses of our high crime rate, but the United States has not onlyone of the world's highest crime rates, but also one of theworld's largest middle classes. The religious right claimsAmerica's huge crime rate is caused by a break-down of familyvalues. This would require family values breaking down suddenlyin 1907, returning in 1933, and suddenly breaking down again in1964. Many liberals believe that America's large crime rate isdue to our lack of gun-control laws, but America's gun-controlpolicy has changed little throughout this century. There is noway gun control can explain the enormous fluctuations inAmerica's homicide rate. The United States government's substancecontrol policies are the only answer. The only way to lowerAmerica's violent crime rate, short of turning the United Statesinto a totalitarian state, is through ending the War on Drugs. The growing list of people who support decriminalization ofdrugs in America include: WilliamF. Buckley, George Carlin, George Crockett, Alan Dershowitz,Phil Donahue, Hugh Downs, MiltonFriedman, Ira Glasser, Michael Kinsley, David Letterman, JohnMcLaughlin, Andy Rooney, Carl Sagan, Kurt Schmoke, Tom Selleck,George Shultz, George Silver, Tom Snyder, Robert Sweet, ThomasSzasz, Garry Trudeau, and Donald Trump.[5] Organizations opposed to the War on Drugs include the Cato Institute, the Libertarian Party, the National Organization for the Reformof Marijuana Laws, and the ReasonFoundation.

The Declaration of Independence states thatthe rights to "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit ofHappiness" are "unalienable" rights, i.e., rightsthat are incapable of being sold or transferred. The preamble tothe Constitution states that one of the purposes of theConstitution is to "secure the blessings of liberty toourselves and our posterity". The Ninth Amendment states,"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shallnot be construed to deny or disparage others retained by thepeople." Clearly, the rights to liberty and to the pursuitof happiness, specifically mentioned in the Declaration ofIndependence, are retained by the people. Many people take drugsto pursue happiness. Thus, any law that denies them the libertyto take drugs is unconstitutional. Q.E.D. Some people pursue and attain happiness in noother way than by taking drugs; they work all day so that theycan pay for and enjoy drugs after work and on weekends. TheConstitution, which views people not as statistical averages butas individuals, should protect each drug user until such time ashe or she actually harms another person. Of course, as we allknow, the Supreme Court does not base its decisions on logic,therefore it would be very difficult to have the laws againstdrugs declared unconstitutional even though an irrefutable casecan be made in ten seconds. It might be argued that the need to"promote the general welfare" overrides the need to"secure the blessings of liberty", but that argument isspecious. The prohibition of alcohol caused social chaos; and,although reliable statistics are difficult to obtain because ofthe illegality, it is probably safe to say that prohibitionresulted in more people drinking than ever before, including manychildren and many who were poisoned by bad booze. Also,prohibition consolidated the position of organized crime inAmerica. The prohibition of drugs is having a similar, and worse,effect. This is only natural. Not much good can result fromlegislation that is inherently immoral. (As Brent [1] points out,one possible "good" result of prohibition is that,after some members of the Afro-American race or the Hispanicraces consolidate their positions as drug bosses, they can allythemselves with the establishment and become part of the rulingclass, start legitimate businesses, send their children to the"best" schools, etc., as did some members of otherundervalued races before them, e.g., the Kennedys.) Many Americans may be willing to repeal (drug)prohibition because it is impractical; but, some of them may beoffended when they are told that they must repeal prohibitionbecause it is immoral. Moreover, it is bound to be difficult toget the average American to recognize that the drug problem ismerely a symptom of a corrupt and inefficient social and economicsystem. Nevertheless, I must reveal the whole truth as I perceiveit no matter how unpopular it may be. I cannot imagine thatanything positive will be achieved by discussing only what is"politically acceptable" and inoffensive. Even if every single American were in favor ofa law that would violate the Constitution, it would be improperto enact such a law so long as we wished to retain the semblanceof a civilization. What we have in America today is not a war ondrugs, but a war against people, based on our need forscapegoats. Indeed, many people take drugs because of the miseryin their lives, but drugs are not the fundamental cause of themisery. The majority of the people, frustrated by our many socialproblems, have been whipped into a state of mass hysteria by themedia and by politicians who wish to divert attention from thetrue causes of the problems. This is reminiscent of the McCarthyera and the Massachusetts witch hunts, which, presumably, wereconducted by people who thought they were doing the right thing."The more things change, the more they stay the same." In order to provide a perspective differentfrom my own and to corroborate some of my points, I have includedthe preface to the book Ceremonial Chemistry [2], by permissionof its author, Thomas Szasz, the well-known social observer andprofessor of psychiatry. This clear, concise, and insightfulanalysis of the "drug problem", written over sixteenyears ago, appears in its entirety in Appendix A. The Fundamental Axiom. [Note (3-24-92): In myphilosophical system, three moral axioms and a number of otherfundamental assumptions are based on aesthetics, reasonableness,and utility. The first moral axiom is the fundamental axiomstated below except it is stated without reference to rights.Rights, then, are based on morals. Also, the terms materialismand dematerialism have been dropped in favor of competitionismand decompetitionism and the word decompetitionism is no morethan a writer's convenience. Basically, we don't like Isms! Mybasic theorem is that the abandonment of competition for wealth(or money), power, and fame is a necessary and sufficientcondition for sustainable human happiness. I mean the sustainablehappiness of all of humanity.] Nearly everyone agrees that our right topersonal liberty does not extend beyond the point where it beginsto interfere with the personal liberty of others. The personalchoice of individuals to take drugs in the privacy of their ownhomes or in other places set aside for that purpose does not, inand of itself, interfere with the personal liberty of anyone.Certainly, there are many cases where the use of drugs leads toexcesses and social disorder including pain and misery for thefamilies of the user, accidents in the workplace, and seriouscrimes that affect innocent people. This social disorder is whatsincere proponents of tough laws against drugs wish to prevent,but it is not an inevitable result of taking drugs and thenoninevitability is crucial. Thus, it is improper and immoral tocondemn all users of drugs and to deprive them of their civilrights because of the action of a few (or even of many). This isprecisely the punishment of an individual for a crime that he orshe has not committed. Moreover, it is not difficult to see thatthe laws against drugs cause more social disorder than theyprevent. The Fundamental Axiom of this paper is thatadult American citizens living in the United States have a rightto do whatever they please provided they do not interfere withthe rights of others. Probably this principle can be extended toa larger class of people, which might include children undercertain circumstances, but, for this paper, the above statementis sufficient. Morals, Ethics, and Laws Inevitably, this essay must concern itself withwhat is moral. I choose to distinguish two categories of morals.The first category consists of personal or arbitrary morals theviolation of which does not interfere with the rights or freedomsof any other person. Examples from this category are therequirement to do no work on the Sabbath, the proscription ofeating meat on Friday (no longer in fashion), the prohibition ofcertain sexual acts, and, most important for this discussion, thetaking or nontaking of drugs. Some of these lower morals aresimilar to the taboos of primitive tribes. The second categoryconsists of higher morals the violation of which does interferewith the rights of others. Examples from this category are"Thou shalt not kill", "Thou shalt not bear falsewitness against thy neighbor", and thou shalt not impose thyreligious beliefs on others. By definition, it is a violation ofa higher moral to interfere with the rights or freedom of others. We would like to have a system of absolutemorals, morals that are independent of culture or point of view.Of course, some religious people believe that we already have asystem of absolute morals given, for example, by the Bible, butmost of these people are not aware of the epistemologicaldifficulties that would have to be overcome to establish such asystem. Probably absolute morals are impossible and, eventually,it might be discovered that some sort of uncertainty principle orundecidability principle prevents the establishment of a systemof absolute morals. We do not need a system of morals that can beapplied to the entire world though. We need a system of moralsthat can be applied to the United States and is consistent withour Constitution. A system of morals may fall short of theabsolute and still be good enough to gain universal acceptancewithin a nation whose members are finite in number. Suffice it tosay that the Fundamental Axiom of this paper should be thecornerstone of such a system of morals. Whether a self-consistent and complete systemof morals can be constructed or not, a subset of a system ofmorals or a superstructure built upon it has been chosen to bethe law of the land, or at least that part of the law that dealswith human and institutional behavior, as opposed to governmentalprocedures. I submit that the law should be congruent with oursystem of morals and easily derivable from it. We are far fromthat advanced state where legislators would be almost unnecessaryinasmuch as anyone with an inference engine (computer andappropriate computer program) could test automatically whether agiven proposition was a "law" (or not) by deriving it(or its contradiction) from fundamental axioms or firstprinciples. The American legal system is in such shambles that wecan hardly be considered a society governed by laws at all.Although this begs the question, prohibition would not even beconsidered if laws were derived from first principles rather thanwilly-nilly to consolidate the power of the ruling class and toappease the superstitions of the people. Simply stated, we are probably going to havelaws into the foreseeable future. The laws should be derived fromand congruent with a system of morals with which we can allagree, but the Fundamental Axiom of this paper is nonnegotiable.In any case, there is no possibility of a nation living inAmerica in peace under a constitution unless we can agree toembrace higher morals and to recognize that some morals are amatter of personal preference. Since the religious right hasgiven the word "morals" a bad name, I will use the word"ethics" to refer to higher morals, even though I donot believe the religious right should have a monopoly on theword "morals". It is a corollary of the Fundamental Axiom,then, that no one has a right to impose an arbitrary system ofmorals on others. The correctness of this position iscorroborated by the failure of every attempt by church or stateto enforce an arbitrary system of morals. Prohibition, which, bythe way, required a constitutional amendment, was a dismalfailure and had to be repealed. The repression of drugs and thepersecution of drug users and dealers still continues, but theeffects are catastrophic and the drug trade thrives. (Onearbitrary aspect of the current laws against drugs is theillegality of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin and the legality ofnicotine, caffeine, and alcohol, all of which can be just asdangerous depending, of course, on the dosage.) Materialism and Dematerialism [Note (7-19-93): I now employ the terms competitionismand decompetitionism.] For the purposes of the discussionthat follows I must say what I mean by materialism anddematerialism. Materialism can be defined as the use of materialwealth as a measure of success, a reward for achievement oreffort, or as an inducement to behave in a certain way.Materialism leads to unequal distribution of wealth, which, inturn, results in economic and social strife. Only a (usuallyundeserving) minority, whose particular talents and inclinationscorrespond to making (or preserving) money, can depend onenjoying a comfortable old age. In order to have a flexiblesupply of human resources, in order to cope with the businesscycles, inevitable in a quasi-laissez-faire economy, and to keepthe price of human resources low, according to the laws of supplyand demand, it is necessary that there be a pool of unemployedpersons. These people are susceptible to both sides of the drugmarket, because of boredom and despair on the one side andbecause of the lack of any other opportunity on the other. Ofcourse, many people who are not reduced to such circumstanceselect to deal drugs, partly, at least, because materialismteaches that only those who acquire large amounts of wealth are"winners". Many people are upset (and frustrated) becausematerialism, as it manifests itself in a quasi-laissez-faire,free-enterprise, capitalistic society, has created a large numberof social ills, many attributable to poverty itself, one of theleast desirable consequences of materialism. They see reducedstandards of living, senseless crime, bizarre behavior (anddress), dishonesty in business and government, the decay offamily values, hopelessness, and cynicism marked by a newhedonism among the youth as signs of the decay of everything theyvalue. These people are easy prey to mass hysteria and crowdmadness. They are looking for scapegoats. An alternative to materialism is dematerialism.By dematerialism, I mean libertarian wealth-sharing, not thesocialism of Russia or China. Dematerialism requires the equaldistribution of wealth, modified slightly to account fordifferences in needs, and the production of wealth in acooperative setting according to the abilities of the individual,allowing for the need for abundant leisure. An education that isconsistent with the aims of dematerialism provides people withthe ability to enhance the material wealth and prosperity ofsociety, viewed as a collection of private individuals; but, moreimportant, it teaches people how to enjoy leisure in a mannerconsistent with their development as human beings, through thearts and sciences, sports, and other recreation, which mightinclude the use of drugs. Materialism feeds on itself and leads to alarge authoritarian government to control a society that isessentially unstable because of large differences in wealth. Aproperly-constituted, democratic, privatized, libertarian,wealth-sharing society, such as might exist under ourConstitution, would require only a small government because anonmaterialistic society is essentially stable. The successes orfailures of experiments in Capitalism, Socialism, Communism, andall of their "practical" implementationsnotwithstanding, the truth of the above assertions can be provedin the context of an appropriate system of ethics, moduloundecidability; that is, the above statements can be proved atleast as rigorously as social propositions are ever proved. Thatis the subject of another paper. For now, the above statementsmust be regarded as the author's point of view, a point of viewthat is entitled to as much respect as any other. Although thepostulate that materialism is unethical is not needed to advancethe thesis of this paper, namely, that drugs should be legal, itis useful to recognize that materialism may be the root cause ofmost of the drug problem including the laws against drugsthemselves. The Drug Problem Most of us agree that too many people aretaking excessive doses of too many drugs on too many occasions.The drug problem can be defined as these excesses coupled withthe misery and social disorder surrounding the illegal drugtrade. But, it is materialism and the laws against drugs, not thedrugs themselves, that are the cause of the problem. There is agrowing number of people, in addition to the dealers, who profitfrom the multibillion-dollar drug industry created by the lawsagainst drugs. The drug problem is not likely to disappear untilthe profit motive is removed. The Solution The reasonable solution, in a free society, iscomplete legalization and decontrol accompanied by unbiasededucation. By "decontrol" I mean decontrol of thepurchase and consumption of drugs. Prescriptions should continueto be used, but they would not be required for the purchase ofpharmaceuticals. Manufacturers should continue to be regulated,but the government should not control which drugs are produced orin what quantity. Employers have a right, sometimes a duty, todemand sobriety on the job, but people should be allowed to do asthey please elsewhere, provided they do not interfere with therights of others. Taking drugs, in and of itself, does notinterfere with the rights of anyone. The legalization of drugswill remove the thrill of breaking the law and the incentive toget people "hooked"; it will end the suffering causedby unmetered doses, impurities, substitutes, and substandardparaphernalia; legalization will move a huge segment of theunderground and extralegal economy into the legitimate economy,taking money away from criminals, eliminating crime and violence,and restoring many talented people to useful endeavor. Outline of This Paper The purpose of this paper is to show thatlegalization and decontrol is a practical solution to the drugproblem and that it is the ethical solution that should beadvocated by all right-thinking people of good will. A number ofadditional points that are made in this paper can be listed here:1) it is not the proper role of government to decide what is goodfor the people or what is not; 2) the war against drugs isessentially an attack on freedom of religion; 3) "drugaddiction" may not be a disease that requires treatment; 4)many people who advocate prohibition do not have respectablemotives; 5) the laws against drugs lead to numerous catastrophesand absurdities; 6) much of the misery experienced by manyconsumers of drugs is caused by the laws against drugs; 7) thesocial, political, and economic disorder on the supply side ofdrugs is caused by the enforcement of the laws against drugs; 8)in many cases the use of drugs is natural, proper, necessary, orotherwise justified; 9) the aggressors in the unwinnable waragainst drugs are guilty of the oppression of innocent people;moreover, the oppressors themselves are victims of crowd madness.No matter which aspect of the case one considers, no matter whatline of reasoning one pursues, rigorous logic always leads to thesame conclusion, namely, that the laws against the manufacture,sale, possession, and consumption of drugs must be repealed. I begin by pointing out the failure of methodscurrently being employed to end the drug problem and mention someof the absurdities and tragedies that are caused by thesemethods. The next section contains a short discussion of theimportant topics of addiction and treatment. There is someconfusion as to what people are talking about when they use theterm "drug addiction". It is not at all clear that drugaddiction is a disease; moreover, the question of whether thereis such a thing as an efficacious treatment for drug addiction isstill open. Next I give twelve reasons for legalizing drugsand I repeat a very important point that is usually ignored,namely, that the laws against drugs are essentiallyunconstitutional. I have pointed out that the taking of drugs inand of itself does not interfere with the rights of anyone. Onewonders then, with so many good reasons for legalizing drugs, whymany people still oppose the idea. In the next section, I attemptto answer that question, at least partially. Antidrug propaganda rarely has anything good tosay about drugs, particularly recreational drugs, i.e., drugstaken for the fun of it. In the next part of this paper, I list afew uses of drugs that are not abuses. I include here some of theresponses I have obtained in discussions with drug users whodemand repeal. Next, a few of the anticipated bad effects oflegalization are addressed and, finally, after summing up whatthe government should do, I suggest some possibilities for actionby individuals. Failure of the Current Approach Disaster, Absurdity, and Irony Nearly every day the newspapers carry anaccount of a disaster, the threat of disaster, or an absurditycreated by our government's "war on drugs". A U.S.agent is murdered; criminals seize control of a city, perhaps anentire nation; the government prepares to employ the military ina manner contrary to law. Suspects are beaten; their civil rightsare violated; the Constitution is trampled as law-enforcementagents spy on American citizens. Millions, perhaps billions, oftaxpayers' money is squandered by a government that has alreadyspent far beyond its means in a cause that is absolutelyguaranteed to fail. People who are reasonable in ordinary mattersadvocate cruel and inhumane policies. Police officers fall to thetemptation of huge profits; entire squads of narcotics agentsconspire with drug dealers; confiscated drugs return to the"free" market. Recently, in our town, two crack houses weredestroyed by bulldozers. The houses were punished for thebehavior of the people who occupied them! More recently stilllaws against attempting to buy drugs have been enacted. Can youimagine someone being arrested for saying, "Gee, I'm sotired; I wish I had something to pep me up for a few hours"!The Kiplinger Newsletter warns that imports from Central Americawill be delayed by exhaustive searches; so, now, the war on drugsinterferes with business itself, in an ironic twist of fate. The Beneficiaries Dealers, money launderers, law-enforcementagents, social workers, psychiatrists, physicians, lawyers,bureaucrats, drug testers, and dealers in drug-free urine are inon the action. Recently I saw a sign by the side of the roadadvertising cut-rate prices on beepers. (Beepers are widely usedby drug dealers, even to summon children in school.) Conveniencestore operators place items used to prepare and smoke crack inprominent places in the store. Only the dealers and the moneylaunderers are on the illegal side of the law and the moneylaunderers just barely. The others will fight legalizationroughly in proportion to the loss in income they will experienceif drugs are legalized. This is an important point. It is clearthat, in a market economy, the current approach to solving thedrug problem is not likely to succeed for this reason if for noother, namely, that there are too many people who have too muchto lose if the problem goes away. Thomas Szasz, the well-known social observerand professor of psychiatry, points out that the biggest gainersin the war on drugs are the politicians themselves [3]. Whenthings are going badly, there is nothing like a popular war todivert the attention of the people. Physicians After the politicians themselves, physiciansprobably have the most to lose since many physicians earn theirliving by writing prescriptions for people who have alreadydecided on their own course of treatment including which drugsare indicated. In addition, an informed population will recognizethat the non-use, use, and abuse of drugs and the withdrawal fromdrugs is not the province of the medical profession alone. Mostphysicians know about prescription drugs only what they read inthe Physicians' Desk Reference and in manufacturers' brochuresand they know about drugs not in the pharmacopoeia such as heroinand hashish next to nothing unless they or their patients areusing them. (Probably most patients are not discussing their useof illegal drugs with their physicians.) Thus, physicians are notentitled to a monopoly on the distribution of drugs and thetreatment of drug abuse. The Rehabilitation and Prevention Rackets Quacks and do-gooders are setting up clinicsand earning their living practicing half-baked and unproventechniques to stop, from using drugs, people who, for all weknow, have been enjoying drugs and are trying to stop onlybecause of outside coercion. (The insects who prey on humanweakness are coming out of the woodwork.) Educators lie to theirstudents and "public-service" groups buy televisiontime to lie to the public or to get well-known ex-addicts to lieto the public either because they (the ex-addicts) have beenbrainwashed or because they are afraid of what will happen tothem if they don't cooperate. "Drugs are all bad," theytell us. But, most people, including the children, know that thatcan't be quite true and so they reject the entire message eventhough some of it may have merit. For example, The Partnership for a Drug-FreeAmerica sponsors a television ad contrasting "brainwaves" from a fourteen-year-old before and after takingmarijuana. First of all, the ad implies that the significance ofthe signals is well-known, which is false. Epileptics sometimesexhibit quiescent brain waves, but epileptic seizures are oftenpreceded by moments of extreme mental clarity. The punch line isthat, if you are using pot, you are not using your brain. Now,that is patently false. Anyone who has experimented with potknows that, far from the absence of cerebral activity, there areoften valid insights, the obvious again becomes obvious (perhapsa little slowing down of the brain is useful, assuming, for themoment, that the quiescent brain waves do in fact reflect lessmental activity; a lot of mental garbage is cleared out), and thebeauty of music becomes more apparent (unfortunately, thelistener may be hearing music with little merit, but, at least,he's hearing all of it). Moreover, the liars behind ThePartnership don't have the guts to reveal who they are; noaddress or phone number is given in the ad. [Note in proof:Lately I have heard that the ad is faked, which certainly makessense. Where would they get a fourteen-year-old boy on"pot" without breaking the law themselves?] People wonder why American students do sopoorly. Part of the reason is, of course, TV. But, how canstudents develop self-reliance when their educators don't respectthem sufficiently to tell them the truth about drugs! Studentsdescend to the expectations people have of them. Also, youngpeople must be confused, at best, when they try to reconcile thestandard party line on the American economic and social systemwith what they can actually observe at home and in the streets,but that, perhaps, is another matter. Sports No discussion of drugs would be completewithout some mention of drugs in sports. We find here thatrigorous logic leads to surprising conclusions. The drugs used byathletes are of two types: (i) the usual recreational drugs(drugs that are taken for the fun of it) and (ii) steroids andother substances taken to increase muscle bulk or strength or insome other way to enhance performance. The banning or suspensionof athletes who are caught using illegal recreational drugs couldlead to the following absurdity: Some year, perhaps decades fromnow, a given National Basketball Association team wins thenational championship, after which it receives a formal challengefrom a team formed from among professional basketball players whohave been banned from the league for using drugs. To make itreally interesting the members of the outcast team could beallowed to use any substances they choose administered by themost skillful sports doctors or "dopers". In one case,the national champions are defeated decisively in a challengethey are honor-bound to accept. In another case, they decline thechallenge or are forbidden to accept it. In either case, do theyhave a right to consider themselves national champions? The veryexistence of a class of people who might be able to form a teamand defeat them compromises their championship. Farfetched? Notaccording to rigorous logic. The situation with steroids is more disturbingstill. The policing of athletes is nearly impossible assubstances that mask the use of other substances already exist.World records that are broken by athletes using banned substancesare compromised if not invalidated. Athlete A holds the worldrecord for the 100 meter race, but everyone, including A himself,knows that athlete B actually ran the race faster, not with amachine but with his own body. It appears, then, that the banningof steroids is as hopeless as the banning of other drugs. But, competitions that encourage or requireparticipants, if they want to be the world's best, to risk theirhealth and their lives are unethical. It is even worse to forcesomeone to take something he really doesn't want to take than itis to forbid someone to take something he wants to take. So, therealities of professional sports and world-class amateur sportsare even more unfair than the laws against drugs. Thus, theolympic games, professional and college football, evenhigh-school football, and many other activities that have grownto be national and international institutions should not beencouraged. (I do not favor the passing of even more laws;boycotts and nonparticipation by governments should besufficient.) There is no doubt that the seriousness with whichathletes and the general public treat athletic competition hasreached the point where all types of absurdities are commonplace.One wonders whether friendly competition of a local nature, theresults of which are not reported by the media, might somedaysupplant the current madness. On the subject of sports, what about the"runner's high"? Suppose the chemical substance thatgives the runner his high could be isolated and synthesized. Thenpeople could enjoy it without going to the trouble (and danger)of running. Naturally it would be banned. People would have to betested for it just as they are tested for other illegal drugs, inwhich case runners would test positive. When one starts with anabsurdity like drug prohibition, it is easy to derive anotherabsurdity. The Enforcers On the day following the completion of theprevious version of this paper a news story broke thatillustrates dramatically the failure of the government's currentapproach to the drug problem. It appears that the DrugEnforcement Agency (DEA) has been staging phony drug busts thatare reported by the media as real. Also, the DEA has beenfurnishing drug chemists with equipment and chemicals to makedrugs. The DEA claims that the staged arrests are designed togain the confidence of big-time dealers abroad, at least one ofwhom has been arrested subsequently. The agency claims thatassisting drug chemists makes it easier to keep tabs on them,that it is not entrapment, and that the drugs never reach thepublic. The Justice Department investigated the staged drugarrests and the concomitant deception of the media and, in turn,the people. In a matter of two or three days, it found noevidence of wrongdoing and closed the case. First of all, why would a dealer haveconfidence in a smuggler who loses the goods? In the secondplace, how does the DEA arrest a subject of a foreign power ifthe subject does not enter the United States? By what right doesit have jurisdiction? It would appear, at least to this observer,that the DEA is attempting to bolster its image and tomanufacture some success in the "war against drugs".But wait! There's more. One of the people involved in thesmuggling operation claims that seventeen duffle bags of cocainewere seized, whereas the DEA can account for only fifteen. Couldit be that someone in the DEA is involved in drug trafficking andthat the missing cocaine will find its way back to the market?For that matter, when was the last time you saw with your owneyes the destruction of confiscated cocaine? We have seenmarijuana burned from time to time, but cocaine destroyed? Concerning the DEA-supplied drug labs, one ofthe chemists alleged that DEA-sponsored chemists have given theDEA the slip and DEA-sponsored drugs have indeed been sold to thepublic. Also, it is not clear that this is not entrapment. Also,the drug chemist claims that, at one point, it was so obviousthat he was making drugs that he asked his supplier if he knew ofa better procedure to produce the drug. The DEA agent suppliedthe procedure for $2000. Are we supposed to believe that the$2000 ended up in the U.S. Treasury? You will draw your own conclusions about theseevents or withhold judgment, but it is clear to me that there issomething rotten in the DEA. Also, I suspect the JusticeDepartment of a cover-up. Sadly, if I am asked to choose to trustthe word of a drug-smuggler/drug-chemist or the word of a DEAagent, I'll take the smuggler/chemist every time. Attacking the Constitution Lately, the United States has asked for theextradition of "known" drug kingpins from Colombia.Does not the Constitution guarantee a fair trial by a jury ofpeers? How are these people, who played no role in the passage ofthe laws they are accused of breaking, ever going to get a fairtrial in the United States? Are we going to import Colombians forjurors! In addition, the United States government hasbegun seizing the assets of suspected traffickers without dueprocess, possibly depriving them of the resources they will needto defend themselves in a legal battle against a powerful enemy.Also, the United States, while interfering in the internalaffairs of a sovereign state, is aiding and abetting the seizureof assets without due process, which would be unconstitutional ifit happened here. Addiction and Treatment Addictions Most people are against drug addiction and sois this author, if drug addiction, indeed, exists, and, for thesake of argument, I am willing to agree that it does. But, I amalso against all the other forms of addiction that plaguesociety. While we are eliminating addiction to drugs, let useliminate addiction to TV, which is lowering the IQ of a nationand filling its collective mind with nonsense. Is there anaddiction to popular music, some of which is not really music atall? Some children and even some adults cannot leave it behindfor a minute. They wear earphones everywhere, even while drivinga car, "studying", or attending a lecture. That soundsmore like an addiction than a form of recreation or culture. Somewomen seem to be addicted to cosmetics. Some people are addictedto getting something for nothing! They easily fall prey to statelotteries, the coupon industry, sweepstakes, rebates onautomobiles, and the numerous forms of gambling. Incidentally,how can states prohibit the use of drugs, on one hand, andencourage, by expensive and insidious advertising, gambling, onthe other! Recently I read about the addiction of some people to,of all things, surgery! How are these addictions, all of whichcan be traced to materialism, going to be treated? The Meaning of the Term "Drug Addiction" With respect to the existence or nonexistenceof drug addiction it should be noted that at least five differentphenomena are referred to as "drug addiction". In oneclass of cases the "addict" is attempting to treat him-or herself for chronic depression. A drug has worked at leastonce and the victim hopes that it will work again and sometimesit does. In a second and completely different set ofcircumstances the use of a drug has caused, usually as a sideeffect, a symptom that can be relieved only by taking more of thedrug. After a good night's sleep the craving is gone. I believethis is the case with the ordinary use of cocaine and, for somepeople, with alcohol. It could be referred to as short-termaddiction. In other cases the victims experience acute withdrawalsymptoms that last several days or longer. This third class ofcases could be referred to as long-term addiction. Apparently,this is what heroin addicts and caffeine addicts experience. (Iam aware of the fact that some alcoholics seem to experience bothshort-term and long-term addiction.) It is this third meaning of the word that laysthe best claim to the term "addiction". However, manypeople are addicted to drugs in this "true" sense ofthe word if and only if they believe they are addicted. (Perhapsthe headaches I experience when I try to give up coffee occuronly because I expect them.) Perhaps all such addictions arepsychosomatic. A fourth behavior pattern that is often calledaddiction occurs when the user derives a great deal of pleasurefrom using drugs and therefore repeats the experience as often aspossible with or without consideration of the long-rangeconsequences. (After all, if you tell a twenty-year-old man thatdrugs will kill him in forty years, he is not likely to be tooconcerned, especially if he's having a good time.) And finally,many people take drugs repeatedly in order to perform a specifictask that cannot be performed as well or at all without drugs. It has occurred to me lately as I reread CeremonialChemistry by Thomas Szasz, who views the war against drugs asthe persecution of drugs, drug addicts, and drug pushers, thatmany people relish the idea of being persecuted. After all, Jesushimself in the Sermon on the Mount suggested that it might be ablessing to be persecuted under certain circumstances. I believethat many people believe that living the drug life satisfies theconditions alluded to by Jesus, namely, a pursuit of spiritualthings rather than material things. The Treatment of Drug Addiction I am very suspicious of counselors,psychoanalysts, ministers, priests, lecturers, gurus and other"professionals" who make their living by treating thespiritual problems of man. It is easy for a charlatan to pose asa spiritual healer. I don't believe anyone knows enough about thehuman mind and the spiritual nature of man to be certain he isnot doing more harm than good. In particular, it is not clearthat drug users should be subjected to professional treatment atall. Normalization of drug use, i.e., legalization, decontrol,and public tolerance, should make most problems disappear; but,when a problem persists even in a normalized society, undoubtedlythe best way to treat it is with ordinary human kindness andcompassion. Friends or family members are the ones who can helpthe most. In a normalized society, drug users who cannotcope and have no family or friends who can provide sufficienthelp fall into a special class, as do drug users who requirerestraint. Probably the state will have to intervene, but itshould do so in as nonauthoritarian and nonpatronizing a manneras possible. Of course, prisons will continue to exist as long asmaterialism exists, but not many drug users belong in prison. Thestate should supply help, i.e., food, clothing, shelter,information (not propaganda), job training (if needed), andconsiderate people (who might be fellow sufferers) to talk to,rather than treatment. In any case, treatment must be voluntary,particularly if the patient's freedom is to be surrendered.(Probably most treatments diminish the humanity of the patient bythe use of tranquilizers, by brainwashing, or by tactics similarto those employed by cults.) Remember, the term "mentalillness" is a metaphor! But, if "professionals"insist on treating "drug addiction", they damn wellbetter know what it is they are treating! Practical, Humanitarian, and Ethical Benefitsof Legalization Disclaimer The following is a list of the main practicaland humanitarian benefits that will result from the legalizationof drugs. The proof of each of these points is taken to beobvious. If it should happen that reasonable doubts arise as tothe truth of these assertions, it will be necessary to providemore detailed arguments. I have avoided purposely the recitationof statistics of indeterminate accuracy. I believe it issufficient to accept the fact that, for example, some people havedied because they bought impure drugs; it should not be necessaryto know the exact statistics. Perhaps a more ambitious author iswilling to make the effort to supply the numbers. Practical and Humanitarian Benefits 1) Legalization would remove the economicincentive to get people "hooked" and, as discussedbelow, prevent some people from changing from nonaddictive ormildly addictive drugs to more addictive drugs. (Some peoplebelieve that drug addiction is a myth manufactured by society andcaused by mass delusion and hysteria. People become addicted todrugs because they believe in drug addiction.) 2) Legalization would make it unnecessary for"addicts" to steal. Of course, some people were thievesfirst and addicts second. Whether or not they will continue to bethieves is another matter. Others have gotten into the habit ofstealing and the habit of stealing may be more difficult to breakthan the habit of taking drugs. But, in any case, there will befewer people stealing to pay for drugs and they won't have tosteal as much as they do now unless the government levies heavytaxes. A punitive tax on drugs would be unfair and unwise since,under heavy taxation, only the rich could afford legal drugs andthe black market would return. 3) Drug legalization would eliminate theviolence surrounding the drug business. This is a very importantpoint. 4) It would move a huge segment of theunderground economy into the legitimate economy, taking profitsaway from criminals, keeping drug money, unless it were spent onother imports, in the country, allowing reasonable, but notpunitive, taxation of the legal trade, providing alternate cropsfor tobacco growers, etc. As everyone now knows, some dealers arebecoming so rich that they can take control of sovereign states.The laws against drugs are the source of their wealth. The above four points are the ones usually madeby people who favor legalization on practical grounds alone. Manywriters and speakers have discussed these points and I shall notelaborate on them further. The next eight items have receivedless attention. 5) Legalization would remove the thrill ofbreaking the law. This is especially important if children aregoing to forget about taking drugs. On the other hand, if enemaswere made illegal, some children somewhere would dedicatethemselves to taking enemas. Naturally, it would be preferable ifchildren could be taught respect for the law, but there are twoimportant reasons why this cannot be done in general. The firstis that children see that many important people break the lawwithout losing the respect of society. In fact, in many importantcases, the prestige of the criminal is enhanced. At the veryleast the criminal becomes famous and children are encouraged bythe media to believe that only famous people count. The secondreason is that children know that many laws are unjust and aredesigned either to enhance the wealth, power, and privileges ofthe ruling class or to satisfy the biases and superstitions ofthe masses. (Yes! Many children know this.) It is crucial, then,that children, acting on their own, stop taking drugs becausedrugs no longer interest them, not because drugs are forbidden bytheir parents or the rest of society. 6) Legalization would end the suffering anddeath caused by unmetered doses, impurities, dirty paraphernalia,substitutes, and substances that have only a short history ofuse, e.g., designer drugs. In particular, it would end the deathscaused by AIDS for which the laws against drug paraphernalia, andthe sponsors of such laws, are directly responsible. Those whooppose legalization seem to be singularly lacking in compassion.It is not unreasonable to assign responsibility for a great dealof the misery surrounding the use of drugs to the people whoadvocate and enforce the laws against drugs and drugparaphernalia. Opponents of drugs like to say, "Drugskill." Yes, sometimes they do, but most of the deaths can betraced to unmetered doses, poorly prepared drugs (impurities),and "drugs" that turn out to be something other thandrugs (poison) sold by unscrupulous or incompetent dealers. Itmakes sense to license dealers and manufacturers, but to requireusers to register is, again, an infringement of personal libertyand it won't work. Content and strength of all drugs, includingcoffee, should be labeled clearly. 7) Many users of "hard" drugs beganby using "soft" drugs; but, due to the laws againstdrugs, there came a time when their drug of choice was notavailable. This is what led them from marijuana, say, to heroin.There are many similar instances of harm resulting from theunavailability of the drug user's favorite and familiar drug.Conversely, many troubled people choose to drink, and haveproblems associated with drinking, mainly because alcohol islegal and readily available. These people might have been able toselect a drug from a larger menu, marijuana say, that wouldprovide the same relief with fewer problems or no problems atall. (Sometimes I find it difficult to believe that there has notbeen a conspiracy to suppress the use of marijuana, amphetamines,and heroin so that the cocaine business could flourish.) 8) Legalization of all drugs would eliminatethe "drug life", the endless cycle of getting money,"copping", getting high, etc. that constitutes a careerfor many. Indeed, many addicts are among those who have most tolose from legalization. They would have to give up their entire"lifestyle" with its many positive aspects includinggood friendships, camaraderie, etc. 9) Legalization would restore many to usefulendeavor, even some who continue to use drugs. It woulddecriminalize an even greater number of people who use drugsproperly as discussed below. 10) Legalization and decontrol would allowpeople to exercise their right to be their own physicians. Manypeople could do this without deterioration in the quality ofmedical care they receive. The legitimate medical uses of drugsprohibit punitive taxes such as those levied against cigarets.Moreover, the legalization and decontrol of all drugs is a steptoward controlling medical costs, which we all know are spiralingout of control, to some extent because of the greed ofphysicians. 11) Drug legalization would eliminate the needfor controversial and perhaps unconstitutional intrusion into theactivities and physical bodies of suspected drug users, althoughthe need to have sober airline pilots, etc. will probably prolongthe debate on just how this is to be accomplished for some time,even after legalization. 12) Recently, subsequent to the original draftof this paper, new drug legislation has been enacted by Congressthat includes cruel and unusual punishment. Wayne Saums writes ina letter to the Houston Post as follows: The current drug hysteria is the closest thingto McCarthyism America has seen in 40 years. Draconian penalties,in a drug bill that just passed Congress, include $10,000 finesfor a single marijuana cigarette! The biggest mistake any American could make, inthe face of such insanity, is to assume he is safe if only hedoes not smoke marijuana. This drug is cheap and plentiful. An angryneighbor, a political opponent, anyone at all, would have only totoss a "joint" onto your property, into your home, oryour car. A police officer could stick it right in your shirt, oryour trash can! No, the truth is that, once police statetactics get to this advanced stage, no one is safe. NO ONE! Legalization would eliminate the possibilitythat some diabolical adversary could put us through the nightmareof being falsely accused, or even punished, by a PharmacologicalInquisition. Ethical Benefits Thus, there are many practical and humanitarianbenefits to be derived from legalization, but, in addition, thereare many ethical benefits beginning with respect for the NinthAmendment to the Constitution. The Ninth Amendment states that"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shallnot be construed to deny or disparage others retained by thepeople." A fundamental right, recognized at least abstractlyby most Americans, is the right and freedom to do anything onepleases so long as it doesn't interfere with the rights andfreedom of others. This right is not explicitly stated in theConstitution, but it is retained by the people in accordance withthe Ninth Amendment. Whether or not the majority of Americansbelieve that the right to take drugs is reserved under the NinthAmendment, any interference with that right is unacceptable to alarge group of Americans and they will struggle to protect it.Thus, widespread disobedience of antidrug laws can be interpretedas political struggle. Apparently, Americans recognized that theright to take drugs falls under the Ninth Amendment when theyrequired a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol. Thiscorroborates my position that the laws against drugs areessentially unconstitutional; i.e., such laws cannot be enactedby Congress without a constitutional amendment. It required aconstitutional amendment then; why should it not require aconstitutional amendment now! Legalization would end the hypocrisy of banningmost drugs while not banning others, namely, alcohol, nicotine,and caffeine. The legality of alcohol is probably related to itsrole in the Christian faith. Thus, the banning of hashish, forexample, and not alcohol could be construed as a violation of thedoctrine of separation of church and state. We all know whycaffeine is legal. Most of the working people of the nation, atleast those who work in offices, are addicted to caffeine, butthat's what gives them the strength, or the will, to work longhours for the benefit of their employers, some of whom have a lotto say about what the law of the land will be. In the case ofcaffeine, many people who try to stop using it will experienceviolent headaches; so, at least in this sense, caffeine is trulyaddictive. People Who Oppose Legalization Hypocrites and Prudes Some members of society, particularly thereligious right, would like to impose their sexual and religious"morals" on others. The word "morals" isenclosed in quotation marks to distinguish these personal andarbitrary "morals" from higher morals about whichnearly everyone can agree. As discussed in the introduction, areasonable test of these higher morals, as exemplified by theSixth and Ninth Commandments, is that their violation does indeedinterfere with the rights of others. Some opponents oflegalization are genuinely concerned about the welfare of others,but many of them are simply too mean-spirited to approve ofpleasure. At least they do not approve of intense pleasure, anddrugs do, on occasion, provide some people with intense pleasure,a plain fact that deserves more discussion. Control Addicts There is another group of people in theopposition (to legalization) who simply like to control others.These are the control addicts. It is ironic that in their waragainst addiction they succumb to one of the most insidious ofall addictions, namely, the addiction to power. Of course, mostof these people have an appetite for power that can never besatisfied other than in the authority they exercise over peoplein their own family. They are perfect candidates to be parents ofchildren who escape into the world of drugs. Many control addictsmight benefit from taking drugs themselves, since one of the mostdesirable effects of some drugs is to shock people out of rigidmodes of thought. Taking drugs might be a form of therapy forcontrol addicts. Legislators The congressman from my district wants to applylethal force to stop the flow of drugs, but he doesn't have theslightest idea how to stop people from wanting drugs. As long aspeople want them, someone will find a way to deliver them,although the prices (and the profits) will be high. Addicts willhave to steal even more than they do now; criminals will haveeven greater incentive to murder other criminals who muscle in ontheir territory; and the problem will get worse. What thecongressman doesn't realize is that his policies are part of thereason that many people take drugs in the first place. He is partof the problem, not part of the solution. (Subsequent to thefirst draft of this paper a new and tougher drug law has beenpassed by Congress. As we watch the situation worsen in the wakeof this law, we should gain confidence in the essentialcorrectness of my position. For example, dealers will have evenless to lose by killing other dealers inasmuch as the law putstheir life at even greater risk. Of course, in many cases, thisrisk is what motivates them.) Uses and Users of Drugs The Right to Use Drugs In the beginning of this paper I made the claimthat taking drugs does not interfere necessarily with the rightsof anyone. The reader can prove this by performing a thoughtexperiment in which someone takes drugs and no one's rights areviolated. (For example, a man with no family lives alone; foodand drugs are delivered to him daily by a disinterested party;the fruits of his solitary labors, proofs of mathematicaltheorems, say, are picked up by the letter carrier. There is noimpact on society other than the benefits to be derived from hisproofs, which are assumed to be correct.) The reader shouldrealize that this one example of what many may feel is anabnormal case is sufficient to prove the premise. I maintain thatthousands of "normal" cases occur daily, but it is notnecessary to enumerate them. Nevertheless, I will offer someadditional evidence to support this important claim and to show,further, that taking drugs is not always bad. Drugs for Celebration Most of the discussion about legalizing drugsneglects the traditional and proper use of drugs in ritual andcelebration. Some opponents of legalization believe that theso-called recreational drugs have no valid use, but those samepeople probably would be disappointed if they could not have adrink or two on New Year's Eve, Christmas, or their birthdays.Many Americans don't consider Saturday night a success unlessthey become at least somewhat intoxicated. Is it really so bad towant to experience the exhilaration, release from tension, andjust plain joy of getting a little "high" with goodfriends? Most people consider complete abstinence a little weirdif not downright antisocial. People who never loosen up with adrink or the drug of their choice could be thought of asdeficient, a judgment that is undoubtedly too harsh. (Wayne Saumspoints out how much people enjoy that first cup of coffee in themorning with its "pure chemical high".) Drugs in Ritual and Religion Throughout recorded history intoxication hasplayed a large role in human ritual. Whereas the Catholic masscannot be celebrated without wine, the religious rituals of somenative-American Indians are incomplete without peyote. Governmentcontrol or taxation is inconsistent with freedom of religion.True religious freedom is not limited to a few establishedreligions, moreover vows of poverty preclude payment of taxes onsubstances that can be cultivated on the homestead withoutparticipation in the mainstream of the economy. The book, CeremonialChemistry [2] by Thomas Szasz, elaborates on the role ofdrugs in ritual and, in addition, explains why many people are soanxious to persecute people who use drugs other than the ones ofwhich they approve. Every person who participates in this debateshould read this book. In fact, I will go further and say thatanyone who advocates the regulation of drugs by government andhas not read this book should be disqualified from the drugdebate. For the edification, and convenience, of the reader, thepreface to Ceremonial Chemistry appears in Appendix A ofthis paper by permission of Dr. Szasz. Drugs to Kill Pain Another legitimate use of drugs is to eliminatepain. What could be more absurd and inhumane than limiting thedosage of painkillers taken by terminally-ill people because theymight become addicted! The place of the medical profession is toadvise not control. The final decision on the dosage ofpain-killing (or any other) drugs must rest with the patient. Forthat matter, drugs must be made available to those who wish toend their lives. Many people in American society rely on drugsto assuage the pain inflicted upon them by a callous,materialistic society and by their own mistakes or bad luck.Apparently, society is not yet ready to make the commitment toremove the circumstances that cause this pain and suffering noris society willing to pay the price to relieve human misery. Now,society wants to take away the drugs that provide the onlyrelief, however fleeting, that these people will ever enjoy.Ironically, it may be drug use and only drug use that ispreventing a violent revolution in America. Drugs to Enhance Ability Drugs can be used to enhance the ability ofpeople to perform certain tasks. Many jazz musicians in the 40sand 50s used drugs. I do not believe there was a single exceptionamong, at least, my fifty favorite jazz musicians. It was commonto hear people opposed to drugs say that musicians played welldespite the use of drugs, but does it make sense that all of themplayed well in spite of taking drugs! Maybe taking drugs helpedthem just a little. In any case, the connection betweenintoxication and the muse dictates that the music could not havebeen the same without the drugs. Actually, many "drugaddicts" do very well in society. Many famous entertainers,athletes, artists, and, yes, even scientists take or have takendrugs. I just found out from Jim Bouton's book, BallFour [4], that more than half of all major-league baseballplayers in the 60s and 70s took amphetamines. This doesn't provethat it made them play better, but it was said on one occasionwhen a famous ballplayer narrowly missed a fly ball that withfive more milligrams he would have made the play. So, in anycase, there was a widespread belief among major-leaguers thatamphetamine helped them. It's interesting, though, that people doapply a different set of standards to major-league baseballplayers from those they apply to the average drug user, just asracists accept black people provided they are celebrities. Afterall, the cult of fame and the cult of money are the core of ournational religion. "Very Unimportant People" As long as I have brought up the cult of fame Imight just as well say a few additional words on that subjecthere. In the minds of many Americans wealth, power, and fame aresubsumed under the general concept of Importance. Many peopletake drugs because society is telling them that they are notimportant or even significant. Many people are selling drugsbecause being a dealer makes them feel important. Television andother media seem to be telling us every day of our lives that, ifwe are not important, our lives are meaningless. A comicstripchild after seeing her grandfather on television says, "GeeGramps, you are a real person." This phenomenon goes alittle way toward explaining some of the so-called senselesscrimes reported in the media practically daily. Because it iscontrolled by commerce, television is one of the most perniciousinfluences in society. Special Uses of Drugs It is easy to construct hypothetical scenarioswherein the use of drugs makes possible an important humanactivity. For example, suppose that it is necessary to stay awakeand alert for several days in order to perform an importantscientific experiment. The use of artificial stimulants isjustified in this exceptional case. The use of a sedative isindicated if a person is required to remain motionless for a longperiod in order to participate in a test. Moderation No one advocates the use of drugs all of thetime by everyone. The infiltration of drugs into the lives of ourchildren is deplorable as are many other aspects of drug abuse.Some people should never touch certain drugs and they know whothey are. Perhaps no one should use drugs every day except forthe treatment of a pathology. On the other hand, there ispractically no one who would not benefit from the occasional useof one or another drug as an alternative to complete abstinencefrom all drugs. For nearly everyone there is a drug that can beused safely on special occasions to improve the quality of his orher life. I find it interesting that practically every discussionof drugs jumps from abstinence to abuse as though there werenothing in between. Drugs as a Spiritual or Intellectual Adventure Needless to say, the mere taking of drugs doesnot automatically elevate people to an elite class of individualscapable of discerning right from wrong and able to see throughall the illusions and myths perpetuated by society. Many drugusers are just as narrow-minded with respect to drugs that happento differ from their own particular favorites as are those whooppose the use of all drugs. But, of two hypothetical people whoexhibit the same moral and ethical behavior in all respects otherthan the taking or not taking of drugs, I would have to rankhigher, in the traits that distinguish us from the beasts, theperson who takes a risk in order to discover and experiencesomething new, even if the discovery and experience iscatastrophic. In fact, it could be argued that the taking ofdrugs, under many circumstances, indicates an intelligence higherthan the intelligence of the abstainer even though the latter mayexcel in prudence. Therefore, it is conceivable that the averageintelligence of the drug-taking population, which, of course,includes those who exercise moderation, exceeds that of theabstainers. Also, it should be pointed out that many drug usersclaim that drugs have helped them see through the mythsand illusions perpetuated by society. "Good Guys" and "Bad Guys" Moreover, the taking of drugs, particularly inexcess, cannot help but teach a lesson in compassion learned byvirtue of experiencing one's own vulnerability. Further, drugusers are rarely involved in the struggle for money and powerthat is destroying our civilization. On the other hand, manypeople who are waging the war on drugs employ devious andunderhanded tactics, not the least dishonorable of which isarranging a highly-contrived purchase of drugs near the WhiteHouse and then implying, for rhetorical purposes, that thepurchase was routine. Thus, it is not at all clear that those whoare trying to prevent people from taking drugs are the "goodguys" and those who are using drugs are the "badguys" as the establishment would have us believe. It seemsthat just the opposite is true. Fear of Death Also, it is interesting to note that thefollowing statement, attributed to Jesus, could be construed asapproval of drug users: "For whosoever will save his lifeshall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shallfind it." Of course, it is not clear that everyone who usesdrugs will die from taking drugs, nor is it clear that everyonewho destroys his life with drugs is moved by a divine purpose.Nevertheless, one wonders about all those people who want to goto heaven but are afraid to die. Some Words from Victims of the War On Drugs I have talked with many users of drugs. Some ofthem support the laws against drugs. Some users imagine that thelaws against drugs are the only thing standing between themselvesand lethal doses. If so, they would have to adopt the techniquesemployed by alcoholics to save themselves in a world wherealcohol is legal, cheap, and advertised on TV. But, many users ofdrugs are outraged at the attempts of society to deprive them oftheir personal liberty. Many believe, as I do, that it is not thefunction of the government, however well-meaning, to protect usfrom ourselves. The authors of the following ideas shall remainanonymous. I do not recall their exact words, thus theresponsibility for the wording rests with me although I shallemploy quotation marks, which are to be interpreted loosely. One well-known speaker on drugs sets the toneby saying, "I do not permit anyone to tell me what to putinto my own body." A woman, who contracted AIDS from herhusband, who was an intravenous drug user and has since died fromAIDS, says, "I blame every legislator, bureaucrat, andmedical lobbyist who is responsible for the restrictions againstthe purchase of new disposable syringes. I blame thelaw-enforcement agents too." A man who is dying of cancerand is forced to endure unspeakable agonies because he is a drugaddict and "cannot" be given the indicated dosage ofpainkillers asks, "Is it legal to do this to me?" A middle-aged man who has health insurance butstill objects to the outrageous fees charged by physiciansanswers, "Certainly I'd like to boycott doctors. They makefar too much money and most of them don't place their patients'interests far enough above money to spend enough of their time todo a good job. Of course, they're generous enough with yourtime. If I couldn't live without doctors, well ... no one evergot out of this life without dying. I would never be operated onnor would I ever submit to chemotherapy or other radicaltreatment; but, I should have access to the drugs I know about orcould find out about to treat my medical complaints; I should beallowed to have whatever drugs I needed to kill pain if I were ingreat pain; and I should be allowed to end my life if I wereseriously ill and it became impossible to kill the pain. InsteadI am forced to pay the doctor a ridiculous fee to write aprescription. Of course, I could petition the FDA [Food and DrugAdministration] to permit me to prescribe for myself and sue themif they refused, but I don't have the time, money, and energy.And, as we all know, I would lose." I agree with this man.We have a right to repair our own car or be our own gardener.Even more valid is our right to heal ourselves and to avoid doingbusiness with people who are extracting excessive profits fromsociety. A young mathematician tells his story: "Myphysician started me on a psychic energizer when I began to getulcers from drinking too much coffee. Now, he won't writeprescriptions for it because it has been classified as adangerous drug and is monitored by the state, which requires aprescription in triplicate. I can't do math without it and I amabout ready to turn to the black market. Is it fair for the stateto interfere with my career in this way? If this drug is adangerous narcotic, why wasn't it classified as such before Ibecame dependent upon it? It seems that the classification of adrug is a political decision." I have talked to numerous musicians who playclassical, jazz, and rock music and who are dependent on drugs.I've heard some musicians say, "I can play music withoutdrugs, but I don't enjoy it." Others say, "Drugs put mein a state of mind wherein I am receptive to musicalinspiration", "Drugs open up a part of my mind that isunavailable without drugs", "I couldn't begin to playinspired music without drugs." Other similar statements arecommonly heard. One musician complains, "Music is the onlything in life that matters to me and, for me, drugs and music gotogether. How dare the state try to deprive me of life as I wantto live it." A famous jazz musician is supposed to havesaid, "The three greatest things in the world are music,drugs, and sex, in that order." Notice, he choosesdrugs before sex. Now, taking drugs for the pleasure it gives issimilar to having sex for the pleasure it gives. There are peoplein this world who don't want anyone to have sex for pleasure. Howwould the average prohibitionist like it if sex for pleasure weremade illegal? Another famous jazz musician, now deceasedafter a reasonably long life of approximately 60 years, said tome, "I haven't had sex in two years and, if I never have itagain, it will be too soon." Now, this man not onlypreferred drugs to sex but rejected sex entirely, although it mayhave been deficiencies in society or the drugs themselves thatcaused him to abandon sex altogether. One can argue that theworld would be better off if a significant number of peoplesubstituted abstinence from sex for abstinence from drugs. As badas it is, our drug problem doesn't come close to our populationproblem. The main point, though, is that, for this man,prohibiting drugs was like prohibiting sex for the average man.If the government can stop people from taking drugs with today'stechnology, it might be able to stop people from having sex withthe technology of tomorrow. In Defense of Liberty It seems clear then that very many people,perhaps millions, believe that they have a right to manufacture,sell, buy, possess, and consume whatever drugs they please. Theyconsider a system irrational and unfair that punishes a drugdealer who sells a chemical to someone who wants to ingest it,but rewards a person who dumps, into the air or water, poisonsthat everyone must ingest whether they want to or not. Thesepro-choice people are bound to regard those who are attempting torepress drugs as tyrannical and evil. Normally, the criminaljustice system of the United States is directed against peoplewho acknowledge that they have done something wrong; and,needless to say, not everyone involved with drugs is completelyinnocent of wrongdoing. But, there is a large group of people whouse drugs and, yes, sell drugs who know that they have donenothing wrong. Those who persecute them will be fighting an enemywho knows he is on the right side. As for the ones who feelguilty about their involvement with drugs, enlightenment willreveal that they are not the guilty ones. As for you, William J.Bennett, you are fighting on the side of evil. The other day I saw a large piece of graffitithat said, in English and in Spanish, "The war against drugsis a war against people!" It is a crime to conduct such awar. If Czar William (Bennett) wants to behead people, has he notcommitted murder in his heart already; is he not a man ofviolence; are not his enemies entitled to retaliate violently,however ill-advised that may be! If the American people want towage a declared war on drugs, they should expect"drugs" to fight back. For example, drug enforcementagents not in uniform could be shot as spies. Prisoners of war onboth sides should be treated according to the Geneva conference,provided, of course, that they are "in uniform". Dealing with the Negative Aspects ofLegalization The Abuser as a Bad Example Naturally, there is bound to be some negativeimpact from legalization. Some individuals are bound to increasetheir intake of drugs and some will exhibit bizarre or antisocialbehavior, but there is a positive side even to that. If some drugusers make horrible examples of themselves, it will be adeterrent to others, particularly children. Perhaps some peoplewill try drugs who would not have been willing to break the law,but these must constitute a very small class of Americans. Astaking drugs begins to assume its natural role in society, freefrom the denormalizing effects of criminalization, most negativeactivity will die out. But, we should not expect to recover fromdecades of wrong thinking and bad public policies without somepain. Drug legalization could be compared to balancing thebudget, another pill that will have to be swallowed eventually. Physicians Who Are Addicts A recent letter to Time Magazine warnsthat the increase in drug use would not be trivial. It cites thehigh use by physicians, who have easy access to drugs but shouldknow better. While it is true that many physicians use drugs, thehealth care system in the United States is not exactly in a stateof collapse. At least the physicians and surgeons, whether theytake drugs or not, have managed to look after their own interestsquite well, and the number of doctors on skid row is notexcessive. If society at large does no worse with free access todrugs than the physicians have done, we will be able to withstandthe shock of legalization. The Dissemination of Information Of course, many nonphysicians will not"know better". It is up to the government, which causedthis mess in the first place, to do a first-rate job of informingthe public about the risks of taking drugs without neglecting tomention the positive aspects of drug use. There is no use indenying that many people may enjoy the occasional use ofrecreational drugs without incurring appreciable harm,particularly if drugs are free of harmful impurities and arelabeled properly. The dissemination of information is cheapcompared to the alternatives. Establishment Drug Firms One possible infelicitous aspect of druglegalization is that drugs would be manufactured and sold byestablishment chemists, engineers, and businessmen. I still havefaith in most chemists and engineers, be they establishment ornot, but my experience with American and foreign businessmen hasbeen most disappointing. It is possible that they might be moreunethical than the drug traffickers they would replace. Just lookat what they have done with cigarets, alcohol, and patentmedicines. The solution, I fear, in a capitalist society, isstrict government regulation of manufacturers. Of course, thiswould not be necessary in a dematerialist society because therewould be nothing to be gained by being unethical. Spending ofexcessive profits would be noticed and prevented by socialpressure. Despite the tolerable track record ofestablished drug firms, strict standards of purity, labeling,documentation, and pricing should be enforced. Also, thegovernment must ensure that the public is getting correct,complete, and up-to-date information on all drugs. Any drugwhatsoever may be manufactured, but the effects of new drugs mustbe understood sufficiently well that a well-informed public canhave expectations concerning the new drugs that are reasonablylikely to be fulfilled. A well-informed person, then, can beginusing a new drug at any time during the testing cycle, completelyaware of the risks involved. This could benefit many peoplesuffering from AIDS, for example, or other "incurable"diseases. The Social System Many people believe that a share of the blamefor excessive use of drugs must be placed on the many unnaturalaspects of our economic and social system. The abuse of drugs isa symptom of a deeper problem, the solution to which is a gradualmovement toward dematerialism preceded by the teaching of thenecessity of dematerialism, along with an open discussion of howthe difficulties of implementing dematerialism might be overcome.Suffice it to say that the prohibition of the free use of drugsis part of the problem, not part of the solution. In any case, wehave no choice as to whether or not we will endure whatevernegative impact accompanies drug legalization. We can only hopeto hold the damage to a minimum by making the necessary changesgradually and by providing help for people who request it. Conclusions The Correct Solution Legalization and decontrol is the correctsolution because it will eliminate most of the evil surroundingthe drug trade; it will have many desirable consequences and veryfew bad side effects, all of which can be overcome; and, finally,it is the ethical and prudent thing to do in a nation of freepeople who will not tolerate being told how to live their lives,particularly by people whose actions are not even based on decentmotives or good will. Legalization and decontrol could be gradualin order to absorb the shock of a sudden change in policy, but Ihesitate to say this because no matter how rapidly legalizationis implemented it is nearly certain to take place too slowlyrather than too rapidly. Education of the public, especiallychildren, should continue, but educators should tell the truthabout drugs or lose credibility. Employers should continue todemand sobriety on the job, so the testers probably will not beput out of business immediately. The tests, however, mustdetermine sobriety at the time of the test, not last Saturdaynight. A man can be drunk on Saturday night and fly an airplaneas safely as it can be flown on Monday. Anti-Discrimination Laws should be passed to make it illegal todiscriminate against drug users in employment, housing, etc. Ofcourse, the performance and behavior of drug users should beevaluated by the standards that apply to everyone else. Research Some of the money saved by abandoning the waragainst drugs should be devoted to research to develop betterdrugs, e.g., drugs that induce euphoria but have no unpleasantside effects or withdrawal symptoms. Research could be done todevelop drugs that do not require larger and larger doses toachieve similar effects or at least reach the saturation doseearlier. Perhaps we should stop trying to prevent people fromtaking drugs (they will always take drugs) but give them betterdrugs. However, we must be careful not to let the governmentcreate a "brave new world" by means of some futureclass of drugs. It is unlikely, though, that any drug will everbe as great a threat to freedom of thought as television andreligion are. Dematerialism as a Solution Naturally I believe that an important steptoward ending the drug problem (and the problems of crime,poverty, forced labor, unhappiness, injustice, inequality, andundemocratic government) is the teaching of the virtues ofdematerialism in the schools. The adoption of dematerialism bysociety will be extremely gradual. For those of you who thinkthey know why dematerialism won't work, let's hear your solution.For the rest, let's begin to think of ways to make dematerialismwork in the United States, to overcome its difficulties (and itdoes have difficulties), and to convince others that we must makea change. Most (in my opinion, all) social problems have beensolved theoretically. The difficulty is convincing a brainwashedpeople to adopt the theoretical solutions and to make thempractical. The failures of others to do this are not reallyrelevant (unless you can prove that people will never learn). Letters to Congress The drug problem persists because thegovernment and other institutions continue to pursue incorrectsolutions based on poor reasoning and hysteria. We, the people,should demand an end to this folly through letters and telegramsto our elected representatives. One letter is probably worth athousand votes since congressmen know that fewer than one in athousand writes. An Appeal to Reason The comments by Szasz in an address he gave atan anti-prohibition conference in Brussels last year [3] are soincisive that I must repeat them. Sadly, the war on drugs has offered, andcontinues to offer, modern man much of what he seems to crave:fake compassion and genuine coercion; pseudo-science and realpaternalism; make-believe disease and metaphorical treatment;opportunistic politics and unctuous hypocrisy. It is hard for meto see how anyone who knows anything about history, aboutpharmacology, and about the fundamental human struggle forself-discipline and the seemingly equally intense human need toreject it and replace it with submission to a coercivelypaternalistic authority - how any such person could avoid comingto the conclusion that the war on drugs is simply another chapterin the natural history of human stupidity. I believe that just as we regard freedom ofspeech and religion as fundamental rights, so should we alsoregard freedom of self-medication as a fundamental right; andthat, instead of mendaciously opposing or mindlessly promotingillicit drugs, we should, paraphrasing Voltaire, make this maximour rule: "I disapprove of what you take, but I will defendto the death your right to take it!" In closing, it is important to emphasize thatthe war on drugs is the longest, most protracted formallydeclared war of this turbulent century: It has already lastedlonger than the First and Second World Wars and the wars in Koreaand Vietnam combined - and its end is nowhere in sight. Indeed,because this war is a war on human desire, it cannot be won inany meaningful sense of that term. Finally, since its principalbeneficiaries are the politicians who wage it, we must, againstall odds, try to enlist some honest and humane [and courageous]politicians in our quest to lay before the people the case thatpeace, after all, is better than war - even if the 'enemy' isstupidly called "drugs". Other Methods of Effecting Social Change Although I don't claim to know much abouteffecting social change (hopefully the reader will know more), itseems to me that legalization could be achieved by strongadvocacy, education, demonstrations, and organized lobbying.Prolegalization groups exist and are growing in number and size.Despite the negative aspects of lobbying and other types ofconcerted effort, participation in prolegalization organizationsprobably is essential in American society as it (Americansociety) is presently constituted. One such group is the DrugPolicy Foundation, 4801 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Washington,D.C., 20016. This group sponsors periodic meetings on issuespertaining to drug policy. These meetings are attended by manyresourceful people who support legalization and who could have aninfluence on government. Also, the first edition of The InternationalJournal on Drug Policy, 10 Maryland St., Liverpool L1 9BX,England, was published on July 1st, 1989. This bi-monthlypublication will concern itself with "the legal, social,medical, and educational issues [surrounding] the use ofpsychoactive substances". While the emergence of thisjournal should be viewed with cautious optimism, there is adanger that the people who contribute to it (and to the meetingsof the Drug Policy Foundation) will become a permanent part ofthe drug "industry" and thus become one more group ofpeople who have a vested interest in the drug problem never beingsolved. Remedies at Law There is one additional approach that I wouldlike to see tried, perhaps by a sympathetic attorney in his orher spare time, although I have no idea if one person couldmanage this alone. I would like to see someone file suit to getthe laws against drugs declared unconstitutional. The amount ofresources required to carry this out would depend on whether theintent was to win the case or not. The probability of winning islow because the decisions of the Supreme Court are not basedentirely on logic, but the action itself, if publicized properly,would help to educate the public and, if handled masterfully,would discredit authoritarians. Also, a class-action suit torecover damages for all those who have been injured by the lawsagainst drugs might have a similar"consciousness-raising" effect. Addendum So as not to disturb the organization of theSeptember 25, 1989 version of the paper, some new material iscollected in Appendix B. Thomas L.

Bouton, Jim, Ball Four and Ball Five,Edited by Leonard Shecter, Stein and Day, New York (1981). Appendix A: The Preface to the Book CeremonialChemistry There is probably one thing, and one thingonly, on which the leaders of all modern states agree; on whichCatholics, Protestants, Jews, Mohammedans, and atheists agree; onwhich Democrats, Republicans, Socialists, Communists, Liberals,and Conservatives agree; on which medical and scientificauthorities throughout the world agree; and on which the views,as expressed through opinion polls and voting records, of thelarge majority of individuals in all civilized countries agree.That thing is the "scientific fact" that certainsubstances which people like to ingest or inject are"dangerous" both to those who use them and to others;and that the use of such substances constitutes "drugabuse" or "drug addiction" - a disease whosecontrol and eradication are the duty of the combined forces ofthe medical profession and the state. However, there is littleagreement - from people to people, country to country, evendecade to decade - on which substances are acceptable and theiruse therefore considered a popular pastime, and which substancesare unacceptable and their use therefore considered "drugabuse" and "drug addiction." My aim in this book is at once simple andsweeping. First, I wish to identify the actual occurrences thatconstitute our so-called drug problem. I shall show that thesephenomena in fact consist of the passionate promotion and panickyprohibition of various substances; the habitual use and thedreaded avoidance of certain drugs; and, most generally, theregulation - by language, law, custom, religion, and every otherconceivable means of social and symbolic control - of certainkinds of ceremonial and sumptuary behaviors. Second, I wish to identify the conceptual realmand logical class into which these phenomena belong. I shall showthat they belong in the realm of religion and politics; that"dangerous drugs," addicts, and pushers are thescapegoats of our modern, secular, therapeutically imbuedsocieties; and that the ritual persecution of thesepharmacological and human agents must be seen against thehistorical backdrop of the ritual persecution of otherscapegoats, such as witches, Jews, and madmen. And third, I wish to identify the moral andlegal implications of the view that using and avoiding drugs arenot matters of health and disease but matters of good and evil;that, in other words, drug abuse is not a regrettable medicaldisease but a repudiated religious observance. Accordingly, ouroptions with respect to the "problem" of drugs are thesame as our options with respect to the "problem" ofreligions: that is, we can practice various degrees of toleranceand intolerance toward those whose religions - whether theocraticor therapeutic - differ from our own. For the past half-century the American peoplehave engaged in one of the most ruthless wars - fought under thecolors of drugs and doctors, diseases and treatments - that theworld has ever seen. If a hundred years ago the Americangovernment had tried to regulate what substances its citizenscould or could not ingest, the effort would have been ridiculedas absurd and rejected as unconstitutional. If fifty years agothe American government had tried to regulate what crops farmersin foreign countries could or could not cultivate, the effortwould have been criticized as meddling and rejected ascolonialism. Yet now the American government is deeply committedto imposing precisely such regulations - on its own citizens bymeans of criminal and mental health laws, and on those of othercountries by means of economic threats and incentives; and theseregulations - called "drug controls" or "narcoticcontrols" - are hailed and supported by countlessindividuals and institutions, both at home and abroad. We have thus managed to replace racial,religious, and military coercions and colonialisms, which nowseem to us dishonorable, with medical and therapeutic coercionsand colonialisms, which now seem to us honorable. Because theselatter controls are ostensibly based on Science and aim to secureonly Health, and because those who are so coerced and colonizedoften worship the idols of medical and therapeutic scientism asardently as do the coercers and colonizers, the victims cannoteven articulate their predicament and are therefore quitepowerless to resist their victimizers. Perhaps such preying ofpeople upon people - such symbolic cannibalism, providing meaningfor one life by depriving another of meaning - is an inexorablepart of the human condition and is therefore inevitable. But itis surely not inevitable for any one person to deceive himself orherself into believing that the ritual persecutions of scapegoats- in Crusades, Inquisitions, Final Solutions, or Wars on DrugAbuse - actually propitiate deities or prevent diseases. Thomas Szasz Syracuse, New York September 1, 1973 Appendix B: Addendum The following are a number of afterthoughtsthat were not included in the September 25, 1989 version of thepaper. 1) There are drugs that improve one's interestin things. Why not encourage our apathetic students to take thesedrugs provided the risk were acceptably low? 2) Probably, without drugs to aid ourimaginations, we cannot emerge from the social abyss into whichwe have descended. When the world is a better place, with fewermind-deadening institutions, we will not need drugs as much. 3) Another circumstance often mistaken foraddiction: Drugs anesthetize one from the pain of awareness ofthe world. The more sensitive one is, the greater the likelihoodof using drugs, all else being equal (and it never is). Somepeople would take drugs habitually whether chemical dependenceexisted or not; they simply cannot stand the world. Some of thesepeople are recognized geniuses. Vahn Lewis, a professor at U. ofT., Austin, asked me if there was a correlation between talentand drug-taking among jazz musicians in the 50s and 60s. Ithought for a minute and then replied, "Yes, the better theywere, the more drugs they took." Perhaps, they were too goodfor this world. (Undoubtedly some people take drugs because theyare not "good" enough.) 4) Some of the points made in my paper can beclarified by the ideas of Andrew Weil [5]. He supplied a generalprinciple to account for a number of phenomena that I accountedfor separately. The principle was lurking in my"subconscious" (unarticulated or preverbal thoughts),but Weil put it in words beautifully. The general idea is that itmay not be drugs at all that get you "high". 5) Corroboration of Weil's theories: Sometimesthe less you take the higher you get. Some people who have nofaith in drugs are not affected even by a large dose. 6) Frequently the spiritual rewards of takingdrugs far outweigh the harm and risk. 7) On the constitutional point again: Drugs arelegal. I wish someone would offer a constitutional defense. TheDPF should offer to pay for such a defense for people like thosemiddle-class farmers who grew pot out of economic necessity. 8) I have not emphasized sufficiently that wewill never accept laws against drugs or sex or food or guns oranything that is our personal business. Even the seat-belt lawsare wrong, though seat-belts are essential. Some people preferdrugs to sex. How would you like it if sex were prohibited! Thiswar can end up in terrorist attacks or all-out civil war.Although I personally am against violence, it wouldn't be hard toconvince some people that violence is the only answer. Eventuallythe religionists must be defeated, so there is no possibility ofpeace any time soon. 9) The following paragraph is from my paper"Introduction to Dematerialism" [6]: The point of my paper "Toward AxiomaticMorality" [7] is that it might be possible to get nearlyeveryone to agree to a few basic morals (or moral axioms) fromwhich all other morals [and laws] could be derived. By basicmorals, I do not mean religious superstition or sexual andpharmacological prudery. I am referring to respect for thefreedom of others (and their posterity), respect for theenvironment, and respect for truth. The fundamental principle ofmorality, which allows one to be free to do anything one pleasesso long as the freedom of others is not abridged, is theprehistoric basis for society, giving everyone his or her ownshare and space. I believe that respect for the freedom of othersimplies equal distribution of material wealth, since excesswealth can be used to abridge the freedom of the other, in onecase by purchasing excess political power, in another by biddingup the price of land and acquiring unfair exclusive access topart of the earth's surface, in another by holding a strongernegotiating position in an economic transaction, which might bethe employment of one person by another, a practice that isrevolting to many thoughtful people. The violation of thesemorals causes all of our troubles and creates all of our logicalconflicts and inconsistencies. 10) The following statement might be able to beunderstood by most intellectuals: "The notion of controllingthe possession of a substance is absurd. One may possessplutonium if one desires. The conflict arises out of theunreasonableness of society not out of the unreasonableness ofpossessing plutonium." These final statements may soundsilly to all but the most astute philosophers: "Everyone hasforbidden substances inside his or her body with a nonzeroprobability due to quantum effects." "Substance is avariation in the geometry of space, therefore the notion ofpossession of a substance is absurd." 11) A woman suffering from arthritiscomplained, in a letter to a Houston newspaper, that, due toanti-drug hysteria, she has difficulty obtaining prescriptionsfor Tylenol 3, which contains codeine, a drug the research forwhich was supported by her tax dollars. 12) The proponents of prohibition indulge in anumber of fallacies and one way to undo their mischief might beto point out their fallacies. Bennett, lately, has been indulgingin ad hominem arguments. Also, when he refers always tothe use of drugs as abuse, he is indulging in the fallacy of theexcluded middle. Almost all prohibitionists indulge in Bentham'sdyslogistic and eulogistic fallacies, which consist in applying aterm of either denigration or praise to an item that is logicallyneutral. An example is calling drugs "poison" or"horrible mind-bending chemicals" [Carl Rowan]. Clearlydrugs are good if they are used to remedy an unpleasant conditionor cure a disease; but, for the sake of argument, they could beconsidered neutral, i.e., their goodness or badness depends onhow they are used. Referring to drugs as poison is a clear caseof the dyslogistic fallacy. Another use of the dyslogistic fallacy isreference to the spread of drugs as an epidemic, whereas takingdrugs is not even a disease. Also, users of drugs are referred toas slaves even though they act more independently than theaverage employee of the average American corporation. Actually,the average Christian, who accepts Christian dogma withoutreservation is more of a slave than is the most hooked addict,i.e., the religionist's soul is entirely subjugated whereas thebody only of the addict is under the control of the addictingdrug, as evidenced by the fact that his will remains free to wishto be free of the addiction. Even this analysis is granting toomuch to the use of the word slave. How can one become the slaveof an inanimate substance, which has no will! An example of theeulogistic fallacy is the praise of the narcs as the good guys,when in fact they are no better and no worse than anyone elseincluding the dealers. This ignores the fundamental facts ofman's existence. 13) I recently heard an ex-addict make thefollowing statements more or less (I do not remember his exactwords): "I used drugs for about 30 years so I know what I'mtalking about when I talk about drugs. Some of these guys who aremaking these outrageous attacks on drugs ought to try drugsbefore they shoot off their mouths. Anyway, I quit taking drugsabout 10 years ago. Why? I guess they didn't fit into my plansanymore. I changed careers and the new career didn't require theuse of drugs. To be fair, I should say that the new career reallydidn't tolerate drugs either. Maybe I just outgrew drugs. I knowa lot of people to whom that happened. One day drugs no longerinterested them. They put up with all kinds of drug treatmentsand it didn't mean a thing, then one day they just stopped. Ithappens all the time, especially to older folks. So you canforget that hooked-for-life nonsense. "On the other hand, although I do not wishto argue that I am not better off now that I have stopped takingdrugs or that the next older person who stops taking drugs won'tbe better off, it's worth considering that, if you stop takingdrugs, you may lose the ability to take drugs! That's true. Youmay wish to take drugs again to get high, but your body may losethe ability to tolerate them after a certain age. This could leadto serious regrets. At least, it's worth thinking about. Peopleare accustomed to thinking that the decision to take drugs isirrevocable, but they do not consider the possibility that thedecision to stop taking drugs might be irrevocable. "But, I want to make a couple ofadditional comments about taking drugs: First, the laws againstdrugs caused me to take more drugs and to take them more oftenand for a very understandable reason. I took as much as I couldbecause I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get any more. Even ifI didn't feel like getting high and I had the opportunity to gethigh, I got high because I was afraid it might be my last chance.The law was always there with the threat of interrupting thesupply. One had to make hay while the sun shone. "Also, I want you to know that I was neverharmed by drugs, but I was harmed a number of times by the lawsagainst drugs. Once because I used an infected needle, which Iwould not have used had needles been available in the drugstore.A number of times I took bad drugs. If they were legal, I wouldhave used desoxyn or isotonic solution of methamphetaminehydrochloride for a stimulant, dilaudid (or pharmaceuticalheroin) for a narcotic, hashish (orally, in cookies) for ahypnotic (trance inducer or meditation enhancer), and valium fora tranquilizer and/or a soporific. By the way, it was a dark dayfor America when the ampules of isotonic solution ofmethamphetamine hydrochloride were removed from the market. Theeffect of that stuff, when injected, was like turning on thelights in a room that had been darkened with a dimmer switch.Perhaps it did a little harm, but the damage must have beennegligible compared to the benefits. Also, American civilization(such as it is) took a giant step backward when heroin wasremoved from the pharmacopoeia. "I know I can't sue the law enforcementcommunity and Congress, but those people owe me plenty. SometimesI hope there really will be a judgment day so that those guyswill get the punishment they deserve. But, what the hell, theyare just ignorant slobs like the rest of us. No one is perfect.If they were in the john when the brains were being passed out,is it their fault! "Finally, I want to say a word about drugsand sex. I enjoyed sex before I took drugs, but after I startedhaving sex while I was high I wondered why I thought it was sogreat when I was not high. I mean it was a thousand times better.So, go ahead. Abstain from drugs. (Probably you should nowadays.Maybe it's no longer safe. If so, too bad.) Maybe you'll livelonger. Maybe you'll never go to jail. Maybe you'll be a bigsuccess in business. So what! You'll miss out on one of the twoor three greatest things on this earth. Maybe I wouldn't thinkthat were true if society hadn't destroyed most of the naturalpleasures of life by perverting the way we live, but I can'timagine a life that wouldn't be enhanced by drugs. Some peoplethink Jesus lived a perfect life and he took drugs. Put that inyour pipe and smoke it." 14) The most important hidden assumption in thethinking of Bennett and other prohibitionists is that theindividual serves some higher purpose than himself, usually theneeds of the economy. In a paper, "Drug Abuse in theWorkplace", by Walsh and Gust of the NIDA [8], this tacitassumption stands behind every conclusion. It is interesting thatthey viewed as an intolerable circumstance surrounding drug usethe discovered fact that "marijuana and cocaine users`skipped work' two to three times as often as nonusers, simplybecause they 'didn't want to be there'. [Shuster C.R., TestimonyBefore the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control,May 7, 1986.] Walsh and Gust were unable to recognize that drugsmight have helped users realize their true feelings and that thedifficulty might lie with the workplace rather than with drugs. 15) Someone said, "I broke my toe and thedoctor gave me some nasty little codeine substitute. I needed apill for pain, but not a pill that makes me wish I hadn't takenit. Heroin would be fine. What's that you say? Heroin is toostrong? Fine, I'll take less. Also, I could use a Sabbatical fromthis nasty little world we live in. I could have killed two birdswith one stone, killed the pain and had a holiday, for the priceof the same harm to my body, if there would have been any harm.But this codeine substitute feels so much worse than heroin thatnobody will ever be able to convince me that it doesn't do moreharm as well. My body isn't stupid you know!" 16) "If I were a young man, I would go toany lengths to avoid living in a drug-free society. I would findan island refuge and grow and manufacture my own drugs or I wouldlive on the high seas as a pirate. Forcing a person to go withoutdrugs is intolerable repression. Some of the greatest moments ofmy life, physically and spiritually, have occurred while I washigh on legal and illegal drugs. Unfortunately, I am too old todo what I would have to do to re-create those moments." 17) The choice between taking drugs and nottaking drugs is a little like the choice between a plannedeconomy and a laissez-faire economy. Actually it is like areligious choice if not precisely a religious choice. MostAmericans think that planned economies have been discredited, butthat is not the case. It is easier to argue that laissez-faireeconomies have created the more undesirable circumstances. In anycase, to regulate one's own body chemistry or not is clearly apersonal decision. Nearly everyone chooses to regulate to someextent. 18) In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley depicts anation enslaved with the aid of drugs, free sex, and freedom fromreligion. It appears that Huxley has the situation reversed.Nowadays one sees that the forces of repression favor drugprohibition, restrained sex, and the spread of religious dogma. 19) Banning of all drugs, even for children,might be compared to banning masturbation. While masturbation isadmittedly a poor succedaneum for true erotic sex, our publicschool system has not sufficiently prepared manythirteen-year-old children for responsible, meaningful sexualrelations. For the time being, then, masturbation is theinevitable alternative. When society is sufficiently advancedthat no one feels the need for the artificiality of drugs,coercion will no longer be required to discourage the use ofdrugs. Until that time, no amount of coercion will suffice. Thus,it appears that, as usual, we have the cart before the horse. Theproblem isn't drugs at all; it is a badly organized society. References 5.

Wayburn, PhD Everything We Need to Know We Learned in Kindergarten. We think we know almost everything; what weactually know is almost nothing - and most of that is false. Themost pernicious type of ignorance is belief in falsehood. We areignorant, but our minds are filled with something. In thebeginning, our minds begin to be filled by words, which representideas. That's why I shall place so much emphasis on the abuse ofwords. Next, our minds begin to be filled with notions, i.e.,unexamined assumptions, promulgated or inculcated by parents,teachers, government, business, etc. Some of these notions wehear repeated every day, but others are buried so deeply that weare never aware of their existence. In either case they areprejudices; they have been assimilated without the exercise ofour judgment or our reason. Some are true, but most are false.Social institutions are willing to go to great lengths to preventfalsehood from being exposed. Heterodox views are everywhererepressed. The world stands on the brink of the Orwellian abyss. People who are unwilling to examine theirprejudices are said to be closed-minded. The notion that allfundamental philosophical questions have been answered is theultimate mind closer. The world is filled with closed-mindedpeople and we may never be able to influence most of them by anappeal to reason, but that does not excuse any one of us as anindividual from being willing to drag out and examine under thecold light of reason even our most cherished prejudices. Theworld may not be ready to give up its myths, but there is no lawof the universe that says we cannot understand something merelybecause our ability to make a living depends on our notunderstanding it. As soon as one of our assumptions is questionedor its opposite averred by even one solitary soul, it becomesincumbent upon us to drop the contested claim as an assumptionand provide for it, instead, a proof. If the claim ismetaphysical, it must be supported by the twin pillars ofreasonableness (aesthetics) and utility. That's what I believe.None of us is completely open-minded. I am curious to know,however, why there is such a great disparity between what one cansay to an individual and what one can say to the general public. Currently, we are moving from a law-enforcementapproach to a prevention-treatment approach to drugs. This changeis resisted by government to whom it represents a loss of power,but it is supported by business, education, medicine, and otherinstitutions that stand to gain. The unstated assumption is that,since prevention and treatment are less repressive than lawenforcement, they are not at all repressive. This is thefallacy of false consolation, an appeal to peace (ad quietem).Both law-enforcement and prevention-treatment are characterizedby the notion that one person has a right to regulate thebehavior of another. The prevention-treatment approach puts drugsunder the auspices of the health establishment. People who haverun afoul of both the criminal-justice system and themental-health system know that between the two there is not muchto choose. Both enjoy pretty gruesome reputations. The days ofshock therapy, pre-frontal lobotomies, and "One Flew Overthe Cuckoos Nest" are not far behind us, if they arebehind us. The Supreme Court ruled recently that mental healthinstitutions may force patients to take drugs against their will.Man's inhumanity to man continues apace. The decriminalized"addict" may wonder whether he has jumped out of thefrying pan directly into the flame. The jailer knows damn well heis punishing someone for nonstandard behavior, in which he mayindulge himself. The therapist may be running around with hishead full of what is very likely to turn out to be mush. The assumption that some people have a right tohave power over other people is usually justified on the basisthat the dominant people know what's best. Even if we dispose ofthe notion that drugs represent a public-health problem, we willhave to contend with those who have the most to gain from thepoint of view that drugs represent a spiritual problem, namely,the clergy. As Bertrand Russell [1] said, "It is possiblethat mankind is on the threshold of a golden age; but, if so, itwill be necessary first to slay the dragon that guards the door,and this dragon is religion." (I would have said "organizedreligion".) Eventually we will realize that we have apolitical problem resulting from spiritual corruption. Thatproblem has nothing to do with drugs. An example of spiritualcorruption, in my opinion, is the notion that one should receivesomething in return for what one gives. This is supportedindirectly by the so-called Protestant work ethic, which has beenadopted by Catholics and which is accepted in Asia. Only by acomplete change of heart will we be able to recognize the typesof political change required, but we should not look forward tothe assistance of any professional politician alive in this worldtoday. Enlightenment will come exceedingly slowly and iscontingent upon the survival of the human race. In the meantime,we must struggle to be allowed to teach our view of things incontradistinction to the conventional wisdom. Exposing fallaciesand stating unstated assumptions might be helpful. A Drug-Free Society is Desirable. Whether stated or unstated, this represents aserious fallacy backed up by dozens of other fallacies. In myprevious paper [2], I said what I thought of the idea. It isbased in part on the notion that drugs are what get us high. Thisassumption, taken to be so obvious as to require no mention, isquestioned by Andrew Weil [3]. What if we show people how to gethigh without drugs, but the subsequent behavior and otherconsequences of getting high were the same as they are now withdrugs. Would that be acceptable to prohibitionists? Some of thembelieve that pleasure itself is evil. The idea that a drug-freesociety is desirable depends, too, on the assumption that genuinedevotees of drugs will submit to tyranny. Frequently, we are told that taking drugs isimmoral. This is the vague-generalities fallacy, another fallacyof confusion and an example of ad judicium (to judgment).Some morals are good, others bad. The proponent implies that thenature of good morals is understood and that, if we violate hismorals, we are against Morality. Drugs may be bad for the bodybut good for the soul. Perhaps the body and the soul are at warfor possession of the will. In Brave New World, Aldous Huxleypictured a dreadful totalitarian society, supported by atheism,free sex, and free drugs. Huxley's fears are well founded, but,in my opinion, he has precisely reversed the instruments ofrepression, perhaps purposely to suggest what he could notespouse publicly. A drug-free society would expedite therepression of independent thought. Drug users have been in thevanguard of the anti-war and other progressive movements,including the movements for civil rights, women's rights, and gayrights. Some believe that LSD and marijuana weresymptoms of "the movement", but it is easy to make agood case that they were the prime cause. Whatever else onethinks of Uspenski, it is difficult to argue against his theorythat drugs provide a conscious shock that enables one to breakthrough the walls of prejudice that bind us, especially in asociety where we are immersed in propaganda. In any case, thosewho use drugs are in a better position than those who don't tojudge the validity of the argument. Finally, many people believethat drugs themselves are the cause of the drug problem. Thisassumption is highly suspect. Apparently, outside of context,drugs are neutral. Almost all prohibitionists indulge in Bentham's[4] dyslogistic and eulogistic fallacies, which consist inapplying a term of either denigration or praise to an item thatis logically neutral. An example is calling drugs"poison" or "horrible mind-bending chemicals"[Carl Rowan]. Clearly drugs are good if they are used to remedyan unpleasant condition or cure a disease; but, for the sake ofargument, they could be considered neutral; i.e., their goodnessor badness depends on how they are used. Referring to drugs as"poison" is a clear case of the dyslogistic fallacy.Potassium cyanide is poison! William Bennett, lately, has beenindulging in ad hominem arguments. Users of drugs are referred to as"slaves" even though they act more independently thanthe average employee of the average American corporation.Actually, the average religionist, who accepts religious dogmawithout reservation is more of a slave than is the most hookedaddict; i.e., the religionist's soul is entirely subjugatedwhereas the body only of the addict is under the control of theaddicting drug, as evidenced by the fact that his will remainsfree to wish to be free of the addiction. Even this analysis isgranting too much to the use of the word slave. How can onebecome the slave of an inanimate substance, which has no will! Similarly, we are told that drug enforcers arethe "good guys" and users and dealers are the "badguys". This ignores the fundamental facts of humanexistence. Needless to say, the mere taking of drugs does notautomatically elevate people to an elite class of individualscapable of discerning right from wrong and able to see throughall the illusions and myths perpetuated by society. On the otherhand, many people who are waging the war on drugs employ deviousand underhanded tactics, not the least dishonorable of which isarranging a highly contrived purchase of drugs near the WhiteHouse and then implying, for rhetorical purposes, that thepurchase was routine. Thus, it is not at all clear that those whoare trying to prevent people from taking drugs are the "goodguys" and those who are using drugs are the "badguys" as the establishment would have us believe. Fallacies and Lies Can Be Used to Prevent Drug Use. Recently I attended a class given by theHouston Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (HCADA) for people whowill speak to students in the Houston Independent School District(HISD) to prevent them from taking drugs. I attended anotherclass (to be discussed below) for children referred by the courtand their parents. I will not apologize to the reader forattending only two classes or for assuming that these classeswere typical. No one is better able to judge than some of myaudience whether the fallacies discussed in the sequel apply ornot. The assumption that falsehood and fallacious reasoning are aproper means to the end of preventing children from taking drugsis not specifically stated by the HCADA nor do they acknowledgeit; but, if it is not behind their program, they are very badlydeceived. Under these circumstances, this is theend-justifies-the-means fallacy (ad judicium). "Charles Manson, for example, took drugs,therefore drugs are bad" is an example of an ad odium(to hatred) fallacy. It neglects the fact that William RowanHamilton, for example, took drugs. Counselors are advised to tellthe students that marijuana, nowadays, is 1000% more powerfulthan formerly rather than 10 times more powerful, despite thefact that percentages are applied normally only when they liebetween 0 and 100. Whether increase in strength is observed ornot (NORML says "not"), the deception that 1000% seemsmore than 10-times reinforces stupidity and is ad metum(to fear). Again, "the end justifies the means". TheHCADA neglects to mention that one might simply take 1/10th asmuch, which will reduce the trauma to the throat, very muchexaggerated by HCADA. The HCADA does not recommend ingestion byeating (in hash brownies, say) or the use of a water pipe, whichthey might do if they were truly interested in the student'swelfare. The HCADA says that marijuana is toxic. Thebest scientific data places its toxicity below that of potatoeson the LD-50 scale. Also, marijuana has a therapeutic ratioimmeasurably superior to that of aspirin, for example. HCADAclaims marijuana is often contaminated, sometimes by dried horsemanure. This is unjustified and ad metum. They describehorrible effects of smoking pot, which, in real life, are neverseen. They give data for exceptionally heavy smoking and fortests done on animals with absurdly heavy doses. They describe anisolated case as though it were common, failing to givestatistics. Ad metum, again and again. They showphotographs of damaged nerves in a videotape by AIMS Media of VanNuys, California, which refuses to supply literature citationsfor the purported research. Lester Grinspoon thinks it's faked.The AIMS tape features a narrator dressed in a white lab coatwith a stethoscope hanging around his neck. The more astutestudents will recognize that this man is not likely to need astethoscope during the narration of this tape. This is anappeal-to-authority fallacy, an example of ad verecundiam(to modesty). Reported side-effects of marijuana are listedin dyslogistic terms, whereas they might have been listed ineulogistic terms by a devotee of pot or in neutral terms by anunbiased reporter. Examples: "lethargic" (dyslogistic)instead of "meditative" (eulogistic), "loss ofinterest in school" instead of "able to see through thestupidity of the curriculum and the teachers","absenteeism" instead of "unwilling to toleratethe inhospitable atmosphere in which we work and learn","chaotic" thinking instead of "creative" (or"imaginative") thinking, and so on. In a perverse abuseof language, many anti-drug people try to detach the word"square" from non-users and attach it to users."Hip" and "square" are the words coined byusers to differentiate themselves from others. The HCADA employs the gateway fallacy.Epidemiological evidence seems to point to marijuana as a"gateway" to "harder" drugs. The evidence canbe explained by the behavior of individuals who cannot obtaintheir drug of choice due to the laws against drugs. TheHCADA employs a poster that indicates one might go to jail forsmoking pot without mentioning that many people believe that thelaws against smoking pot should be repealed. They claim thatsmoking marijuana impairs one's sense of time without mentioningthe great musicians who smoked marijuana when they played. It isintellectually dishonest to report only half of the story, butthat's what HCADA does at every point. They divide drugsimproperly into stimulants and depressants. Two charts were employed showing drugs that arenot abused and drugs of abuse. Nyquil, which can be abused, ifthe word is to have any meaning, was on the first chart, andalcohol and cigarets as well as the usual illegal drugs wereshown on the second chart. I asked if moderate use of alcohol orany of the illegal drugs constituted drug abuse. I was told thatany use whatsoever was considered abuse. This is theexcluded-middle fallacy and illustrates that the Houston Councilof Alcohol and Drug Abuse doesn't know the meaning of theword "abuse". I could go on and on, but I will finishby noting that the teacher commented in passing that, "withkids, honesty is best"! After the class, I reminded the teacher thatexaggerating the danger had been tried and failed. When I pointedout the factual and logical errors in her presentation, she"refuted" my objections on the basis that (i) she hadmany years experience in this field and I had very little (adverecundiam), (ii) her presentation was consistent with thelatest "scientific" research, and (iii) the HCADA was ahighly respected United-Way institution. These are fallaciousappeals to authority and the use of the term"scientific" is a vague generality. I pointed out thatit is intellectually dishonest not to present both sides. Evenwhen I reminded her that it was not I who was disseminatingquestionable facts in the public schools, she insisted that theburden of proof was on me. Students don't have to prove we arelying, they need only know it, after which they discounteverything we have said even though some of it may be true."Falsehood is so unexacting, [it] needs so little help tomake itself manifest!" [Proust] If I wished, I was told, Icould bring my argument to the director, but the director refusedto meet with me and review the evidence I had assembled. So muchfor truth in the public schools of Houston. My letters to theschool board and the United Way are still in my head. They willbe written but probably to no avail. Drug Abuse and Drug Addiction Are Diseases. The effect of this assumption, whether statedor unstated, is to bring "drug abuse" and "drugaddiction" under the purview of the medical profession. Wewish to investigate under what circumstances this may be donelegitimately. Peele [5], Schaler [6], and others make anexcellent case that it cannot be done at all. But, placing drugtreatment under the auspices of the medical professionconstitutes an appeal to respect for authority and to fear.Leading authorities support prevention and treatment, therefore,if we are against prevention and treatment, we are againstScience. In the preface of Ceremonial Chemistry [7], Szaszstates, essentially, that "everyone" is against drugs,but different drugs depending on era and culture. The use ofacceptable drugs is a popular pastime, while the use ofunacceptable drugs is considered "drug abuse" and"drug addiction." "Drug abuse is not a regrettablemedical disease but a repudiated religious observance.Accordingly, our options with respect to the 'problem' of drugsare the same as our options with respect to the 'problem' ofreligions: that is, we can practice various degrees of toleranceand intolerance toward those whose religions - whether theocraticor therapeutic - differ from our own." I believe that terms such as"disease", "epidemic", "treatment",and "recovering" in the context of drug (mis)useoriginated in metaphor but continue to be used to confuse thepublic because it is advantageous to the health professions to doso, in which case the use of these terms is the impostor-termsfallacy (ad judicium), a fallacy of confusion. Even theuse of the word "illness" in the phrase "mentalillness" probably originated as a metaphor but becameconfused with actual illness almost immediately. In any case, itis not at all clear that mental illness exists in the sense thatthe health profession would like us to believe it exists. Szasz[8] thinks not. Behind the disease model of conflicts in livingis the unstated assumption that "social intercourse would beharmonious, satisfying, and the secure basis of a good life wereit not for the disrupting influences of mental illness." The Random House Dictionary of the EnglishLanguage [9] defines disease as (i) a condition of the bodyin which there is incorrect function resulting from the effect ofheredity, infection, diet, or environment and (ii) any derangedor depraved condition, as of the mind, society, etc. Thedefinition in The Mosby Medical Encyclopedia [10] agreeswith (i) but doesn't include (ii). Health professionals canremove people from environment or society temporarily at somecost, but they, the people, must return eventually to anenvironment or society about which the health profession can donothing. Therefore, we may dismiss society and environment fromthe discussion for the time being. We must then inquire as to themeaning of "deranged" and "depraved" andwhether they might not be dyslogistic terms for behavior of whichwe do not approve, behavior that might just as well be describedin eulogistic terms, such as "divinely inspired" or"impelled by a vision", or neutral terms such as"nonstandard". The effect of infection can be ruled out; thereare no germs, viruses, etc. If we may consider drugs part of ourdiets, we recognize that some discomfort due to having takendrugs might be considered disease, but we wonder if that is whatis being treated by physicians and other members of the healthprofessions. The effects of heredity have been discussed inconnection with alcohol. Many researchers still believe in a genefor alcoholism; but, as shown by Peele [5], undesirable responsesto alcohol can be explained in other ways. In any case, we hoperesearchers identify the gene for drug addiction soon, if itexists, so that those of us who don't carry it can use drugscasually without fear of becoming addicted! I have not encountered definitions of drugabuse or drug addiction. As discussed above, HCADA does notdistinguish between use and abuse. Mathre [11] dissociates casualusers and people "who choose to alter their state ofconsciousness through drugs" from abusers and addicts. Peele[5] states that "the administration's own statisticsdisprove the link between recreational drug use andaddiction". Mathre seems to exempt drug (or chemical)dependence from her disease model of addiction, but she does notsay what addiction is. I have compiled a short list of phenomena thatare sometimes referred to as (or mistaken for) drug addiction:(1) self-medication for chronic depression or chronic pain, (2)taking a drug that causes a symptom that can be relieved only bytaking more of the drug or by the passage of a few hours, (3)acute withdrawal symptoms that last several days, (4) dedicationto the repetition of a pleasurable experience regardless oflong-range consequences, (5) taking a drug to perform a task,which might have to be performed several times a week, perhaps tomake a living, (6) obligatory daily performance of a task thatcannot be performed during withdrawal from a drug, (7) usingdrugs to isolate oneself from the painful realities of life in abad world, (8) unwillingness to pass an opportunity to take drugsbecause the law may cut off one's supply, (9) the case of a drugthat, like valium or blood-pressure medication, poses a healthrisk if one forgets to take it in the absence of a craving that(blessedly) reminds one to take it. In Case 1, a physician mayprescribe another drug, Case 2 is normal and involves a consciouschoice between two alternatives on the part of the individual,Case 3 might require supervised tapering off or the prescriptionof other drugs, Cases 4-8 are behavioral choices in the face ofcircumstances that are beyond a therapist's control. I do notbelieve any of the cases correspond to what we normally call adisease. Case 9 is a normal medical situation and stretches themeaning of addiction seriously, but may not be omitted as itconstitutes a requirement to take the drug, which, in this caseand in this case alone, is strictly medical. Drug abuse usually refers to some type ofbehavior of which other people do not approve but which isconsistent with the goals of the user, who might be a criminal oronly an oddball. The term "denial" is a fallaciousappeal to the authority of the treatment community in a disputewith a user who is insufficiently articulate to defend his valuesand motives. The term "denial" is an impostor. When theuser himself disapproves of his own behavior, the term "drugabuse" might make sense, unless the user is a victim ofanti-drug propaganda. Many people who have tried to stop takingdrugs might benefit from the friendship and advice of other drugusers. As suggested by Henman [12], drug use must be looked atfrom the perspective of the user. Ex-Users and Non-Users Are Competent to Counsel. Occasionally a person who has never used drugsbut is possessed of great sensitivity and penetrating insightmight be able to offer useful advice to drug users, but normallya non-user simply does not know what's going on. Ex-users areusually failed users. If they didn't understand drugs when theywere using them, why should they be expected to understand themnow? In my many years of experience in the drugculture (1954-1963 and 1969-1980), I have observed very fewpeople whose drug taking was troublesome to themselves or otherusers. Ex-users were sometimes more troublesome within the drugcommunity than were users. If a member of the set was out ofline, the other members could usually bring social pressure tobear upon the transgressor and things would soon return tonormal. Many of the people with whom I associated during thoseyears have died short of their 70s, but there is much to be saidfor quality of life. Most people, when they are born, have noright to expect to live as interesting a life as some of myfriends have lived. The reader might protest that I was notliving in the inner-city ghetto of 1990. It is widely assumedthat the greatest problem in the inner city ghetto is drugs, butisn't it more likely that racism and the other institutions that createdthe ghetto are the central problem? We Can Predict Human Behavior. Only mathematics is unconditionally true.Physicists employ mathematics to provide provisional solutions toeasy problems. The difficult problems are referred to chemistsunless they involve the mystery of life, in which case they arereferred to biologists. Since World War II, social scientists,particularly economists, have tried to apply the techniques ofphysics to the behavior of people. Despite some successes, thelikelihood of continued progress in this direction is open todoubt, especially now that the phenomenon of chaos has beenobserved in systems as simple as a dripping water faucet! For thepurposes of treating drug users, it is insufficient to predictthe behavior of people in statistical aggregates and even that issuspect. The twentieth century has been distinguished byrevealing what can not be done by science. As one might expect from the name, The HoustonCouncil on Alcohol and Drug Abuse attempts to exploit theparallel between alcoholics and people who use drugs excessively(according to someone). In particular, they employ the word"sober" to mean "not high on drugs". This isan impostor term as many drugs, e.g., pot, make one abnormallysober. The comparison with alcohol breaks down because, whereasalcoholics might not avail themselves of other drugs tocounteract the effects of alcohol or to substitute for alcoholwhen alcohol is not indicated, free drug users could employ alarge slate of drugs, including alcohol, to adjust their bodychemistry appropriately under most circumstances; i.e., theymight use one drug to work, another to play, another to have sex,a fourth to drive home, and a fifth to go to sleep. With moreresearch, this might be accomplished safely. At the second class at the HCADA, referred toabove, the class leader claimed he could always recognize a kidfrom a dysfunctional family. According to Bertrand Russell [13],the family has been dysfunctional since men began to work awayfrom the homestead, and it has become less functional with eachchange in modern society. Why blame dysfunctionality on drugswhen both parents work? Also, why must it be assumed always thatthe behavioral choices of the drug user are incorrect? Often themembers of the family who are troubled by a person taking drugs,although convinced of the rectitude of their conduct, are notwell-behaved themselves, nor do they always have the best motivesfor wishing to restrict the user's activities. How many wives ofmusicians complain about the behavior of their husbands withoutunderstanding the importance of the musician's quest! We have aproblem of conflicting values, not a drug problem. The thrust of the class was an explication (asfact) of the victim-enabler-hero-scapegoat-loner-mascot theorywherein "volunteers" were asked to simulate the variousroles, holding up poster-size signs with lists of psychologicalattributes. Oversimplifications aside, it is clear that thistheory cannot predict. The class leader did not indicate that thetheory was conjectural and unproven. The term "victim"is clearly an impostor, used to signal the disease theory ofnonstandard behavior. The term "enabler" ignores theimpediments created by most spouses of alcoholics and drug users.Also, the theory totally ignores the possibility that the school,the workplace, or the political system in which we live is the"culprit". Political theory seems to be missing fromalmost all approaches to social problems in the United States.Since "substance abuse" seems to be a symptom of adeeper problem, why should we not expect abstinence to shift theproblem elsewhere? While watching the class, I could not help butbe struck by the wide disparity of backgrounds of those present.This must be reflected in a wide disparity in values. Assuggested by Szasz [8], why should a single approach fiteveryone? The self-esteem fad was very much in evidence,but why should people feel good about doing bad? Children haveonly to turn on the TV to realize how unimportant they are in asociety where only famous people count, an abuse perpetuated byourselves, today, in the conference for which this paper wasprepared. This business of applauding themselves and each otherat the tiniest provocation and standing up and saying "Hi,I'm Darrell" is brainwashing and gets the respect itdeserves among children. The group leader referred to God andquoted Proverbs (but not Proverbs 31:6,7) in violation of theFirst Amendment, as discussed by Luff [14]. The Tough Love theorywas introduced. Although there may be a little truth to the idea,truth suffers when one tries to turn tough love into a business.The unstated assumption is that one can package wisdom. Nevertheless, some people do stop takingdrugs. Does that mean treatment has been successful? This is the post-hoc-ergo-propter-hocfallacy (after this, therefore because of this). Perhaps subjectshave merely exchanged one form of deviance for another. Perhapssubjects have invested a great deal of money and don't want toadmit they have wasted it. (Charter Hospital of Sugarland, Texas,charges $825/day for 30 days and employs some pretty hard sell.)This is not a cure; it's self-deception. And this is the mainpoint: Do people who stop taking drugs and enter a lifelongabstinence program along the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous reallyimprove their lives? Are they not simply exchanging one bad habitfor another, or, perhaps, exhibiting the same character defect ina new way? Perhaps people in treatment "cults" aresaving the body at the expense of the soul. "I'd rather be adrunk than belong to AA." Perhaps, though, as in the case ofMarcel's friend Saint-Loup, who stopped taking cocaine to becomea war hero in Remembrance of Things Past, they have simplyfound something better to do. I believe that nearly anyone willstop using drugs if he has an opportunity to do somethingworthwhile with which drugs are incompatible. The Primary Function of a Human Being Is to Serve theEconomy. The most important unstated assumption in thethinking of William Bennett and other prohibitionists is that theindividual serves some higher purpose other than himself, usuallythe needs of the economy. In a paper, "Drug Abuse in theWorkplace", by Walsh and Gust of the National Institute onDrug Abuse (NIDA) [15], this tacit assumption stands behind everyconclusion. It is interesting that they viewed as an intolerablecircumstance of drug use the discovered fact that "marijuanaand cocaine users 'skipped work' two to three times as often asnonusers, simply because they 'didn't want to be there'."[Shuster C.R., Testimony Before the House Select Committee onNarcotics Abuse and Control, May 7, 1986.] Walsh and Gust wereunable to recognize that drugs might have helped users realizetheir true feelings and that the difficulty might lie with theworkplace rather than with drugs. "The number one problem inthe workplace is drugs," they tell us. But, according toHusch [16], "Work is not the arena to which problems arebrought, rather work may be the forum within which problemsarise." Walsh and Gust assume obliquely that drug useleads to impairment, neglecting cases where it leads to improvedperformance. They refer to occupations "where it isessential that the individual be free of any and all effects ofall drugs at all times", without naming even one suchoccupation. I challenge. The assumption is that theindividual should adjust to the workplace rather than the otherway around. NIDA advocates Tough But Fair drug policies, but isit likely that business will be fair when faced with values thatconflict with its own? Why is it that, according to business,drugs are harmful but pesticides are not? Houston, Texas September 19, 1990 References 1.

Wayburn, PhD The Plenary Sessions The plenary sessions are elitist. Moreover, Ididn't hear anything new or insightful in the plenary sessionsthat I attended. This is to be expected from elitism. The idea ofeffecting social change by influencing important people who willthen make their influence felt is not a good idea, in my opinion.It always seems to involve the institutionalization of at least alittle falsehood because important people got to be important byembracing falsehood, usually, at least the falsehood, asdistinguished by me according to my philosophy, that it is validfor one person to enjoy more importance than another. Perhaps, inorder to practice what I preach, I ought to write anonymously. Anice precedent for that is N. Bourbaki, which is the pseudonymfor a group of (highly elite (!)) mathematicians who wrote anentire collection of math books covering almost all of basicadvanced math in a French that is accessible to nearly everyone.One of the plenary speakers actually addressed the problem of thelimits of what a political person can say publicly. I would haveliked to ask, "Are these talks, then, to be taken as true orfalse? I mean, do you people really believe what you're saying orare you saying what is merely politically expedient?" I believe (and I think Bruce Alexander saidthis too) that the important thing is to produce a body ofstatements that have meaning and to approach the truth (thecongruence of statements with events) as closely as possible.This, then, will be disseminated into the collectiveconsciousness of humanity and affect the way people think andact. When enough people think and act appropriately, appropriatechange will be inevitable. We must always refer to an ideal toknow what to think and do. It doesn't help to create a politicswith no basis. Being "realistic" is just an excuse forbeing wrong. We need to understand without worrying about what is"acceptable" and what is not. Then, we need to find afelicitous way to speak the truth recognizing that we arefallible. If money, for example, is a harmful andunnecessary institution, it will not help to say otherwise, butit might be helpful to admit that my proof (and I do have aproof) is based on assumptions that may not be correct and thatwe ought not to dispense with money suddenly but rather favormeasures that lead to its eventual disappearance. So, instead ofsaying we will accept the monopoly of the control of drugs by themedical profession, we should say we will never accept such astate of affairs and would rather see nothing done (other thanthe speaking of the truth) until that eventuality is swept out ofthe collective mind. We, on the other hand, can lend our ownpersonal aid to those who are the most abused in the most acuteways by the status quo, whether our help lies inside or outsidethe law. Presumably, what some members of the ACLU are doingrenders aid within the law as far as it can be rendered in case aperson's liberty be violated. The view that law enforcementshould be replaced by prevention and treatment was fairly welldiscredited in the workshops I attended. I shall discuss theworkshops next. National Drug Strategy Network Someone explained the network and handed outcopies of the newsletter, which apparently has some goodlate-breaking information. We need reasoning more than we neednews however. The Hemp Tour representative, a young woman,complained about elitism and certain barriers at the meeting they(the Hemp Tour) had difficulty dealing with, but, actually, sheheld the floor longer than anyone. Health and Science Committee Lester Grinspoon stated that Kevin Zeese hadasked him to confine our mission to (i) a public-health plan and(ii) information. Grinspoon and the co-chair, a person whose nameescapes me, thought we ought to forget about the public-healthplan for now and only Jeffrey Schaler was not content to confineour mission to information. We began with a tremendous amount ofconfusion, though, because everyone had a different idea aboutwho our target should be and what sort of information wasrelevant. Someone said we should address ourselves to otherscientists first and I seconded that reminding the room that thatwould provide a natural filter for unscientific information. Ineglected (or was afraid) to ask how many of us were"real" scientists, i.e., people who apply mathematicsto the analysis of models of nature (mathematicians, physicists,physical chemists, and engineering scientists). (Oh heck, maybebiologists, psychologists, and some MDs are scientists after all,but the "real" progress in science has come fromphysicists and mathematicians. The Salk vaccine is not to becompared to the quantum theory or functional analysis.) Timidly Isuggested that if there was a body of valid scientificinformation we ought to identify it and protect it from theinfiltration of scientific drivel. Robert Goodman suggested thatwe eschew generalities and embrace specifics and I agree thatthat's the only way it can be done. We agreed that a letter would be writtenrefuting a recent article in Science and people gottogether afterward to arrange to do that. (The more signatures byfamous people, the greater the chance of publication,regrettably.) Art Leccese wants to get together with me to try tostart a truth squad. I know how to do that in a valid way,although it sounds scary on the face of it. Actually, Lester wasthe one that suggested that one be formed, although, clearly,that was the import of my suggestion. So from great confusion asort of consensus was formed, but it is unclear how our consensuswill have a practical effect. I think if Art and I (and Robert ifhe's willing) get together and start a drug literature abstractsservice with thorough specific discrediting of invalid research,we will have done a great deal. Obviously, we could only survey asmall fraction of the scientific literature at first until we gotinstitutional help. We might restrict ourselves to pharmacologyand toxicology, omitting epidemiology, and also restrictourselves to the journals with the widest circulation. We need anexpert statistician to help us, because "figures don't lie,but liars figure". Why Marijuana Should Be Treated Separately I think they are right about one thing atleast. Marijuana will be treated separately. Dale Gieringerbetrayed a genuine bias against other drugs. "Our drug iscool, but your drug is bad." I talked about that in my firstdrug paper. Also, Don Fiedler said "other drugs" twicebut "harder drugs" once, without saying in what sense"harder". I would never agree to separate treatment formarijuana, but, if they want to treat marijuana separately, theymust announce that this is a compromise. If they do not, I willfight them just hard as I would fight someone who wants to treatalcohol separately. Gieringer used a specious argument aboutmarijuana having a constituency and, since heroin addicts don'tdemand rights, they are not entitled to any. Richard Cowan, thelibertarian, claiming to speak the absolute truth, spoke what isalmost certainly an untruth, namely, that marijuana is the leastdangerous drug. Now, there are millions, perhaps an infinitenumber if we count the undiscovered drugs, so the probabilitythat marijuana is the least harmful is nearly zero. I suggestedyohimbine (an aphrodisiac discussed in The Naked Lunch) asa better candidate. Mary Lynn Mathre said that the persistence ofmarijuana in the urine might induce some users to switch tococaine, say, and, I must admit, I never thought of that. Also,she defined an addict as anyone who says he (or she) is. Ialready commented that this definition is easy to apply but,perhaps, not too useful, as many people are swayed by theirimaginations. (Maybe this is a good time to interject theChristian Science interpretation, which, I believe, isunfalsifiable and, therefore, may not be introduced intoscientific discussion, but it still deserves our attention. (Tobe falsifiable means that an experiment or a chain of reasoningcould prove it false if it were false.) Maybe it really is all inour heads or in the heads of others. In Christian Science, thereason infants get ill is that they are influenced by thethinking of those around them. This is what Christian Scientistscall "malpractice". It is not clear that the infantexperiences the disease or only the adults who observe it do.) Alternative Models for Reform Christina Johns said that no one has addressedthe underlying social causes, but she didn't read last year'sCatalog. I addressed them. She said she would reference me nexttime, but she ought to reference Ellen Luff's paper given thisyear too. We'll see. I'm going to describe Wasserman's veryinteresting paper, which, by the way, contains the firstreference I have ever seen to the work of Joel Feinberg, my AuntMildred's brother. Wasserman points out a number ofinconsistencies and other legal difficulties arising fromhalf-way measures like excusing the buyer and prosecuting theseller, non-enforcement, and under-enforcement. Then he gets intoa hot topic - culpability for crimes committed under theinfluence. He makes an ambiguous statement, namely, "It isundisputed that a high proportion of violent crimes are committedunder the influence of alcohol and other drugs." Does hemeans that the drugs influenced the commission of the crime orthat some other aspect of the criminals state or behavior wasinfluenced by the drug? If the latter, the answer is "Sowhat". If the former, the answer is "How would youknow?" All we can do is identify the coincidence of theevents committed, namely, a violent crime and having taken adrug. No inference about cause and effect can be drawn, nor willit ever be able to be drawn - in my opinion. Then, he questionsthe validity of DWI laws. I have questioned them orally, but thisis the first time I have seen them questioned in print. Good forhim. Potsdam State College (part of SUNY) did an experiment. Theyhad a bunch of drivers take a skills test sober, then get drunkand repeat the test. Most subjects did much worse, but the guywho scored highest sober also scored higher drunk than anyoneelse scored sober. True, he hit one pylon when he was drunk, buthe still drove better than any sober person - in the test.Wasserman likes the Fletcher model whereby the intoxicateddefendant is treated like an accomplice to his own misconduct. Heseems to find fault with other models. But my (ideal) approachadds this. If the perpetrator does not buy into the moral basisfor the law she (or he) has broken, she cannot be regarded ashaving committed a crime. She is a prisoner of war and must beaccorded all the rights and privileges of a captive sovereignhead of state. In particular, if a poor person steals from a richperson or even commits a violent act upon her (or him), it isn'ta crime if the crime followed naturally from the difference inwealth, according to my theory. This is war! Todd Mikuriya discussed the idea of a drugcooperative. I don't think it is tenable and the audience wasn'ttoo receptive either, noting its elitist character. Art Hilgart,though, thinks more like Luff, Johns, and I (do). He discussedanomie, the incompatibility of social norms and the incapacity tomeet them. He advocated a public health policy for certain drugs,but I haven't read his paper. I don't see why we can't makeepidemiological data available to everyone (graphically for thoseincapable of dealing with abstractions) and take care of the sickregardless of how they got sick, given that no one really knows,except in the most trivial cases (you hit a man over the headwith a hammer ). Hilgart dared to bring up the declining power ofthe unions as a possible cause of anomie. Good for him. ClarkHosmer is not a bad man. (You know I'm going to find fault,right?) BUT, he wants us to study physiology and to create morejobs without recognizing what a drag jobs are under thecapitalist system. He makes a nice point, though, aboutbenefit/cost ratio, but it probably won't wash quantitatively.It's nice to see a retired army officer espouse a liberal view.Horst Senger is pushing Say's Law (Say is a competitor of Smith,Keynes, and Marx). He got hooted down somewhat, mainly because hejust wants to stop people from taking drugs. His advice: let thegovernment provide them free. But, which drugs? how much? etc. Toconclude, I don't know if the audience was moving toward (i)let's fix society and (ii) no half-way measures. Maybe. Preventing Drug Abuse with Education This was better than I thought it would be.Sandy Burbank, whom I got to know much better, just wants to tellthe truth and Mary Lynn Mathre just wants to heal the sick, nevermind how they got sick (I think), but I haven't read the paperfor bias and falsehood. Alex Stuart wants to re-instill moralvalues but couldn't name one. He got put down hard by a youngHarvard student. I felt sorry for him, but I didn't show mercyeither. I stepped out to the john and got back in time for thediscussion. Paul Kelly exercised his prerogative as a Black tospeak at length, which he did at every workshop that we bothattended, while I rushed through my three sentences with my heartbeating wildly because I was unable to distinguish my "rightto be heard" or expected to be treated like a madman. TheNarconon guy was there, but I believe he didn't mention the badpart about what they are doing. I don't remember what Robertssaid, if I even heard him. New Issues in Drug Treatment Ray Jeffery was thoroughly rejected as wasPatricia Ritter. Ronald Farrell saved himself by expressingserious doubts about what he is doing, but, if you read hispaper, you hear some ominous terms, cf., conformity, behaviormodification, deviance. After the workshop I commended Jeffereyon the importance of identifying the harm done by heavy metals,but the appropriate course of action is to prevent - not to"tag" the victims. I think, by rejecting all the thingsthat are not permissible, I set up Luff's call for politicalaction, if I am not jumping too far ahead. The Cult of Ibogainewas a little disruptive (this is discussed in my contribution tothe 1991 papers) and a young man named Dana thought that it washypocritical for people who wear suits and ties to try to changesociety when, presumably, only he can change society, but Isensed a move toward rejecting the disease theory and behaviormodification and recognizing that we need political change. Ofcourse, as I said, once we get the quacks off our backs, we willstill have to contend with the clergy. Even if there weresupernatural events involved, which, if you read Chapter 3(available on request) of my book Beyond Competitionism(working title for work in progress), doesn't make much sense (inmy opinion), the mainstream and fundamentalist clergy aren'tgoing to be helpful. So, the "new issues" were either(i) it won't work or shouldn't be done except for ibogaine, IFibogaine works and (ii) we can't ignore the politicalimplications. If Luff's paper, and mine too, are not referencednext year, it will tell us that something is wrong. [My hope foribogaine has cooled considerably since I wrote this.] Addiction: Is It a Disease? As we all know, this session was in troublebefore it started as "addiction" is undefined and wasnever defined, so the use of the word at all begs the question.Poor Henry Blansfield meant well, but, like us poor sexists, herevealed his biases by the inadvertent use of one word ratherthan another or by the use of a give-away term, cf.,"unfortunate people". It reminds me of the Sidney Lumetfilm "The Pawnbroker", wherein the pawnbroker referredto the black derelict as a "poor creature", which,admittedly, is worse. "Don't pity me. Sometimes I wish Iweren't me, but I sure as hell am glad I'm not you." As Ipointed out, even if it were a disease, and it's not at all clearthat it is, the etiology might belong to medicine, but thetreatment not, particularly if there is none, due to theirreversible nature of the damage. On the other hand, if medicinecan supply us with a work-around drug, i.e., a drug that providesa new mechanism for the body to achieve whatever it could notpreviously achieve because of the irreversible damage, we willtake it, but first let's see the drug. Medicine wants hegemonyover the resolution of all conflicts in living because it's agood business. As Shaw said, "Every profession is aconspiracy against the laity." I said that any doctor whoclaimed to be reversing an irreversible condition, i.e., curing"drug addiction" would be a quack and I offered ascorroboration the fact that Houston's Dr. George S. Glassrelegates his "patients" to non-medical personnel. I agree with Jeffrey Schaler. I didn't hear himsay anything that I think is wrong. Jonas sketched a reasonablepicture of the public health model and made me regret my use ofthe term to describe the treatment industry in my paper. As Isaid above, they should patch up any bad effects of drugs and,perhaps, advise when advice is requested without losing sight ofthe fact that there are many things in this life worth a littleharm to the health. Bruce Alexander's discussion was very helpfulto me, but I think, when he says there are three choices, he isleaving out a multitude of other options. But, I would like toquote his statement "There is nothing more practical thanstraight thought." Reworded it could have been the title ofmy paper. These dialectical distinctions are not mere quibbling.We could end up providing an acceptable life for a few thousandmiserable people now and end up with a totalitariantherapeutocracy in a thousand years. I liked Robert Goodman'stalk, but I didn't completely understand his paper. Also, hisexperiment with the purple triangle is silly. Once it beginswhistling "Dixie", it is no longer a triangle, so youcan't imagine it. But, the point is well taken. We can't imaginehunger when we are full. So, that promise to quit tomorrow ismeaningless today. I think we have seen the disease theory prettywell discredited even if there is some physiological changes dueto taking drugs. People are going to have to develop a betterdialectic and, finally, the public health model is acceptable aslong as it doesn't get mixed up with values and decisions. Ithink that was the consensus I saw being formed. Paul Kelly was outrageous and Steve Jonas'saction in assuming that he could be the representative of everyblack person who wasn't there but should have been there equallyoutrageous. Why, then, wasn't I permitted to speak for everyspeed and heroin devotee, as opposed to former devotee, whocouldn't be there? [The initial remarks that were in thisparagraph are confidential, but the concluding remarks concerningthe validity of spiritual intuition may be worth passing on -even out of context.] Chemical and spiritual transformationsoccur and may be dual to one another without invoking thesupernatural. The spirit is part of nature too, is it not? Mymain point, I guess, is that a person's intuitive feelings aboutwhat happened to him or her cannot be introduced into publicpolicy because they are not verifiable. Strangely, we want topick science's pocket for all the little doodads that are in it,but we are unwilling to accept the scientific philosophy inconducting our affairs. That seems a little hypocritical. Racism in the War on Drugs The talks by Siegel, De Vidts, and Aldrich wereinformative. Myers brought the focus over to economics, where Ithink it belongs, and the moderator, Raymond Brown, mentioned"all those shiny towers" (skyscrapers) or somethinglike that. I mentioned to him afterward that, in America, weimagine that we can have a high standard of living withoutproducing anything. We are supposed to have an informationeconomy, which means that we will live by business alone. Take alook at the section on the work ethic in my separation paper,"The Separation of the State from the Christian Church"[1], to see what I think of that. Blacks can produce things thatwe need to live, but they are being excluded from the informationeconomy, because it's based on membership in a club or class ofpeople who have IT. Meanwhile, the residual minimum-wage orless-than-living-wage jobs are growing in number and are open toanyone. I, personally, would not accept a job that required me totake orders from someone I did not recognize as qualified. Thetruth is very nearly this: No one is qualified. As William Morrissaid, "No one is qualified to be someone else's boss."I reject bosses and I certainly don't blame anyone who elects alife of crime in preference to taking orders from an unqualifiedboss - for peanuts. Paul Kelly was there to complain about all theBlacks who are dying and the under-representation of Blacks atthe conference. I have a hard time accepting the idea that thesituation is different for me and for a black user, but, if youforce me to make the distinction, I have to say that this is aconference to legalize drugs for white middle-class users.Perhaps, Blacks should have their own conference, especially ifthey are not for full legalization, i.e., government off ourbacks. They are pissed off that so many black men are in jail,but they don't want to legalize. It's up to the bright blackpeople to show their communities that the laws against drugs area problem for them too and that getting rid of the laws willimprove things - at least in the long run. They had better getthe "reverends" out of their politics too. I think thesmart black people know that they have an economic and politicalproblem and the sooner they realize that a few blackmillionaires, whether they became millionaires from drugtrafficking or the usual capitalist crimes, are not going to helpthem. It won't help to be exploited by a black man. Black bossesand business tycoons may be more cruel than whites, since theyhave less guilt to bear. That's what I think; I don't know whatthe audience thinks. I know we get pretty foggy-brained when itcomes to thinking about Blacks. We imagine that a differentsystem of logic applies. Summary of the Conference Paul Kelly returned my call after theconference and we talked for about a half an hour on his"nickel". I told him all the bad things I said abouthim (above). Despite that, I think we ended up as friends. Ipointed out the inconsistency of resenting the large number ofblack prisoners and still not wanting legalization. He said therewas nothing for them to do even if they weren't in jail. Ipointed out that I had many friends who had done time and it wasvery unpleasant in some ways but not because you couldn't getdrugs. Apparently, one can get used to homosexual activitieseasily too without becoming "abnormal", although Ididn't mention this to Paul as it is not relevant. I attacked thetwelve-step plans and he defended them mainly by reminding methat I didn't know much about them. We agreed that it was wrongto force someone into a plan, but he wasn't so sure that offeringit as an alternative to prison constituted force. It was awell-organized and constructive dialogue in which I was able tointerject a little of my political position and, also, to soundonce again the warning about possible future genocide if it isnot already too late. We ended by agreeing that he would call mewhen he comes to Houston later this year or early next year and Iwould try to audit a twelve-step meeting to get a better idea ofhow they work. I did say I was anti-Christian but not an atheist. So, to summarize, a drug network bulletin isuseful and a drug science abstract and truth squad service wouldbe useful. The marijuana devotees probably have a better chanceto get their drug of choice legalized sooner because they feelbetter about their drug than users of other drugs feel abouttheirs, correctly or incorrectly. We recognize the usualintolerance of behavior that is not congruent with our own. Thepublic health model seems to be replacing the disease model, butmany disease-model therapists and God-squad therapists willcontinue to masquerade as public health defenders. The political,social, and economic causes of people taking more drugs than aregood for them are beginning to be recognized and I think we shallsoon begin questioning the onerousness of most jobs. I saw a news(?) item on TV where an American factory worker was saying thathis biggest problem is boredom on the job. Of course, thepharmacological, toxicological, and other physiological aspectsof drugs should continue to be investigated by people who havenothing to do with the treatment industry. Also, the harmfuleffects of heavy metals and other toxic chemicals should bestudied and steps should be taken to contain them and keep themout of the food chain. Meanwhile, the jurisprudentialdifficulties of dealing with people who break laws after takingalcohol or drugs, or, for that matter, take alcohol or drugs togive themselves the false courage, badly-termed "Dutchcourage" by one contributor (!), to commit crimes (or actsof war against the establishment), will continue to be debatedfor some time without anyone recognizing that the legal systemhas no moral standing as it itself, as a character in a moviesaid, is "out of order". The prevention racket will continue to bepervaded by lies despite Sandy Burbank and MAMA, but aninteresting breakthrough was noted in the news: the Dutch havedecriminalized sex among twelve- to sixteen-year-olds. I daresayyou get the connection. The aforementioned "truthsquad" could make itself felt on the education scene, butI'm not sure how. This is hooked up with the efforts to preventschool prayer and the infiltration of religion into the schoolsin other ways. Also, we would like to identify (most) forms ofpatriotism as irrational quasi-religion. Last night I was askedto call in on an American Atheists (AA) radio program on thelocal Pacifica Radio station here. I'm not sure I said anythinguseful, but AA might be able to mount a small effort to get truthin to ( and falsehood out of) the schools. I think one has to dothis through the courts as there is no public consensus for it. I think most of the participants at theconference are against 1984-style behavior modification and wouldbe willing to try to keep the medical profession in its place. Ido not believe the supernatural may be introduced into publicpolicy, but, clearly, many people still think that somethingsupernatural plays a role in the process of changing one'sbehavior with respect to drugs. I think that, if it does, itshould get re-classified as natural. I mentioned theinconsistency in the viewpoint of most of the black community,but I think that many black intellectuals are ready to reject thestupid dichotomy between Capitalism that is not capitalism andCommunism that is not communism. Hopefully, all Americans will beopen to new ideas soon.

Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | The Drug Legalization Debate CAN THE STATE TEACH THAT DRUGS ARE WRONG ANDHARMFUL? by Thomas L. Wayburn, PhD Chemical engineering consultantand writer Recently Congress enacted a law that requiresevery public school in the nation to teach students that"the use of illicit drugs and the unlawful possession anduse of alcohol is (sic) wrong and harmful". This reminds meof the story, whether true or false, that the Illinois StateLegislature once changed the value of pi, the ratio of thecircumference to the diameter of a circle in the Euclidean plane,to 3.0. The difference this time is that only what may be taughtis mandated rather than what is true. What remains the same, ifwe neglect the question of harmfulness for a moment, is that bothjudgments are transcendental and may not be legislated by man. From a utilitarian viewpoint, "wrong"and "harmful" amount to the same thing, but it is notclear that the viewpoint of this law is entirely utilitarian. Noris it clear whether the law means that drugs are entirelyharmful, in which case no one would use them, or that the harmmerely outweighs the good. The question of harmfulness (unlessmoral harmfulness is meant) presumably belongs to medicine, whichis an inexact science and cannot supply answers to all suchquestions. One school of medical researchers claims to haveevidence that marijuana, for example, is harmful; another schoolrefutes this evidence and presents contrary evidence thatmarijuana is exceptionally safe. When the truth has beendiscovered scientifically, such disputes tend to disappear. It isdifficult to see how government or the schools can supply answersthat science cannot supply. How is this dilemma to be hidden frominquisitive students? Regarding right and wrong, two importantquestions are at stake here and neither of them is trivial: (1)May the state legislate right and wrong in the absence of aconsensus? and (2) May the state legislate what is to be taughtconcerning right and wrong? It is not clear whether the subjectof right and wrong belongs to ethics or to morality, if ethicsand morality are at all different. In my lexicon, ethics pertainspreponderantly to respect for truth and morality pertains tobehavior. Most moral decisions are religious decisions, thereforethe legislation of morality is usually a violation of separationof church and state. Many may object that the state legislates rightand wrong all the time. For example, the state forbids murder.Without getting into all of the philosophical considerations thatobtain in the banning of murder, I may safely say that mostpeople who commit it allow that it is wrong. On the other hand,we have about twenty-five million Americans who use illegal drugsand a sizable percentage of them do not allow that it is wrong.On the contrary, many insist that it is wrong for the state torepress their natural inclinations and, in some cases, what theyclaim are God-given rights and, yes, even duties. Regarding teaching that using drugs is wrongand harmful, one must distinguish between teaching both sides ofan open question, i.e., a question under dispute, and teachingwhich side is correct. When the state legislates which side of anopen question is to be taught, either it is legislating what istrue, which is totalitarian, or it is denying the necessity ofteaching truth, which is unethical. Perhaps ethics may belegislated without violating separation of church and state, butthe state may not legislate bad ethics, i.e., an ethic that doesviolence to truth. If drugs are wrong independently of context,teachers must show why they are wrong or students will askquestions that cannot be answered without gross distortions oftruth. For example, if a brilliant artist used drugs to create amasterpiece, the students must be told that the importance ofcreating a masterpiece is overwhelmed by the importance of thedamage to the artist's health, however slight, and the importanceof the artist breaking a law. This will be especially difficultto do if the artist, who may have been Picasso, lived a long lifeor lived in a country where - or at a time when - the substanceswere legal. If the students are discouraged from askingquestions, the schools will be reinforcing stupidity. If taking marijuana to treat glaucoma is legal,then taking marijuana under other circumstances may be wrong onlybecause it is illegal. Also, the law seems to say that drinkingalcohol (in moderation?) is wrong only when it is unlawful.Paraphrasing Bertrand Russell: To appeal to the law to invalidatean act that otherwise would be good is to impute evil to the law. But, the law has proved to be evil on numerousoccasions. The law once required the return of runaway slaves.Nowadays, the law requires an innocent family to be turned out ofits home if a visitor is found with illegal drugs. Therefore, toask a student to believe that the use of a drug is wrong simplybecause it is illegal is asking too much. Whether one desires a drug-free society or not,one ought to deplore this law and take appropriate action to haveit repealed. It is guaranteed to have no effect on many, tostultify the education of many more, to drive the astute furtherinto rebellion, to provide additional justification for takingdrugs, to discredit further the educational process, and todiminish what little respect the law still enjoys.

Wayburn, PhD Executive Director of theAmerican Policy Institute, Inc. Recently, a number of anti-drug editorials andOp-Ed pieces have appeared in the Houston Post disparaging drugs,drug users, drug merchants, and those who espouse druglegalization; but, today, December 13, 1993, was a record low forsheer volume of misguided opinion, misinformation, and incorrectbad reasoning - mostly as a response to the surgeon general'sinnocent off-hand reply to a questioner. An interview with John Lucas, the coach of theSan Antonio Spurs and a failed drug user, appeared on page one.The headline was: 'There are no benefits at all' to legalizingdrugs in the U.S. Deborah Mathis on the Op-Ed page claims,"Proponents [of legalization], who come from all walks, haveonly one argument: It would reduce the violence tied todrugs." Both of these statements are patently false. Inmy 1989 paper ["No One Has a Right To Impose an ArbitrarySystem of Morals on Others" in Drug Policy 1889-1990, AReformer's Catalogue, Arnold S. Trebach and Kevin B. Zeese,Eds., The Drug Policy Foundation, Washington, D.C. (1989)], Ilisted twelve practical benefits of legalization. Mathis, atleast, should be acquainted with my paper, which appeared in themainstream of anti-prohibition literature. The twelve practical benefits may be enumeratedbriefly (and incompletely) as follows: (1) remove the economicincentive, (2) eliminate the need to steal, (3) eliminate theviolence, (4) take profits from criminals, (5) remove the thrill,(6) end the suffering and death caused by unmetered doses,impurities, dirty paraphernalia, cf. AIDS, substitutes, andsubstances that have only a short history of use, e.g., designerdrugs, (7) provide more alternatives for users to select best orleast harmful drug, (8) eliminate the "drug life", (9)restore many to useful endeavor, (10) permit people to treatsimple ailments thus reducing health-care costs, (11) eliminateinvasion of privacy, (12) eliminate pharmaceutical McCarthyism. But, much more important is the one compellingethical reason for legalizing drugs, namely, that any rational, non-politicizedSupreme Court would find the laws against drugs unconstitutionalbecause they violate the rights to liberty and the pursuit ofhappiness as retained by the people in accordance with the NinthAmendment and they violate the freedom of religion clausein the First Amendment because: (i) taking or not taking drugs isa moral choice and moral choices are religious choices and (ii)taking drugs can be construed to be a religious ritual. It isinconceivable that the framers of the Constitution (1789) couldhave forgotten the Declaration of Independence. Any argumentbased on the "compelling interests of the State" wouldfail because the compelling interests of the State would be tolegalize drugs to achieve the benefits enumerated above exceptinsofar as the State should be interested to support theprevailing religious superstitions of the masses, which would bea violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. In the paper, I present many other argumentsand answer all the objections of Mathis, Charles Rangel, andothers. In fact, I make a complete case. Today's Post reminded me that David Robinson,one of John Lucas' players, libeled all drug users as a classin a paid endorsement. Also, in an editorial about River Phoenix(11-18-93), The Houston Post wrote, "Every person who abusesdrugs ... is directly responsible for the death anddestruction caused by those drugs. It matters little whether hisis a casual or serious use". [Italics mine] To qualify as libel, a statement must be (i)untrue, (ii) malicious, and (iii) harmful. In the case of DavidRobinson, we all know what "scum" is. The greatphysicist William Rowan Hamilton was not scum, Charlie Parker wasnot scum, Lawrence Taylor is not scum. No human being can betruthfully said to be scum. In the case of the Houston Post, thestatement is completely wrong, but the use of the word directlyis easiest to refute. Obviously, the direct cause was the bullet,the impurities in the drug, or the excessive size of the dose,which was not standardized. As I showed in my 1989 paper, onemight more properly blame the laws against drugs. While the tone of Robinson's voice convicts himof malice, in the case of the Houston Post, the argument is moresubtle - but more informative: It is difficult to reconcilelogically the inclusion of "casual" use under"abuse", moreover abuse is not defined. Under"serious" use the author of the editorial has rashlyfailed to consider religious uses and artistic uses, which areclearly serious. The illogic of his verbiage indicates anemotionally charged state. Further consideration suggests thatthe operative emotion must have been malice. It is obvious thatdrug users suffer from this invective. If it does not lower theirown self-esteem, it surely reduces their esteem in the eyes of atleast some bigots. Thus, all the requirements of a class-actionlibel suit against David Robinson and the Houston Post have beenmet. Juan Palomo's column of December 13 urgesrespect for Joycelyn Elder's suggestion. Paradoxically, he doesnot escape my criticism. He says we need "effectivetreatment programs". In my 1990 paper ["Fallacies andUnstated Assumptions in Prevention and Treatment" in TheGreat Issues of Drug Policy, Arnold S. Trebach and Kevin B.Zeese, Eds., The Drug Policy Foundation, Washington, D.C.(1990)], I denounced drug treatment. One may call the Drug PolicyFoundation at (202) 537-5005 to obtain copies of thesepublications. In some cases I will supply copies of my papersupon request. In present day America, however, I would notexpect many people to be swayed by my reasoning. Three hundredyears ago, in his famous Essay Concerning Human Understanding [Oxford:Clarendon Press, New York (1979)], John Locke wrote "[H]owcan we imagine that [anyone] should renounce those tenets whichtime and custom have so settled in his mind that he thinks themself-evident, and of unquestionable certainty; or which he takesto be impressions he has received from God himself, or from mensent by Him? How can we expect, I say, that opinions thus settledshould be given up to the arguments ... of a stranger oradversary?" Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky discuss howthe modern totalitarian state works in their book ManufacturingConsent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media[Pantheon Books, New York (1988)]. In America, the multi-nationalcorporations and their servants - the State and the Church -impress the weak-minded. Strangely, the talking heads on TV areperceived as men sent by God himself - even though many peopleclaim to hate them. John Lucas got at least one thing right."The war on drugs has not been a failure." The war ondrugs has managed to create an irrational bias against drugs inmany people who are capable of fairly reasonable decisions whenit comes to taking care of their automobiles - for example. Thewar on drugs has been successful in promoting falsehood andtyranny.

Neither more nor less. Andit's like a human creetur so far, that you always hear what canbe said against it, but seldom what can be said in its praise.' -Charles Dickens, The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Introduction I claim that, if one does NOT insist that (i)drugs are essentially neutral - having good or bad effectsdepending upon circumstances only - and that (ii) one has a moraland legal right to take the drugs of his (or her) choice withoutgovernment regulation, control, or interference, that: (1) theDrug Enforcement Agency (DEA) position can be defendedeffectively by a non-governmental person (unconstrained byseparation of Church and State) and (2) the pro-legalizationposition can be defeated in debate as Charles Rangel defeatedWilliam Buckley in the "Firing Line" debate on thePublic Broadcasting System. (The letter I sent Buckley subsequentto that debate is in Appendix A.) The argument recommended byCliff Schaffer in his paper, "Persuasive Strategies"and Schaffer's point-by point rebuttal to the DEA position isconvenient to employ as the (imaginary) argument to be defeatedby the (imaginary) civilian apologist for the War on Drugs. By"civilian", I mean someone unconstrained by separationof Church and State and for whom a prohibitionist position doesnot represent a conflict of interest, e.g., someone who is notemployed by the DEA. On the other hand, if one insists upon theaforementioned (provable) conditions, the DEA can be defeated, aswill be shown in the second part of this paper. Armed with the philosophically andpharmacologically correct positions on the two crucial issues, Ican defeat an imaginary "civilian" apologist for theDEA, i.e., a supporter of the War of Drugs. First (1), I show whythe laws against drugs are immoral and illegal(unconstitutional). Next (2), I attack the morals, motives, andmethods of the drug warriors, thus my argumentation must besqueaky clean even if I have to admit weak links in my chain ofreasoning (I am generous and give my opponent all the ammunitionhe is ever likely to find to use against me; of course, my armorplating has been designed to withstand this very ammunition).Then (3), I give arguments for legalization avoiding nearly allof the arguments discussed in the unnumbered book DrugLegalization: Myths and Misconceptions; these are thearguments for which my opponent is not likely to be prepared. Ifhe can't prepare an argument on the spot, he will be in seriousintellectual trouble. (Cliff Schaffer points out that the reasonthis book has no document number or control number or anyreference number whatsoever is that the government didn't want topublish or admit to publishing this book. I believe he is right.)Finally (4), I demolish most of the arguments the DEA gives inthe book avoiding the two or three points that I am willing toconcede as I don't believe any of us knows very much about them,viz., alcohol prohibition in the U.S., the experiences of foreigngovernments, and environmental uses. However, I do point out theunfair tactics used by the DEA. The DEA employs fallacies even inthe very few cases where an honest argument would have sufficed.I shall omit Step 3 in this presentation as it is coveredadequately in my earlier essays, which shall be made available tointerested parties (Actually, this, my latest essay on drugpolicy, may be part of a complete collection if it can bearranged.) Partial Rebuttal of Cliff Schaffer's Argumentby an Imaginary "Civilian" Apologist for the DrugEnforcement Agency (DEA) Assume that drugs are unmitigated evil and thatno one has a moral or legal right to use them. As an example of adefense of the DEA position let us attempt to rebut CliffSchaffer's argument - not line by line at this time, although Ihave annotated his argument against the DEA essentially line byline, but this results in too much repetition. Rather, I willgive a few samples of rebuttals that will suffice for one or moreof his arguments. This half of my thesis is less important andwill receive considerably less space, since, like Cliff, I aminterested to defeat the DEA. We differ only in which approach tothe common goal we prefer. 1) A DEA apologist might say, "Youmisunderstand the aims of our strategy, which have been fulfilledto a remarkable degree for the present generation. We must pushforward to benefit future generations similarly. To ask for adrug-free America is asking too much. However, we have made itmuch harder for the productive members of society to get drugsand, in contrast with the sixties and early seventies, almost noone approves of drugs. Even artists no longer use drugs to anygreat extent, which you can tell by the lack of deep feeling intheir work. In the inner city, the drugs are so weak that it isdifficult for people to become addicted - even to heroin.Conceivably, most heroin habits are largely imaginary. Jail is anessential part of our strategy. "Mr. Schaffer is either being dishonest orfacetious when he asks us if jail makes people more productive.We never said (and Mr. Schaffer knows that we don't mean toimply) that people who go to jail are more productive than theywould be otherwise (they probably were not very productive tobegin with), however many people abstain from drugs ordrastically curtail their drug use to avoid or reduce the risk ofjail and they are the ones we expect to be more productive.Certainly, Mr. Schaffer knows this. The deterrent effect of jailis greater in the white population because whites do less well injail and jail is more of a disgrace for them, whereas many blackmen take jail in stride. Some even feel more at home in jail thaton the street. It's good that they are in jail as they areprovided for and they do not set a bad example in the populationat large." (From now on I drop the quotes. Also, I shallabandon the effort of the speaker to emphasize that he is notpart of the DEA, but the reader is to understand he is notanyway. Therefore, his community standards argument can be ratherreligious in nature, which will be harmful to Mr. Schaffer'slikeability - as he, Mr. Schaffer, appears to be going againstGod! It is doubtful that Mr. Schaffer holds a degree as high asthe PhD as he puts his SAT scores in English up as evidence ofhis entitlement to criticize his interlocutor for using"big" words. Twice he refers to big words assequipedalianistic, which, of course, is an old joke, apparentlynot understood by Mr. Schaffer as jokes are not usually toldtwice. This is ad hominem and not part of the argument.) 2) Mr. Schaffer continues to preface hisremarks with "Every major study shows ..." How did hebecome qualified to determine which are major studies and whichare not? How does he know that he is familiar with every study?This is indeed remarkable. I have here the tables of contents ofthe latest issues of the five leading refereed journals dealingwith this subject. Would he be willing to state the results ofeach study as I state the journal and authors' names? Thethrowing around of names of authoritative studies is an exampleof what Jeremy Bentham calls the ad verecundiam fallacy,i.e., an appeal to the natural modesty of the interlocutor. Thisis a form of sophistry designed to make us seem inferior whenthere is no good reason why we should. Undoubtedly, Mr. Schafferis not familiar with the results of most of the best science donein this area although he would like us to imagine that he is.Also, Mr. Schaffer is cavalier with expressions such as "Noone believes ....", "Everyone knows ... ". Theseare sweeping statements and rather dubious to say the least.Could it be that Mr. Schaffer plays fast and loose with thefacts? Since his remarks obviously are memorized, conceivably hehas read none of the studies, and receives his informationsecond-hand. A few simple test questions should determine if thisis the case. I have in this box photocopies of hundreds ofreviewed articles supporting our claims. Shall we see howfamiliar Mr. Schaffer is with these studies and which heconsiders major? Shall we plumb the depth of his knowledge of thestudy he last mentioned? 3) Mr. Schaffer refers frequently to historicalfacts that tend to support his thesis that drug laws were passedfor all the wrong reasons. Besides being irrelevant to thequestion of whether or not they are good laws, what gets writtenin history books tends to depend upon the biases of thehistorian. Much of this history was written during the longperiod, which has not yet ended, in which history departments atmost universities have been dominated by left-wing liberals whotend to denigrate the white male patriarchy regardless of whatactually occurred. This is part of being "politicallycorrect" and is only just now being recognized as just asunfair and biased as history in praise of chattel slavery. Thewhite male is inevitably cast in the role of demon and theminority or economically disadvantaged groups are portrayedalways as victims regardless of how many white males theyscalped. 4) Mr. Schaffer claims he wants sensible druglaws, but he doesn't say what is sensible nor does he give anexample of a sensible drug law. 5) On the contrary, if drug use is immoral itis certainly not sensible to tolerate it under the law. If wedid, the law would be incomplete and therefore flawed (containingsomething immoral but not illegal). (This is as bad as somethingmoral but illegal and imputes evil unto the law - if I mayparaphrase Bertrand Russell.) To be fair we should say "moreflawed than it already is". We are trying to reach an idealset of laws, which can be done only after an infinite period ofstruggle. We must never bring discredit to the law knowingly,though. The law does not enjoy much respect - even in themiddle-class. This does not promote the welfare of the State. 6) Arguments about the success or failure ofdrug legalization or prohibition in foreign countries can beskewed because drugs may not be despised as much abroad as here.We have done a better job of drug education, presumably. I don'tthink we should have too much confidence in anyone's ability toevaluate the success or failure of drug policies abroad,therefore I wouldn't make too much of Mr. Schaffer's defense ofso-called legalization programs abroad. Clearly, though,variations in punishment of drug use from place to place be itcontinent to continent or county to county are bound to engendersome migrancy. As we do not approve of unnecessary and wastefulmigrancy because of its environmental and social effects, weshould continue to insist upon a universal international attackon drugs all over the world to avoid providing safe havens formoral degenerates. 7) If adults can get drugs more easily,children will be able to get drugs more easily. Many adults arewilling to provide drugs for kids as they provided alcohol for mewhen I was a kid - either for monetary compensation or for otherreasons of their own (perhaps misguided goodness of heart). Inearly died driving a car after adults gave me so much liquorthat I had to be carried to my car and placed behind the wheelwhere my automatic pilot took over until I plowed into threeparked cars totaling all three and the brand new car I wasdriving and putting myself in the hospital. Some goodness ofheart. This could occur if drugs were legal and supplantedalcohol as the party enhancer of choice. 8) If multi-national corporations were free tomarket drugs, they could employ the media blitzes that have madeAdvil a household word in a very short time. If they were no morescrupulous in the sale of heroin or cocaine than they have beenwith Tylenol or Micatin - making extravagant and patently falseand/or deceptive claims, society might be even more threatenedthan it is now with dangerous patent medicines. A Tylenol OD isnot a pretty picture. Virtually every vital organ shuts down.These companies have no morals. It is not their business to havemorals. Profits feed the bulldog and we all know it. "A manwith a wife and children to support will do anything formoney." His justification is represented by the charmingfamily portrait on his desk next to his calendar. 9) If heroin were legal, it stands to reasonthat it would be more popular than alcohol. It's a much betterdrug and gives more pleasure to the user. Many people do notrealize they are hooked until they try to stop. They don't wantto stop because it's so enjoyable and, for awhile, they may beable to carry on their lives more effectively than they couldwithout it. Thus, they have a large window of opportunity tobecome addicted. Young people think they are invulnerable."Other people might get hooked but not me." The upshotis that, with such a seemingly superior product and a long periodof time before its drawbacks are perceived, we have circumstancesguaranteed to result in many more users than currently and quiteplausibly more users than alcohol has ever been able to attract. 10) The following is a very important point andthe simulator would like the reader to imagine that this speechis to be delivered with many embellishments and passionatereligious fervor. We cannot have laws in conflict with ourcommunity moral standards and our family values. We cannot allowthese degenerates and perverts to walk freely among us - possiblyinfecting our children with their vile condition. This is aGod-fearing Christian country and we will not let the devil haveour children. Blah, blah, blah. 11) Jail is more effective than treatment.People must be held accountable for the laws they break.Prevention works especially when backed up by the deterrent ofjail - both the physical inconvenience of jail especially towhites and the shame of going to jail particularly for whites.The black religious leaders must make blacks more ashamed of jailthan they are currently. They may employ the argument that theirown shame is shared by all blacks and that they have let downtheir brothers and sisters if they go to jail. One Black in jailis a disgrace to all Blacks. Consider the argument used byDickens with respect to the Jew in Our Mutual Friend. Heis a good man, so he leaves the money lending business, which hewas fronting for a gentile anyway, so as not to disgrace allJews. "When a Greek goes bad, they say, 'Well, there's somebad apples in every race', but when a Jew does something of whichsociety does not approve, they say, 'All Jews are bad.' "So, Riah leaves the money-lending business and goes to work in afactory operated by Jews that is a model enterprise for its daywith the best treatment of employees imaginable. This ends Part I, wherein I have played theDevil's advocate against an opponent not armed with moral outrageand faith in all the good uses of drugs. Rebuttal to the Arguments in the Book: DrugLegalization: Myths and Misconceptions, by Raymond J.McKinnon, Published by the Drug Enforcement Agency to TeachProhibitionists How to Argue with Pro-Legalization Advocates INTRODUCTION I now wish to refute the arguments of the DEAarmed with moral outrage and faith in all the good uses of drugs,which, according to the beliefs of this author, a benevolent andfar-seeing God included in His design of Nature so that men mightbe spiritually inspired by song, story, verse, and imagery todraw closer to Him. (The author's religious viewpoint towarddrugs explains, metaphorically, why he claims that virtually ALLgreat artists used and use drugs as do the greatest scientistswho share the worship of the infinite with artists as discussedby Whitehead, which makes them the only true scientists, theothers being more or less technicians, though not to be entirelydisparaged if that is all they are capable of. If they took drugsthey might be capable of much more; but, in many cases, theirlove of this earthly life, however fleeting and petty, farexceeds their love of the infinite in the sense of Whitehead -and Russell, too (writing independently). Therefore, they avoiddrugs because they believe, perhaps correctly, that drugs mightshorten their lives. The author has no intention to prove hisbelief, which is, after all, a religious belief. He asks merelyfor the same respect that other religious people ask for theirviews. Obviously, this view is protected by the Free Exerciseclause of the First Amendment, regardless of what anyone else,e.g., a Supreme Court justice, thinks. Thus, I have not proved this close connectionbetween art and science and drugs. Nevertheless, I am permittedto assume that such a connection exists in this exposition as anexample of a good use of drugs, which is assumed to exist; andthis positive use is as good as any and reasonably easy tobelieve. I do not believe it is fair to "out" livingartists and scientists, but many artists and scientists who aredeceased and have left adequate documentation of their drug useshould convince a fair-minded person that this connection exists.SeeAppendix B. The Declaration of Independence written ca.1776 gives man the unalienable rights of life liberty and thepursuit of happiness. Surely by 1789 the Founding Fathers had notforgotten this when they wrote the Ninth Amendment: "Theenumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not beconstrued to deny or disparage others retained by thepeople". [quoted loosely from memory] Among those otherrights must be liberty and the pursuit of happiness. They did notguarantee happiness - only its pursuit. Certainly, many menpursue happiness in no other way than by taking drugs. Youropinion of whether they are likely to find happiness in this waydoes not abrogate their right to pursue happiness in this way.Needless to say, a man is not free, i.e., possesses not liberty,unless he can take whatever drugs he wishes. Amazingly, the argument that drugs actuallyenslave the user has been advanced lately; so, apparently, it isnot "needless to say". This is very easily refuted. Apassage borrowed from another essay should suffice: [R. Emmitt] Tyrrell employs the term"enthralls" with two distinct meanings. This isequivocation, which is unfair in debate. Since we are enthralledby drugs as we would be by a great love, it is easy to agree thatthese wonderful, miraculous, divine drugs of antiquity have lostnone of their charm with age. It is as though our beloved weresnatched from our arms when the word is suddenly used to connoteslavery, which we detest. We are no more enslaved by our favoritedrugs than we are by our favorite foods - or, to bring home thesharp sword of truth, far less than the average employed Americanis enslaved by his job. The average drug user is free compared tothe average corporate employee. This is the beauty of JackNicholson's speech in the pot smoking scene in the film EasyRider when he tells the bikers that the townspeople fear thembecause they represent freedom. The druggies of the BeatGeneration and subsequently have been symbolic of man's quest forfreedom. From among us come the free spirits of the land. Onlythe oppressor's iron yoke can bow the heads of those who dare totread the paths of the liberated criminal saints of thefree-wheeling drug culture. The whole world knows this is true. This enslavement argument is extraordinarilyperverse as the whole point of the War of Drugs is to enslave theworld in the interests of the multi-national corporations, i.e.,the rulers of the world, and those who serve them. Drug users arenot good candidates for wage slaves and they are most likely tobreak the mental shackles forged by the massive indoctrination towhich ordinary people are subjected beginning even beforepre-school as their parents are very likely mental zombies andwhich continues throughout school and on the nightly news and inevery statement made by the government or big-business throughits massive advertising campaigns, which, lately, have taken todisseminating such philosophical gems as "Life is a sport;drink it up." Drugs serve as a conscious shock, in the senseof Uspenskii [1], which reorders rigid mental patterns by whichthe received wisdom of the church, the workplace, and the Statekeep us in line - docile servants of the agendas of the richwhose "vile maxim" is "everything for us andnothing for anyone else". Business (capitalism) requireslarge supplies of readily available, unthinking, docile workers,who may be employed when needed and laid off when not. They referto these unfortunate human beings as human resources, which issupposed to be a more advanced term than employee butwhich tends to corroborate our claim that business thinks ofpeople as so many tons of coal just like any other businessresource. Allow me to reprint my earlier remarks [2] onthis subject: Users of drugs are referred to as"slaves" even though they act more independently thanthe average employee of the average American corporation.Actually, the average religionist, who accepts religious dogmawithout reservation is more of a slave than is the most hookedaddict; i.e., the religionist's soul is entirely subjugatedwhereas the body only of the addict is under the control of theaddicting drug, as evidenced by the fact that his will remainsfree to wish to be free of the addiction. Even this analysis isgranting too much to the use of the word slave. How can onebecome the slave of an inanimate substance, which has no will! After we have cleared away the garbage-speakand the double-speak, we see that freedom to take drugs is amajor point. Many people rate taking drugs higher than sex. Wouldyou like to prohibit sex? Just try it. To many people, (taking)drugs is not just the best thing - it's the only thing. Drugtyranny is total tyranny. Then there is art, which, withoutdrugs, is gone. Naturally, the establishment wants to keep usfrom taking drugs. Taking one tip from Uspenskii, another cluefrom Aldous Huxley, and from personal observation, I havedetermined that drugs is the fastest route to political. social,and economic enlightenment - perhaps the only route. (A friend ofmine confessed that he had been a hidebound, right-wing Christianreactionary until he smoked one joint. The scales fell from hiseyes - instantly.) Cast off the shackles of your mind. "Turnon; tune in; and drop out." As Jack Nicholson's character,George, an open-minded lawyer and an alcoholic, in Easy Ridersays, "They're afraid of you because you represent freedomand freedom terrifies them." [quoted loosely] The Tenth Amendment may be violated as well,since, as we have shown, such laws may not be enacted by thefederal government. The only question is whether the Constitutionprohibits the States from enacting such laws. In any case, theTexas Constitution, for example, prohibits the passage of suchlaws because of their religious nature. (The Texas Constitutionseparates Church and State more definitely than does the U.S.Constitution.) I have alluded to the religious aspect of drugsabove. Drugs also entail normally a great deal of group ritualthat has every feature of a formal religious observation or rite,thus the Free-Exercise Clause of the First Amendment is violatedby any law that prohibits these rituals. Actually, the decisionto take drugs or not is a moral decision; moral decisions arereligious decisions; thus "Congress shall make no lawrespecting" [with respect to] them, which is theEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment. Moreover, thecontrolled substances act has no proper definition of"substance", which, according to Bertrand Russell [3],is a nonsense term, nor is the odd term "drug abuse"defined. (Does it mean that the user is harming the drug as inchild abuse or does it mean the drug is abusing the user? Tosatisfy the due-process clause of the Fifth Amendment, laws haveto make sense. The controlled substance law, employing undefinedterms, does not make sense, thus the drug laws violate dueprocess as well. Throw in a little illegal search and seizure andviolation of privacy (Fourth Amendment) and you have a nice messof constitution bashing all in the name of protecting us fromourselves. Not a pretty picture. What do you do when you live ina tyranny with unfair, illegal, and plain wicked laws? You breakthem and with a vengeance. If hard drug users would act up likeAct Up, the government would be reeling. I wish drug users wouldact up a little more. I believe some "dirty tricks" ala Abbie Hoffman are in order. A little polite ass kickingmight get some people's attention as well. You know, the place toget their attention is where they live. (I prefer massivegraffiti attacks, e.g., spray painting "liars","thieves" in huge black letters across the front of theDEA building in Washington or on the homes of prominent drugwarriors.) I have written voluminously on the positiveuses of drugs and the rights of drug users. This is as much as Ineed to repeat here, because I am going to assume the twocondition in my argument anyway. They don't have to be true forthis argument to be true. I wish only to illustrate the utilityof proving that they are true. I wish to show how much you canprove once you have these two simple principles at your disposal;namely, (i) the laws against drugs are illegal and immoral and(ii) drugs are inherently neutral such that the desirability ofdrug use depends upon circumstances. After I attack their arguments, I plan tointroduce arguments from my earlier papers that they areundoubtedly not prepared to rebut. If I am to go first, I wouldstudiously avoid every argument in their book! This should creategeneral confusion among poor debaters who cannot think forthemselves on their feet. I intend to approach their arguments intwo ways: (i) logically, i.e., without an appeal to questionabledata, and (ii) empirically, concentrating mainly on theirmisstatements. Finally and most importantly, one can statewith confidence that no valid scientific evidence exists toindicate that the use of drugs is more harmful than it isbeneficial or that it causes any type of impairment rather thanenhanced abilities as we claim. Actually, no satisfactoryexperiment can be performed to test the effects of drugs onhumans so long as we are living in a state of mass hysteria thatis guaranteed to skew the results. Nor will any such experimentbe performed before drugs are legal and drug use is normalized tothe point where a drug user is considered no more abnormal than areader of poetry, say. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES Fletcher's Doctrine: This comes fromlegal philosophy. It proposes that the drunken man is notresponsible for what he does when he is drunk, but the sober manhe was when he decided to become drunk and, then, performed theacts required to become drunk is responsible for what the drunkenman has done. This is fair because the person enabling thedrunkard presumably had good knowledge from personal experienceof how the drunken man might behave. No one gets away withanything. Dram shop laws: The Fletcher Doctrine,which is valid, is in sharp contrast with the dram shop laws,which punish individuals who may have no knowledge of theindividual whom they enable to become intoxicated, who are in thebusiness legally of so enabling him, and who have every right toassume his behavior will be rational and normal. Dram shop lawsare unfair and violate due process, probably, as they areunreasonable. Definition (Imaginary offense). Animaginary offense is an act that appears to violate the rights ofanother individual only because of how that individual conceivesof that act. But, with a different viewpoint on the part of theperson putatively offended would not violate any rightswhatsoever, in contradistinction with acts that violate therights of individuals regardless of what they think. An exampleis a mother who imagines that her son's homosexuality is ruiningher life, but would not be offended or inconvenienced if herattitude toward homosexuality were different. Many family membersof drug users imagine that they are disgraced by the behavior oftheir close relative who uses drugs, but this is because theyhave a bigoted and intolerant attitude toward drug use, in manycases inculcated by anti-drug propaganda and mass hysteria. Theproof of this is that in some families no one thinks anything ofit. If the rights of one family are not violated by the drug useof one of its members, then no family's rights are violatedbecause the verdict depends upon how the non-users think and iscompletely independent of the behavior of the drug user. If, onthe other hand, the drug user beats his wife when he is on drugs,the Fletcher Doctrine kicks in. Wayburn's Doctrine (unless a priorenunciator of the doctrine can be identified): One cannot beconvicted of a crime in the average. Crimes do not apply tostatistical averages, but to individuals only. A statisticalaverage cannot commit a crime. If an activity is harmless in somecases then it cannot be considered a crime. One must discoverwhat aspect of that activity is always harmful to identify thecrime. Thus, since using drugs is normally (or even sometimes)harmless, in which case it interferes with no one's rights andthe State has no compelling reason to prevent it, it cannot beconsidered a crime even if it is harmful in some particular caseinvolving some particular individual or individuals. One mustbase criminal law upon the combination of the activity and theharmfulness. If, due to societal conditions, harm is doneindependent of the user of the drugs and because of circumstancesthat are not of his making, the harm should be blamed on thesocial conditions operative and, since all of society is toblame, no criminal law can be construed. This is very muchrelated to the commonly known principle that a person may not bepunished for a crime until he commits it - certainly not becausepeople who share some characteristic with him have committed thecrime in the past. SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE DEA ARGUMENT Dyslogistic and Eulogistic Fallacies(Respectively) These consist in using terms that have negativeor positive (respectively) connotations in situations that callfor neutral expressions, generally because they belong tostatements about which nothing has been proven, often statementsthat would be the conclusions of their logical developments, ifthey had resulted from logical developments rather than a jumpdirectly to the conclusion without evidence or logicaldevelopment of any type, usually appealing to nothing better thanpopular opinion or the "conventional wisdom", which insome cases has been "manufactured" by their ownpropaganda. A good example is the use of the conclusory terms"myths" and "misconceptions" in the title oftheir book, which, by the way, is in violation of their mandateand represents a clear-cut conflict of interest. Passing off unscientific work as scientific The literature cited by the DEA refers, in somecases, to "scientific" studies funded by organizationswith a vested interest in the outcome. Impartiality is anabsolute requirement for science. That work is disqualified. Inother cases, unrefereed journals such as the New York Timesare cited. This, too, cuts no ice. Only very few studies haveeven a chance of having been performed by scientists who aredisinterested in the outcome. Even university professors knowwhat side they are on before the study commences. Shifting the Purpose of the Drug War toAccommodate the Argument The DEA is not very specific as to the purposeof the War on Drugs. Obviously, the intent is to prevent peoplefrom taking drugs. But, why? Actually, a host of social ills areascribed to the manufacture, sale, and consumption of drugs.However, over the course of their (imaginary) rebuttal to theaffirmative of the question: Should Drugs Be Legalized? one illor the other is mentioned depending on the argument they pretendto be refuting. Occasionally, the great "evils" thatare supposed to arise due to legalization are inherently neutraland may actually be beneficial under important circumstances. Forexample, addiction is beneficial if it is in the best interestsof the "victim" of "addiction" not to forgetto take the drug in question regularly. If blood pressure pillswere addictive, we wouldn't forget to take them, would we! Sometimes the "bad effect" to beavoided actually favors one or more of the other goals of theWar. For example, early death by overdose of heroin certainlyreduces the share of the national health-care budget consumed bythe victim. Also, if the user can write his own prescriptions -for athlete's foot medication, as well as for sleepingmedication, if indicated - the doctor's time is saved and thehealth-care budget is reduced. Physicians, in particular, do notwant the health-care budget to be reduced. They wish to gathermore and more conflicts in living under their already sweepingpurview. For example, physicians want to take charge of thegang-warfare problem! The DEA is careful not to mention mitigatingcircumstances that do not favor their argument. Clearly, they areinterested in winning this debate by whatever means necessaryrather than arriving at a valid policy, which, unfortunately,would cost them their jobs. They have a definite bias, but so doI. I want a longer drug menu. Moreover, I wish to avoid going tojail. Actually, jail for me, even for five minutes, is absolutelyout of the question! It makes sense to look at the DEA rebuttal fromthe point of view of its goals, real or pretended, to determineif a goal is worth achieving or if a circumstance that interfereswith one goal achieves another. I shall employ an outline form inwhich the Roman numerals correspond roughly to chapter numbers.This section may serve as a brief summary of the remarks thatwill follow, although I will have much to say that will not berepeated. I. ADDICTION A. Biological The only difficulty with addiction occurs if it becomesnecessary to stop the addictive behavior. But, why would anyonewant to stop taking drugs unless an external influence wereoperative. (Occasionally, though, people just stop for noapparent reason, in which case the addiction has disappeared and,therefore, was not a serious problem - at least not the problemit was cracked up to be.) Normally, the external influence arisesbecause of the laws against drugs and the propaganda necessary to"sell" an inhuman and unnatural point of view tootherwise rational persons. Taking drugs is a natural trait of anatural person and has been since drugs were discovered inpre-history. No one has any evidence to the contrary, thus theposition need not be defended. If one disagrees, one merely holdsa different view and nothing more. This is insufficient reason toexercise tyranny. B. Psychological The psychological aspect of "addiction" is, in theview of Dr. Robert Goodman [4], a manifestation of the simplefact that we like to repeat pleasant experiences. It is simplyabsurd to try to turn that into a pathology. In Iran, whenopiates were legal, a large proportion of the population consumedthem. Is it reasonable to suppose that a large proportion of thepopulation of Iran was mentally ill! II. CRIME As will be shown, it is futile to claim that crime will be aserious consequence of drug legalization. Crime is caused by ourinsistence upon allowing human activity to center aroundcompetition for wealth and power - our refusal, in the face ofincontrovertible evidence, to abandon competition for wealth,power, and fame utterly! [5] III. PLACES WHERE LEGALIZATION FAILED A. Addiction increased. For every bad case of addiction they can find, I can find agood case. Addiction like drugs themselves, is neutral, i.e.,depending upon circumstances as to its desirability. One may notdemonize addiction any more than one may demonize drugs. Thedemons are imaginary. This view is just as good as any and mustbe respected until a valid scientific experiment provesotherwise. No such experiment has been made. Always drugs areplaced in a singularly disadvantageous position, thus ensuringthe results desired by the biased pseudo-scientists. (A truescientist must be absolutely fair if not completelydisinterested. It is practically impossible to find adisinterested scientist and, if he could be found, who would fundhis research?) B. Death rate of users increased. The true spiritual man is undaunted by this kind of talk. Itmeans nothing to him. But, his death, in any case, if, indeed,there is any rational reason to fear death from drugs in anormalized society where drugs are legal and drug users aretreated like everyone else or like an avid reader of goodliterature, for example, i.e., merely an anomaly, I say, hisdeath will normally be quick and inexpensive so that people whothink along such lines (sorry specimens of humanity in my view)needn't worry about having to support health care for someonethey don't like or have no interest in. (In Appendix C, I showthat the laws against drugs cause many more deaths than arecaused by drugs themselves. This provides a compelling reason forlegalization.) C. Crime increased. The evidence presented by the DEA seems to indicate that theonly crime that increased, at least in Great Britain, was theState-manufactured crime of taking drugs itself. D. Cost of law enforcement increased. If any crime other than the artificial crime of taking drugsitself increased it was caused by competition for wealth, powerincluding negotiable influence, i.e., influence that can beconverted to wealth or power, and negotiable fame. Drugs havenothing to do with our need for law enforcement. Perhaps, ifeverybody "turned on and tuned in", we wouldn't needlaw enforcement or, for that matter, armed forces. This view isas good (and better if one reads my book [5]) as any other viewuntil proven otherwise. I remain confident that no such proof isforthcoming as I have proved (in my book) the view supported bymyself as well as social theorems are ever proved (without theabsolute necessity to employ drugs to achieve the spiritualrevolution of which I have spoken). E. Addicts will burden welfare and the health-care sector. If, as we demand, drug users are given the same opportunitiesas everyone else, they will out-perform everybody. No experimentto disprove that has ever been attempted even though it is easyto design one. (Remember, the drug users must be free of anynegative expectations or social stigma or fear of socialretaliation or demonization or scapegoating during the trials oftheir effectiveness at tasks of their own choosing.) So much forwelfare. The health-care issue is settled. Prohibitionists can't haveit both ways. Either drugs will shorten lives or they won't. Ifthey don't, drug users are as likely or more likely to contributeto health care (by virtue of their genius) and less likely toburden the system as many will choose to doctor themselves. IV. CRACK BABIES Let's wait six months to a year. I can virtually guaranteethat, by then, so-called crack babies will prove to be yetanother myth surrounding drugs - in a category similar to"reefer madness". See below. V. MONEY As will be shown, the money is in prohibition. What will allthe quacks, charlatans, and parasites do when peace breaks out?The ineptness of drug users that is supposed to cause workplaceaccidents has no scientific basis as in the previous cases. VI. MORALS The American government and the Christian right are notqualified to comment upon morals. The moral position is held by usas will be made abundantly clear as the argument unfolds. VII. MEDICAL USES OF SO-CALLED ILLEGAL DRUGS The DEA opposes the medical use of certain drugs for their ownpolitical reasons only. This is criminal. They wish to pretendthat they can make certain drugs go away completely. The War onDrugs has been amazingly successful in demonizing drugs and drugusers. (I can hear Chomsky saying, "Goebbels would beimpressed", which is not something I would write.) However,in stopping the flow of drugs it has been a dismal"failure". I predicted [5] that we would see newhorrors and we have seen them. Too many people have too much tolose if drugs disappear. The DEA, itself, will never let thathappen! So, the typical pro-legalization cant that the War onDrugs has failed is only half right and by no means the besthalf. Personally, I think the DEA has achieved nearly every goalon its agenda. VIII. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS The DEA claims that individual rights must bow to thepotential harm done by a few; however, it seems that thetrampling of human rights itself is the raison d'�tre. Afree people do not permit the punishment of people before theycommit a crime and the prohibition of drugs is just that. Formany of us, it is a draconian punishment that we shall struggleagainst as we would struggle against the worst sort of tyranny -for which drug prohibition is a good candidate. No measuresshould be ruled out in a struggle for an essential element of ourhumanity, e.g., the ability to make our own decisions, which ispart of the definition of freedom, cf., The Random HouseDictionary [6]: Definition (Freedom).Freedom is the exemption from external control,interference, regulation, etc. It is the power of determiningone's own actions or making one's own decisions. IX. LEGAL ASPECTS The difficulties suggested by the DEA can beovercome easily. We still have Fletcher's Doctrine, so nobodygets away with anything. The Food and Drug Administration canadvise and we are certain to take its advice into account.However, desperate people may take desperate measures if theywish, e.g., those dying from AIDS. Pharmaceutical companies andother drug manufacturers must continue to bear responsibility forwhat they do - as do we all. Nothing new here. The Meaning of the Word Addiction Is Not MadeClear In Chapter 1, below, I have defined nine typesof addiction, which does not constitute an exhaustive list. Whenthe DEA compares the rates at which given substances addict,i.e., the fractions of people who having used at all becomeaddicted, they are comparing apples with oranges if the types ofaddiction are widely disparate. For example, comparing theaddiction rate of cocaine to that of nicotine is nonsense, as theshort-term addictive effect of cocaine is gone once one elects tosleep. On the other hand, nicotine withdrawal is normallyaccompanied by painful symptoms that make the victim unfit forhuman companionship in many cases. In real life in the fast laneof rock music, we rarely encounter severe cocaine withdrawalsymptoms. The psychological dependence is merely the regret oneexperiences when one must forego a gratifying and delightfulexperience. This kicks in when the physiological withdrawal isover and its unpleasantness depends entirely on the individualand not at all on the drug. If I wished to add an amusing tenth type ofaddiction to the list below, I would consider an entirelyseparate type of addiction that is added intentionally to amedication, such as blood pressure medication, that must be takendaily, but, by itself, provides no gratification that impels onetoward a healthful regularity in one's use. I wish the drugcompany would add something addictive to my Indiral so that Iwouldn't forget to take it. I have just given an example of anaddiction that is useful and wholesome. Evidently, thedemonization of addiction is irrational and those who useaddiction always in a dyslogistic sense have fallen into alogical trap. CHAPTER BY CHAPTER REBUTTAL The Introduction to the DEA Document The DEA expects us to prove that the benefitsof legalization outweigh its costs, however benefits and costsmay be noncomparable when a moral imperative is involved.Generally, the DEA will be concerned with length of life asopposed to quality of life. The notion that some suffering isworthwhile is lost on them. Their question about using drugaddiction as a defense in a trial is answered by the FletcherDoctrine above. Finally, they wish to dictate the terms of thedebate. Naturally we shall insist that the terms of the debate benegotiated between us and we shall have something to say aboutthem. Chapter One: Addiction Rates and DrugLegalization I don't use the argument that drug use will godown and, frankly, in some cases, I hope it goes up. We can makethe best drugs available and, quite naturally, users will choosethe better drugs over those with serious drawbacks. If powdercocaine and new syringes are readily available, the use of crackcocaine might well disappear. Further, legal research should turnup even better drugs with few, if any, drawbacks. Cocaine is said to be much more addictive thanalcohol and yet some experts [7] claim that cocaine is notaddictive at all. I have classified cocaine under Case 2 (below),short-term addiction, and Case 4, pseudo-addiction, you enjoy anexperience so you wish to repeat it. Years ago, no one consideredcocaine addictive, mainly because there are no withdrawalsymptoms. The "violent psychotic behavior" theyassociate with cocaine is almost never seen in practice. Makethem state incidence rates and how they were obtained. The reasonthat there is "no effective, permanent treatment" forcocaine use is simple. Cocaine use is not a disease! Naturally,some people want to medicalize everything. There's gold in themthar hills. For the record, I include my short list of types ofaddiction together with a brief analysis of how well they fit thedefinition of disease [8]. I have compiled a short list of phenomena thatare sometimes referred to as (or mistaken for) drug addiction:(1) self-medication for chronic depression or chronic pain, (2)taking a drug that causes a symptom that can be relieved only bytaking more of the drug or by the passage of a few hours, (3)acute withdrawal symptoms that last several days, (4) dedicationto the repetition of a pleasurable experience regardless oflong-range consequences, (5) taking a drug to perform a task,which might have to be performed several times a week, perhaps tomake a living, (6) obligatory daily performance of a task thatcannot be performed during withdrawal from a drug, (7) usingdrugs to isolate oneself from the painful realities of life in abad world, (8) unwillingness to pass an opportunity to take drugsbecause the law may cut off one's supply, (9) the case of a drugthat, like valium or blood-pressure medication, poses a healthrisk if one forgets to take it in the absence of a craving that(blessedly) reminds one to take it. In Case 1, a physician mayprescribe another drug, Case 2 is normal and involves a consciouschoice between two alternatives on the part of the individual,Case 3 might require supervised tapering off or the prescriptionof other drugs, Cases 4-8 are behavioral choices in the face ofcircumstances that are beyond a therapist's control. I do notbelieve any of the cases correspond to what we normally call adisease. Case 9 is a normal medical situation and stretches themeaning of addiction seriously, but may not be omitted as itconstitutes a requirement to take the drug, which, in this caseand in this case alone, is strictly medical. Drug abuse usually refers to some type ofbehavior of which other people do not approve but which isconsistent with the goals of the user, who might be a criminal oronly an oddball. The term "denial" is a fallaciousappeal to the authority of the treatment community in a disputewith a user who is insufficiently articulate to defend his valuesand motives. The term "denial" is an impostor term.When the user himself disapproves of his own behavior, the term"drug abuse" might make sense, unless the user is avictim of anti-drug propaganda. Many people who have tried tostop taking drugs might benefit from the friendship and advice ofother drug users. As suggested by Henman [9], drug use must belooked at from the perspective of the user. We are told marijuana is stronger nowadays. So,take less! Also, label it honestly. If anything, its strengthwill be exaggerated, by establishment growers. Especiallyby establishment growers! Also, remind people that you needn'tsmoke it. The THC can be extracted with butter and drunk withcoffee or even milk. (Never try to extract it with water, ofcourse. It's not soluble in water.) If they use the argument thatthe commercial product Marinol, which contains THC, listsnumerous side effects associated with THC. Just pull out theblurb that goes with a common prescription medicine that isnormally deemed safe and see how long the list is for it.I would choose Imitrex, which cures migraine headaches, the totalnumber of side effects listed is thirty-four, unless Imiscounted. Remember, any symptom that is reported by as many as1% of the test group and appeared at least as frequently as itdid in the placebo group must be listed. If they tell youmarijuana impairs sexual function, ask them if they are worriedabout low birth rates. That's the kind of shifting of prioritiesthat they are fond of doing when it suits them. Just what is itthey don't want to happen? Do they really care more about thehealth of junkies or about the property of the affluent? If theytell you drug use drives up medical costs, ask them how much theyspend on the indigent compared to the well-heeled. Of course,early death, if it really occurs, reduces consumption of scarceresources, e.g., gasoline. Obviously, the ill effects ofmarijuana are never seen in the real world - only in the labs ofover-zealous "scientists" anxious to ingratiatethemselves with funding agencies, who, it must be admitted, arerarely run by hippies. Finally, they use the term "commonsense" in a fallacious way and refer to "misery anddeath", which occurs only rarely among sensible users. It isworth noting that the increase in use foreseen by some is merespeculation at best as no one can predict the future in thiscase. They have no scientific theory upon which to base theirpredictions. Chapter Two. Crime and Drug Legalization Once again, at the beginning of this chapter,the DEA claims that some drugs, notably crack and PCP, causeviolent and anti-social behavior. First of all, ask with whatfrequency. This behavior is virtually never seen in the realworld. If pressed, I could indicate, from personal experience andthe experience of friends and acquaintances, how exceedingly rarethis behavior must be as it is never witnessed by me or anyone Iknow. Even if a few did exhibit such anti-social behavior,society may not punish everyone for the actions of a few - and Imean a very few. Alcohol is the drug that causes violent andanti-social behavior, particularly if the user has seen armedcombat. The DEA divides crime associated with drugsinto three categories: purchase-related crime, drug-inducedcrime, and black market crime, which I shall consider separatelyas they do. PURCHASE-RELATED CRIME They claim, at the outset, that drugs are cheapnow, which is far from the case - even for a middle-class user.They claim that prices might not go down, thereforepurchase-related crime (crimes committed to get the money to buythe drugs) would not decrease. However, establishment drug firmshave the technology to produce drugs cheaply and they might findthemselves in heavy competition as no patents can be held on thetraditional drugs. Moreover, they would have no research costs todefray. (Research on marijuana has already been done by theunderground - and done well, I might add. Tobacco growers wouldbenefit immediately from this knowledge.) First the DEA claims that purchase-relatedcrime would not decrease because prices would not go down. Next,they claim that, if prices go down, use would increase, sopurchase-related crime would rise proportionately. Possibly usewould increase, and I hope it would, as drug use improves peoplein my experience. But, the price should be sufficiently reducedthat the cost of the saturation dose would not be prohibitive topoor people even, who manage to find the price of a pack ofcigarettes. At one point in the argument, the DEA claims propertycrime goes up with drug use - essentially for no reason at all.This won't wash as all the conditions will have changed and nosuch general rule can be justified. Of course, if hard pressed, poor people willsteal just to live, but that's another problem, namely, povertyitself, which had better be solved and solved soon. But, nothingthe DEA recommends will solve poverty. People who cannot getdrugs do not have a better chance to get decent work than drugusers would in a normalized situation. The trouble is in theeconomy and has nothing to do with drugs. In fact, the drug warcan be explained as a tactic to draw attention away from realproblems. DRUG-INDUCED CRIME Drug testing of people arrested for putativecrime proves nothing about drugs causing crime. This is thewell-known post hoc ergo propter hoc (after this thereforebecause of this) fallacy. (The fallaceous assumption is thateverything that happens after some distinguished event is causedby it.) The DEA statement that, "Drugs changed theirbehavior, enabled, and encouraged them to act violently andirrationally," is completely unsupported and has beendismissed by my earlier remarks. The authors of the DEA argumentsare shameful in their use of deceptive and inflammatory rhetoric. They often bring up crack, a drug that I, forone, shall assiduously avoid; however, they neglect the role ofthe drug war in encouraging the invention of crack as a marketinggimmick. If Squibb would provide a wide menu of cocaine productsother than crack, the use of crack would probably disappear, asit is not a very good drug and users would choose better ones. Moreover, the research of Schamaet al. [10] will disprove the existence of crack babies - unlessI am very much mistaken. Drug-induced crime is largely a myth. The DEAhas no case here. The constitutional rights of (otherwise) lawabiding citizens may not be denied due to the behavior of a fewexceptional people who would probably commit crimes with orwithout drugs. No scientifically verified mechanistic link hasbeen established between taking drugs and committing crimes. The DEA says, "Drugs changed [drug users]behavior, enabled and encouraged them to act violently andirrationally." Presumably, this would not occur except inpsychotic individuals, however it is well known that psychoticpeople are incapable of coping with the exigencies of habitualdrug use with all its complicated business of obtaining money,copping, and dealing with diverse and complicated people. Thus,people who are likely to behave irrationally will not be able totake illegal drugs on a consistent basis such that the fearsretailed by the DEA would be at all realistic. Fear ofpeople going crazy on drugs is the only irrational behavior oneis likely to encounter in connection with drugs. It is no stretchof logic to claim that the DEA is driving Americans crazy byinducing mass hysteria and unjustified fear of drugs, dealers,and users. BLACK MARKET CRIME It is patently absurd toimagine the black market competing with Parke-Davis unlesspunitive taxes are levied, which would be unfair and unwise. It'snot likely that the Cali cartel has the muscle (or ruthlessness)to take on multi-national corporations, most of which can put acreditable army in the field if it serves their selfish intereststo do so. The Cali cartel is a midget compared to Squibb. This isthe DEA's silliest argument - so far; but, don't worry, they willtop themselves. Children are bound to get drugs from adultsunder any scenario unless they can be convinced not to - blackmarket or no. I believe the best an honest educator can do issteer kids to the better and less harmful drugs and teach themhow to use drugs effectively and safely. The schools presentlyare incapable of offering an educational alternative that cancompete with drugs with their power to attune our sensibilitiesto the best that our culture has to offer and make worthwhilesubjects intensely interesting. All that the schools offer islies, drudgery, boredom, and all the wrong stuff. Kids who takedrugs are much more likely to take an interest in scholarship andart than are squares. Personally, I don't want my kids attendingany school I can think of - not Harvard, not any of them - and Ihave taught in four universities and attended many more includingthe elite academies. Frankly, I don't see many importantdifferences among them. They are all bad. Chapter Three. The Experience of ForeignCountries and Drug Legalization I do not intend to use this argument, but Imust comment on some of the specious arguments in this chapter.The DEA claims that "legalization did not work" in anyforeign country. They neglect to say what they mean by"work". In some cases, it worked for me. In theparagraph on Great Britain, the DEA refers to the journal Lancet,but they don't give us a reference directly to Lancet.Rather, they refer to a letter, which, we, of course, would notbe able to find in our library. This simply makes it impossibleto determine if they have quoted Lancet correctly - ifthey have evaluated the conclusions of the Lancet articlefairly. From experience, acquired in this booklet, we know betterthan to trust the DEA. They are dishonest and must be watchedcarefully in everything they say and do. In fact, every singlereference at the end of this chapter is clearly biased in favorof their position. This is typical of the references, as I havesaid before. Even references to university studies are tainted,as the sponsors and/or the directors of the institute doing thestudy are far from disinterested - to the everlasting shame ofall who profess science as their field of endeavor. Science: oncesacred, is now a tool of the wickedest people on earth. Later in the section on Great Britain, we aretold that only 20% of the "addicts" participate inmethadone programs. They conclude that the reason for this isthat heroin is a better drug. Almost certainly, street heroin isa much worse drug. The true answer undoubtedly is thedehumanization one experiences in any drug "program"or, for that matter, any government program of any type. That iswhy this author will never submit to a decriminalization planwith controls of any kind. This is why anti-prohibitionists whoadvise against asking for complete legalization and decontrol(and, perforce, rejecting any halfway measure) are part of theproblem not part of the solution. We have a moral imperative.There shall be no compromise - even if it means all-out war. Next, we are told that, while the clinicalheroin experiment in Great Britain was going on, the death rateof heroin addicts was twenty-six times the average for thepopulation. Firstly, I don't believe them (the reference is aletter that refers to an article in The New Republic,which is not a refereed scientific journal); and,secondly, why would they care, as they are obviously against drugaddicts. Undoubtedly, a considerable portion of whatever excessdeath rate the addicts do enjoy is caused by the lawsagainst drugs, which is proved in Appendix C. This is typical ofthe way in which this booklet switches objectives whenever theauthors find that a new objective is useful to make a point. If Iprove that result A will be achieved by legalization, theysuddenly abandon A as an objective and look for a new objectivethat will be met less well by legalization than by a bad law. Weare told that when the British "programs" were inoperation Scotland Yard had to double its narcotics division"to cope with the increased crime rate". [emphasismine] It appears, then, that the crime they are concerned aboutis taking drugs itself, which, of course, would not be a crime ifthey had not made it a crime artificially. The DEA equates success with less drugsconsumed and fewer users. But, clearly, they are not concerned atall with the quality of life of users, which they do everythingthey can do to diminish. In the Netherlands, they are concernedabout an increase in property crime, but one wonders what lawswere passed in the Netherlands, or anywhere, making it illegal torefuse employment to a person merely because he or she usesdrugs, regardless of his effectiveness. I, for example, can donearly anything better stoned than anyone else can do it notstoned - to put it modestly. I claim that nearly anyone can finda drug or combination of drugs that will enhance his performance.That's why so many athletes take drugs when they play, or,rather, used to before the systematic persecution and invasion ofprivacy of drug users (through testing) forced its nastytentacles deep into sports. I shall not go into the experiences of othercountries or cities with partial decriminalization, mainlybecause it is nearly impossible to find out what really happenedand, furthermore, it's irrelevant. Whatever the DEA says, weshall have to check it carefully as they are so dishonest. Afterall, they are fighting to protect lucrative jobs with virtuallyunlimited opportunities for corrupt practices. In the summary of Chapter 3, we read, "InIran and Thailand, countries where drugs are readily available,the prevalence of addiction has been and continues to beexceptionally high." Why don't they tell us how high? Thelast two sentences are as follows: 1.) Both the Single Convention on NarcoticDrugs of 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of1971 (both signed by the U.S.) insist that drugs should not belegalized. ["Issues and Comments to respond to Legalizationof Illegal Drugs." Drug Enforcement Administration, May1988]. 2.) The International Narcotics Control Boardof the United Nations concluded that "legalization advocateshave not yet presented a sufficiently comprehensive, coherent orviable alternative to the present system of internationaldrug-abuse control." ["Report of the InternationalControl Board for 1992," United Nations Publication]. Undoubtedly, these are true statements and Ithink they deserve a comment. They are indicative of the greatcontrol exercised by the United States in international politics,including the United Nations, which has become little more than atool of U.S. aggression and imperialism. We have become theall-time world's greatest bully - a nation of puritanicalhypocrites willing to impose intolerance and bigotry wherever itsuits our "interests", namely, the continued predationof the largely U.S.-based multi-national corporations. It isn'tjust drugs of which we are intolerant; it's any form ofself-determination among the weaker nations and any form ofdemocracy, be it capitalist or communist. Of course, since theonly path to true democracy lies through some type of communism,every democratic movement arising from the people will beinterpreted as communism, perhaps rightly. I don't have to saymuch to support this picture of the world as it really is. Thishas been done for me by Noam Chomsky with hundreds of detailspainstakingly documented [11,12,13, ... ]. The War on Drugs isonly the tip of a gigantic iceberg. Chapter Four: The Economics of DrugLegalization I do not use the argument that druglegalization will provide tax revenue. Drugs should not be taxedas they are a necessity of life. Food is taxed in Utah. Shame!Normally, the necessities of life are not taxed. In civilizedjurisdictions, they are never taxed. But, I must comment on thefalsity employed by the DEA - even in this pointless argument. Again, we see a reference to so-called crackbabies. When the Emory University studies [10] are finallypublished, and the detractors have been silenced, this myth willbe put to rest for all time. I shall rewrite this section at thattime. The DEA is again concerned about lostproductivity even though they have done nothing to ensure thatdrug users have jobs if they want them. Again, they make theunsupported claim that drug use is responsible for workplaceaccidents. The fact that Conrail train operators had usedmarijuana may have had nothing to do with the accident that theyconstantly harp on. I pointed out that just because eventscoincide does not prove that one is the cause of the other. Thisis a logical fallacy. In the chemical industry, which I know bestand where the accidents are of apocalyptic proportions,management pays lip service only to the prevention of accidents.Certainly, measures are taken, but the main cause of accidents isnot addressed, namely, the hiring of contract workers to avoidpaying benefits. Many of these workers do not read the languagein which the safety and operating manuals are written. Until thisoutrage is corrected, all bets are off concerning workplaceaccidents. I wish to express a sentiment peculiar tomyself to close my comments on economics. As far as I amconcerned drug users ought to be able to occupy themselvesexclusively with art if they so desire. Even fifty million drugusers supported by the rest of the work force does not seemexcessive to me. We have too many people working. The economy istoo large to be in harmony with nature. It is destroying theenvironment. For those of you who feel you should not have tosupport drug users, let me remind you that we haven't evenaddressed the slight matter of reparations for the inconveniencewe have suffered due to unconstitutional and immoral laws againstdrugs. I, personally, would be satisfied with $100,000 per yearfor the life of myself and my wife, however many will want muchmore - perhaps a one-time payment of fifty million 1996 U.S.dollars? Chapter Five: The Lessons of Prohibition andDrug Legalization In a recent talk, Jerry Epstein of the DrugPolicy Forum of Texas pointed out that the difficulty we areencountering in ending drug prohibition exceeds the difficultyencountered in ending alcohol prohibition simply because thepeople who remember what it was like before drug prohibition areall dead, whereas the people who repealed alcohol prohibitionremembered the period before Prohibition vividly. If the vastmajority of the body politic remembered that drugs were not aserious problem when they were legal, we would have an easy timerepealing the laws against drugs. By the way, they would rememberwhy the drug laws were enacted and they would realize, now thatracism has fallen into bad repute, that the drugs were enactedfor all the wrong reasons. Furthermore, it took a constitutionalamendment to prohibit alcohol. Why did it not require aconstitutional amendment to prohibit drugs? Clearly, aconstitutional amendment was required but conveniently by-passed,as it would not have passed muster in any rational court. Other than these observations, I have nothingto say about the lessons of Prohibition. Thus, the DEA ispreparing to defend itself against an argument I will not make.Apparently, the DEA has availed itself of "recent historicalevidence". Why should new evidence about past eventsbe more reliable than whatever evidence has been available sincethe time of Prohibition! I am skeptical of all such evidencewhether it furthers my case or not. It is more useful to me to hang the DEA withits own arguments. They seem to think that the majority favorsdrug prohibition, which somehow justifies prohibition. On thecontrary, the tyranny of the majority must be rejected along withevery other form of tyranny. What I think, though, is that, notonly do the majority favor drug legalization, the majority usesillegal drugs. I think it is amusing to contemplate thepossibility that, if every user came out of the closet, the setof users might turn out to be everyone! Ha! In Appendix B, I shall place Bob Ramsey's listof great men and women (mostly men) who have used drugshabitually. This may interest those who imagine that thepersecution of drug users will have no unintended social effects.If all of our great men were put in jail, society would certainlysuffer - embarrassment at the very least. Chapter Six: The Role of Alcohol and Tobaccoin the Drug Legalization Debate I will add caffeine to that list. Can youimagine how office workers would react to a ban on caffeine! I amnot suggesting that these other drugs should be made illegal ordemonized. I am sympathetic with smokers, particularly those whobegan smoking before the general propaganda campaign todiscourage smoking began. However, one must really wonder aboutsmokers who are so stupid as to congregate near the doorways ofbuildings to smoke, since that is an area through which everyonewho enters or leaves the building must pass. Why would they wantto lose the few sympathizers they have among nonsmokers when itwould cost them only a minimal additional effort to walk a fewpaces away from the building entrances? I suppose it is unfair toremark that quitting smoking cost me no effort worth mentioning,I suppose I am immune to addiction. Actually, I can take any drugor leave it. Arguments that hinge upon addiction, crime, health,etc. don't apply to me; so, presumably, neither should the laws.Actually, I am uncomfortable with the laws against drunk drivingbecause of the large number of drivers who drive well - evenbetter - while intoxicated. This must be a very large class ofdrivers, extending perhaps, to everyone on the road aftermidnight every Saturday night / Sunday morning, otherwise howwould they get home from the bars? It seems to me that the lawshould not kick in until actual harm is done. I cite the FletcherDoctrine, stated above. The DEA seems unprepared for my claim that thelegality of alcohol, the blood of Christ, and the illegality ofpeyote, marijuana, etc. is a violation of the EstablishmentClause of the First Amendment. Other than that I remark only thatthe DEA argument is typically silly, but I do not wish to go intowhat is obvious. Let me list a few fallacious statements fromeach of the remaining chapters even though I do not use theargument with which the chapter deals. By now the reader can tellthe author what's wrong with these statements. Let's leave suchcriticism as exercises for the reader. "Cocaine debases the user's life."Is that what they think? If it does, it is only because they sayso. And, they are willing to say anything regardless of whetherit makes sense or not. I am not nor have I been guilty of the adhominem fallacy. The drug warriors really are wicked.The general public ought to see them for what they are. Theydiscredit their own arguments by employing dishonest and immoralmethods to promote their own selfish interests. If theirarguments were valid, they would not have to resort to suchtactics. "[T]obacco does not affect one'sintellectual processing or decision-making ability." Sowhat! It is not clear that these other drugs affect them exceptpossibly to improve them. In most cases, the most popular illegaldrugs definitely enhance the IQs of most users. Users for whomthis is not true usually haven't much intellectual ability tobegin with. Personally, I don't think such people should be usingdrugs, but I am not prepared to tell them they may not; and, fromtime to time, they will surprise me with an outstandingintellectual leap, which, probably, they could not have madewithout drugs. Nobody has any evidence that is worth citing in ascientific debate. As Professor [James Q.] Wilson explains [Noticethat what follows is in no way an explanation, which byitself makes the entire statement a flat-out lie.],"Tobacco shortens one's life, cocaine debases it.Nicotine alters one's habits, cocaine alters one's soul [whichProf. Wilson knows from measurements on his soul-o-meter]. Theheavy use of crack, unlike the heavy use of tobacco, corrodesthose natural sentiments of sympathy and duty that constitute ourhuman nature and make possible our social life." [When aman uses the word "duty" in this manner "stand noton the order of your leaving but leave immediately". Please,Prof. Wilson, spare me your society.] Professor Wilson's opinionis worthless. Quoting "authority" is the weakest typeof argument and may safely be dismissed. One can always findsomeone as stupid as oneself. See my article on academia [14], to understandwhy I don't think college professors deserve the respect ofordinary people. During the last few decades, they seem to havebecome incorrigibly stupid. I have deliberately dissociatedmyself from all but a few with whom I remain on civil terms.These few are cynical enough concerning the intellectualabilities of the rest. I have been attending seminars at RiceUniversity, lately, to correct all the stupid things that aresaid - except in mathematics, where profound stupidity has notyet carried the day. But, more and more, I despair of beingunderstood. Occasionally, one or two receptive minds can befound, but only on rare occasions. The drivel one hears is beyondwhat anyone could imagine only a few short years ago, butacademia has succumbed to the cesspool mentality almostcompletely. The college students, even in the prestige academies,are pathetic, especially those who come from homes that allowtelevision viewing. (PBS, even, is an unmitigated intellectualdisaster.) I honestly see no point in being diplomatic inthis effort to change people's minds. No good will come fromadopting partial truths or downright falsehood as Madison Avenueand the mainstream culture have done. I should expound at greaterlength on this attitude of uncompromising truth regardless ofconsequences, that is, truth as we perceive it - recognizing thatwe are fallible. "And although cholesterol may kill you,it does not lead to the types of bizarre, destructive behaviorthat is associated with most illegal drugs." Refute thisas an exercise. (Why should not the reader get a chance toparticipate in the slaying of monsters of falsehood?) "[W]e should compare the risks of alcoholand tobacco [don't forget caffeine] with those of legalizedcocaine and marijuana." [Fair enough] "Likely, wewould find that the latter are much more dangerous than theformer." False; say why as an exercise. "[A]lcohol, while admittedly,dangerous, is much less addictive than presently illegal drugsand also is easier to quit once addicted." Criticize asan exercise. Hint: Add what we said about the definition(s) ofaddiction to the other falsehoods in this sentence. Chapter Seven: Medical Uses of PresentlyIllegal Drugs Criticize this chapter as an exercise unlessyou find its illogical point of view and other faults tooobvious. Hints: (1) They call what we say"propaganda". We admit to that, but wonder if theythink that what they say is "education". (2) One can drinkmarijuana. (3) Appeal to authority is the fallacy known as adverecundiam, i.e., toward modesty - your modesty. Chapter Eight: Individual Rights and theLegalization of Drugs I do not refer to John Stuart Mill, so it's nogood pawning his remarks off on me. I have made an irrefutableconstitutional argument. It remains only to examine the majorityand minority opinions in the case law that reached the SupremeCourt of which, I would venture to say, very little exists;however, I may be in for a surprise, a surprise I can handle. Themajority opinions that ruled against my positions must involveunconscionable assaults on logic. These can easily be refutedwith whatever slight aid I expect from the minority opinions. No,Your Honors, "I'm not trying to show contempt for thiscourt, I'm doing my best to hide it." My contempt knows nobounds, thus it's impossible to hide it. What will they arrest mefor, contempt of word processor - to take a page from Tom Wolfe.I have no fear that the Supreme Court will defeat my argument inthe higher court of unfettered reason. They will try to establish compelling reasonswhy these violations of the Constitution are essential to thecommonwealth of the United States. We shall not allow that thegovernment has a right to regulate the health and personal safetyof its citizens against their will. We can raise an army in notime that will put down that heresy. (Obviously, such armies arealready out there in force - although they are rarely informed bythe highest principles.) Other sections of this paper willdisqualify nearly every compelling reason they are likely to comeup with. If they pull something new, it will be just as speciousas the rest and I can refute it on my feet under as much pressureas they wish to put to bear. One must realize that, although theywield immense raw force, they are basically little people -barely more than children and they have not had a valid thoughtin years. They are almost nobody - in the existential sense. Weshould not fear them, rather, we should get busy and get them outof there. We can certainly contrive to arrange that if weapply our minds and exercise a little moral resolution. They have repeated my argument in their"little book". They claim our freedom doesinterfere with the freedom and well-being of others. (They usethe weak phrase "affect other people" to which we mightrespond: So what! But, for the sake of argument, we shall grantthat they mean that the effect is to interfere with the freedomof other people, and we shall use this concept in the widestpossible sense giving them every opportunity to make a validcase, which they cannot do.) In my philosophical papers, I haveshown how to disqualify imaginary offenses, i.e., offenses thatwould not occur if the mental outlook of the victim weredifferent. For example, a mother is distraught because she haslearned that her son is homosexual. Her pain is caused by herintolerance and misunderstanding of the situation. It cannot besaid that he is interfering with her freedom or "hurtingher" in a way from which she can be protected by the State.I will take their arguments one at a time and finish with themost common situation of all, namely, the case of the wife whoclaims to be suffering because her husband gets high. CRIME Earlier, I have shown that the argument thatdrug use increases crime is invalid. Even if drug use didlead to crime on occasion, the Wayburn Doctrine invalidatespunishing every drug user for the behavior of a few. DAMAGE TO THE UNBORN The epidemiological data suffers from thewell-known fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc. But, mostcompelling, the study by Schama et al. [10], which is mechanistic(rather than epidemiological), has good controls, employs morethan adequate variation in conditions, subjects the young monkeysto a wide range of accepted psychological tests, and is beingperformed using the strictest scientific procedures to avoid anembarrassment when it is subjected to (expected) harsh scrutinyby drug warriors subsequent to publication, this study, I say,pretty much shows that there is no such thing as crack babies.I have known this for years from vast personal, albeit anecdotal,experience, namely, nearly daily observation of the pregnantmothers throughout their pregnancies - observations that the drugwarriors never have at their disposal. The plain truth about muchscience funded by the public is that it can be replaced withoutloss by introspection and casual observation. This is especiallytrue of the so-called social sciences and a large part of medicalresearch even. I do not intend to tar everyone with the samebrush. Notable and laudable exceptions exist. However, researchthat is sponsored by government agencies or other parties withvested interest in the outcome, e.g., a study of the carcinogeniceffects of chemicals sponsored by Dow and DuPont, is notscience! CHILD ABUSE This, again, is the fallacy of post hoc ergopropter hoc. Drug users almost never abuse children. Povertyabuses children. Capitalism abuses children. Instances of childabuse by drug users must be so rare that to punish every druguser for their crimes is an outrageous abuse of law. Punish childabusers when they abuse children - if the government has theremotest idea what constitutes child abuse, which I doubt. This,by the way, is an equivocal way of using the term abuse in abooklet that employs the term drug abuse. What do they mean, thenby drug abuse? Striking a pill with a blunt instrument or merelyyelling at a bag of cocaine? These people are such terrible liarsand morons. They deserve our utmost contempt. (This paper is notcalculated to make friends among them. To the drug warriors, asW.C. Fields would say, "I hate you!") The horror stories can be attributed one-by-oneto the War on Drugs and, of course, Capitalism, itself, which isbehind the War. I suppose the rich old men are afraid that younghip drug users might refuse once more to dress up in soldiersuits and go out and be killed (and kill those with whom theyshare the same old men as enemies) to make the old men and theirfamilies richer still at the expense of themselves and their ownfamilies. I find it ironic that, in the case of our armedaggression against the people of Viet Nam, our boys went out assquares and came back hip junkies, knowing the score even if itcost them a limb or two, unless, of course, they were killed -or, rather, murdered by the same company that brings you, now,The Drug War, in living color. AUTO ACCIDENTS The DEA paragraph on this topic begins byasserting that a large percentage (how large?) of automobileaccidents in the U.S. is caused by marijuana. They think theyknow this - or, perhaps, they think they can convince us of this- by doing drug testing after the accident. This is posthoc ergo propter hoc, which proves nothing; it doesn't evengive us a clue. What percentage of drivers who didn't get inaccidents were high on grass? I'll tell you what: I'll put mybunch of vipers, higher than kites, in a driving contest againsta random bunch of squares. I'm not going to let you employ thePenske team, naturally, that's why I say random. It is easy todesign a fair experiment to determine if drug use causesimpairment of driving skills, for example; however, no suchexperiment will be conducted. The authorities will not provideimmunity, remove the stigma, the social expectations, and pastdemonization and scapegoating of drugs and drug users. Contrary to the DEA claim, the Conrail accidentprobably had nothing to do with pot. I say this with confidence.No one has even remotely proved that it did. Would you like todiscuss the evidence? No unbiased scientific experiment has everbeen carried out to study the effects of drugs! Nor is it likelythat such an experiment can or will be carried out until drugsare legalized and drug use is normalized. The last statement in the (DEA) paragraph underconsideration is just plain ludicrous on the face of it. That'swhy we know these drug warriors are plain old-fashioned liars -desperately trying to hold on to their lucrative (very lucrative,I opine) jobs that are not and never were needed. Can you sayparasite? Here's the statement: "Furthermore, a studyconducted by Stanford University found that twenty-four hoursafter smoking one joint, pilots could not safely land aplane." The reference is the Drug Awareness InformationNewsletter, undoubtedly another bunch of liars, but certainlynot a reviewed scientific journal. Now, after making asensational claim like this, why wouldn't they give us areference to the actual study? Twenty-four hours after smoking ajoint, hardly anyone can distinguish a difference from the way hefelt before he smoked the joint. Given this indisputable everydayfact, why should we ever get in a plane knowing that the pilot isunable to discern by feelings alone whether he is capable oflanding it? How did they get permission to carry out this testlegally? Who would carry it out illegally? I know thepresident of Stanford might divert research funds to luxuries forhis personal use, but illegally fly planes ... ? This is thedumbest thing in the book! (The only reason I am bothering withpeople whose only logic is bullets is that I promised someone Iwould do it.) The people who wrote this book are dishonest. Goahead sue me for libel. It ain't libel if it's true. (Anysuggested advocacy anywhere in this paper - or in any other paperby this author - of illegal acts by the author or others is to beconstrued as humor, naturally.) MONEY Lost Productivity The DEA claims that drugs cost the nation moneydue to lost productivity. This reveals, already, an unclearconcept of economics, but the reader must read my other papers tolearn economics. (If you learned economics from Samuelson, youdon't know economics.) But, I'll leave economics out of it.Proponents of the American economic system (quasi-Capitalism)don't seem to understand that the lives of working people have noextrinsic purpose. People are not here to be exploited byentrepreneurs, to designate employers as charitably as I can.People belong to themselves. We better ask ourselves why peoplewho take drugs often lose all interest in their employers'agendas. Isn't it clear that the fault lies with the work, theworkplaces, and the bosses, not with drugs! Further, the remarksabove concerning the lack of any scientific evidence continue toapply to performance in the workplace. Higher Taxes The DEA is not clear how these higher taxescome about. I shall argue in a moment that it is unlikely thatthe higher taxes are needed to benefit drug users. I hope I havemade it abundantly clear that the purpose of a human life is notto be of the greatest possible service to the State, which mightinclude paying taxes. I shall have to await a cogent argumentfrom the DEA (or one of its pawns) before I can say what I thinkof it. Increased Health Costs Including IncreasedInsurance Premiums Since we have no decent scientific evidencethat links workplace accidents to drug use, we shall rule outthat factor. (Certainly, the most dangerous corporate policy inthe chemical industry, with which I am familiar, is hiringcontract workers who cannot read the language in which the safetyand operating manuals are written. This has resulted in manyhorrible catastrophes. Probably, chemical plants need to be muchsmaller to lessen the scope of the harm done by mishaps.Currently, plants are large enough to wipe out entire cities,cf., Bhopal.) If we are to believe the DEA, many drug userswill not be receiving health insurance benefits due to their ownchoice, but we Americans have not enacted equal opportunitylegislation to prevent unfair and unconstitutional employmentdiscrimination against drug users who are as competent as anyonewhether they are stoned at work or not. Drugs enhanceperformance. That's why most major-league baseball players useddrugs before the country returned to the Dark Ages, cf., JimBouton [15]. Also, if the DEA wants to claim that drug users haveshorter life spans, they must admit as well that they willrequire health care for a shorter period. Also, many drug usersdon't avail themselves of the medical establishment at all. Afterall, they are into self-medication, are they not? To carry thatpoint further still, if people could write their ownprescriptions, medical costs and, concomitantly, the incomes ofphysicians would be reduced. For my first paper on drugs [2], Iinterviewed a drug user who wishes to boycott doctors. In thatpaper, I make practically the complete case for completelegalization and decontrol of all drugs. If you had read it, asyou should have, we might not need to have this discussion somany years later as there would be nothing to discuss.Nevertheless, I am pleased to record my latest thinking on thesubject for my own personal records. Suppose, for example, that aperson is willing to sign an affidavit that he will never availhimself of the health-care system, except for the pharmaceuticalsector (and of course the textbook publishing and salesbusiness). In that case, would the DEA (or Congress) be willingto permit him to prescribe for himself? Finally, in the unlikelyevent that drugs kill a user, the death is swift, normally, and,therefore, inexpensive! The DEA's Last Word on Personal Freedom "In short, few people use the IndividualAutonomy argument any more because it is painfully obvious thatdrug use affects not only the individual user, but also theuser's family, innocent third parties, and society as awhole." We shall need many more words than this to establishour rebuttal, but not only because the DEA expects the Americanpeople to be incredibly stupid and, of course, they will not bedisappointed. In America, independent thought has been wiped outby insidious propaganda techniques learned from Madison Avenuewith the full force of the academic social science establishmentin the vanguard. (How do professors shave themselves in themorning? After only a few years, I became so ashamed of my(academic) calling that I could not go on, even though I thoughtthat I needed the money.) The Sufis, an amusing littlefree-thinking off-shoot of Islam, ask, "Are people really asstupid as we say they are?" Absolutely, as they demonstratepersuasively. I first wish to comment on the gratuitous useof the expression "painfully obvious". This is simplyinfuriating, as no valid evidence has been given. Not only is itnot obvious, it is not even true. In mathematics, we would callthis handwaving. It's what you do when you have forgotten theproof or no proof exists. To use this argument to suspendconstitutional guarantees, one would have to show that this"effect" occurs in every case, and that the effect isbad, and that the drug user is somehow in the wrong to createthis effect. I wish to discuss the effect on the family first. We may safely disregard the possibility thatthe effect involves violence as we have no evidence that drug useis responsible for violence with a non-negligible frequency ofoccurrence. On the contrary, drug users are more gentle,sensitive, and caring than the public at large. I have drawn up alist of complaints made by the wife of a friend of mine. Ishall pretend that I am he. When I say "my wife", Imean "his wife". I shall suppose that my children wouldnot come up with complaints substantially different from these. Idistinguish between imaginary offenses, such that the"victim" would not be inconvenienced if her attitudewere at least different if not more correct, and actual offenses,such that the state of mind of the victim has no bearing on the"abuse" she must suffer. I have used the analogy of themother whose son is homosexual, in which her suffering dependsentirely on her state of mind and has nothing to do withhis behavior. My Wife's Concerns 1. Fear for my health. Not really validas she refuses to respect my dietary needs, which have animmediate and permanent effect on my health. 2. She objects to what she perceives asunattractive and bizarre behavior manifested when I'm stoned andwhich she finds embarrassing. Sounds pretty subjective to me.When I get stoned, I become preoccupied with art, literature,mathematics, and, music. I look distracted, particularly when Iam interrupted. I am at work and, therefore, my long and enduringfaithful devotion to my wife, although always strong andsustaining, is, perforce, in the background. Interruptions,therefore, cause me confusion, which might be mistaken for idiocyby a person who has never experienced an obsession. I have noidea what I look like, but it probably bears comparison to thecrazy artist or mad scientist stereotyped unfavorably in ourcommercial movies. Of course, even geniuses don't get the respectdue them from their wives - or their valets. How can that fatslob who belches at the dinner table be in a class with Einsteinor Beethoven? I wonder what Bach's wife called him when thechildren weren't around, which, come to think of it, must havebeen infrequently in his case. Mrs. Bach - "Hey, [ironically] maestro,you left the lid up on the toilet seat again. Honestly, I don'tknow why I married you; you can't do one single thing right. Mrs.Handel's husband just bought her a new dish washer, but what do Iget from you - another grosse fugue, you bum." Bach - "Yes, dear, you're perfectly right,dear, I'm listening to every word you say, dear; I'll get to itthe first thing in the morning; but, if you'll give me half asec, I'll put the finishing touches on this cantata and thentake out the garbage. [sotto voce] What the hell is she talkingabout now? Goddam alto clef, let's see - F-A-C-E-G. [loudly] Yes,dear, right away, dear. [sotto voce] No respect! And I thinkshe's pregnant again. That little bastard Carl [his son, CarlPhilipp Emanuel Bach] ate all my morphine suppositories, again.Why me! [loudly] No, dear, you do not smell pot." 3. Maybe taking drugs is immoral. Well,that's what the DEA, other authoritarians, and the liquor andcigarette lobby are spending a fortune to induce her to think,but I don't think she's that stupid. No, that's not a problem forus. In any case, I've gone to a lot of trouble to show thattaking drugs is not immoral [5]. What is immoral is trying tostop someone from taking drugs! My wife would not be in aposition to criticize my morals as she puts meat products on myplate, rarely but sometimes, even though I have expressed mymoral outrage at the killing of animals for food, not to mentionthe horrible treatment of many animals prior to slaughter, cf.,large chicken "plants". Eating meat really is immoral,however I have not forcibly prevented anyone from doing it norhave I exacted punishment from those who do. If this drug warcontinues, that will undoubtedly change, although not because ofany direct action on my part. 4. What will the neighbors, her parents, heremployers, and co-workers think? Well, that's the sameproblem as above, but why should she care what people think! 5. Danger from the police. Well, yes,that's what we're trying to fix. 6. Danger in the Third Ward, a Black ghetto.Ditto. 7. I earn less money when I take drugs.I don't earn any money in any case. But, to tell the truth, Iusually don't take drugs when I am employed. It's really toocomplicated and, since I can take them or leave them according tomy inclinations and the circumstances, I choose not to take themwhen engaged in certain activities, but I have never said I wouldnot ever take them again. I have never repudiated drugs. Thatwould be dreadful. 8. I am less productive on drugs.Absolutely and categorically false. While, it is true that Idon't design chemical plants on drugs, I could if I wanted to,provided I worked at home, the way things are nowadays, which weare trying to fix. I don't watch professional football or junkmovies when I'm using drugs, but I get more done by orders ofmagnitude and my work is far superior to anything I can dowithout drugs. That includes mathematics, any type of problemsolving, philosophy (old-fashioned "big philosophy" -original philosophy, music theory and practice, craftsmanship,housework and home repairs, writing, study, financialtransactions (yes, I do financial transactions, just likeordinary folks and I do live in the world), driving a car(long-distance travel), photography, graphic arts (modeling), andsex (if sex may be called work). I'm sure I've forgotten a fewthings. But, basically, I can do anything on drugs. 9. I don't eat well when I'm stoned. Oh,that it were true! I gained four pounds over a two-day period thelast time I got high. Heroin improves my appetite tremendouslyand cocaine does not attenuate it. Sometimes I may get absorbedin my work and skip lunch, but I always sit down with my wife forthe (obligatory) family evening meal. I may eat differently as Iam trying very hard to avoid meat. My wife cannot seem tounderstand that I object to killing animals for food on moralgrounds. 10. She likes to have things her way, whichincludes me. I have been subjected to a remodeling agendafrom the beginning; and, believe it or not, I have changedconsiderably to accommodate my wife's design. I think many womencommit to men under the assumption that, although men are notsatisfactory as they are found in nature, it won't take long tochange them into whatever the women want! I believe this is aproverb. 11. She likes me better when I'm not high.This is a matter of taste and tolerance for what does notcorrespond to what we would wish for. I was high when she met meand it was some time before she saw me when I was not high. If Ididn't suit her tastes, that was the time to do something aboutit, However, in those days I did not object to sacred pledges andwe pledged ourselves to each other without any conditions. 12. Drugs are too expensive. Amen. Icould synthesize or grow any drug I need to take. I do notbelieve taking legalized drugs would be a financial burden,especially if I could make some for my friends. 13. I could lose the car if I am arrestedfor drugs while I'm using it. This is unfair,unconstitutional (due process violation), and must be changed. 14. When I take drugs, our family is notlike the TV family we are indoctrinated to want to emulate,presumably, to support the environmentally catastrophic consumerculture. Thank God for drugs, because, if I did not takedrugs, there, but for the grace of God, go we. 15. When I am high on drugs, I frequentlyget wrapped up in my arts, viz., music and literature. Atlast, we come to what I believe is the real reason my wifedoesn't want me to take drugs. Music and literature take me awayfrom her, at least temporarily. Women fear these rivals more thanthey fear other women. As Duke Ellington put it musically,"A drum is a woman." W. Somerset Maugham claims thatwomen hate art [16]. Mark Hecker, the guitarist and graphicartist, once quipped, "I have never been in a situationwhere music was being played, women were present, and they didnot do everything in their power to destroy (stop) themusic." I think we have arrived at the sad and unfortunatetruth. Thus, it is the drug taker whose freedom is beingabrogated by his wife. This is classic. And, as usual, theauthoritarians (read Conservatives if you wish) turn the truthinto its opposite. This book by the DEA is a handbook of lies.[It's worse than the Bible, which I always thought was theepitome of falsehood. Moses spoke to God. Oh, sure.] Chapter Nine: Legal Issues Surrounding theLegalization of Drugs The DEA points are easy to answer. Use theFletcher Doctrine described earlier. Remember that we insist thatpeople may not be punished for doing harm until they actually doharm. This does not remove the element of prevention, whichremains education - not propaganda but education. Read thedefinition of "education" in a good dictionary such asthe Random House [6]. Condemn Dram Shop Laws. The function of theFDA (Food and Drug Administration) is to advise not control.Thus, hopelessly ill people could try anything with a fullknowledge of the risks. The DEA does not present difficultproblems in this chapter. Chapter Ten: Environmental Issues and theLegalization of Drugs I do not use this argument. Nevertheless, as anexercise, the reader may look for errors in the DEA logic. Chapter Eleven: "Anything Is Better ThanWhat We Are Doing Now" Hopelessness, Drug Control, andPotential Solution Again, I do not use this argument. Be carefulhere, though, because, if the purpose of the DEA is to demonizedrugs, drug users, and drug dealers, they are very successful. Ofcourse, they can never stop the flow of drugs, but they may notclaim that that is their objective. They are making it plentytough for many users, which, of course, we view as immoral,wicked, and, indeed, illegal. Threaten them with class-actionlibel if you wish. If they think about it, they may be worried.David Robinson in his sneaker ad was definitely guilty of libeland would have lost in a fair trial. Nowadays, one never knowswho the jury may be and any verdict is possible! This is animportant point and the tyranny better start worrying about it. Iconclude with my seven-point post-prohibition plan. Obviously, mymajor thrust was the constitutional and moral issue, which theyhave said nobody uses anymore! That's only the main issue.Next comes terrorism and selective assassinations if the tyrannypersists. That Pablo Escabar sure knew how to treat authoritarianpublic officials. Well, we have to get their attention. Ofcourse, we do not condone violence and we will repeat that asoften as necessary. Any allusions to violence are in the natureof humor or, at their most drastic, represent dire predictions ofevents we would do anything to prevent. Insist on this. We neverdiscuss anything more drastic than an occasional dirty trick thatwe would never play on anyone. We only mention these tactics toexpress our good-natured joviality, as we are the last people onearth who will lose their sense of humor. My Seven-Point Plan for Post Prohibition My new plan for post-prohibition societyconsists of the following: (1) an equal-rights amendment for drugusers, (2) teaching people how to live with drugs, to choose themwisely, and to use them properly (to get the most out of them andto prevent accidents, disease, and unpleasant side-effects), (3)new opportunities for drug users, heteroclites, and other peoplewho are "different" to make contributions to society inappropriate nonstandard settings including settings where one canwork while using drugs, (4) during the transition, reparationsfor victims of the laws against drugs amounting to whatever theyneed to live abundantly, and (5) free informal counseling fortroubled or troublesome drug users by drug users. Since, it must be admitted, some people who aretaking drugs might like to stop - even in a normalized society, Ipropose two additional "points": (6) institutions likecommercial hotels that cost no more than hotels and that have allthe amenities of hotels and more, e.g., VCRs and videotapelibraries and books, except that the (voluntary) guest may notleave for a fixed period of time agreed upon in advance (by theguest) nor indulge in certain drugs beyond agreed upon limits,which might be monotonically decreasing. Rural locations mightprovide better settings with lower real estate costs offset byhigher transportation costs. Only one "medical""professional" per shift would be needed, namely, todispense medicine. I can say truthfully that I would trust anydrug dealer I have known to perform that job - except for one,who was generous to a fault. Vouchers could be provided for thosewho can't pay. And, finally, (7) new drugs that preventwithdrawal symptoms and cravings may be used (voluntarily), ifthey exist. Such claims have been made lately for the drugibogaine (17), but, unless the costs are reduced or borne by thestate, it will not be widely used. Also, the claims may not betrue - or not true in an acceptable mode; i.e., the effectivenessof ibogaine may depend on "religious" faith, whichmight diminish the humanity of the patient. Moreover, those whohave been "cured" by ibogaine may have merelytransferred their allegiance to a new drug, which, in the case ofibogaine, is long lasting (six months or longer) - at first, butwhich, after repeated doses, might "need" to be usedmore frequently. Lately, similar effects have been ascribed tothe South American drug yage or one of its derivatives. Actually,the possibility of switching to a new drug is included underpoints (2) and (5) above.

Letter to William Buckley After HeLost Debate to Charles Rangel March 28, 1990 William Buckley "Firing Line" P. O. Box 5966 Columbia, SC 29250 Dear Mr. Buckley, I suspect that many great and famous men do notget to see the mail addressed to them. In case this is being readby someone who is considering not letting Mr. Buckley see it, letme caution against that idea. Whether I receive a reply or not, Iwill assume that Mr. Buckley is aware of the arguments expressedin this letter and in the enclosed paper, "The Case for DrugLegalization and Decontrol in the United States." Any futuredeeds or words by Mr. Buckley in connection with this debate willbe construed in the light of this. Whereas it would be aninjustice to Mr. Buckley to assume that he had ignored convincingarguments if his staff had not permitted him to see them, theblame would reside with his staff. I wish I knew how to say thatbetter in fewer words, then I could begin all letters to the highand mighty with a stock paragraph - like the warning on a packageof cigarettes. That said, I would like to comment on thespecial edition of "Firing Line" with the debate ondrug legalization, although I tuned in a little late and had toturn it off 15 minutes early to go to bed. It seems that none ofthe pro-legal team could answer Rangel's point that we should tryprevention and treatment before legalization. Also, hisobservation that we have not addressed the social causes ofimproper drug use, e.g., poverty, was detrimental to thepro-legal side. So, when I tuned out, the prohibitionists had wonthe debate. The pro-legal side deserved to lose becausethey did not produce the most important arguments forlegalization, the points covered in my paper, the addendum, andmy letters to the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), which might makesense to someone who had read the DPF Newsletter (in particular,one of them destroys Judge Sweet's position). Since I coveredbasically everything, let me single out the crucial points,namely, those that destroy Rangel's position. Also, before Iforget, why in the world wasn't the anti-prohibition sideadequately represented? Didn't you consult Arnold Trebach? If youdid, why didn't Arnold get someone who supports the followingpoints (not me, I can't appear on television; however, I amwilling to debate anyone, anytime, anywhere in the print media,including you): 1. The laws against drugs are unconstitutionalon the basis of (i) the First Amendment (the laws are essentiallyof a religious nature), (ii) the Ninth Amendment (proceeding fromrights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness), and (iii)violation of due process ("abuse" is undefined, aspointed out by Dr. Robert Goodman). 2. Prevention and treatment are based onfallacies and unstated assumptions, namely, (i) drugs are bad foreveryone, (ii) drug abuse is a disease, not is like adisease but is a disease, to name only two. 3. Prevention and treatment won't work, mainlyfor the reasons stated in (2). You continued to emphasize thatprevention and treatment won't get the criminals out of the drugtrade, which is one of your main concerns, and certainly a validconcern, but the thrust of the argument fails because no onecould prove that Rangel's plan wouldn't dry up the demand. I am interested in obtaining a transcript ofthe debate; but, by the time you have read this, I will havespoken to "Firing Line" and obtained my copy if it isat all possible. I am preparing another paper for the DPF. (Partof the enclosed paper is in Drug Policy 1989-1990, AReformer's Catalogue, Chapter 6 [1].) The new paper is to beentitled "Unstated Assumptions and Fallacies in Preventionand Treatment." [2] Perhaps you would like a copy? Sincerely, Thomas L. Wayburn Note to the reader (4-30-96): Buckley did notrequest a copy of Reference 2; however, he did read Reference 1,at least as much of it "as he had time for". Heaccepted my position in that paper but without excessiveenthusiasm. Nowadays, one no longer expects famous men and womenwho dabble in essay writing to exclaim, "My Heavens, this isthe greatest essay I have ever read, at least the best I haveread lately. Why is this writer not recognized? I shall dowhatever I can to bring this great talent to the attention of thereading public." I don't believe anyone (save myself alone)would do that even for his own son. Hey, it's a jungle out there. References 1.

THE LAWS AGAINST DRUGS AND THE WAR ON DRUGS RATHERTHAN THE USE OF DRUGS PER SE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST (ALMOSTALL) DEATHS ASSOCIATED WITH DRUGS. Classification of DeathsInvolving Drugs We may place deaths associated with drugs incategories, which should be nearly exhaustive. If someone takesexception to the proposition that forms the title of this sectionand names a category not on my list, I am prepared to deal withthat category at any time the detractor wishes. (I am prepared todefend my viewpoint against all comers at any time and any placeprovided the debate be fair; e.g., I must be allowed as much timeas I need to make my points or my rebuttals to my opponentspoints regardless of the exigencies of television or otherbroadcast medium. Nothing could be more outrageous than placingtime limits on a debate of this importance. I don't care ifregular programming has to be suspended for a year. The airwavesare a public trust and must serve the needs of the people and thepeople desperately need rational debate on public issues.] Thecategories are as follows: Accidental deaths Murders perpetratedby debtors and creditors in the drug trade Murders associatedwith the battle for market share Deaths due to marketing ingeneral and advertising in particular Deaths due to conspiraciesor the ultimate conspiracy, a monopoly on the sale of a specificdrug Deaths due to overdoses, substituted chemicals, impurities,and unexpected effects Crimes of passion of which people whodon't take drugs are incapable Deaths due to physical impairment Analysis of Each Category ACCIDENTS OCCURRING DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF DRUGS These arerare and, in any case, are of much smaller scope, than accidentsoccurring in the commercial pharmaceutical business. Thus,legality might increase the number of such deaths, but in thesame way that the manufacture of a cure for cancer would. Wewould not be against a cure for cancer just because, in thenormal course of operations, accidents do occur whereverchemicals are present. MURDERS PERPETRATED BY DEBTORS ANDCREDITORS IN THE DRUG TRADE The murder of a creditor to avoidpayment with a child caught in the crossfire On December 12,1995, an article about a three-year old child who was killed inthe crossfire associated with the an unpayable drug debt appearedin The Houston Chronicle. Undoubtedly, the intention of thearticle was to demonize drug users and sellers further; but thefact is that, due to the illegality of drugs, creditors anddebtors do not have access to the normal legal proceduresassociated with debt. Thus, the laws against drugs are theculprit. Sellers of legal drugs do not in general extend credit.When drugs are legal no premium is added to compensate the dealerfor additional risk. Further, in the case of the most popularillegal drugs research costs are virtually nonexistence becauseof thousands of years of experience available at no cost toanyone. Thus, manufacturers do not have to add a premium torecoup the cost of research as must be done in the case ofZantac, for example. The low price justifies drug stores inrefusing to extend credit for a bottle of aspirins, say.Therefore, it is the laws against drugs that allow debt andcredit with its concomitant disputation into the picture.Creditors in legal trades have recourse to the courts - whateverthat's worth. Whereas, it must be admitted that the civil courtsare not a realistic remedy for most people who are involved inbusiness disputes, including the great number that arise due todebt, such recourse as they do afford is a slight deterrent toviolence. We all know that a broken knee cap is a much moreeffective expedient in the case where one feels he has beenunjustly treated or, if one retains bourgeois values, a punch inthe nose. Debtors in legal trade have recourse to bankruptcy and,in any case Deaths due to marketing in general and advertising inparticular Deaths due to conspiracies or the ultimate conspiracy,a monopoly on the sale of a specific drug Deaths due tooverdoses, substituted chemicals, impurities, and unexpectedeffects Crimes of passion of which people who don't take drugsare incapable Deaths due to physical impairment Analysis of EachCategory ACCIDENTS OCCURRING DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF DRUGSThese are rare and, in any case, are of much smaller scope, thanaccidents occurring in the commercial pharmaceutical business.Thus, legality might increase the number of such deaths, but inthe same way that the manufacture of a cure for cancer would.

We all know that a broken knee cap is a much moreeffective expedient in the case where one feels he has beenunjustly treated or, if one retains bourgeois values, a punch inthe nose. Debtors in legal trade have recourse to bankruptcy and,in any case , are rarely murdered by their creditors who have much toomuch at stake to risk everything to recover a single debt. It isbut a poor business indeed, whose solvency depends on theperformance of a single account, although, to be sure, suchsingle-client businesses do exist and, undoubtedly a ruinedtradesman has from time to time dispatched the perceived cause ofhis ruin in a fit of pique - if that is not too mild a word. Inthe normal case "legitimate" businessmen do not conducttheir affairs in the presence of children, upon whom they wish toimpose the delusion that not all decency in the world has beendispensed with in the life-and-death struggle for wealth andpower exemplified by our ever and abiding mercantile economy.'Nuff said. MURDERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BATTLE FOR MARKET SHAREAs a Common Feature in the Conduct of All Business I believe thebattles for market share among the robber barons are sufficientlywell documented that no one need doubt that, if you did not sellyour upstart gas station to Standard Oil at the price theysuggested, it would be blown sky high regardless of who got hurt.In the "old" days, i.e., the days of John D.Rockefeller, who has living great-grandchildren if not livinggrandchildren, the establishment got established by playinghardball - no less hard than the drive-by shootings in the'hood'. If these were the old days, we might not expect to seethe violence surrounding the drug trade go down just because drugtraffickers were made "legit" by virtue of legislativefiat. But, these are not the "old days". As a VanishingTradition Displaced by Still More Insidious Methods That HappilyVisit Most of the Concomitant Misery Upon People Who Are of NoAccount, i.e., Not "Our" Type of People The above titleis an example of irony in its most bitter form. The very"highest" class of people in our country, the realplutocracy, do not in general tolerate competition from"upstarts". If a large drug company were manufacturingcocaine for the mass market and I should attempt to enter themarket by selling a purer, cleaner product by mail-order throughmy web site on the internet at no profit but at a lower cost thanthe big company, the big company would turn its lawyers on melike a pack of killer dogs. They might try to get me on"look-alike" charges; they might try to dig upsomething in my past that could be used against me; they mighttry to get me kicked off the internet; and I can't imagine whatelse they might do; but, and this is most important, theyprobably would not have me murdered like they used to do in theold days. Thus, violence associated with the struggle for marketshare would take a different form from the violence in theneighborhoods between rival street gangs who wish to sell"crack" in a city park. Marketing in general andAdvertising in Particular It is probably safe to say that allmarketers practice fraud to some extent and that everyadvertisement at the mass market level (not a child advertisingfor homes for some of his cat's kittens) is deceptive if it isnot in such incredibly bad taste that young children raised ontelevision can no longer tell the difference between fine art andmeaningless garbage. Conspiracies and Monopolies In a normalized,legal drug market, the people must take precautions againstconspiracies of all types, including total monopolies. But, drugproduction is not such an arcane art that people cannot manage tocarry it forward in their garages and basements even if they areproducing effectively for themselves alone. The danger ofindustrial monopolies is a political problem or, as the Unabomberwould put it, an industrial problem. Frankly, I don't see thedifference. People who get stoned are guaranteed to make betterpolitical decisions than those who don't, which is yet anotherpoint for legalization, which should reduce the violence normallyassociated with the formation and destruction of conspiracies andmonopolies. OVERDOSES, SUBSTITUTED CHEMICALS, IMPURITIES, ANDUNEXPECTED EFFECTS We must demand high-quality drugs, carefullyand truthfully labeled. This can be done, in the beginning by agovernment bureau; but, as the profit motive disappears,government regulation will gradually become unnecessary, as whowould perpetrate evil for no advantage to himself when therewards of virtue for its own sake are right before his eyes.Thus, most of the deaths caused by drugs will be eliminated byavoiding (i) overdoses that occur because the user is used toweak dope and accidentally gets some that has not been cut verymuch - either intentionally or by accident, (ii) drugs containingharmful impurities (information on how to produce high-qualitydrugs will be widely disseminated without governmentinterference), and (iii) drugs will not be mislabeled - neitherintentionally to defraud the consumer nor accidentally throughcarelessness and/or ignorance. These are the most important waysin which the laws against drugs kill. CRIMES OF PASSION OF WHICHPEOPLE WHO DON'T TAKE DRUGS ARE INCAPABLE For Those Who BelieveSuch Crimes Exist If a person takes a drug that enables him toexperience deep passion of which he is not capable otherwise, heis nowise more culpable than a naturally deeply passionate personwho exhibits the same behavior. The test of whether his behaviorqualifies as passion is the observation of the person on theidentical dosage of the identical drug but not exhibiting thepassion. If such a time comes, we know that the passion was notcaused by the drug but, rather, was triggered by an insult, asexual provocation, or some other external stimulus. The drug,then, merely permits an inhibited person to experience the depthof feeling that is his due as a sentient being and a child of God- a feeling that is experienced normally under the samecircumstances by a natural person. The tragedy of a sick societythat kills natural impulses in men and women is not something forwhich a person may be punished if he merely discards the bindingneurosis by means of a conscious shock. The man who is capable ofdeep feeling and correspondingly violent action is healthier thanthe man who is incapable of feeling deeply and takes no steps tofree himself from the shackles imposed by an insane society. Thisanalysis can be applied to nearly every form of violent crime.The criminal bears less guilt than all but the most spiritual ofsouls - actually the truly enlightened who can transcend theworld completely and must be a rare species indeed. But, theenlightenment of the spiritual sage is no substitute for thepolitical change needed to make society rational and just, suchthat people who are truly alive needn't be bound and gagged likeanimals by the oppressors and their willing dupes, who, ofcourse, are victims as well. Conservatives will recognize this asthe typical liberal notion that society is at fault for thebehavior of criminals. It is stated here without reservations,qualification, or, needless to say, apologies of any kind. It isthe plain truth and easy to prove, as I have done in Chapter 4 ofReference 1, my large work in progress, of which the first part,which includes Chapter 4, is available from the American PolicyInstitute, Inc. The Myth of Reefer Madness and its ContemporaryCounterparts As stated in my rebuttal of the DEA argument,drug-induced crime is largely a myth. The DEA has no case here.The constitutional rights of (otherwise) law abiding citizens maynot be denied due to the behavior of a few exceptional people whowould probably commit crimes with or without drugs. Noscientifically verified mechanistic link has been establishedbetween taking drugs and committing crimes. No such link may beas sumed until a valid scientific experiment proves itsexistence. No such experiment has been performed. Always drugsare placed in a singularly disadvantageous position, thusensuring the results desired by the biased pseudo-scientists. (Atrue scientist must be absolutely fair if not completelydisinterested. It is practically impossible to find adisinterested scientist and, if he could be found, who would fundhis research?) The above is merely a repetition of more completestatements made earlier. DEATHS DUE TO PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTMythical Impairment Prohibitionists are fond of citing studiesthat demonstrate how inept we become when we take drugs. Thesestudies are normally conducted by people whose funding comes fromthose with a vested interest in positive results, i.e., showingthat impairment does indeed exist. By definition, these are notscientific studies as scientific studies are performed bydisinterested people who are just as willing to be proved wrongas right, nay, more willing - as the falsification of ascientific hypothesis is more likely to lead to new andinteresting results than a corroboration, e.g., Michelson-Morley.In a sense, every experiment is designed to prove a hypothesisfalse. But, those who accept funding from "interested"parties are already tainted and we should discount their findingsone hundred percent. (Personally, I advocate spitting in theirfaces and cutting them dead in public - "cutting", thatis, in the old-fashioned sense of high-class snobbery. Normally,I am as egalitarian as the next chap; but, in the case of thosewho drag our noblest institutions in the mud, I am willing tomake an exception - with the greatest of regrets, of course.) Letme give an example (from the main text) provided by the DrugEnforcement Agency: The last statement in the (DEA) paragraphunder consideration is just plain ludicrous on the face of it.That's why we know these drug warriors are plain old-fashionedliars - desperately trying to hold on to their lucrative (verylucrative, I opine) jobs that are not and never were needed. Canyou say parasite? Here's the statement: "Furthermore, astudy conducted by Stanford University found that twenty-fourhours after smoking one joint, pilots could not safely land aplane." The reference is the Drug Awareness InformationNewsletter, undoubtedly another bunch of liars, but certainly nota reviewed scientific journal. Now, after making a sensationalclaim like this, why wouldn't they give us a reference to theactual study? Twenty-four hours after smoking a joint, hardlyanyone can distinguish a difference from the way he felt beforehe smoked the joint. Given this indisputable everyday fact, whyshould we ever get in a plane knowing that the pilot is unable todiscern by feelings alone whether he is capable of landing it?How did they get permission to carry out this test legally? Whowould carry it out illegally? I know the president of Stanfordmight divert research funds to luxuries for his personal use, butillegally fly planes ... ? Genuine Impairment Of all the drugs,that which impairs physical and mental faculties to the maximumextent possible is, of course, alcohol, which is not underdiscussion. Average doses of a few drugs can really get thesubject whacked - notably Quaaludes, PCP, and most barbituratesunder fairly common circumstances if the subject be not confinedto bed. In the very first place, suppose that the menu ofavailable drugs contain the entire pharmacopoeia. My claim isthat the vast majority of users of these drugs will choose otherdrugs. (I can't imagine anyone choosing phenobarbital when heroinis available; heroin does not cause impairment in the greatpreponderance of cases - quite the contrary.) For the very fewwho do not choose better drugs, I give you the Fletcher Doctrine,which belongs to legal philosophy. The Fletcher Doctrine statesthat, while the person who does the damage due to lack ofself-possession under these drugs is not responsible for hisactions, the person who decided to use those drugs of impairmentis responsible for what his other self may have done. Is thatclear? Responsibility is properly assigned; no one gets away withanything; and, in all probability, no more harm is done than in asociety in which the only legal drug of impairment is alcohol.This should be an extremely rare class of unfortunate incidentswith which we shall have to contend as best we can. It is nothingnew and I don't think we may punish the user of a drug ofimpairment until he causes damage - in keeping with Fletcher.(Don't look now, but all those people who drove cars while theywere drunk and did not do any harm have been improperly contemned- according to this entirely reasonable view.) Conclusion We haveshown that in nearly all cases death would not have occurred ifdrugs were legal and freely available to everyone, provided, ofcourse, that they are of high quality and properly labeled as tostrength, recommended dosage, and with all information necessaryto the user correctly supplied. We have many deaths attributed toalcohol, which is legal, but we claim that alcohol is a very baddrug that no reasonable person ought to prefer when a widevariety of alternative drugs is available. The same commentapplies to many other inferior drugs and may even apply to crackcocaine. Thus, deaths due to drugs should be rare in anormalized, post-legalization society. We are left with an oddcase or two where the Fletcher Doctrine must be applied, but wehave satisfied our promise to prove the statement in the title;namely, the laws against drugs and the war on drugs rather thanthe use of drugs per se are responsible for most (almost all)deaths associated with drugs. Finally, although it is easy todesign a fair scientific experiment to test all of theseobservations, such an experiment cannot be performed until drugsare legal and normal and all of the stigma of drug taking hasdisappeared, at which time we shall have achieved our objectiveand the drug problem will be just another shameful chapter inhuman history.

Wayburn, PhD,Executive Director TELEPHONE SURVEYS These share all of the difficulties of othersurveys besides being an incredible imposition upon the personwho is called. How does the surveyist know that the respondent isnot an insomniac who has gotten to sleep after three days oftorture followed by a remedy that has a window of opportunity toact of five minutes, say, after which arousal means moreinsomnia! How does the surveyist know that the respondent (theperson answering the call) is not the type of person who cannotresist answering his phone because each call may be the goldenopportunity that knocks but once (or because of a compulsivecuriosity about who is calling him); so, even though he is on thepoint of the greatest orgasm of his life, he stops everything andpicks up the devil's invention, the telephone! (Sometimes I thinkthe devil invented the computer too, and I am a computer expert.But, this is only a metaphor.) Stephen Klineberg, who conductsthe Houston Area Survey out of the "prestigious" RiceUniversity, calls numbers at random, so even those with unlistednumbers are not spared. All of this is reprehensible behavior.But, don't worry, they'll get theirs. OTHER SURVEYS, PARTICULARLY MAIL SURVEYS These are usually worse than worthless besidesthe trouble they cause. Of course, only idiots answer them, sothe opinions reflect those of the stupidest people in society, ofwhich the surveyist should be aware. In general (I mean withoutexception), they are invalid for the purposes for which theypretend to be intended. Usually, however, the last question is"Will you send us money?", so we understand their truepurpose. They are just another disgusting sales gimmick. Let me illustrate with a survey I received fromthe Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) only today. Basically, I favortheir cause, although they are extremely conservative in theirdemands and have no philosophy worth mentioning. Presumably,their real purpose is to make their leaders famous. (In America,you are famous or you are no one.) Question 1. Some people believethat heroin and marijuana should be available to citizenssuffering from painful and often terminal diseases. Shoulddoctors be allowed to prescribe such drugs in treating the painand suffering of cancer, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis and otherdiseases? Yes. Sick people deserve to have whatever medicine isavailable. No. Allowing sick people to have these drugs sends thewrong message to the general public. Commentary. If I answer yes, it means Iaccept the medical monopoly on the distribution of drugs. I can'tanswer no; that would be unconscionable. Question 2. The world honors the UnitedStates as a country that respects its citizens and their rightsof privacy. Some people perceive that the search, seizure andtesting for drugs is undermining this American tradition. Do youagree? Yes. The individual rights of our citizens are our mostimportant priority. No. Drugs are so dangerous we may need to sacrificesome of our rights. Commentary. I could answer with a yes;however, a yes seems to indicate that I agree that the world doesindeed honor the U.S. as a country that respects etc. First, theworld does not honor; and, second, this is not a country thatrespects ... But, suppose I were concerned about right-wingmilitias and I approved of the BATF raids on their headquarters.This is not the case, but suppose it were. I don't want just notto be searched for drugs, I want equal rights for drug users - inemployment, housing, education, ... everything AND copiousreparations for the suffering I've had to endure because of thesedraconian, immoral, and irrational laws. Question 3. We spend over $20 billioneach year on drug law enforcement - over two-thirds of the totaldrug control budget. Should other methods such as treatmentprograms and drug education be allocated a higher percentage ofthat budget? Yes. Our tax money would be more effectively spentfunding treatment and prevention programs. No. We should continue funding punitive measures ofdrug enforcement and build more jails. Commentary. If I answer yes, I indicateapproval of treatment and prevention programs, which I thoroughlydiscredited, along with some others, at the 1990 Drug PolicyFoundation. (Nevertheless, the foundation dishonestly persists inits invalid policies - regardless of the outcome of the debatesat that meeting. The DPF has no intellectual integrity.) If Ianswer no, I appear to support law enforcement, and I don't evenapprove of the enforcement of the law against murder! Infact, I know who killed one of my best friends and the policewill never find out from me. Never, but never, go to the police.If you must, handle it yourself. Question 4. According to the Centers forDisease Control, one-third of all AIDS cases started at the pointof a contaminated syringe shared between drug users. Should wetake action to prevent the spread of this deadly disease byallowing IV drug users to exchange used syringes for sterile onesat approved outlets? Yes. Preventing the spread of AIDS is more importantthan a policy of zero drug tolerance of drug users. No. Providing IV drug users with sterile syringes sendsthe wrong message. Commentary. If I answer yes, I appear toapprove of control of some kind over the sale of syringes, whichI don't. The no answer is ridiculous and extremely cruel. Infact, the "wrong" answers are purposely exaggerated tomake the "sucker" more willing to answer the crucialseventh question "right". Question 5. Drug-related theft, violenceand turf wars bring danger to our streets and harm many innocentpeople, including our children. How do you think we should dealwith this growing problem? By taking the profits away through thedecriminalization or legalization of some or all drugs. By being tougher with enforcement and doing whatever ittakes to get drugs out of our country. By developing new methods of control, education andtreatment. Commentary. All three answers areunacceptable. If you can sell anything for profit, you can selldrugs. Actually, though, it's immoral to sell anything or, forthat matter, to accept a return for anything one does, gives, orsays, but one has to understand my entire philosophy tounderstand that. Question 6. The most important policyfor the Drug Policy Foundation to work towards is (check one): Making clean needles available to prevent the spread ofAIDS and other blood-borne diseases. Making drugs like marijuana and opiates available tothe seriously ill. Decriminalizing drug use. Protecting individual rights of Americans. Commentary. None of the above. The DPFshould adopt my policies for drug reform, which includes workingto eliminate capitalism and the profit motive and overthrowingthe government. Anything less is like pissing in the wind. Question 7. Will you support the DrugPolicy Foundation's efforts to mobilize the American people andthe Federal government to examine alternative solutions to thedrug crisis? Yes. Enclosed is my tax-deductible contribution of: $200 $150 $100 $75 $50* $35 $25 _______Other (Please make your check payable to The DrugPolicy Foundation.) No. I can't give my support to DPF at this time.However, I am completing my 1995 Drug Policy Survey and haveenclosed a gift of $12.50 to help with the processing. Commentary. What about the possibilityof sending what I can afford to send: a sincere criticism of theDPF's policy. Why would not this be worth a fortune to a personwho wishes not to persist in error! An honest person would stateat the outset that this is an appeal for money, presumably tomake Arnold Trebach and Kevin Zeese as famous as they can arrangeto become. It's like the joke about the carpenter who wasinformed about a good deed done by another carpenter. "If hedid it," quoth the first carpenter, "he did it to gethis name up." I am the outstanding thinker in drug policy ofwhom I am aware and I read the two proceedings of the DPFsymposia that I attended from cover to cover. (I don't say thisout of egotism; it's a plain statement of fact.) Yet, I havenever received any recognition from Arnold, Kevin, or anyone inthe DPF. They are too busy looking out for themselves. Meanwhile,mediocre individuals receive awards because the DPF gains morefrom giving the award than the recipient does from getting it.Don't worry, I don't bother with that. I don't accept awards. Ihave written a short essay proving conclusively that they areharmful and a significant part of THE problem and, therefore, asignificant part of the drug problem. MARGIN OF ERROR Typically, when the results of one of thesesurveys is published, it comes with a margin of error. Frankly, Idon't know how this calculation is made - perhaps by partitioningthe data. The point is that the margin of error could be 100%because everyone may give Answer A when they really mean AnswerB. It cannot be known how effective these polls are and my guessis that they are considerably over-rated. In any case, they are apublic nuisance with few if any redeeming features in the vastmajority of cases. Moreover, I do not consider surveying to be aqualified scholarly endeavor. In particular, college professorsshould not be able to get away with calling it research.

Wayburn, PhD, Executive Director American Policy Institute, Inc. 2638 Yorktown Apt.294 Houston, TX 77056-4873 TWayburn@aol.com IN WHICH I SAY NOT AT ALL NICE THINGS ABOUT MR. TYRRELL ANDFIND NO FAULT WITH MYSELF "No to Drug Legalization" by R.Emmett Tyrrell, Junior, is a short article that appeared in the AmericanSpectator. It does not have much substance and, in addition,when it raises a point that needs to be proved, it refersgenerally to what someone else has said. This is the weakest formof argument. If a point is needed for the author's thesis, hemight have the courtesy to prove it rather than send the readeroff to yet another author, whose work may be troublesome toobtain. However, the contentions are readily disproved or shownto be irrelevant regardless of the arguments that appearelsewhere in their defense. It is my job, then, to show that thisauthor has no case. On the other hand, my drug policy ispresented elsewhere and, since I am not compelled to proveanything (merely disprove or discredit), a single literaturecitation should satisfy the reader that I really have a positionon this subject that, by the way, fills the vacuum left by Mr.Tyrrell rather nicely. Thus, I am really a creator primarily anda destroyer only secondarily and then only in a very minorcapacity, as Mr. Tyrrell has not provided much of an edifice forthe wrecking ball. IN WHICH I ALLOW MR. TYRRELL TO HANG HIMSELF Tyrrell's argument, which I must assume is aweak attempt at humor or, at least, jocularity, hinges on ahandful of statements that are either patently false, equivocal,or irrelevant. I shall employ these statements as secondarytitles. Drugs kill and enthrall. The impression that Mr. Tyrrell wishes tocreate is that drugs are lethal poison. Why, then, are they neverused to kill rats, insects, or ill-tempered wives? If the State,itself, is doing the killing, the excessive cost due toillegality would not obtain; nevertheless, illegal drugs are notemployed. If cocaine and heroin were lethal poisons, we wouldhave no addicts since users would expire before they becameaddicted. While it is true that one can ingest enough of nearlyanything, even if it recognized as an essential nutrient, e.g.,vitamin , to cause death. The primary function of drugs isnot to kill, but to enhance joy, relieve pain, alleviatediscomfort, and to create altered states of consciousness, etc..Death comes, in most cases, when the substance ingested is notthe substance expected or when the dosage is drasticallydifferent from the dosage expected. These are accidents that donot occur with legal drugs except in a few cases where the legaldrug is much more dangerous than the common favorite illegaldrugs most of which have been part of our culture for thousandsof years and with which we have vast experience. This is animportant point, namely, that cocaine, heroin, marijuana, andeven the relatively modern amphetamines are safer than many newlegal pharmaceuticals in proportion to our greater experiencewith them, provided, of course, that we get what we expect toget, a circumstance that we demand along with legalization. Mr. Tyrrell employs the term enthrallsequivocally. Since we are enthralled by drugs as we would be by agreat love, it is easy to agree that these wonderful, miraculous,divine drugs of antiquity have lost none of their charm with age.It is as though our beloved were snatched from our arms when theword is suddenly used to connote slavery, which we detest. We areno more enslaved by our favorite drugs than we are by ourfavorite foods - or, to bring home the sharp sword of truth, farless than the average employed American is enslaved by his job.The average drug user is free compared to the average corporateemployee. This is the beauty of Jack Nicholson's speech in thepot smoking scene in the film Easy Rider when he tells thebikers that the townspeople fear them because they representfreedom. The druggies of the Beat Generation and subsequentlyhave been symbolic of man's quest for freedom. From among us comethe free spirits of the land. Only the oppressor's iron yoke canbow the heads of those who dare to tread the paths of theliberated criminal saints of the free-wheeling drug culture. Thewhole world knows this is true. It is not as though a drug-free society takesthe fun out of life. Druggies are about as amusing as cadavers. To take the last first, people don't take drugsto amuse squares. As for the first, a drug-free America wouldn'tbe worth living in. Not only would it take the fun out of lifefor artists and other sensitive people, it would destroy nearlyeverything else worth living for including closeness to thetranscendent - whether it's called God or nothing at all. Wheredo these prudes and puritanical control freaks get the idea thatpeople take drugs exclusively, or even predominantly, for fun?Mr. Tyrrell, once and for all, don't knock it until you try it.And, by the way, stay out of my face. I am not bothering you orinterfering with your pursuit of happiness; however insane,ridiculous, and misguided your recreational activities seem to befrom where I sit? For all I care, you can dress up in babyclothes and have your maiden aunt push you around Central Park ina perambulator. I won't call the cops. You strike me as the sortof man who may have played golf. As much as I despise people fortaking so much space that should be available to children andwildlife, I won't take it away from you until someone has noplace at all, be it man or beast. Drugs are indulged in solely to escape fromreality. How would you know? Drugs are "indulgedin" to paint pictures, write books, poems, and, yes, essays.To play music, to have sex, to enjoy the company of one's friendswithout a bunch of puritanical, middle-class hang-ups. To getcloser to God. And for more reasons than can be known in aphilosophy so pitifully tiny that it can be wedged into so narrowa mind. Honestly, Emmett, you say the dumbest things. How many have left in their trail happy,elegant works of art? (A rhetorical question asked without havingobserved an artist at work - presumably.) Let me turn that around. Who has not used drugsand left behind anything worth doing? It's not that every druguser has created great works of art. Many, if not most, havetried, but few succeed. However, with very few exceptions, thoselucky, bless�d ones who have left behind "elegant works ofart" have used drugs. I'll give you one exception: GeorgeBernard Shaw. At least he claims not to have used drugs, but Iremain unconvinced. Of the known drug-using artists, the list islong. Is there any doubt? The arts belong to drug users. Not justjazz musicians. Consider all the writers, poets, painters whohave spoken of their drug use: Coleridge, Poe, etc. Where doesanyone get the temerity to challenge the contributions of drugusers to art! Ah, if only drug users went on strike, art wouldcease and the souls of these Philistines who persecute us woulddry up like the wingsof insects caught in our divine flame. But, scientists, too, have found inspiration indrugs. Consider William Rowan Hamilton, without whom quantummechanics could not have arisen in quite the same way. RichardFeynman admitted using drugs. The list is long and records thenames of some of the brightest stars. I will not "out"living scientists despite what I know. Many of us would beamazed. Those who traffic in drugs are killers. This is an absurd statement on the face of it.Not, that no one who trafficked in drugs has been a killer; but,generally, the killing has been incidental to the illegality. Whois worse (a) a drug dealer who delivers on request a substance toanother man who wishes to ingest it or (b) a chief executive of achemical company who forces everyone in the neighborhood of hisplant to ingest poisonous chemical wastes whether they wish to ornot! The flight from responsibility of drug usersendangers the free society. This is a matter of calling the victim theculprit. The heads of the multi-national corporations are thetrue danger to society. And, if you will pardon me for speakingthe truth, capitalism (American style) is the real danger as itreduces 90% or more of our population to third-world conditionsin its insatiable greed, as it starves the third world to deathand makes armed conflict inevitable. You, sir, are the danger toa far-from-free society. In many areas drugs are so freely availablethey might as well be legal. No sir, the quality is horrible; the expense ispreposterous; and the danger from the police is terrifying. No,no, and no. You and other evil, wicked, vicious authoritariansare winning the war against drug users and dealers, but you willnever stop the flow of drugs. All you can do is increase themisery of the wretched who fall into your clutches. This includesthat middle-class stock-broker who does heroin on the weekend outon Long Island. He, too, knows that he hasn't much of a future tolive for. Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow we die. But, atleast, his white, middle-class crumbs from the table will buy himdecent drugs. The worst quality drugs go to the ghetto. Ofcourse. The white middle class enjoys a higher quality ofdespair. How gratifying. "But, it is a far, far better thingI do than - what I normally do during the week." Our high prison population is composed ofbrutes who have committed heinous acts and are more likely tocommit such acts on drugs. The evidence shows otherwise. I'll go all theway: the people in prison are the only ones left who can manifesta little honor and refuse to bow to the ruling rich and theirloathsome toadies. The rich steal, but they don't rob. That'sbecause they are afraid of man but not afraid of God. Thecriminal may not - I said may not - be afraid of God , buthe's not afraid of man either. The corporate bums are beneath therespect of reptiles. I won't prove this, but you haven't provedanything either. You had better get your philosophy together andtell us what makes a good society and what makes a bad society. Ireally don't believe you know. But, the next quote from Tyrrellgives us a hint of his abiding faith in the essential equality ofall men (and women?). ...put inferior people on the shelf and out ofsociety. I suppose Poe, Coleridge, Charlie Parker, LouisArmstrong, William Rowan Hamilton, Richard Feynman, and themillions of others who used drugs were inferior to you. You arean exemplary man - a man of lies, deception, of light-hearted andcruel intolerance, a trifler in matters of life and death, awould-be inquisitor, a man of no depth or parts. What kind of mancould have written your little auto-da f�? In your lastparagraph you have said precisely nothing. Is this your idea ofhumor? We are not amused.

Voth, MD, of Drug Watch International 5/27/96 How this document got here: I was in some private discussions with Dr. Voth, who is avehement opponent of the legalization of marijuana. In the courseof our discussion I pointed to the research which I already haveon this website and asked Dr. Voth to supply any research orreferences which would support his point of view. It took a lotof pestering, but finally Dr. Voth submitted the followingbibliography on marijuana. What is most curious about this bibliography is that much ofit does not support Dr. Voth's point of view. It honestly makesme wonder if he has read the books on his own list. I havespecifically asked him about a few of the books listed here, suchas the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs,but he has never given any indication that he has read them. IfDr. Voth will respond with a list of the ones he claims to haveread, I will post that, too. Statistics: Centrale Recherche Informatie 1993 report, CriminalInvestigation Department. Rotterdam 1993.

Structure This manual is divided into chapters, each chapter addressinga different argument used by the "legalizers." Forexample, Chapter One addresses the argument that legalizing drugswould reduce the addiction rate; Chapter Two addresses the impactthat legalizing drugs would have on the crime rate. Furthermore,each chapter is divided into two parts. The first part, termedthe "Discussion" section, briefly states thelegalizers' arguments and then provides an in-depth analysis ofhow to defeat them. The second part of each chapter is termed the "SummarySheet" section. The Summary Sheet section is designed forpeople who for whatever reason do not have time to read theDiscussion section - for example, those people who actually areinvolved in a debate at that moment. The Summary Sheet section isdivided into two columns, the first titled "If TheySay," and the second called "Then You Say." TheSummary Sheet section basically iterates the factual highlightsof the Discussion section in a format that is easy to "justpick up and use." In both the Discussion and the SummarySheet sections, relevant facts will be footnoted or otherwisecited. This is so that if anyone asks you where you got yourinformation, you will be able to tell them immediately. Appendix One suggests a structured format for an actualpublic debate. Following these rules will prevent the debate fromdisintegrating into a shouting match and a forum for"speeches" from the audience. Finally, an extensive bibliography is provided for yourconvenience should you choose to pursue additional reading. 1 For purposes of this manual, "legalization" meansa policy whereby selling and using drugs is legal."Decriminalization" means a policy whereby penaltiesfor breaking the drug laws are lessened and/or the drug laws arerestricted in scope. See Ralph A. Weisheit and Katherine Johnson,"'Exploring the Dimensions of Support for Decriminalizationof Drugs," Journal of Drug Issues, Winter 1992. That is, ifheroin were legalized, it would be legal to sell or use it. Ifheroin were decriminalized, it technically would be illegal touse it, but (for instance) the penalty for its use would be a $10fine. Another example of decriminalization would be allowing theuse of heroin as a common pain killer in hospitals. Introductory Pointers Before getting to the substance of the legalization debateitself, here are three suggestions for use when debating thelegalizers. 1. Right to expect benefits. As with anypolicy, you have a right to demand that the legalizers prove thatthe benefits of their proposal outweigh its costs. 2. Right to specificity. As with any policy,you have a right to demand that the legalizers provide a specificproposal which to debate. One cannot talk about policy in theabstract. For example, let's say that you were debating whetherthe federal government should cut spending - you have to havesome idea of what is to be cut, how much is to be cut, when it isgoing to be cut, etc. With regard to the legalization debate, youshould ask your opponent these questions at the beginning ofthe debate: What drugs are we talking about? Are they advocating legalization or decriminalization? Are there limitations on who can use these drugs - what about children, pregnant women, prison inmates, police, members of the military, people who drive buses or fly planes, etc.? Are there limitations on the quantity or potency of drugs that the individual can use? Would an unlimited supply of drugs be made available to the habitual users or drug addicts? Who will create, market, and sell the drugs? How much will the drugs cost? Will the drugs be taxed, and if so, at what rate? Will drug addiction be able to be used as a defense in civil or criminal trials? Make sure that your opponent answers these questions early!After all, it is only fair that you know what you are debatingbefore you begin the debate. 3. Right to sources of information. You have a rightto ask the legalizers the source of their data. By the sametoken, they have the right to ask the same of you (and that's whythis manual is complete with footnotes). Bearing these pointers in mind, we begin with an analysis oflegalization and addiction rates.

Their Argument Proponents of drug legalization argue that legalizing drugswould decrease addiction rates for two reasons. First, theymaintain, people use drugs because they are illegal - thatis, people get a thrill breaking a social taboo. Legalize drugsand the incentive to take them will go away. Second, proponentsof legalization argue that if drugs were legalized, we couldspend the money that we presently spend on the criminal justicesystem on treatment of addicts.2 II. Our Argument Before addressing the particular merits of the legalizationdebate, it is useful to describe just what is an addiction.Addictions are either physical or psychological. Physicaladdiction occurs when the body becomes dependent upon chemicalsor drugs not normally found in the human body and requires suchchemicals in order to sustain basic bodily functions. Take, forinstance, cocaine addiction. Cocaine alters the means by whichbrain cells communicate with one another. Usually, nerve cells(neurons) send signals to one another through chemicalneurotransmitters such as dopamine. Dopamine flows from oneneuron to the other, delivers its message, and returns to theoriginal neuron. Cocaine, however, blocks the dopamine fromreturning to the first cell, and the first cell just keeps firingaway. This explains why cocaine produces such feelings ofpleasure; for lack of a better description, cocaine locks all ofthe user's neurons into an "On" position. The problemoccurs when all of the cocaine has been metabolized by the body.As Professor James Q. Wilson explains, "[w]hen theexaggerated high produced by cocaine-influenced dopamine finallyends, the brain cells may (in ways that are still a matter ofdispute) suffer from an extreme lack of dopamine, thereby makingthe individual unable to experience any pleasure at all."3This is a very simplified model, of course, and different drugsaffect the body in different ways, but a simple fact remains -physical addiction is biochemical in nature and is independent ofsocial, political, or psychological causes. There is another type of addiction, however, that beingpsychological addiction. Unlike physical addiction, whichbasically is a medical condition, psychological addiction occurswhen the individual user feels or is of the opinion that drugsare necessary for his or her life. This is not to suggest thatpsychological addiction is easily dismissed; indeed it can have aprofound influence on how addicts live their lives. Suchespecially is the case when addicts live in a culture thatcontinually reinforces the desirability or necessity of drug use. Let us examine addiction specific to two drugs: cocaine andmarijuana. Although rough, estimates suggest that there arebetween 650,000 and 2.4 million cocaine addicts in the UnitedStates.4 "Cocaine is a much more addictive drug thanalcohol. If cocaine were legally available the number of cocaineabusers would probably rise to...perhaps 20-25million."5Mitchell Rosenthal, President of the Phoenix Housedrug-rehabilitation program states that cheap available drugswould increase addiction; only 10% of drinkers become hooked,while an estimated 75% of regular drug (crack) users could becomeaddicts.6 Scientific studies agree, noting that when givenunlimited access to cocaine, laboratory animals will consumeincreasingly greater amounts until they die.7 That cocaine isharmful to one's health likely will come as a surprise to no one.Dr. Frank H. Gawin, director of stimulant abuse, treatment andresearch at Yale University concludes that cocaine causesdepression, paranoia, and "violent psychoticbehavior."8 What is worse, there is presently no effective,permanent treatment for cocaine addiction.9 Almost everyone would agree that cocaine is a dangerous,addictive drug, but many would be surprised to find that the sameis true of marijuana. Although it is very difficult to determinethe precise number of marijuana users and addicts in the UnitedStates, one fact is clear: marijuana has become much more potentover the last twenty years. Cannabis delta 9tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as "THC," is theactive ingredient in marijuana and other cannabis such ashashish. The THC content in marijuana during the days ofWoodstock was something less than 1%. In 1974, the average THCcontent of illicit marijuana was 0. 36% and by 1984 had increasedto 4.40%.10 In 1992 in Alaska, marijuana was discovered that hada THC content of 29.86%.11 Now stop and think about that for aminute. Today's marijuana may be between thirty to sixty times aspotent as were the joints of the 1960's. This observation gives one pause when we realize that THC isboth dangerous and habit-forming. Marinol, a prescription drugthat is very occasionally used in the treatment of nauseaassociated with chemotherapy, is chemically synthesized THC. Mostpeople are familiar with the information sheets that come withprescription drugs - the pieces of paper that detail theindications and usage of the drug in question, its potentialside-effects, its chemical composition, etc. The informationsheet that comes with Marinol states verbatim, "MARINOL ishighly abusable and can produce both physical and psychologicaldependence .... Patients receiving MARINOL should be closelyobserved."12 The company that produces Marinol goes on toexplain that its THC may cause "changes in mood ...decrements in cognitive performance and memory, a decreasedability to control drives and impulses [and] . . . a full-blownpicture of psychosis (psychotic organic brain syndrome) may occurin patients receiving doses within the lower portion of thetherapeutic range."13 Such warnings should not surprise the scientists who have formany years maintained that the THC contained in marijuana isdangerous. First, in the late 1960's Dr. Robert Heath, thenchairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Neurology at TulaneMedical School, found that marijuana affects brain waves anddestroys brain cells.14 Second, a study conducted by Dr. EthelSassenrath at the University of California at Davis between 1974and 1978 found that THC increased the rate of fetal loss (inutero, fetal death) in monkeys by over 300%, while at the sametime decreasing the birth weights in those babies born alive.15Third, a study by Dr. Susan Dalterio, at the University of Texasfound that marijuana decreased testosterone and impaired sexualdevelopment in male mice.16 Finally, a study by Dr. Albert Munsonfound that injections of THC suppressed the immune systems ofmice and made them 96 times more susceptible to the herpesvirus.17 Dr. Charles R. Schuster, former Director of the NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse said, "The fact that there are over77,000 admissions a year to treatment programs for marijuana useand that annually almost 8,000 persons require emergency hospitalcare for marijuana use is sufficient evidence of the drugsdangerousness"18 Clearly, drugs such as cocaine and marijuana are, bothaddictive and dangerous. The legalizers likely would admit this,but counter by saying that if we legalized them we would haveless of a problem. This is untrue. Recall from above that legalizers claim that people use andbecome addicted to drugs because of the excitement of breakingthe law - it is the fact that drugs are illegal that causespeople to try them. The data disagree. Robert E. Peterson, FormerDeputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania notes, "70% of highschool students in New Jersey and about 60% of the students inCalifornia said that fear of getting in trouble with the lawconstituted a major reason not to use drugs."19 The legalizers' argument that we should legalize drugs andspend the money we now spend on criminal prosecution on treatmentand rehabilitation also fails. Both proponents and opponents oflegalization are in agreement that legalization almost certainlywould decrease the price of drugs as they became more available.However, basic economic theory states that as the price of acommodity declines, demand for the commodity will increase. Butwhereas the reverse usually also is true (increase price anddemand decreases), it is not so with addictive substances. Thatis, drop the price of a gram of cocaine by 50%, and you will seean increase in use as demand for the product increases. Increasethe price of cocaine by 50%, and you will not see an equaldecrease in demand because addicts will pay the price to sustaintheir addictions. In technical economic terms, the demand foraddictive drugs is elastic with respect to price declines, butinelastic with respect to price increases. Expert opinion supports this hypothesis. Dr. Herbert D. Kleberof the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, ColumbiaUniversity, suggests that legalization of cocaine would result ina five- to six-fold increase in cocaine use.20 Dr. Robert DuPont,former director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse agrees,stating that legalization would increase the number of users ofcocaine and marijuana to between fifty and sixty million, and thenumber of heroin users to around ten million.21 Dr. DuPontconcludes that when one takes into account the health effects ofcocaine, heroin, and marijuana, legalization could result inbetween 100,000 and 500,000 drug induced deaths each year.22Further, you cannot legalize cocaine and control the crackepidemic, for users could easily turn the former into the latter. History also supports the fact that legalization wouldincrease addiction rates. When opium was legal in the UnitedStates at the turn of the century, we had proportionately betweentwo and three times the number of addicts than we do presently.23Furthermore, Dr. Richard Schwartz, Professor of Pediatrics atGeorgetown University School of Medicine, notes that Alaska andOregon, the states that traditionally have had the most lenientdrug laws, also have the highest marijuana addiction rates in theUnited States double the national average.24 Finally, foreign countries that have relaxed drug laws haveseen an increase in addiction rates [see Chapter Three]. In short, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana are dangerous andhighly addictive substances. Scholarly opinion, historicalevidence, and common sense suggest that if these drugs arelegalized, then the rates of addiction will skyrocket, leading tomisery and death. 2 See Chapters Two and Four for additional discussion ofwhether legalizing drugs would indeed allow us to shift resourcesfrom criminal prosecution to treatment and rehabilitation. 3 James Q.

Their Argument Proponents of legalization advance two theories as to howlegalization will decrease crime in the United States, and bothare dependent on the assumption that legalization will reduce thecost of drugs to the user. First, because users will not have tospend as much to support their drug habits, fewer will need tocommit crimes such as robbery and burglary to obtain drug money.Second, because the cost of drugs will decrease, so will the drugsellers' profits. Because drugs will no longer be a profitablebusiness, and because addicts will be able to obtain their drugsfrom legal sources, the current black market suppliers of drugs -gangs, foreign cartels, organized criminals, etc.-will fade away. II. Our Argument Before addressing these theories, it is useful to distinguishbetween three types of drug-related crime. As Professor James Q.Wilson notes [t]he illegality of drugs increases crime, partly because someusers turn to crime to pay for their habits, partly because someusers are stimulated by certain drugs (such as crack or PCP) toact more violently or ruthlessly than they otherwise would, andpartly because criminal organizations seeking to control drugsupplies use force to manage their markets.25 For ease of discussion, this author will refer to the crimecaused by people to pay for their habits as"purchase-related," the crime caused by people whileunder the influence of drugs as "drug-induced," and thecrime caused by organized criminal suppliers of drugs as"black market crime." Let us discuss each in turn. A. Purchase-related crime As stated above, legalizers assume that as legalized drugsbecome less expensive, addicts will no longer have to commitcrimes in order to fund their habits. One immediate difficultywith this analysis is that drugs already are exceptionallyinexpensive. For example, a hit of crack costs about five dollarson the streets of Seattle and about three dollars in other majormetropolitan areas.27 Granted, the pharmaceutical cost of cocainesufficient to make a hit of crack is roughly twenty-five cents.28But to the extent that a legal crack supplier likely would haveto meet government regulations or would have to internalize thecosts of taxes placed upon the legalized drug, some analystsquestion whether it is possible to reduce the currentstreet-price of drugs.29 Nonetheless, let us assume that legal drug suppliers couldundersell the black market by offering cocaine for approximatelyfifty cents a dose. What would happen? As discussed at length in Chapter One, addiction rates wouldskyrocket. This fact is almost indisputable, and even theLibertarian supporters of drug legalization admit that "lowprices would encourage use."30 History is very clear on thispoint as well---once cocaine began being marketed in the highpotency/low cost form of crack, addiction rates did increase.31And when addiction rates increase, so does purchase-relatedcrime. As Elliott Currie explains, "[h]igher levels of druguse do go hand in hand with increased crime, especiallyproperty crime."32 So in reality, legalizing drugs would not decreasepurchase-related crime, but would actually increase it.Three reasons explain why this is so. First, if you decrease theprice of an addictive substance, addicts merely will buy more ofthe less expensive product.33 Second, it is not as ifaddicts steal money only to pay for drugs; likely, they stealmoney to meet living expenses such as food, rent, etc. WilliamBennett notes that "[m]aking drugs legal would just be a wayof subsidizing [addicts] habit. They would continue to rob andsteal to pay for food, for clothes, for entertainment."34 Ofcourse, since there are more addicts, there would be more peoplecommitting purchase-related crimes. Third, one must recall thatpurchase-related crime is not directly related to the cost of thedrug, but instead is indirectly related: the prices of drugsaffect the addiction rate, which in turn affects thepurchase-related crime rate. This point perhaps is subtle, butalso is important. Addicts will pay almost any price for drugs.Thus the question becomes not "What is the price ofdrugs," but instead "How many addicts are there?"Because legalized drugs increase addiction rates,purchase-related crime necessarily increases. B. Drug-induced crime As with purchase-related crime, the price of drugs is notdirectly relevant in determining the amount of drug-inducedcrime, except to the extent that the price affects the number ofaddicts. Undoubtedly, drug-induced crime is a significantproblem, One conservative estimate based upon the Bureau ofJustice Statistics study suggests that with regard to local jailinmates, 15.4% of such inmates tested positive for illegal drugsand an additional 12.1 % tested positive for a combination ofillegal drugs and alcohol.35 Another study conducted by theNational Institute of Justice in 1986 found that for twelve majormetropolitan areas, 70% of inmates tested positive for illegaldrugs.36 The N.I.J. study concluded that "[these offendersdid not commit crimes simply to feed their habits. Drugs changedtheir behavior, enabled and encouraged them to act violently andirrationally."37 Again, these results are unsurprising. Drugs such as crackencourage hyperactive violence.38 If you legalize such drugs andthe addiction rate increases, you will have more people walkingaround more often under its influence. It simply is untenable tosuggest that policies such as legalization that increaseaddiction rates could do anything but increase the frequency ofdrug-induced crime. C. Black market crime As mentioned above, legalizers suggest that if you allow drugsto be sold legally, it would drive out the black market, for thelatter only thrives when people cannot obtain goods throughnormal, legal channels. Such analysis seems attractive at first,but a closer look at the facts will prove that it is bothsimplistic and incorrect. So long as there are any restrictions as to what drugs were tobe legalized, who would be able to buy them, what quantities andpotencies were available, etc., a black market would fill theneed. For example, if the legalizers would limit the sale ofdrugs to those people over twenty-one, then the black marketwould target children. This argument is made by David T.Courtwright, who finds potential black markets for "thoseunder twenty-one, or for public-safety officers, or transportworkers, or military personnel, or pregnant women, or prisoners,or probationers, or parolees, or psychotics. . . . "39 Inorder truly to defeat the black market, one not only would haveto allow anyone to buy drugs, but also would have to make allforms of drugs available. William Rasberry explains that"[i]f marijuana and perhaps heroin are legalized, but notcrack cocaine and violence-inducing PCP, the effect on the crimeassociated with drug trafficking would be minimal." Few, ifany, legalizers would be willing completely to legalize all drugsfor all people - but if they refuse to do so, they cannotjustifiably claim to have made a significant impact on blackmarket crime. Another problem with the legalizers' argument is that many ofthem advocate a policy whereby legalized drugs are taxed in orderto raise revenue for other social programs. But again, if youlegalize drugs and tax them, you will have a black market thatcan sell the same drugs less expensively. The same is true if youstamp a tariff on imported drugs, and history shows this to becorrect. Recall that until the early twentieth century, opiatesand other drugs were legal in the United States. Much of theopium consumed by U.S. citizens was imported from China, and" enlightened lawmakers decided to place a tariff on thedrug as a means of raising revenue. For example, between 1866 and1914, the duty on crude opium was 33%; on ready-to-smoke opium itwas 97%.41 Although these tariffs did produce income, they alsocreated a smuggler's paradise that organized crime syndicatessuch as the Chinese tongs quickly filled. Criminals would smuggleopium into the country, not pay the tariff, and make a higherprofit margin on their goods. Interestingly enough, at the peakof the opium tariffs twice as much opium was smuggled into theU.S. as went through legal channels.42 Thus, history proves thatif you place a tariff on imported drugs - be they legal orillegal - black markets will continue to flourish unabated. Let's return to the simple taxation of drugs produced withinthe United States. Again, the equation is simple - tax equalsblack market - and again, history proves it to be true. Taketobacco for instance. Here is a legal commodity that potentiallycan be taxed by both the federal government and any of the stategovernments.43 Unsurprisingly, some states historically have hadhigher cigarette taxes than others. In 1975, smokers in NorthCarolina would pay thirty-six cents a pack whereas New Yorkershad to pay fifty-four cents.44 Organized syndicates tookadvantage of the situation, buying cigarettes in North Carolinaand selling them in New York for a profit-indeed at one point 50%of all the cigarettes sold in New York City were bootleggedproducts controlled by criminal organizations.45 Thus, proponentsof legalized drugs will never be able to stop the black market,because the federal government, even if it wanted to, could notstop state governments from taxing the drugs at different levels. Finally, with regard to the entire black market theories ofthe legalizers, we have to remember the simple fact thatorganized crime is composed of criminals. Query what the Cali orthe Medellin Cartel would do if they discovered that theircocaine was being under priced by a legal manufacturer (let's saya pharmaceutical company like Upjohn). What is the chance thatthe Colombians would say "Oh well, we just cannot compete inthe market. Let's close up shop and take real jobs."Unlikely. Instead, currently entrenched crime syndicates woulduse violence to ensure their place in the market.46 In the aboveexample, the Cali cartel might destroy Upjohn's laboratories. Orit might murder everyone who sits on their Board of Directors. Orit might take the less glamorous, but certainly more traditional,strategy of telling addicts that if they don't buy their cocainefrom the cartel, they will be killed. In short, the belief thatif we legalize drugs then organized crime will run away with itstail between its legs ignores grim reality. In conclusion, drugs produce three types of crime:purchase-related crime, drug-induced crime, and black marketcrime. To the extent that legalizing drugs would make themcheaper - a point on which all sides of the debate agree - itwould create many new addicts and the incidence ofpurchase-related crime and drug-induced crime would increase.Furthermore, if there were any regulations or taxes of anysort placed upon the legalized drugs, U.S. history provesthat the black market crime would continue. Thus, legalizingdrugs not only does not decrease criminal behavior, it almostcertainly would spur its increase. 25 James Q.

Chapter Two Summary Sheet: Crime and Drug Legalization Ifthey say... If drugs were legalized, addicts would no longer have tocommit crimes to pay for their habit. Thenyou say... Drugs are already so cheap that legalization might not drivethe price down any further. Thus, addicts would still have tosteal. ["No Magic Bullet: A Look at Drug Legalization,"U.S. Dept. of Justice, D.E.A. Demand Reduction Section Positionpaper]. But assuming that legalization would cut the price of drugs,low prices encourage use and addiction. [Timothy Radonich,"Controlling drugs through regulation," NorthwestLibertarian, September 1990.] As addiction rates increased, crime, especially propertyCrime, would increase. [Elliott Currie, "Towards a Policy onDrugs," Dissent, Winter 1993]. As the prices of drugs decrease, addicts will buy more; thus,they will still steal in order to spend the same amount on drugs.[Robert E. Peterson, "Stop Legalization of IllegalDrugs," Drug Awareness Information Newsletter, July 1988]. Addicts would still steal in order to afford food, clothes,entertainment, etc. [William Bennett, "Mopping up after thelegalizers: What the 'intellectual' chorus fails to tellyou," The Washington Times, December 15, 1989]. Ifthey say... If drugs were legalized, drug- induced crime would decrease. Thenyou say... Drug use encourages irrational and criminal behavior. Studiesindicate that as many as 70% of inmates were on illegal drugswhen arrested.

November 1992;Peter Bensinger, "Arguments Against Legalizing Drugs,"Drug Abuse Update, September 1988]. Recent U.S. experience with crack cocaine clearly proves thatas drugs become cheaper, violent crime increases. [WilliamBennett, "Mopping up after the legalizers: What the'intellectual' chorus fails to tell you," The WashingtonTimes, December 15, 1989]. As legalization of drugs increases the addiction rate [seeChapter One], then we would have more people under the influenceof drugs more often. Ifthey say... Legalizing drugs would end the crime caused by black marketsand organized syndicates. Thenyou say... If there are any restrictions placed upon who may use legaldrugs, such as minors, pregnant women, police, militarypersonnel, pilots, prisoners, parolees, or psychotics, a blackmarket would rise up to fill the niche. (David T.Courtwright,"Should We Legalize Drugs? HistoryAnswers," American Heritage, February/March 1993]. In order to begin to stop the black market, you would have tolegalize crack and PCP. [William Rasberry, "LegalizingDrugs: Let's Get Specific," The Washington Post, November 1,1989]. U.S. history proves that if you attempt to levy tariffs onimported legal drugs, a black market will result due tosmuggling. Such was the case in the early twentieth century whenChinese crime syndicates smuggled opium into the U.S. so as toavoid tariffs. [David T. Courtwright, "Should We LegalizeDrugs? History Answers," American Heritage, February/March1993]. If you tax the legal drugs at all, a black market will result.This is proven by U.S. history, where organized crime wouldsmuggle cigarettes from states with low tobacco taxes into thosewith high tobacco taxes, thus making a profit [Courtwright,citation above]. Organized crime would use violence against legal suppliers inorder to ensure its market share. Criminals would not play by therules. [Christopher Collins and Susan Collins, "WhatSavings?"

Their Argument Proponents of legalization suggest that the experiences ofcountries such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Switzerlandprove the efficacy of legalizing or decriminalizing various typesof illegal drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. Theymaintain that because such drugs are legal, these countries havefewer addicts and less drug-related crime. II. Our Argument The statements of the legalizers here are empirically untrue.As we discuss each country in turn, it will be shown thatlegalization did not work in any of them. A. Great Britain With the report of a government commission known as the BrainCommittee of 1964, England instituted a policy whereby doctorscould prescribe heroin so long as they followed certain treatmentcriteria.47 Previously in England, doctors could prescribe heroinmuch like any other opiate (such as morphine). This allowed a fewunscrupulous doctors to sell ungodly amounts of heroin to membersof the black market.48 Consequently, it was believed that ifheroin were offered at medical clinics according to stringentrules and regulations, addicts would come to these clinics toseek treatment and eventually would overcome their habit. As of 1983, however, England began to phase out these programsof clinically supplied heroin in favor of methadone treatment.49Why? First, according to the reputable British physician journal Lancet,the number of addicts increased 100% between 1970 and 1980.50 Adisproportionate number of these new addicts were between theages of sixteen and seventeen.51 Second, only twenty percent ofall of the addicts in England belonged to the clinicalprograms.52 At first blush, this fact seems strange - why wouldaddicts choose not to participate in a program wherein they getfree methadone? The answer probably lies in the fact thatmethadone does not produce the high that heroin does. Also,addicts probably did not care for the mandatory treatment andrehabilitation facets of the clinical programs. Whatever thereason, by 1985 England had 80,000 heroin addicts, the vastmajority of whom wen not in treatment.53 A third reason why England began to abolish its clinicalheroin program was the fact that not only were there few people,in them, but the programs themselves did not work. According tothe British Medical Journal, more addicts left the programbecause of criminal convictions than because of treatment.54Fourth, even with the clinical programs, heroin addicts had adeath rate twenty-six times the average population. Finally, evenwhen the programs were in operation, Scotland Yard had toincrease its narcotics division 100% in order to cope with theincreased crime rate.56 To summarize, the British experience with decriminalizedheroin in the clinical context was a dismal failure. When expertsfrom British Columbia were debating whether to create a similarprogram, they made the following conclusions that are soimportant as to deserve to be quoted at length: While some success is claimed in terms of reducing theincidence of young users, the following findings have also beennoted: 1) The British approach has failed to attract a majority ofaddicts; 2) Many registered addicts continue to turn to illicit sourcesof drugs; 3) Many registered addicts do not decrease their dosage overtime; 4) Many registered addicts continue to be involved in criminalactivity; 5) Many registered addicts are chronically unemployed or donot earn enough to look after themselves; 6) The death rate of registered addicts is much higher thanthat of the general population and may be higher than that ofNorth American addicts; 7) Since 1960, there has been a dramatic increase in theEnglish addict population; 8) The black market for heroin continues to thrive; 9) Law enforcement appears to remain a necessary, costly andcomplex control measure. In view of the above, it is felt that the application of theBritish approach to British Columbia would present seriousdangers.57 B. The Netherlands Proponents of legalization almost certainly would citeAmsterdam as the drug Mecca of the Western world. Anyone may gointo the restaurants in this city and order marijuana and hashishfrom a menu; further, heroin and cocaine have been decriminalizedfor all practical purposes. The police simply leave the usersalone. Consequently, health officials estimate that Amsterdam has7,000 addicts, 20% of whom are foreigners.58 These addicts areresponsible for 80% of all property crime in the city, thusnecessitating that Amsterdam maintain a police presence fargreater than those of cities of comparable size in the UnitedStates.59 The Dutch have not raised one dollar in tax revenue from drugsales, and drug violators account for 50 percent of the Dutchprison population, a higher proportion than in the UnitedStates.60 The Netherlands is the most crime-prone nation inEurope and most drug addicts live on state welfare payments andby committing crimes.61 Nationwide, the number of reported crimesincreased to 1.3 million in 1992 from. 812,000 in 1981.62 Facedwith public disgust at home over soaring drug related crime andpressure from other European Community countries to strengthendrug laws, Dutch authorities are implementing an aggressiveprogram to reduce drug-linked crimes and disturbances and shownew teeth in combatting illegal drug sales.63 Eberhard van derLaan, leader Of the Social Democrats in the Amsterdam CityCouncil says, "People are absolutely fed up with all thetroubles caused by drug addicts - car windows broken, noise,whole streets almost given up to the drug problem."64Legalization advocates claim that marijuana use in Netherlandshas not increased since the laws were liberalized, but the numberof Amsterdam drug cafes rose from 30 to over 300 in one decade.They also fail to note that daily marijuana use by U.S. youth hasdeclined by 75 percent.65 C. Switzerland Much like Amsterdam, Switzerland until recently followed apolicy of decriminalization. Indeed, a city park in the town ofZurich for many years was allowed to be a haven for drug users -police simply would ignore the problem by claiming that it wasbetter to have all the addicts in one place rather than havingthem roam throughout the entire city.66 Unsurprisingly, inFebruary of 1992 Switzerland ended this experiment withdecriminalization after experiencing an unacceptable increase inuse, violence, crime and health costs and consequences.67Specifically, the number of addicts residing at the park (calledPlatzspitz) jumped from a few hundred in 1987 to over 20,000, byearly 1992.68 Approximately 20% of these addicts were foreignerswho came to Zurich to take advantage of the city's lax druglaws.69 In deciding to close the park, city officials cited theincreased incidence of crime and prostitution--as Andres Oehler,a municipal spokesperson stated, "it was felt that thesituation had got out of control in every sense."70 D. Spain Since 1983 in Spain, it has been legal to use, but not sell,cocaine and heroin. Recently, however, Spanish officials have begun a crack-down on drug pushers dueto a dramatic increase in the addiction rate.71 Unsurprisingly,Spain and Italy, which also legalized use of cocaine and heroin,have the highest rates of both drug use and overdose of allEuropean countries.72 E. China Lest we forget the lessons of history, consider that in thelate 1800's, opium was legal in China. By 1900, ninety millionChinese were addicted to the drug, and it took fifty years ofrepressive police measures and rehabilitation to correct theproblem.73 Today, opium and other addictive drugs are illegal.74 F. Japan In the 1950's, Japan was faced with an epidemic of amphetamineuse that created half a million addicts. Through socializationand policies aimed at both reducing supply and demand, thenumber of addicts was decreased to a few thousand within fouryears.75 A heroin epidemic involving thousands of addicts wasdealt with successfully in the 1960's using the same measures. 76 G. Other countries Throughout recent history, numerous other countries haveattempted legalizing or decriminalizing drugs, all meeting withthe same harmful results. In Egypt in the 1920's, an unrestrictedsupply of cocaine and heroin created an epidemic that eventuallyresulted in the strict prosecution of all addicts.77 In Thailandand Iran, countries that traditionally have had cheap andunrestricted sources of narcotics, the addiction rates have beenand continue to be high.78 Finally, the Republic of Singapore hadto resort to strict law enforcement and mandatory rehabilitationin order to overcome a heroin epidemic.79 Given the experiences of countries such as Great Britain,Switzerland, The Netherlands, China, Japan, Spain, Egypt, Iran,and Thailand, it is little wonder why countries thattraditionally have had lenient drug laws are all moving in thedirection of illegalization. Undoubtedly, the danger that druglegalization presents was foremost on the minds of the numerouscountries - the United States included - that signed the SingleConvention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention onPsychotropic Substances of 1971. And such danger also is why theInternational Narcotics Control Board for the United Nationsconcluded in 1992 that "legalization advocates have not yetpresented a sufficiently comprehensive, coherent or viablealternative to the present system of international drug abusecontrol."80 47 John S.

Because of its drug problem, Amsterdam is required to have apolice force much greater than those of U.S. cities of similarpopulation. [Ramon Bracamontes, citation above].

[Roger Cohen, "Amid GrowingCrime, Zurich Closes a Park It Reserved for Drug Addicts,"New York Times, February 11, 1992]. Allowing a city park to be used as a "druglegalized" area of Zurich, the number of addicts escalatedfrom a few hundred to over 20,000 within several years. [RogerCohen, citation above]. Swiss officials now admit that their policy oflegalization-decriminalization served to increase crime,especially property crimes and prostitution. [Roger Cohen,citation above]. Ifthey say... Spain successfully legalized both cocaine and heroin. Thenyou say... Spain, and Italy, the two European countries that legalizeduse of both cocaine and heroin, have the highest rates of bothaddiction and overdose in all of Europe. [Gabriel G.

Historically, countries that have legalized or decriminalizeddrugs have not been harmed. Thenyou say... When opium was legal in China at the turn of the century,there were 90 million addicts, and it took China fifty years toeventually solve the problem. [Gabriel G. Nahas, "TheDecline of Drugged Nations," The Wall Street Journal, July11, 1988]. In the 1950's Japan had an epidemic of amphetamine addictionthat it solved within four years by both police enforcement andrehabilitation. [Gabriel G. Nahas, citation above]. When Egypt allowed unrestricted trade of cocaine and heroin inthe 1920's, an epidemic of addiction resulted. [Gabriel G. Nahas,citation above]. In Iran and Thailand, countries where drugs are readilyavailable, the prevalence of addiction has been and continues tobe exceptionally high. [David T. Courtwright, "Should WeLegalize Drugs? History Answers," American Heritage,February/March 1993]. Ifthey say... The international community condones legalized drugs. Thenyou say... Both the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and theConvention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 (both signed by theU.S.) insist that drugs should not be legalized.

Their Argument Proponents of legalization suggest that their policy will savesociety money for several reasons. First, we will not have to paypolice to enforce the present criminal-justice approach to drugusage. Second, we will be able to tax legal drugs, therebyraising revenue. II. Our Argument It should be stated initially that most people misconceive theamount of resources expended under the status quo for drugcontrol. The FY 1994 federal budget allocates $7.51 billion fordrug control (supply reduction) which includes criminal justice,interdiction, international programs and intelligence.81 Stateand local governments spend even more, $12.6 billion a year.82Granted, this is a lot of money, but we should put these numbersin perspective. Americans spend about four billion dollars eachsummer for air conditioning.83 The citizens of Washington Statespend $1.4 billion each year on legal gambling alone.84 Thenational debt numbers in the trillions of dollars. One StealthBomber runs half a billion dollars. Indeed, only 1.4% of totalgovernment spending goes for law enforcement of all types, and anadditional 1.0% for prosecution and prisons.85 Out of this smallpercentage, 12% of spending for law enforcement was allocated todrug control activities, and about 25% of correctional (prison)spending was drug related.86 Only 1.5% of total state and localgovernment spending is attributed to drug control activities.87Thus, when taken in context, it is apparent that the costs ofcriminalized drugs nowhere approaches the financial obligationsof government programs such as national defense, Social Security,or Medicare. More important, if we legalized drugs on the assumption thatby taxing them we could raise large amounts of revenue, we wouldbe sadly mistaken. First, as discussed in Chapter Two, any suchtaxation scheme would perpetuate a criminal black market.Consequently, we would still have to spend money funding police,courts and the like to fight this problem. Second, if alcohol isany indication, we simply would not make that much money bytaxing drugs. The total revenue collected from alcohol taxes atthe federal, state, and local levels amounts to about $13.1billion a year," a paltry sum compared to the social costsassociated with alcohol consumption - something in theneighborhood of $100 billion." Third, how would we structurea tax scheme for drugs? If we wanted to correlate higher taxeswith higher risk behavior, logically we would tax the fifth jointmore than the first (inasmuch as the fifth joint probably is moredamaging to one's health). And wouldn't it cost money to createthe governmental bureaucracy that would handle this taxationpolicy? Thus, we do not spend that much on the drug war in comparisonto other governmental programs, and taxation of legalized drugswould not result in that much revenue. But by far the mostcompelling economic argument against the legalization of drugs isthe social costs associated with such a policy. First, treating drug addicts is enormously expensive. Takecrack babies as an example. In 1988, it cost $2.5 billion for theintensive care needed to keep the babies alive after birth.90 Butthat was just the beginning of the expenses. It is estimated thatit will cost $15 billion to prepare these children forkindergarten,91 and will then cost between $6 billion and $12billion for every year of special learning programs.92 Evenassuming the low-ball figure, the social costs of educating allof the crack babies born in 1988 - not all crack babies, mindyou, just those born that year - will run approximately $90billion by the time they graduate from high school. Now to theextent that legalization will increase the drug addiction ratesenormously [see Chapter One], legalization seems like a veryexpensive policy indeed. And who will foot the bill? Eithercommon citizens will through taxes for government aid programs,or through increased insurance premiums.93 But treatment costs are just the first way in which drugaddiction drains society. Already, drug addicts cost the countryroughly $33 billion dollars a year in lost productivity andjob-related accidents, according to a study conducted in 1987 bythe Research Triangle Institute of Research Triangle Park, NorthCarolina.94 If legalized, addiction rates would increase and thecost would rise to between $140 billion and $210 billion ayear.95 And who will pay for lost productivity and job-relatedaccidents? Consumers will, of course, in the final costs of theproduced goods. Finally we must consider human lives in the economic calculus.As drug abuse causes more job related accidents, more people willbe hurt or killed. Take, for example, the Conrail/Amtrak disasterof January 4, 1987. Because an engineer and a brakeman were highon marijuana, their train collided with another, killing sixteenpeople and injuring 175.96 So go back to the beginning. We spend approximately $20billion a year on drug control activities. If drugs werelegalized, we would see an increase in addiction rates.Consequently we would have more crack babies (the kind thatalready will cost the system $90 billion), decreased productivity(at a cost of between $140 billion and $210 billion), morejob-related accidents, and more dead people. And given thepotential black market effect, it is unlikely that we could raiseeven several billion dollars in tax revenue. From a purelyeconomic standpoint, legalization is not cost effective. 81 "National Drug Control Strategy: Reclaiming OurCommunities from Drugs and Violence," The White House, February 1994. 82 "State and Local Spending on Drug ControlActivities," Office of National Drug Control Policy, October1993. 83 John W.

If we legalized drugs, we could raise much revenue throughtaxation. Thenyou say... If you try to tax legalized drugs, you will create a blackmarket.

Addicts require treatment, and this is enormously expensive.For example, in 1988 we spent $2.5 billion for intensive care ofcrack babies. It will cost roughly $15 billion to prepare themfor kindergarten. Further, special learning programs will costbetween $6 billion and $12 billion a year for every year afterkindergarten.

If we legalize drugs, consumers will bear the ultimateresponsibility for the bill because of increases in insurancepremiums and higher costs of manufactured goods. ["No MagicBullet: A Look at Drug Legalization," Drug EnforcementAdministration Publication]. Legalizing drugs would increase the incidence of drug-relatedaccidents such as the Conrail/Amtrak train crash of January 1987in which 16 people were killed and 175 were injured.

Their Argument Proponents of legalization suggest that the United Statesexperience with alcohol prohibition in the 1920's provides ampleproof of the problems that result when the government attempts tomake a popular substance illegal. Legalizers point to ostensibleincreases in organized crime such as that associated with AlCapone in order to make their point. Basically, they say, it isbetter to legalize, tax and regulate than simply to declare drugsillegal. II. Our Argument The legalizers' arguments here are deeply flawed and merit twoprimary responses: first, the circumstances surroundingProhibition are so different than those of today's world that itpractically is impossible to use its history as a means ofanalyzing present-day policy; second, Prohibition was in factsuccessful and did not create the negative consequences that thelegalizers say it did. But to the first point. David Teasley, an analyst with theCongressional Research Service of the Library of Congress,undertook an in-depth analysis in 1992 entitled, "Druglegalization and the 'lessons' of Prohibition." Teasleyultimately concluded that [A] comprehensive analogy between Prohibition and the moderndrug problem is problematic in at least two major ways. First,between the two eras there are significant differences that tendto undermine the prolegalization analogy. Second, many argumentsof the prolegalizers are weakened by their reliance upon a widelyheld set of popular beliefs about Prohibition rather than uponrecent historical evidence. Such attempts to create this analogybased upon these popular beliefs about Prohibition serve only toconfuse the debate over legalization of illicit drugs.97 Let us examine the differences that Teasley (and others) citebetween the era of Prohibition and the era in which we now live. First, during prohibition the government sought to restrictthe consumption of alcohol although it lacked the moral consensusof the nation. That is, even during Prohibition, most people wereaccepting of alcohol.98 Such is not the case today, for the vastmajority of citizens do feel that illicit drugs should remainillegal [see Chapter Eleven]. Thus, Prohibition went against thenational consensus whereas illegalization of drugs does not. Second, the laws of Prohibition themselves were different thanthose dealing with illicit drugs today. During Prohibition, itwas not illegal to drink alcohol, it was only illegal to sell it.Today, however, it is both illegal to sell and to use illicitdrugs. Consequently, today's laws can target the users whilethose of the Prohibition era could not.99 Third, during the Prohibition era several states did notsupport the federal laws. This fact created tension between thestate and federal governments and hampered effective prosecutionof alcohol distributors. Today, 48 states have signed the UniformControlled Substances Act, and all are in effective agreementwith the federal government in matters of drug policy - astate/federal consensus exists that was not present duringProhibition.100 Fourth, criminal penalties are much more severe today than inthe 1920's. For example, the first-offense bootlegger faced amaximum fine of $ 1,000 or six months in prison. Today, afirst-offense trafficker of cocaine or heroin (of less than 100grams) faces fines up to $1 million and imprisonment for up to 20years.101 Fifth, during Prohibition the United States was a"dry" nation within a "wet" internationalcommunity. Just as the Prohibition policies were counter to themoral consensus within the U.S., they were also at odds with thatof the international community (which explains why so muchalcohol was imported from Canada). But as discussed in ChapterThree, the international community is resolute when it comes todrug policy; in December of 1988 over 80 countries signed theConvention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs andPsychotropic Substances.102 Sixth and finally, the administrativestructure of the government agencies designed to carry out theProhibition laws was narrow, unstable, and filled with politicalappointees. Today's national drug strategy involves over a dozenfederal agencies coordinated by the Office of National DrugControl Policy. In short, the governmental bodies that prosecutetoday's drug violators are much larger, have much betterresources, and are much more professional than their Prohibitioncounterparts.103 Thus, it is factually incorrect for the legalizers toanalogize our history with Prohibition to today's drug policies.They simply do not have that much in common. But should thelegalizers choose to make such an analogy, they also should bemade aware of the fact that Prohibition was on balance asuccessful program. First, use of alcohol decreased significantly duringProhibition.104 This decrease in turn lead to a marked decreasein the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver.105 Also,alcohol-related arrests decreased 50%. 106 Finally, the suiciderate also decreased by 50%.107 A second reason why Prohibition was a successful program isdue to the fact that it did not -- contrary to popular myth --cause an increase in the crime rate. It is true that there was anincrease in the homicide rate during Prohibition, but this is notthe same as an increase in the overall crime rate. Furthermore,the increase in homicide occurred predominantly in theAfrican-American community, and African-Americans at that timewere not the people responsible for alcohol trafficking.108 Thedrama of Elliot Ness and Al Capone largely was just that, dramasensationalized by the media of the time. In short, it is doubtful that one legitimately may analogizeProhibition with our current efforts to control drugs. There aretoo many differences in the laws, the political establishment,the moral consensus, and the international community to make suchanalogizing worthwhile. Nonetheless, the fact remains thatProhibition accomplished many of its goals, improved the healthof the entire nation, and did not cause a significant increase inthe crime rate. Mark Kleinman, who has proposed legalizingmarijuana109 notes, the U.S. experience with Prohibition is thebest evidence to support the continued illegalization of illicitdrugs.110 97 David L.

The lessons of Prohibition can be used to analyze the presentpolicies, prohibition in illicit drugs. Thenyou say... Whereas there was not a moral consensus for Prohibition U.S.citizens overwhelmingly are in favor of the the continuedillegalization of illicit drugs. [Robert E. Peterson, "StopLegalization of Illegal Drugs;" Drug Awareness InformationNewsletter, July 1988]. During Prohibition, only the sale, and not the use, of alcoholwas illegal. Today, both sale and use of illicit drugs areillegal. Consequently, present drug policies can target userswhereas Prohibition laws could not. [David L. Teasley, "Druglegalization and the 'lessons' of Prohibition," ContemporaryDrug Problems, Spring 1992]. During Prohibition, there was much tension between federal andstate alcohol policy. Today, 48 states have signed the UniformControlled Substances Act, and the federal and state governmentswork in concert. [David Teasley, citation above]. During Prohibition, criminal sanctions were not extreme - afirst-time bootlegger could receive a $1,000 fine or six monthsin prison. Today, fines for first-time cocaine or herointrafficking are up to $1 million and prison sentences go as highas 20 years. [David Teasley, citation above). During Prohibition, the U.S. was a "dry" country ina "wet" international community. Today, almost allcountries are in agreement that drugs should be illegal, aswitnessed by the fact that 80 countries signed the 1988Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs andPsychotropic Substances. [David Teasley, citation above]. The political administration responsible for enforcingProhibition was small, underfunded, and unprofessional. Incontrast, the current drug control program is run by over a dozenagencies coordinated by the Office of National Drug ControlPolicy. [David Teasley, citation above]. Ifthey say... Prohibition caused more harm than good. Thenyou say... During Prohibition, alcohol use declined significantly [DavidTeasley, citation above]. During Prohibition, incidence of cirrhosis of the liverdecreased by 35%. [Charles Krauthammer, "Legalize? No,Deglamorize," The Washington Post, May 20, 1988]. During Prohibition, the suicide rate decreased 50%. [RobertStutman, "Reasons Not to Legalize Drugs," DrugAwareness Information Newsletter]. During Prohibition, the incidence of alcohol-related arrestsalso declined by 50% [Robert L. DuPont, "The Case AgainstLegalizing Drugs," Drug Awareness Information Newsletter]. Contrary to popular opinion, the crime rate did not markedlyincrease during prohibition. What did increase was the homiciderate (not the same as the overall crime rate) amongAfrican-Americans. And African-Americans had little to do withalcohol trafficking. [David Teasley, citation above]. Mark Kleiman admits that the U.S. experience with Prohibitionis one of the strongest arguments in favor of the continuedillegalization of illicit drugs. [Letter from John C. Lawn toJoseph E.

Their Argument Proponents of drug legalization advance the argument that tothe extent alcohol and tobacco may be freely consumed, it ishypocritical to make other drugs such as marijuana and cocaineillegal. They cite the individual and social harm caused by bothtobacco and alcohol to support their argument. II. Our Argument Two responses immediately come to mind when addressing thelegalizers' argument. First, simply because we have as a societyhave chosen to legalize some dangerous substances does not leadto the conclusion that we should legalize all dangeroussubstances. Second, the legalizers' argument is logically flawed:When they compare the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco tothat caused by drugs such as cocaine and marijuana they arecomparing apples and oranges (or more specifically, legal toillegal drugs). Alcohol and tobacco are legal, and, according toour analysis in Chapter One [Addiction Rates], are used much morefrequently than illegal drugs. Because their use is greater, theamount of damage they cause will also be greater. But this is notto say that one "dose" of alcohol is inherently moredangerous than one "dose" of cocaine. As James Q.Wilson explains, predictions about the harms of cocaine thatassume its illegality tells us little about what damage cocainewould do if it were legal.111 Thus, the proper analysis is not tocompare damage caused by cocaine to that caused by alcohol underthe present system, but instead is to compare the harm likelycaused by legalized cocaine to that caused by alcohol. But let us look more closely at the legalizers' positionitself. 1. Tobacco. Certainly tobacco kills people.Nonetheless, it is disingenuous to say that as such it is a moredangerous substance than either cocaine or marijuana. For whileit may harm one's health, tobacco does not affect one'sintellectual processing or decision-making ability. As ProfessorWilson explains: Tobacco shortens one's life, cocaine debases it. Nicotinealters one's habits, cocaine alters one's soul. The heavy use ofcrack, unlike the heavy use of tobacco, corrodes those naturalsentiments of sympathy and duty that constitute our human natureand make possible our social life."' Think of it this way: Research fairly convincingly hasdemonstrated that cholesterol is bad for people, and in fact maybe responsible for a large amount of heart disease in the UnitedStates. In essence, cholesterol kills. But to take this premiseand then argue that because we allow people to eat red meat weshould also allow them to smoke crack is both unsophisticated andunpersuasive reasoning. Similarly, to argue that because we donot allow people to smoke crack we should not allow them to eatred meat also displays a rather monumental lack of common sense.And although cholesterol may kill you, it does not lead to thetypes of bizarre, destructive behavior that is associated withmost illegal drugs. 2. Alcohol. Alcohol is somewhat harder to justify, fornot only can it kill people but it does in fact alter one'sbehavior and may encourage antisocial and destructive activity.But again, this admission does not me-an that one must viewalcohol and cocaine as equivalent. First, a far greaterpercentage of people who use cocaine become addicted to thesubstance than do people who use alcohol. Recall that in ChapterOne, we discovered that the addiction rate for cocaine may be ashigh as 75%.113 Conversely, the addiction rate for alcohol isabout 10%.114 One is thus far more likely to becomeaddicted to cocaine than to alcohol. Second, the relapse rate(the percentage of people who quit the drug who later begin totake it again), is much higher for cocaine.115 In short, do not let proponents of legalization argue thatjust because tobacco and alcohol are legal, so too should becocaine and marijuana. First, just because we sanction somedangerous substances does not mean that we should allow all ofthem. Second, it is misleading to compare the damage caused bylegal drugs with that caused by illegal drugs -- instead weshould compare the risks of alcohol and tobacco with those of legalizedcocaine and marijuana. Likely we would find that the latterare much more dangerous than the former. Third, tobacco does not alter one's behavior and encourageviolent behavior as do many illegal drugs. Fourth, alcohol, whileadmittedly dangerous, is much less addictive than presentlyillegal drugs and also is easier to quit once addicted. Do notcompound problems simply because they are difficult to solve-keepillegal drugs illegal and at the same time try to discouragealcohol and tobacco use. 111 James Q. Wilson, "Against the Legalization ofDrugs," Commentary, February 1990. 112 Id. 113 George Church, "'Thinking the Unthinkable,"Time, May 30,1988. 114 id. 115 "Issues and Comments to respond toLegalization of Drugs," Office of Congressional and PublicAffairs Drug Enforcement Administration Publication, May 1988. Chapter Six Summary Sheet: The Role of Alcohol and Tobacco inthe Drug Legalization Debate Ifthey say... Since alcohol and tobacco are legal, marijuana and cocaineshould also be legal. Thenyou say... Just because some dangerous substances are legal does not meanthat all dangerous substances should also be legal. One cannot properly compare the harm associated with tobaccoand alcohol use with the harm associated with cocaine andmarijuana use, because you are comparing legal drugs with illegaldrugs. And as discussed in Chapter One, legalizing a drug makesit more dangerous. (See last paragraph, page 7). Although tobacco harms one's health, it does not alter one'smental processes, nor does it create bizarre, violent behavior.[James Q. Wilson, "Against the Legalization of Drugs,"Commentary, February 1990]. Although alcohol is harmful, it is much less addictive thancocaine: Studies suggest that alcohol has an addiction rate of10%, whereas cocaine has an addiction rate as high as 75%.[George Church. "Thinking the Unthinkable,"'Time, May 30, 1988]. Do not legalize drugs because alcohol and tobacco are harmful:keep illegal drugs illegal and try to decrease use of the others.

Their Argument Proponents of legalization suggest that even if drugs such ascocaine, marijuana, and heroin are not fully legalized, theyshould be made more available as forms of medical treatment. Forexample, legalizers suggest that heroin should be used much inthe same way as is morphine presently and that marijuana shouldbe used in treating glaucoma and the side-effects ofchemotherapy. II. Our Argument In order to fully analyze the debate surrounding the medicaluses of heroin and marijuana, each drug should be discussed inturn. 1. Heroin Heroin is an opiate, as are drugs such as morphine. Legalizerssuggest that because morphine does not always succeed inrelieving the pain of, for example, cancer patients, the onlylogical step is to try heroin. This is factually incorrect. In order to understand why this argument is flawed, one mustknow how heroin and morphine differ from one another. As Drs.Robert McCarthy and Michael Montagne explain, "Kaiko, et al.found that although heroin is more potent - and achieves peakpain control and mood elevation effects faster, both pain controland mood elevation are more prolonged with morphine. "116That is, heroin gives you a quicker "high," butmorphine provides longer-lasting effects. Furthermore, we havemany other opioids available under present pharmaceutical laws.As Professor Arthur G. Lipman explains, [s]ome advocates of heroin legalization argue that it shouldbe available as an alternative opioid because some patientsrespond better to one opioid than another. That is true. However,we already have a variety of opioids commercially available inthis country. If a patient does not respond to morphine asexpected, it would be more logical to use a chemically differentopioid (e.g., hydromorphone, methadone) than a morphine product[such as heroin]. Therefore, the argument for heroin is notlogical. 117 Not only is Professor Lipman's argument medically sound, butit makes common sense. Heroin and morphine have similar chemicalstructures. If morphine does not work for a given patient, itmakes more sense to try an opioid with a different chemicalconstruct than to give them a drug very similar to the one thatis not working. These two facts----that heroin does not produce as constantand prolonged a treatment as does morphine, and that many otheropioids presently exist that can do the job better than heroin inthe event that morphine does not work - help to explain why thevast majority of medical society members do not favor the use ofheroin as a form of therapeutic treatment. The British doctorswho initially suggested the viability of therapeutic herointreatment long ago reversed their position.118 And althoughMaurice Bectel, President of the American PharmaceuticalAssociation, admits that problems do exist in the treatment ofcancer pain, these problems stem largely from the fact that"physicians fail to prescribe proper dosages of existingmedications, not because of the lack of availability ofheroin."119 Indeed, as Professor Lipman correctly notes,"[i]f the energy devoted to legalizing heroin wereredirected toward better use of available opioids, patients wouldbenefit.120 But not only is allowing the therapeutic use of heroinunnecessary, it also could create other problems. For example,increased medical use of heroin increases the risk of"diversion"-- that the patients would sell their heroinon the black market.121 Also, if pharmacies routinely stocked asupply of heroin, it would increase the risk of burglaries. Thisfact gives one special concern when one notes that fully 50% ofburglaries against pharmacies are committed with the intention ofstealing controlled substances.122 In short, Lipman concludes that "[m]isinformation aboutheroin has clouded the issue, but there is valid, published scientific evidence that unequivocallyrefutes the argument that heroin should be legalized."123 116 Robert L. McCarthy and Michael Montagne, "Theargument for therapeutic use of heroin in pain management,"American Journal of Hospital Pharmacists, May 1993. 117 Arthur G.

Lipman, "The argument againsttherapeutic use of heroin in pain management," AmericanJournal of Hospital Pharmacists, May 1993. 121 Id. 122 Id. 123 Id. 2. Marijuana a. Treatment for glaucoma Glaucoma is a disease in which the fluid pressure within theeyeball (known as the intraocular pressure) increases and therebydamages the optic nerve, potentially causing blindness.Legalizers advance the claim that marijuana can decrease theintraocular pressure and thereby prevent blindness. Let's look atthis claim. First, the studies that the legalizers cite for support oftheir propositions assume the use of THC itself rather thanmarijuana.125 Thus while one may claim that THC decreasesintraocular pressure, it is not technically correct to claim thatmarijuana does as well. Second, even if marijuana does decrease intraocular pressure,it does so only at high dosages - in order to get the benefits,you have to stay stoned all day. Doctor Keith Green suggests thatin order to decrease intraocular pressure, one would have tosmoke the equivalent of six joints a day.126 Michael Van Buskirk,Director of Glaucoma Services and Chairman of the Department ofOphthalmology at Devers Eye Institute agrees, stating that"[a]lcohol also produces a profound reduction in . . .intraocular pressure. 'Me recommendation to use marijuana isexactly analogous to the recommendation to ingest alcohol andmaintain a state of drunkenness to treat glaucoma."127 Third, even if marijuana successfully combats one symptom ofglaucoma - intraocular pressure - it does so at the expense ofexacerbating another symptom. For while marijuana may decreaseintraocular pressure, it also decreases blood pressure (and thusblood flow) to the eye. Carl Kupfer, director of the National EyeInstitute, explains: For the optic nerve to be properly nourished, there, must bean adequate amount of blood flowing to that nerve at all times,so that if we have a drug that both lowers intraocular pressureas well as blood pressure, we may be interfering with the supplyof blood to the optic nerve, and therefore even though thepressure in the eye may decrease, such a patient will not beprotected against losing visual function from the glaucomaprocess.128 Thus, marijuana at best alleviates one problem of glaucomawhile increasing the risk of another. And in order to evenaccomplish this ambivalent goal, one must stay stoned the entireday. It is no surprise, then, that experts such as Doctor Greenconclude that "marijuana. . . has little potential future asa glaucoma medication."129 b. Treatment for chemotherapy Proponents also suggest that marijuana is useful to combat theside-effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting. Tosupport their position, they cite a study conducted by MarkKleiman which found that 40% of cancer specialists hadrecommended marijuana to relieve chemotherapy nausea. 130 First, the Kleiman study is flawed statistically andmethodologically. 57% of the doctors that Kleiman sentquestionnaires to did not even bother to return them. Also,Kleiman does not document the number of questionnaires that werereturned unanswered. Further, Kleiman does not document thenumber of questionnaires that expressed no opinion as to thetherapeutic use of marijuana. Once all of these factors areconsidered, Kleiman's "40%" acceptance rate would be nomore than 15%, and, according to Dr. Richard Schwartz, ClinicalProfessor of Pediatrics at Georgetown University School ofMedicine, is "probably much less."131 Second, the nation's top cancer experts reject marijuana forchemotherapy treatment. As David Ettinger, professor of oncologyat the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine notes,"There is no indication that marijuana is effective intreating nausea and vomiting resulting from radiation treatmentor other causes. No legitimate studies have been conducted whichmake such conclusions."132 Doctor John Laszlo, VicePresident of Research for the American Cancer Society agrees thatthere is insufficient evidence to suggest that marijuana is auseful chemotherapy treatment.133 Third, the National Cancer Institute itself notes that"other antiemetic agents such as ondansetron,metoclopramine, droperidol, etc. have been shown to be moreuseful than marijuana-related compounds as first linetherapy."134 Thus, while there is no evidence to prove marijuana's use inchemotherapy, there are numerous alternative drugs that obviatethe need to even pursue research on the subject. c. Treatment for AIDS Proponents of legalized drugs next suggest that marijuana isuseful in treating AIDS both because it relieves pain and becauseit stimulates appetite. Unfortunately, marijuana would actuallyexacerbate the health risks associated with AIDS. First, studiesconducted at the Virginia Medical College suggest that the THC inmarijuana damages the immune system, making the patient moresusceptible to colds, viruses, and influenza while at the sametime increasing the severity of any illnesses that the patienthas.135 Clearly, the last thing that a patient with AIDS needs isto have his or her immune system weakened. Second, the marijuanasmoke itself is damaging to the AIDS patients. As Dr. SoniaBuist, Professor of Medicine at Oregon Health Sciences Universityexplains, "I cannot support the use of marijuana to treatpatients with this condition [AIDS]. Furthermore, I wouldmaintain that its use is contraindicated because marijuana smokeis extremely irritating to the airways and may add additionalpulmonary problems in these very susceptibleindividuals."136 d. Treatment for multiple sclerosis Proponents of legalization finally argue that marijuana isuseful to stop the spasms caused by multiple sclerosis. Expertson MS absolutely reject this proposition. In fact, the scientificopinion may be summed up by Dr. Donald Silberberg, Chair of theDepartment of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania Schoolof Medicine and Chief of the Neurology Service at the Hospital ofPennsylvania, when he states that I have not found any legitimate medical or scientific workswhich show that marijuana... is medically effective in treatingmultiple sclerosis or spasticity.... The long-term treatment ofthe symptoms of multiple sclerosis through the use of marijuanacould be devastating. . . . The use of (marijuana), especiallyfor long-term treatment ... would be worse than the originaldisease itself." Having proved that marijuana is not effective in the treatmentof glaucoma, the treatment of chemotherapy side-effects, thetreatment of AIDS, or the treatment of MS, we should discuss theevidence that suggests that marijuana is harmful to one's health.Recall the material presented in Chapter One [Addiction Rates]that suggested that marijuana caused numerous health problems.Let us expand upon the inquiry. First, Swedish researchers foundthat people who smoked pot fifty or more times were six times aslikely to develop schizophrenia. The study specifically foundthat marijuana increased the incidence of schizophrenia not onlyin those patients who were predisposed to the illness, but alsoin those who were not.138 Second, physicians in 1986 beganreporting cases of lung, head, neck, tongue, and respiratorytract cancer in patients aged 17 to 39.139 Third, maternal use ofmarijuana increases the risk of childhood leukemia by 1,000%.140Fourth, marijuana exposure produces abnormalities similar tothe Fetal Alcohol Syndrome but at five times the rate of alcohol.141 Thus, not only is marijuana not a good medical treatment, butit also causes schizophrenia, cancer, leukemia, and childhoodabnormalities. Consequently, it is unsurprising to learn that"marijuana has been rejected as medicine by the AmericanMedical Association, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, theAmerican Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmologyand the American Cancer Society. Not one American healthassociation accepts marijuana as medicine."142 124 Purnell and Gregg (1975); Perez-Reyes et al.(1976); Merritt et al.

Chapter Seven Summary Sheet: Medical Uses of PresentlyIllegal Drugs Ifthey say... We should allow for therapeutic use of heroin. Thenyou say... Morphine provides longer-lasting, more consistent pain reliefthan does heroin. [Robert L. McCarthy and Michael Montagne,"The argument for therapeutic use of heroin in painmanagement," American Journal of Hospital Pharmacists, May1993]. If morphine does not work for a given patient, you should notuse- heroin, which is chemically very similar to morphine, butinstead should use a different opioid such as methadone. [ArthurG. Lipman, "The argument against therapeutic use of heroinin pain management," American Journal of HospitalPharmacists, May 1993]. The British doctors who initially advocated the therapeuticuse of heroin long ago reversed their position. [Lipman, citationabove]. The American Pharmaceutical Association admits that there areproblems in pain management, but that they are due to thetendency of doctors to fail to prescribe sufficient dosages ofpresently available opioids, not because of the unavailability ofheroin. [Lipman, citation above]. Allowing the therapeutic use of heroin increases the risk ofdiversion-i.e. that patients will sell their drugs on the blackmarket rather than using it themselves. (Lipman, citation above], Allowing pharmacies to stock heroin likely would 'increase therisk of robbery, especially when one considers that 50% of allpharmacy burglaries are committed to steal controlled substances.[Lipman, citation above]. Ifthey say... Marijuana should be used to treat glaucoma. Thenyou say... The studies which assert that marijuana helps to decreaseintraocular pressure were conducted with THC, not with marijuanaper se. [Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition;Remand; 21 CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. In order to see a significant decrease in intraocularpressure, you would have to smoke so much marijuana that youwould be stoned all day. [Scheduling Petition, citation above]. In fact, alcohol also decreases intraocular pressure. But aswith marijuana, you would have to consume so much that you wouldbe drunk all day. [Sandra S. Bennett, "TherapeuticMarijuana: Fact or Fiction," Drug Watch, July 1992]. Although marijuana may reduce one symptom of glaucoma(intraocular pressure), it also exacerbates another problem.Specifically, marijuana decreases blood pressure and hence. bloodsupply to the optic nerve- Because the optic nerve no longerreceives an adequate blood supply, it can be just as damaging toeyesight as the high intraocular pressure itself. [Bennett,citation above (citing Michael Van Buskirk, Director of GlaucomaServices and Chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at Devers Eye Institute)]. According to Doctor Keith Green, who serves or has served onthe boards of eight prestigious eye journals, "Marijuana ...has little potential future as a glaucoma medication."[Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial of Petition; Remand; 21CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. Ifthey say... Marijuana should be used for therapeutic treatment of theside- effects of chemotherapy such as nausea and vomiting. Thenyou say... The study that the legalizers will probably cite-the oneconducted by Mark Kleiman, which says that 40% of doctorsquestioned supported the therapeutic use of marijuana for cancerpatients--is methodologically flawed. Specifically, its returnrate (number of questionnaires returned), was only 42%, whichraises the strong potential of response bias. Also, Kleiman did notinform the reader how many of the people who did return thequestionnaire did in fact answer the questions. As one expert inbio-statistics concluded, "The report seems simple andcareless. - This is mere propaganda, and will be seen as such bythe informed reader." [Robert E. Peterson, "StudentExercise for Marijuana Activist Group Given National MediaAttention to Influence Court Case," Drug PreventionNewsletter, June 1991). As David Ettinger, professor of oncology at the Johns HopkinsUniversity School of Medicine notes, "There is no indicationthat Marijuana is effective in treating nausea and vomitingresulting from radiation treatment or other causes."[Marijuana Scheduling Petition; Denial, of Petition; Remand; 21CFR Part 1308 (Docket No. 86-22), 1986]. The National Cancer Institute concluded that other drugs suchas ondansetron, metoclopramine, droperidol, etc. are more usefulfor treating chemotherapy than is marijuana. [Janet Lapey,"Marijuana As Medicine Refuted by NIH Scientists," DrugWatch, August 1992]. Ifthey say... Marijuana is a useful treatment for AIDS patients. Thenyou say... Studies show that marijuana actually damages one's immunesystem and makes one more susceptible to colds, viruses, andinfluenza. [Guy A. Cabral, Marijuana and Virus Infections,Southeast Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and CommunitiesNewsletter]. Marijuana actually increases the health risk to AIDS patientsbecause the smoke causes pulmonary problems. [Sandra S. Bennett,"Therapeutic Marijuana: Fact or Fiction, "Drug Watch,July 1992]. Ifthey say... Marijuana is a useful treatment for MS(multiple sclerosispatients). Thenyou say... According to Doctor Donald H. Silberberg, Chair of theDepartment of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania, thereis no evidence that marijuana helps MS, and, in fact, it likely would be very harmful to the patient. [Marijuana SchedulingPetition; Denial of Petition; Remand; 21 CFR Part 1308 (DocketNo. 86-22), 1986]. Ifthey say... Marijuana on the whole is a good medicine. Thenyou say... According to Swedish researchers, use of marijuana increasesthe incidence of schizophrenia six-fold for long-term users.[Marsha Keith Schuchard, "Marijuana: An EnvironmentalPollutant" Publication of the National Parent's ResourceInstitute for Drug Education, Inc.]. Use of marijuana increases the threat of lung cancer, throatcancer, tongue cancer, and head cancer. [Schuchard, citationabove]. Use of marijuana by pregnant mothers increases the risk thattheir child will develop leukemia by 1000%. [Schuchard, citationabove]. Use of marijuana increases the risk of abnormalities similarto those caused by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome by 500%. [Schuchard,citation above]. (See also Chapter One, Addiction Rates). Ifthey say... The medical community condones the therapeutic use ofmarijuana. Thenyou say... Marijuana as medicine has been rejected by MedicalAssociation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, theAmerican Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology,and the American Cancer Society. Not one American healthassociation accepts marijuana as medicine. [Marijuana SchedulingPetition; Denial of Petition; Remand, 21 CFR Part 1308 (DocketNo. 86-22), 1986].

Their Argument Although proponents of legalization do not rely upon thisargument very much any more, a traditional response of thelegalizers was that "It's my body and I have a right to dowith it as I please so long as I'm the only one affected."This is called the Individual Autonomy argument. II. Our Argument The obvious flaw with the Individual Autonomy argument, andthe reason why it is not used much any more, is the simple factthat drug use does affect other people. Indeed, this entiremanual is in large part a collection of reasons and examples asto how drug use affects not only the individual, but alsoinnocent third-parties and society at large. But for the sake ofclarity, let us iterate and expand upon these points. First, drug use increases crime - and consequently harms otherpeople - in at least three different ways. For a discussion ofthis, please see Chapter Two. Second, drug use by pregnant women causes in utero damage tothe fetus. Children born of cocaine mothers have three times themortality rate and four times the low birth-weight as childrenborn of normal mothers.143 Similarly, "coke babies"tend to have emotional traits similar to those found in peoplewith antisocial personality disorders.144 Unfortunately, the samemothers who are most likely to damage their children in this wayare also the least likely to seek professional help andtreatment.145 Third, drug abuse closely correlates to child abuse. Forexample, in Philadelphia, cocaine is implicated in half of thecases in which parents beat their children to death, and in 80%of all abuse cases. 146 In the District of Columbia, 90% of thosereported for child abuse were substance abusers. 147 In 1984 theLegal Aid Society in New York City handled 3,3 10 abuse andneglect cases in the city. By 1989 it was handling more than24,000.148 What happened? Crack did, beginning in 1985. Sixtypercent of abuse and neglect cases involved drug allegations. 149The number of children wounded and killed by stray bullets intragic drive-by shootings pales in comparison to the impact ofcocaine in the over 1,200 child abuse murders in 1989.150 Butthese problems are not mere statistics - they are horror stories.In San Francisco, a woman who was freebasing cocaine gave birthto twins on her living room floor. She continued to freebase andlet her children die unattended. Fourth, drug use, like alcohol use, is responsible for a largepercentage of automobile accidents in the United States. InMaryland, 32% of car crash victims tested positive formarijuana.152 Fifth, drug use among pilots and train operators also leads toaccidents. Recall the Conrail disaster discussed in Chapter Four,wherein 16 people were killed and 175 were injured because thetrain operators were high on marijuana. Furthermore, a studyconducted by Stanford University found that 24 hours aftersmoking one joint, pilots could not safely land a plane.153 Sixth and finally, consider all of the economic and socialcosts associated with drug use in our society-costs that equate to tens of billions of dollars inlost productivity, higher taxes, and increased insurancepremiums. In short, few people use the Individual Autonomy argument anymore because it is painfully obvious that drug use affects not only the individual user,but also the user's family, innocent third parties, and societyas a whole. 143 Ken Auletta, "Six doses of reality are injected inthe argument for legal drugs," New York Daily News, December 17, 1989 (citing Dr. Karla Damus,director of research and epidemiology for the Bureau of MaternityServices). 144 Id. 145 James Q.

Drug use causes increased crime. [see Chapter Two]. Drug use by pregnant mothers causes in utero damage to thefetus. Specifically, it increases the risk of mortalitythree-fold and the risk of low birth-weight four-fold. [KenAuletta, "Six doses of reality are injected in the argumentfor legal drugs," New York Daily News, December 17, 1989(citing Dr. Karla Dainus)]. Drug use causes child abuse. In Philadelphia, cocaine isimplicated in half of the cases in which parents beat theirchildren to death, and in 80% of all abuse cases. In the Districtof Columbia, 90% of those reported for child abuse were substanceabusers. [Robert E.

Drug use plays a large part in automobile accidents. InMaryland, 32% of car crash victims tested positive for marijuana.[Marsha Keith Schuchard, "Marijuana: An EnvironmentalPollutant," Publication of the National Parent's ResourceInstitute for Drug Education].

[see Chapter Four].Also, a study conducted by Stanford University showed that 24hours after smoking one joint, pilots could not safely land aplane.

Their Argument This chapter deals not with an argument of the legalizers perse, but instead their implicit belief that legalizing drugs would not have a profound effect onother facets of law and public policy. II. Our Argument Basically, we have three concerns here. First, can drug use be used as a defense in criminal or civilproceedings? That is, can a person accused of a hit-and-run accident escape liability by notingto the court that he was on cocaine at the time? Second, what will be done with the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA)? As its name suggests, the FDA isresponsible for testing the safety of food and drugs in theUnited States. For example, the FDA banned the use of Red Dye #2a number of years ago because it caused cancer (this is why therewere no red M+M's in most of the 1980's - it was not until thecandy producer came up with a noncarcenogenic dye that theystarted making them again in the late 1980's). Similarly, the FDAbanned the use of the substance known as Laetrile when itdetermined that this supposed drug had absolutely nopharmacological effects. But if we allow the legal sale of drugssuch as cocaine, marijuana, heroin, and PCP - that unquestionablyare dangerous - how can we justify allowing the FDA to exercisequality control over any other type of drugs? To allow the saleand use of cocaine while still granting the FDA power toregulate, say, food additives such as saccharine is like banningslingshots but allowing people to carry automatic assault rifles.So if we legalize the sale and use of clearly dangerous drugs, itseems that to be logically consistent we would have to close downthe FDA and let everyone have access to every type of drug. Andgiven legalized drugs it also seems hypocritical to have any typeof quality control on food additives or food products moregenerally. A third and final concern is the legal liability of thecompanies that would manufacture and sell the newly legalizedcocaine, marijuana, heroin, and PCP. This is a very importantargument, and in order to fully understand its magnitude we mustmention what are known as "Dram Shop" laws. If not inname, we are all familiar with what a Dram Shop law is - it is alaw that says that if bartenders continue to serve alcohol topeople that they know are already drunk, and that drunk personlater goes out and commits a crime such as drunk driving, thenthe bartender or the bar can be held responsible. So the questionremains: would producers and sellers of legalized drugs beresponsible for the actions of the people who ingest them? If theproducers and sellers would not be liable, we have aserious ethical problem inasmuch as they could destroy peoples'lives with impunity in the name of profit and not be held morallyaccountable. But if the producers and sellers would be liable --that is, a Dram Shop type of law would apply to them --we wouldprobably have very few companies willing to market and selldrugs. Put differently, if a given drug company knew that itcould be hit with a ten million dollar lawsuit when one of itsclients goes and kills someone (or damages property, etc.), isthat company likely to stay in business? Not likely. The companylikely would decide that the costs of doing business outweigh thepotential benefits and thus would close down shop. For proof ofthis point ask yourself the following: How many companies arethere in the U.S. today that manufacture and sell asbestosinsulation? Answer: probably none. In short, there are many legal and political issues that wouldhave to be dealt with if we legalized drugs, and nowhere in the legalizers' literature have theycome up with adequate answers to these problems. Chapter Nine Summary Sheet: Legal Issues Surrounding theLegalization of Drugs Theysay... We can legalize drugs without any legal difficulties. Thenyou say... If we legalize drugs, will drug use be able to be used as adefense in criminal and civil trials? If we legalize drugs, would not we logically have to closedown the Food and Drug Administration and dispense with all lawsregulating the safety and quality of drugs, food additives andfood products? If we legalize drugs, would manufacturers and sellers beliable for the actions of the people whom they sell drugs to? Ifnot, isn't there an ethical problem here? If so, can werealistically expect anyone to enter the drug business?

Their Argument Some extremists in the drug legalization debate suggest thatwe should legalize hemp - the plant from which we get marijuana -because hemp could be used as fiber to make clothing,alternatives to lumber, paper products, and the like. II. Our Argument Some of the arguments of the legalizers are at least plausible(plausible, but wrong). This is not one of them. The argumentthat we should grow hemp for fiber is completely absurd. First,if hemp is such a good all-purpose fiber, why isn't any countryin the world seriously growing it? Second, there was a time inthe U.S. when it was legal to grow hemp (before 1937), and no onedid. By 1937, so few people chose to grow hemp that it wasn'teven mentioned in Department of Agriculture or Department ofCommerce reports.154 If it is such a good idea, why didn't anyonedo it when they could have? Finally, assume (although this assumption is contradicted byhistory) that hemp could provide all of the environmentalbenefits that the legalizers claim. These benefits would stillhave to be weighed against the costs of allowing farmers to growthousands, if not millions, of acres of marijuana. It would beimpossible to have a policy that allowed the legal sale of hempfor fiber but not for smoking, for one simply could not enforceit. (By comparison, think of how plausible a policy would be thatsaid farmers could grow wheat to make bread but not to makebiscuits). Thus, in order to get the supposed benefits of"hemp as fiber," you would also have to allow people touse it as marijuana. But when we recall all of the harmsassociated with marijuana use - medical problems, lostproductivity, increased accidents, increased crime, etc. - wefind that even granting the supposed benefits of"hemp as fiber," these benefits are still outweighed bythe negative consequences of such a policy. Thus, the "hemp as fiber" argument is disproved byboth history and the fact that no other countries are seriouslyconsidering it as an option. But even granting the legalizersarguments here, the costs of such a policy still would clearlyoutweigh the benefits. 154 For proof of this fact the reader is invited to scan anyAgriculture or Commerce reports from 1916 to 1937. Chapter Ten Summary Sheet: Environmental Issues and theLegalization of Drugs Itthey say... We should grow hemp and use it as fiber, thus achievingenvironmental benefits. Thenyou say... When farmers could do this in the early twentieth century inthe U.S., no one did. [Reports of the Departments of Agricultureand Commerce, 1916-1937.] If it is such a good idea, why aren't any other countries inthe world doing it now? Even if we granted the supposed benefits of "hemp asfiber," (which we should not), the costs of such a programwould still clearly outweigh the benefits.

Their Argument The final argument of the legalizers is one of hopelessness -the status quo obviously is not working because we are spendinglots of money on the problem, and it is not yet solved.Therefore, any policy is preferable to the present one. II. Our Argument Such cynicism is understandable - drugs are a pervasiveproblem in our culture. But legalization is not the answer, andin order to prove this we should look at two points: first, thatthe problem is getting better, and second, that many other viablesolutions besides legalization exist. 1. The Problem is Getting Better A mere purview of the facts proves that our problems withdrugs are not as bad as they used to be. For example, in 1979 thepercentage of 12 to 17-yr. olds who said they had used anyillicit drug in the past month was 17.6%. In 1992, it was down to6.1%. Similarly, the percentages for ages 18-25 yrs. dropped from37. 1 % to 13.0%. 155 Cocaine use is also down. In 1982 thepercentage of 18-25 yr. olds reporting past month use of cocainewas 6.8 %. In 1992 the figure had dropped to 1.8%.156Unfortunately, the 1993 data show a bottoming out and reversal ofthis trend, which has been linked to a softening attitude aboutthe dangers of drug use.157 Not only is drug use down, but public opinion has crystallizedinto a "no drug tolerance" position. One Gallup pollreported that over 80% of Americans said legalizing drugs was abad idea.158 A large majority said they feared legalization wouldlead to increases in addiction, drug overdoses, drug-relatedcrime and drug use in schools. 159 Furthermore, a study conductedin 1990 showed that 89% of the population would be willing to pay highertaxes to support the War on Drugs. 160 And as discussed above,children and adolescents have become less tolerant of drug use.As a letter to the New York Times on May 7, 1988, written by aclass of 14 and 15 yr. olds explained, "America is in a'moral rut' and ... drug abuse is one of the maincauses."161 Thus, not only is drug use declining, but public opinion growsincreasingly hostile to any such behavior. No wonder so fewpeople favor legalization these days. 2. Alternative Solutions These facts are not to suggest, however, that we should becomecomplacent in our efforts. Drug use continues to be a severesocial problem, and we should always be on the lookout forinnovative policies. Here are just a few ideas. First, we should continue our reliance on strong legalsanctions to deter drug use. That is, keeping drugs illegal doesdecrease their use. As one commentator noted, 70% of high schoolstudents in New Jersey and 60% of those in California said thatfear of getting in trouble with the law was a primary reason not to use drugs.162 Not only do legalsanctions keep people from trying drugs in the first instance, but they also help to get people off themlater. A study conducted by Douglas Anglin of UCLA noted that the potential success rate oftreatment programs depends largely on how long the patientremains with the program. The longer you stay, the better yourchances of recovery. And Anglin also found that people who entertreatment under legal compulsion (i.e., a court order) stay inthe program longer.163 Thus, legal sanctions eventually correlate to treatmentsuccess rate. Second, we should continue to decrease social tolerance fordrug use at all levels of society and at all levels of drug use.As former DEA Administrator Jack Lawn said, "Here's what itmeans in shirt sleeve English. [The] public is telling the druguser, 'What you're doing is not just your business. It's criminaland it's unacceptable. Get help and get treatment if you need it,or face the consequences. We don't want to be hard-hearted, butthis problem exists only because you and people like you keep italive. The rest of us don't want to put up with itanymore'". 164 Third, we should use education to encourage people not to usedrugs. Educating the youth is one of society's most importantresponsibilities, and nowhere is the need for education greaterthan to teach children about the dangers of drug use.165 Suchpolicies are working with regard to smoking, for as Kurt Schmokeadmits, "[t]he number of people smoking continues to fallbecause of a concerted public education campaign about the healtheffects of smoking."" Fourth, we should encourage private enterprise to adoptworkplace rules restricting drug use. By implementing policiessuch as drug testing, businesses can greatly reduce drug usewhile at the same time increasing their productivity. Forexample, Hoffman Construction of Portland, Oregon, implementeddrug policies and decreased workers' compensation claims by 17%.Indeed, by year three, Hoffman had reduced its workers'compensation costs by almost 90%.167 Perhaps the governmentcould use tax credits to encourage businesses to promote drugpolicies. Fifth, it is possible that the growing health-consciousness inthe United States today (favoring more exercise, lesscholesterol, less alcohol and smoking, etc.) will go a long wayin and of itself to decrease drug use.168 Finally, we may be able to turn to science for help. Somescholars are proposing the use of biotechnology to eradicate drugcrops while at the same time planting more socially useful plants(wheat, soybeans, corn, etc.). 169 In the final analysis of the legalization debate we mustremember that drug abuse is a long-term problem: it took China over fifty years to kick its opiumaddiction.170 And granted, drug use still takes far too large a toll on the United States. But when weconsider the decreasing tolerance for, and use of, drugs in ourcountry, as well as the numerous alternatives we are pursuing andhave yet to pursue, it seems clear that legalization of drugs isnot the answer. 155 "Preliminary Estimates from the 1992 NationalHousehold Survey on Drug Abuse," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, June 1993. 156 Id. 157 "Monitoring the Future Study - 1993," Universityof Michigan Institute for Social Research, Jan 27, 1994.

Chapter Eleven Summary Sheet: "Anything Is Better ThanWhat We Are Doing Now", Hopelessness, Drug Control, andPotential Solutions Ifthey say... Any policy is better than the status quo. Thenyou say... Drug use has been declining: in 1979 the percentage of 12 to17-yr. olds who said they had used any illicit drug in the pastmonth was 17.6%. In 1992, it was down to 6.1%. Similarly, forages 1825 yrs. use dropped from 37. 1 % to 13.0%. In 1982 thepercentage of 18-25 yr. olds reporting past month use of cocainewas 6.8%. In 1992 the figure had dropped to 1.8%. [PreliminaryEstimates from the 1992 National Household Survey on DrugAbuse," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, June1993]. Public tolerance for drug use is declining. One Gallup pollreported that over 80% of Americans said legalizing drugs was abad idea- A large majority said they feared legalization wouldlead to increases in addiction, drug overdoses, drug-relatedcrime and drug use in schools. [David Zucchino, "A Push toMake Drugs Illegal," Philadelphia Inquirer, July 5,1992]. In fact, 89% of the public would be willing to payhigher taxes to support the War on Drugs. [Ralph A. Weisheit andKathrine Johnson, "Exploring the Dimensions of Support forDecriminalizing Drugs," Journal of Drug Issues, Winter1992]. Other solutions besides legalization exist: We should continue to employ legal sanctions against drugusers for two reasons. First, studies of high school studentssuggest that between 60% and 70% cite not wanting to get introuble with the law as a reason not to use drugs in the firstplace. [Robert E. Peterson, "Stop Legalization of IllegalDrugs," Drug Awareness Information Newsletter, July 1988].Second, the use of legal sanction is a good means of keepingaddicts in treatment programs for longer periods of time, thusincreasing the probability of successful treatment [James Q.Wilson, "Against the Legalization of Drugs,"Commentary, February 1990]. We should continue to decrease social tolerance for any andall drug use at any and all levels of society. We should promote drug awareness education as a means odeterring use, as is presently being done successfully withregard to tobacco use. We should use tax incentives to encourage businesses to adoptdrug policies such as those of a Portland, Oregon business thatdecreased its workers' compensation claims 90% in three years.["Position Paper In Opposition To The Legalization ofDrugs," Regional Drug Initiative Task Force, September1990.] The general health-consciousness sweeping the country may go along way to decreasing casual drug use. [Ralph A. Weisheit andKathrine Johnson, "Exploring the Dimensions of Support forDecriminalizing Drugs," Journal of Drug Issues, Winter1992]. We should research ways in which biotechnology could be usedto eradicate drug crops and replace them with socially usefulgrowth such as wheat or corn. [Gabriel Nahas, "A Battle Won,A Stalemated War, and A New Strategy," Position Paper]. We should remember that drug use is a long-term problem thatwill take a long time to solve: it took China 50 years to kickits opium addiction.

Evans Richard M. Evans is an attorney with offices at 56 Main St.,Northampton, Mass. 01060. Search all the parks in all your cities. You'll find nostatues of committees. -Unknown You saved the very foundation of our Government. No mancan tell where we would have gone, or to what we would havefallen, had not this repeal been brought about. -Letter to the VCL, 1933 This is a story about a small, remarkable group of lawyerswho took it upon themselves, as a self-appointed committee, topropel a revolution in drug policy: the repeal of the 18thAmendment. In 1927, nine prominent New York lawyers associatedthemselves under the intentionally-bland name, 'VoluntaryCommittee of Lawyers," declaring as their purpose 'topreserve the spirit of the Constitution of the United States [by]bringing about the repeal of the so-called Volstead Act and theEighteenth Amendment." With the modest platform they thuscommanded, reinforced by their significant stature in the legalcommunity, they undertook first to draft and promote repealresolutions for local and state bar associations. Their successculminated with the American Bar Association calling for repealin 1928, after scores of city and state bar associations in allregions of the country had spoken unambiguously, in words andideas cultivated, shaped, and sharpened by the VCL. As it turned out, this success was but prelude to theirstunning achievements several years later. Due in large part tothe VCL's extraordinary work, the 18th Amendment was, in lessthan a year, surgically struck from the Constitution. Repeal wasa reality. The patient was well. People could drink. Here is how it happened. Climaxing decades of gathering hostility towards saloons andmoral outrage over the general degeneracy said to be flowing frombottles and kegs, the Constitution of the United Stated had beenamended, effective 1920, to prohibit the manufacture and sale of'intoxicating liquors.' The Volstead Act, the federal statuteimplementing the prohibition amendment, prohibited commerce inbeer as well. At first, prohibition was popular among those who hadsupported it, and tolerated by the others. But before long,unmistakable grumbling was heard in the cities. To meet theuninterrupted demand for alcohol, there sprang up bathtubginworks and basement stills, tight and discrete illegal supplynetworks, and speakeasies: secret, illegal bars rememberedchiefly today as where, for the first time, women were seensmoking in public. Commerce in alcohol plunged underground, and soon fell underthe control of thugs and gangsters, whose organizations oftenacquired their merchandise legally in Canada. Violence oftensettled commercial differences - necessarily, it might be said,as suppliers and distributors were denied the services oflawyers, insurance companies, and the civil courts. On the locallevel, widespread disobedience of the prohibition laws byotherwise law-abiding citizens produced numerous arrests. Courtswere badly clogged, in large part because nearly all defendantsdemanded jury trials, confident that a jury of their peers waslikely to view their plight sympathetically. With the growth of well-organized and serious nationalanti-Prohibition groups like Americans Against the ProhibitionAmendment and the Women's Organization for National ProhibitionReform, popular support for repeal grew geometrically during thethirteen years of Prohibition. In the midst of the 1932presidential election campaign, it erupted. It was summer. Millions were broken from economic depression,beleaguered by crime and corruption, and thirsty. As expected, the Republicans nominated the incumbentPresident, Herbert Hoover, who was pledged to supportProhibition. The VCL made a stalwart effort to gain a repealplank in the platform, taking the debate as far as the conventionfloor, where they were turned away by a preponderance ofdelegates. The situation was much different with the Democrats. GovernorFranklin D. Roosevelt of New York, who led in the delegate count,had carefully avoided taking a position on repeal. At theconvention, a successful floor fight produced a pro-repeal plankdrafted and defended by the VCL - in the Democratic platform,which FDR unambiguously endorsed in his acceptance speech. 'Thisconvention wants repeal," he declared. "Your candidatewants repeal.", During the election campaign, FDR made one unequivocal speechendorsing repeal. Otherwise, both candidates successfully avoidedthe issue, despite or perhaps because of - their having takenopposite positions. 'Politics is the art of changing thesubject,' observed Walter Mondale many years later.' When the only thing standing in the way of repeal was theelection of FDR, thousands of 'wets' and hundreds of 'wet"organizations moved unambiguously behind the Democrat. Themessage was clear: Roosevelt meant repeal, and repeal meantRoosevelt. People wanted both, and Roosevelt triumphed in the election.The number of 'wets' in Congress grew significantly. In ninestates, voters passed referenda repealing the state prohibitionlaws. This is when the VCL stepped forward and took on theremarkable leadership and responsibility for which they were souniquely equipped. It required no particular insight into thenature of democracy to know that when the weight of publicopinion demanded repeal of Prohibition, Prohibition would berepealed. The question was how. Certainly, lest the repealprocess - like any important undertaking -become mired inpolitical and legal entanglements, a thorough and solid legalplan was essential. For years, repeal advocates had urged that the repealquestion should be resolved by conventions in the states,which-is one of two methods prescribed in the Constitution forratifying amendments. Problem was, this method had never beenused. Always, the matter of amending the Constitution had been(and to this day has been) decided by state legislatures. But to'wets,' that was out of the question, as state legislatures werenotoriously 'dry," being dominated by rural, fundamentalistinterests, passionate in their defense of prohibition. (The 'oneman, one vote' rule would not become law for another thirty-oneyears.) The repeal resolution had to bypass state legislaturesand go to popularly-elected conventions, if it were to succeed. But by whom were such conventions to be called? How weredelegates to be chosen? When and where were they to convene? Whowould preside? By what rules should the convention conductitself'.? What rights and privileges would delegates have? Howwere conflicts between state and federal law to be resolved? Heavy questions, these, and neither Congress nor any statehad spoken on the subject. Enter the VCL. Conferring with eminent Constitutional scholars, conductingexhaustive legal and historical research, feverishly circulatingdrafts of statutes, memoranda, briefs, summaries, etc. - theworking drawings of legal change - the VCL quickly produced aprototype state statute, which dealt with all of theorganizational problems involved in setting up Constitutionalconventions in the states. It was as invulnerable to legalchallenge as the best legal minds could make it. Called 'trulyrepresentative,' the conventions were carefully set up to mirrorexactly the preferences of voters. This was accomplished byvoters electing delegates pledged for or against repeal, andapportioning delegates based on the popular Vote. Thus the convention process became essentially a two-stepreferendum: voters would speak, and delegates would voteaccordingly. In no way were the conventions to be deliberativebodies. The pretense of debate was not to stand in the way ofrepeal. Copies of the draft bills were sent to every governor andlegislative leader in all the states. Utilizing their impressivenetwork of affiliate-members throughout the forty-eight states,as well as their exquisite and plucky legal skills, the VCLprovided expert witnesses for legislative hearings, submittedthorough legal briefs, defended legal challenges, answeredConstitutional questions - in short, enabled states to preparefor the day that Congress would pass a repeal resolution and sendit to the states for ratification. Congress finally loosened the steamroller on February 20,1933, and by December 5, in thirty-six states (the necessarythree-fourths) legislation setting up conventions had beenenacted, the conventions had been called, delegates had beenelected and convened, and the repeal resolution had passed! Thefinal roll call vote, in Utah, was eagerly monitored by millionsover a national radio broadcast. Nearly all the states that ratified the repeal resolutionrelied heavily on the prototype statute promulgated by the VCL.Many enacted it verbatim, others borrowed from it heavily. Several hours after Utah ratified the 2lst Amendment, whilemillions of Americans were celebrating, the VCL treasurer quietlybalanced the books by making a final contribution from his ownpocket in the amount of $6.66, and closed them permanently. Who were they? At its peak, the VCL claimed around 3,500 'affiliate' lawyersin all states among its members. The organization was managed,however, by a tight coterie of nine impeccably established 'whiteshoe' lawyers. For the entire term of its existence, the VCL was chaired byJoseph H. Choate, Jr., a graduate of Harvard College and HarvardLaw School, son of Theodore Roosevelt's ambassador to England,and an eminent Park Avenue lawyer. The organization's treasurerwas Harrison Tweed, another Harvard/Harvard man, one of thecountry's most successful lawyers, and a prime mover in manyimportant civic causes. Choate and Tweed and seven others, similarly pedigreed,called themselves the Executive Committee, and prudently managedthe affairs of the organization. They were elite, but by no meanselitist. They solicited affiliates in every state andparticipation by as many lawyers as possible, using ads placed inlawyers' magazines. Every inquiry brought a thoughtful anddeliberate response as well as an appeal for financial support. The executive committee hired an Executive Secretary, Mrs.H.P. Rhoudy, who ran the national office, and visited many statecapitals, enlisting local lawyers and political figures in thecause. Her dispatches back to NewYork ring of diplomacy at itsbest. What motivated these men? Their formal corporate charter,adopted in 1927, declared their grievances: The Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act violate thebasic principles of our law and government and encroach upon thepowers properly reserved to the States and the people. Theattempt to enforce them has been productive of such evils andabuses as are necessarily incident to a violation of thoseprinciples, including: disrespect for laws; obstruction of thedue administration of justice; corruption of public officials;abuse of legal process; resort by the Government to improper andillegal acts in the procurement of evidence; infringement of suchconstitutional guarantees as immunity from double jeopardy andillegal search and seizure. Surely, the VCL executive committee were men of society whereProhibition was decidedly unpopular, but their declared objectivewas to excise from the Constitution a vexatious and festeringsore. When they achieved that objective, they disbanded. What are the lessons of their success? Certainly, timing,preparation, and the creed of any good lobbyist: that one doesn'thave to be a politician to make policy. A more foreboding lesson is that the United StatesConstitution, upon which we ultimately rely for the preservationof our form of government and our sacred individual liberties, ishighly vulnerable to the force of public opinion. If the 18thAmendment can be repealed in a mere 288 days, cannot the First,or the Fifth? As the VCL prototype statute was not specific torepeal, the mechanism they helped put in place likely remains onthe book in all states that enacted it. Leaders of the VCL were railroad lawyers. What railroads paidthem handsomely for, they did for the public gratis. They saw atrain coming, and hurriedly secured all the rights and easementsnecessary if it were to reach its destination, avoiding a morassof debilitating lawsuits and other legal complications. Had theynot made this vital contribution, ratification may well havefailed.

Intoxication and overdoses Intoxication Overdose Alcohol intoxication and overdose Barbiturate overdose Methanol poisoning Narcotic overdose Salicylate overdose Tricyclic antidepressant overdose Drug-induced psychosis INTOXICATION Intoxication may be defined as the intake of a quantity of a substance which exceeds the individual's tolerance and produces behavioural or physical abnormalities. OVERDOSE Overdose may be defined as the state that occurs when a person has ingested a drug quantity higher than the recommended therapeutic dose and that also exceeds his/her tolerance. Note: This section offers some guidelines, basic points and reminders, but is not a comprehensive manual for the management of overdosing and poisonings. When presented with an intoxicated or overdose patient basic ABC procedures should be followed. In acute overdose it is recommended that patients are closely observed, monitored and referred to an acute care hospital. A basic modern text on toxicology is Ellenhorn, M. and Barceloux, D.G. Medical toxicology: diagnosis and treatment of human poisoning, Elsevier, New York, 1988. ALCOHOL INTOXICATION AND OVERDOSE Clinically obvious alcohol intoxication occurs in non-tolerant individuals at blood alcohol levels of approximately 34 mmol/litre. In alcohol-dependent persons marked tolerance to the behavioural effects of alcohol may develop. It is not unusual for such patients to appear unimpaired with a blood alcohol level of 60-70 mmol/litre. Coma develops in most individuals when a blood alcohol level is 90-120 mmol/litre. If the blood alcohol level is less than 100 mmol/litre with a patient in coma or unconscious, another drug, concurrent brain injury or other disease should be suspected. BARBITURATE OVERDOSE Management Forced intravenous fluids and where necessary diuretic therapy and alkalinisation Haemodialysis may be necessary No treatment options have been shown to be more effective than supporting the airway, respiration, circulation and renal function Alkalinisation of the urine is useful with phenobarbital and barbital overdose Requires the support of an intensive care unit if airway support is required. METHANOL POISONING Methanol is used in some industrial processes. It is not the same as methylated spirits which in Australia is 95% ethanol and only up to 5% methanol as a denaturant. Methanol is a potential killer and those who survive may become blind, as the metabolites of methanol are particularly toxic to the optic nerve. Toxicity is related to two factors: oxidation of methanol by alcohol dehydrogenase to formaldehyde and formic acid severe metabolic acidosis. Initially central confusion and blindness may occur and it may then be too late for effective treatment. Early recognition and treatment is, therefore, very important. A lethal dose of methanol varies from person to person. A dose of more than 30 mL of absolute methanol is regarded as potentially lethal. Management Block metabolism of methanol. This is achieved by the administration of ethanol which preferentially saturates the alcohol dehydrogenase pathway in the liver. In most cases ethanol can be given orally or via a gastric tube. An initial dose of 0.6-1.00 gram/kilogram as absolute alcohol should be given (this would be equivalent to 50-87.5 mL of absolute alcohol for a 70 kilogram person). When ethanol is given intravenously a similar loading dose of 0.6 grams/kilogram is administered over 30 minutes. Absolute alcohol should be diluted to a 15% solution when used in this manner. Treat metabolic acidosis by the use of intravenous bicarbonate if necessary. Haemodialysis required if the blood methanol level is more than 20 mmol/litre. Monitor arterial blood gases, blood methanol and ethanol level on a regular basis. The objective of management is to keep the blood pH normal and blood ethanol level at approximately 25 mmol/litre until methanol has been eliminated. The supports of an intensive care unit are required. NARCOTIC OVERDOSE Intermittent or dependent narcotic users are prone to accidental overdose because they often overestimate their own tolerance or are unaware of the potency of the drug they use. Slow respiration (2-7/minute), usually deep compared with the shallow and more rapid respiration associated with intoxication by barbiturates, etc. Pinpoint pupils Cyanosis, weak pulse, bradycardia Possible pulmonary oedema Twitching of muscles Subnormal temperature may occur. Management Naloxone (0.4 mg intravenously) may be repeated in 3 minute intervals as required if respiratory depression occurs. Such patients need to be carefully monitored for the signs of respiratory depression, and repeated. Dialysis and stimulants are not indicated. If pulmonary oedema is present maintain oxygenation by adequate support of ventilation. Frusemide may be required. It is most important to maintain adequate airway, oxygen where necessary, artificial ventilation and cardiac massage. In some cases vasopressor agents may be required. Urgent transfer by resuscitation ambulance to an intensive care unit may be required. SALICYLATE OVERDOSE Overdose with salicylates alone or as a polydrug is common in chronic drug abusers. Keep the patient under observation if the salicylate level is more than 2 mmol/litre or if a dose is taken of more than 150 mg/kilogram. Blood levels of 3-4.5 mmol/litre produce mild intoxication. 4.5-7.0 mmol/litre produce moderate intoxication. More than 7.0 mmol/litre produce severe intoxication. Management Supportive therapy is usually sufficient for salicylate concentrations of less than 4 mmol/litre. If concentrations are more 7.0 mmol/litre haemodialysis should be considered. Forced intravenous fluids together with diuretic therapy and alkalinisation of urine. Patients should not be allowed to become acidotic because acidosis causes increased amounts of salicylates to enter cell membranes. Full investigation of electrolytes, blood sugar, salicylate concentrations, blood gases and prothrombin time should be done at regular intervals. Aquamephyton 10 mg subcutaneously should be given. Continue treatment until the salicylate level is less than 2 mmol/litre. TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANT OVERDOSE The use of the tricyclic antidepressants is common by those involved with drugs of abuse. This drug in large dosage can cause coma, cardiac arrhythmias and anti-cholinergic effect; mortality risk is high. Management A cardiac monitor should be used to detect cardiac arrhythmias and these would require treatment according to the evidence of cardiotoxicity. DRUG-INDUCED PSYCHOSIS Many drugs used recreationally can produce psychosis when taken in high doses. Any user showing psychosis requires a detailed assessment. Clinical features Predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors of drug psychosis Management Clinical features Drug-induced psychosis is characterised by: perceptual disturbance hallucinations � visual, auditory or somatic unusual sensations or experience of oneself, others or the outside world thought disorder abnormal thought patterns incomplete sentences delusions disorientation in time, place or person history and evidence of recent drug use. Predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors of drug psychosis Predisposition to drug psychosis multiple drug use family history or personal history of psychotic illness, particularly schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder any compromised cognitive function (eg personal history of head injury or intellectual disability) Precipitating factors of drug psychosis type of drug hallucinogens, eg LSD, magic mushrooms psychostimulants cannabis solvents drug use in non-supportive environments Perpetuating factors which may lead to drug psychosis further drug use in hospital, eg drugs provided by visitors concurrent drug withdrawal. Management There is a medical emergency which requires detailed assessment. Danger to oneself and others needs to be determined. The more disorganised and bizarre the person is, the greater the risk. Admit, observe and detain if necessary in a secure environment. May require psychiatric management, preferably in hospital with good medical facilities. Detailed drug-use history is needed from collateral informants and patient Major tranquillisers are needed (eg 5-10 mg intramuscular haloperidol immediately. This can be repeated half hourly/hourly for 4 doses). Expert reassessment will be required. Unpredictability of patient behaviour is characteristic and is the feature which poses significant risk. Quite sudden, unexpected serious suicidal behaviour or aggressive behaviour can occur, eg jumping out of a window. Unprovoked attacks on staff or other people, although rare, can occur. Occasionally a patient may have a mixed picture 24-72 hours after admission, eg alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal may emerge as drug psychosis is settling. This should be anticipated especially in polydrug use. Detoxification may need to follow, and options need to be discussed with the patient. In the long term: develop a management plan, especially for patients with dual diagnosis (eg schizophrenia and heroin dependence).

DARE Scare: Turning Children Into Informants? WP 1/29/94 9:00 PM By James Bovard DRUG ABUSE Resistance Education (DARE) is currently beingtaught by police officers to more than 5 million children in morethan 250,000 classrooms each year. The brainchild of former LosAngeles police chief Daryl Gates, the DARE program is directedmostly at fifth and sixth graders, though its activities can spankindergarten through 12th grade. Gates made headlines in 1989with his suggestion that drug users be taken out and shot, andhis brand of philosophical moderation permeates the DARE approachto drug abuse. On its face, DARE seems unobjectionable. It seeks to maximizeyoungsters' hostility to drugs by teaching them perils of drugsand reinforcing the message with DARE frisbees, DARE wristwatchesand an official DARE song ("Dare to keep a kid off dope/Dareto give a kid some hope"). Students are also able to win orpurchase DARE pencils, erasers, workbooks and certificates ofachievement. But along with the anti-drug paraphernalia may come a moreominous effect: children informing on their drug-using parents. The program was created partly as a result of Gates'sfrustrations with police sting operations in the schools. Untilthe late 1980s, Los Angeles police officers routinely wentundercover as high school students in order to implore realstudents to buy drugs from them. In 1987, the American CivilLiberties Union complained, "When other adults try to getyoung people involved with drugs, we call it contributing to thedelinquency of a minor. When the LAPD does it, we call it theschool-buy program." Finding young people who would buy drugs proved quite easy.Unfortunately, it had little effect on drug use by students. AsGates told the Los Angeles Times last September, "We keptbuying more and more. It was appalling, depressing. I finallysaid: `This is crazy. We've got to do something.' " The result was DARE. Winning the trust of youngsters is anessential feature of DARE. Policemen sit and talk with childrenduring lunch hour and play games with them during recess. Thefederal Bureau of Justice Assistance noted in a 1988 report thatDARE "students have an opportunity to become acquainted withthe (police) officer as a trusted friend who is interested intheir happiness and welfare. Students occasionally tell theofficer about problems such as abuse, neglect, alcoholic parents,or relatives who use drugs." One of the first lessons found in DARE teaching materialsstresses the "Three R's": "Recognize, Resist andReport." The official DARE Officer's Guide for Grades K-4contains a worksheet that instructs children to "Circle thenames of the people you could tell if . . . a friend finds somepills"; the "Police" are listed along with"Mother or Father," "Teacher"or"Friend." The next exercise instructs children to checkboxes for whom they should inform if they "are asked to keepa secret" - the police are again listed as an option. Roberta Silverman, a spokeswoman for national DAREheadquarters in Los Angeles, rejects the idea that DARE teachesor encourages informing. "When students begin the DAREprogram they are specifically advised not talk about theirparents or friends. We are very clear that when DARE instructorsare in the classroom, they are there as teachers, not lawenforcement officers." Silverman says that the DARE Officer's Guide for Grades K-4is not part of the DARE core curriculum. "It lays thegroundwork for what the officers do later. It's more like genericsafety instruction, teaching kids about personal safety. The partabout keeping a secret is to get kids talking about molestation.It has nothing to do with drugs or with getting them to turntheir parents in." Silverman also says that "any time achild makes a disclosure (of parental drug use) to an officer,the DARE officer would be required like any other teacher toreport that to the proper authorities or agencies." Not surprisingly, children sometimes confide the names ofpeople they suspect are illegally using drugs. A mother andfather in Caroline County, Md., were jailed for 30 days aftertheir daughter informed a police DARE instructor that her parentshad marijuana plants in their home, according to a story in TheWashington Post in January 1993. The Wall Street Journal reportedin 1992 that "In two recent cases in Boston, children whohad tipped police stepped out of their homes carrying DAREdiplomas as police arrived to arrest their parents." In1991, 10-year-old Joaquin Herrera of Englewood, Colo., phoned911, announced, "I'm a DARE kid" and summoned police tohis house to discover a couple of ounces of marijuana hidden in abookshelf, according to the Rocky Mountain News. The boy satoutside his parents' home in a police patrol car while the policesearched the home and arrested the parents. The policemanassigned to the boy's school commended the boy's action. Police and DARE officials keep no statistics on how many drugbusts result from the program. And DARE officials say thatreports of kids informing on their parents cannot fairly beattributed to DARE. "I think to focus on these few incidents is to do adisservice to people who are at the forefront of preventionefforts in this country," DARE's Silverman said. "Thereare 25 million kids who have been exposed to DARE and a handfulof cases of informing that may or may not be related to DARE atall." Nine-year-old Darrin Davis of Douglasville, Ga., called 911after he found a small amount of speed hidden in his parent'sbedroom because, as he told the Dallas Morning News, "Atschool, they told us that if we ever see drugs, call 911 becausepeople who use drugs need help . . . . I thought the police wouldcome get the drugs and tell them that drugs are wrong. They neversaid they would arrest them. . . . But in court, I heard themtell the judge that I wanted my mom and dad arrested. That is alie. I did not tell them that." The arrest wrecked hisparents' lives, said the Dallas newspaper; both parents losttheir jobs, a bank threatened to foreclose on their homes and hisfather was kept in jail for three months. Silverman says that the details of the case prove how murkysuch cases are. While Darrin Davis had been in a DARE program,she says that he did not report his parents to the DARE officerand that there was evidence that the parents were also involvedin drug trafficking, thus putting their child at risk. "It's making a mountain out of a molehill," shesays. Whatever DARE's effect on families, its record atdiscouraging drug use is the subject of some controversy. A studyfinanced by the National Institute on Drug Abuse on the effect ofDARE on Kentucky students between 1987 and 1992 reported "nostatistically significant differences between experimental groupsand control groups in the percentage of new users of . . .cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, alcohol and marijuana." More recently, the National Institute of Justice hiredResearch Triangle Institute (RTI) to survey and evaluate all thepublished research on DARE, and RTI's preliminary conclusionswere largely negative. The RTI's evaluation concluded that only eight publishedstudies of DARE's effectiveness were statistically valid. SusanEnnett, one of the lead researchers on the RTI project, concludedthat these eight studies found that DARE's effects on drug use bychildren ranged from "limited to nonexistent." DAREsays that other experts have criticized the methodology of theRTI study and notes that it has not yet completed the peer reviewprocess. DARE claims that of 23 studies of DARE, 20 found theprogram effective in shaping anti-drug attitudes and behavior. At a March 1993 conference about drug education at theUniversity of California at San Diego, social science researchersagreed that after 10 years of operation there is little evidencethat DARE actually reduces drug use among the young. WilliamHanson, one of the early advisers to DARE and currently aprofessor at Wake Forest University, said, "I think theprogram should be entirely scrapped and redeveloped anew." Many Americans, numbed by politicians' harsh rhetoricregarding drug use, may feel that policemen should be able to useany means available to detect drug users. Many DARE instructorshave the best of intentions. But is that an excuse for governmentprograms that endanger the bonds between children and parents?

Heroin Introduction pharmacology patterns of drug use problems associated with heroin use Complications Withdrawal Management of heroin dependence Methadone maintenance Methadone maintenance programs Heroin use and hiv/aids INTRODUCTION As an analgesic heroin is safe, effective and has a wide safety margin. However, it is perceived by many as a 'horror drug'. The situation demonstrates the powerful influence of policies or legal status of a drug on the lives of those who choose to use the substance unlawfully. PHARMACOLOGY Heroin is a semi-synthetic opiate derived from morphine. It is produced in minimal amounts legally and street heroin is produced in illicit laboratories. The chemical is a white crystalline powder, soluble in water. Coloured preparations reflect different contaminants present. The drug is most commonly administered by injection (IV or IM) but it is also active if smoked. While the drug can be used orally it is more often used parenterally because this is a far more cost effective means of achieving the desired psychoactive effects. The onset of action is rapid and the duration of action is approximately 3-4 hours. The immediate effect or 'rush' after an IV dose is related to the high fat solubility of the drug and thus its rapid entry into the brain. PATTERNS OF DRUG USE As heroin is not legally available in Australia, illegal users obtain supplies of the drug on the street. This results in the dosage being: of variable amount; and contaminated by a variety of diluents of varying quality and safety. Most users inject their dose using a number of solvents for the powder they purchase. Acidifying agents are used to facilitate dissolving the drug and these in their own right may produce complications (eg fungal contamination of lemon juice). Users inject intermittently and may pass from recreational use (1 x week or less) to a major habit where doses costing up to $1000 day are used in 3-4 injections. It is apparent that treating an individual who shoots up four times a day with heroin would prove very difficult if each dose had to be supervised. Many illicit users are unable to obtain regular doses every day and will substitute heroin with other CNS depressants, typically benzodiazepines. PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH HEROIN USE Apart from the risk of overdose which is a direct CNS effect of the drug, most complications of heroin use relate to the injection of contaminated material, or the use of non-sterile injecting equipment. COMPLICATIONS Acute heroin reaction � a syndrome with acute onset and signs of cardiovascular collapse; may prove fatal. Septic complications (often resulting from the use of non-sterile injecting equipment): septicemia bacterial endocarditis skin abscesses infective emboli ophthalmitis � fungal viral infections � hepatitis B hepatitis C HIV. Neurological complications: infections embolic lesions trauma to nerves from direct injection. Sexual transmission of HIV, hepatitis B. WITHDRAWAL Dependence, both physical and psychological, results from regular use of the drug and withdrawal will develop within 12 hours of ceasing regular usage. Maximal withdrawal symptoms are experienced between 36 and 72 hours and symptoms consist of: chills and shivering excessive sweating gooseflesh is prominent (cold turkey) irritability insomnia loss of appetite rhinorrhoea and lacrimation muscle aches and cramps, restlessness diarrhoea yawning. MANAGEMENT OF HEROIN DEPENDENCE Management of heroin dependence is complex. A number of alternatives are available to those who are opioid-dependent. Treatment options include methadone substitution, detoxification in a hospital or approved detoxification centre, supervised outpatient detoxification, drug-free therapeutic community programs, rehabilitation in a residential centre, individual or family counselling and self-help groups. While drug-free treatments attract fewer patients than methadone maintenance, have lower rates of retention in treatment, and lower rates of successful graduation to a sustained drug-free lifestyle, they have been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency of injecting drug use. The natural history of opiate dependence indicates that many do grow through their period of dependence irrespective of treatments offered. Each approach aids some patients but by no means all. The morbidity of heroin users is significantly higher than that of their non-drug using peers. This reflects the severity of many of the complications they experience, including those related to their drug-seeking lifestyle, eg nutritional deficits, violence. METHADONE MAINTENANCE(6) Short-term effects Long-term effects Methadone has been employed in the management of heroin users for over 20 years, but despite this many arguments continue to rage regarding the place of this treatment approach. Methadone, a synthetic opiate, replaces heroin and in doing so decreases the need for heroin-dependent individuals to regularly use the intravenous opiate. As methadone has a longer life in the body than heroin, clients participating in a methadone maintenance program receive a single prescribed dose of methadone every day. The dose is determined according to the characteristics of the individual. The amount of methadone prescribed is enough to eliminate withdrawal symptoms for 24-36 hours, while still allowing the individual to undertake normal activities and functions. The client must take the prescribed dose every day to ensure a stable level of methadone in the bloodstream and control any physical effects which may be experienced. The effects of the drug will vary from person to person. While some individuals will not experience any adverse effects, the strength of effects and their duration may depend upon the size of the dose and the frequency of administration. Short-term effects sweating and increased body odour analgesia euphoria miosis problems with sexual functioning nausea and vomitingor adjusted.* depressed respirationor adjusted.* intense constipation* below-normal drop in temperatureor adjusted.* slow pulse, heart palpitations, low blood pressureor adjusted.* poor blood circulationor adjusted.* * These effects should not usually occur if the appropriate dose of methadone has been prescribed. However, if any of these effects occur, they should be reported immediately and dose and frequency of administration monitored or adjusted. Long-term effects Methadone, when administered in pure and regular doses as part of a treatment program, should not have any severe long-term effects on an individual's health. Possible long-term effects: weight increase, usually due to fluid retention or change in diet tooth decay, due to reduction in amount of saliva produced (is often present prior to participation in methadone program) may lead to impotence or delayed ejaculation in some men loss of libido has been reported by some women amenorrhoea disrupted menstrual cycles reduced fertility methadone can be particularly harmful to people with kidney and liver diseases. These effects are often emphasised by the opiate-dependent and their suppliers to avoid treatment. WARNING: OVERDOSING CAN BE FATAL MIXING DRUGS CAN BE DANGEROUS Using other drugs with methadone can be dangerous. This includes alcohol, tranquillisers and cannabis. While some drugs reduce or change the effects of methadone, methadone itself can alter the effectiveness of other drugs, or produce unexpected side effects. It is very important that people inform their doctor or dentist of their participation in a methadone maintenance program to ensure that they are not prescribed anything which could affect the treatment, and so that other medical procedures (eg administration of anaesthetics) are safe. METHADONE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS In establishing an effective methadone program, it is appropriate to have a clear view of what the methadone is being used for. Guidelines for achieving success should include: establishing the goals and objectives of the program educating staff on the goals and objectives and reasons for them providing information to patients on the goals of the program establishing a working system directed to achieving the goals adhering to unit policy. This list does not suggest that policies may vary from unit to unit and this is indeed the case. Perhaps the most common use of methadone is in the form of a long-term maintenance program in which patients receive a once-daily doses of methadone over a period of months or, in many cases, years. Urine testing is carried out in almost all programs and it is appropriate for patients to be challenged if heroin use continues. Exactly what steps should be taken in a patient who persistently uses heroin remains debatable. The approval of a State health authority is required both for doctors to prescribe methadone and for a drug-dependent person to receive it. Methadone maintenance is a complicated treatment for a complex group of patients. Individuals should not embark on such programs without very clear guidelines and without links to a major unit that can provide support should difficulties arise. HEROIN USE AND HIV/AIDS The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has three main modes of transmission. It can be transmitted through the exchange of HIV-infected body fluids during unprotected sex; through the use of HIV-contaminated injecting equipment; and may be passed on from mother to child during pregnancy or birth, and possibly via breast milk during feeding. Injecting drug users are potentially at risk for transmission of HIV through sexual contact or use of non-sterile injecting equipment. As there is no cure for HIV/AIDS, the only way to curb its rapid spread is by eliminating or modifying the risk behaviours involved in its transmission. For injecting drug users changes may include abstinence, or if this is not feasible, either changing the route of administration of the drug (eg oral ingestion or smoking), or undertaking safer injecting practices, namely, not sharing injecting equipment or, if sharing, properly cleaning the equipment by either sterilising or rinsing with bleach. Medical practitioners and other health workers to should alert injecting drug users to the risks of HIV transmission and provide them with information about safe sexual and injecting behaviour. Appropriate information may include: warning about the risks of needle sharing needle and syringe cleaning techniques the availability of clean needles and syringes or needle exchange programs in the area safer sexual practices the availability of free condoms. New users and irregular users are also a group which are at high risk of contracting the HIV infection through the use of contaminated injecting equipment. For new users this occurs because they are usually initiated with the use of an experienced user's injecting equipment, while for irregular users their drug use is often unplanned and thus they may share needles because they do not possess the necessary equipment. Methadone maintenance programs have been found to be effective in reducing the frequency of injecting and the incidence of needle sharing. They are also effective dissemination points for information about HIV/AIDS, and for users who may be infected with HIV they provide vital contact with the health system.

Aired Sunday,December 27, 1992 Titled: Rx Drugs By: Ed Bradley Ed:       Can Britain teach us anything about dealing with drugs?  That             remains to be seen.  But one thing seems certain, there is                little or nothing we can teach them.  They tried our hard line            methods back in the 70's and 80's and all they got for their              trouble was more drugs, more crime, and more addicts.  So they            went back to their old way of letting doctors prescribe                   whatever drug a particular addict was hooked on.  Does it                 work?  If they're ever going to know, Liverpool, where drugs              are out of control is the place to find out.                    Ed:       This is a gram of 100% pure heroin, it is pharmaceutically                prepared.  On the streets it would be cut 10 to 15 times and              sell for about $2,000.  But take it away from the black                   market, make it legal, and heroin is a pretty cheap drug.  The            British National Health Service (NHS) pays about $10.00 for               this gram of heroin.  And for an addict with a prescription,              it is free.                                                     Ed:       In Britain, doctors who hold a special license from the                   government are allowed to prescribe hard drugs to addicts.                Dr. John Marks is psychiatrist who runs an addiction clinic               just outside of Liverpool and has been prescribing heroin for             years.                                                          Dr.       If a drug taker is determined to continue their drug use,       Marks:    treating them is an expensive waste of time... and, really,               the choices that I am being offered and society is being                  offered, is drugs from the clinic or drugs from the Mafia.      Ed:       To get drugs from the clinic rather than the Mafia, addicts               have to take a urine test to prove they are taking the drug               they say they are.  And unlike most other addiction clinics               where you have to say you want to kick the habit before                   they'll take you in, addicts here have to convince Dr. Marks,             a nurse and a social worker they intend to stay on drugs come             what may.                                                                 But does Dr. Marks try to cure people?                          Dr.       Cure people?  Nobody can.  Regardless of whether you stick      Marks:    them in prison, put them in mental hospitals and give them                shock treatment, we have done all these things, put them in a             nice rehab center away in the country, give them a nice social            worker and pat them on the head, give them drugs, give them no            drugs, does not matter what you do.  5% per annum, 1 in 20 per            year, get off spontaneously.  Compound interested up that                 reaches about 50% (50/50) after ten years are off drugs.  They            seem to mature out of addiction regardless of any intervention            in the interim but you can keep them alive and healthy and                legal during that 10 years, if you so wish to.                  Ed:       By giving them drugs?                                           Dr.       It doesn't get them off drugs, it doesn't prolong their         Marks:    addiction, either.  But it stops them offending, it keeps them            healthy and it keeps them alive.                                Ed:       That's exactly what happened to Julia Scott.  Although she                doesn't look it, Julia is a heroin addict.  For the last three            years the heroin she injects every day comes from a                       prescription.  Before, she had to feed her habit by working as            a prostitute, a vicious circle that led her to use more heroin            to cope with that life.                                         Julia:    Once you get in that circle you can't get out.  I didn't think            I was ever going to get out.                                    Ed:       But once you got the prescription?                              Julia:    I stopped straight away.                                        Ed:       Never went back?                                                Julia:    No, never.  I went back once just to see and I was almost                 physically sick just to see those girls doing what I used to              do.                                                             Ed:       Julia says she's now able to have normal relation, to hold                down a job as a waitress and to care for her 3 year old                   daughter.  Without the prescription, where do you think you               would be?                                                       Julia:    I would probably be dead now.                                   Ed:       Once, they have gotten their prescriptions, addicts must show             up for regular meetings to show that they are staying healthy             and free from crime.  But how can anyone be healthy if they               are taking a drug like heroin?                                  Alan      Pure heroin is not dangerous.  We have people on massive doses  Perry:    of heroin.                                                      Ed:       Alan Perry is a former Drug Information Officer for the local             Health Authority and now a counselor at the clinic.  So how               come we see so much damage caused by heroin?                    Alan:     The heroin that is causing that damage, is not causing damage             because of the heroin in it, it is causing damage because of              the bread dust, coffee, crushed bleach crystals, anything that            causes the harm and if heroin is 90% adulterated that means               only 10% is heroin, the rest is rubbish, and if you inject                cement into your veins, you don't have to be a medical expert             to work it out, that's going to cause harm.                     Ed:       Many at the clinic like George still suffer from the damage               caused by street drugs.  Alan Perry believes you can't                    prescribe clean drugs and needles to addicts without teaching             them how to use them.                                           Alan:     You know the major causes of ill health to drug injectors is              not even the dirty drugs they take, it is their bad technique.             Not knowing how to do it.  In America I have seen addicts                missing legs and arms and that is through bad technique.  So              we show people how to, not how to inject safely, but how to               inject less dangerously.  We have to be clear about that, you             have stoned people sticking needles in themselves in a                    dangerous activity.  The strategy is called "harm                         minimalization."                                                Ed:       George's legs have ulcerate and the veins have collapsed.  To             inject he must use a vein in his groin that is dangerously                close to an artery.                                             Alan:     When you get in there, do you get any sharp pains?              George:   No.                                                             Alan:     If you hit an artery how would you recognize it?                George:   By me head hitting the ceiling.                                 Ed:       In the 70's the British were not content with minimizing the              harm of drug abuse.  They adopted the American policy of                  trying to stamp it out all together.  Prescription drugs were             no longer widely available.  Addicts who couldn't kick the                habit had to find illegal sources.                                        The results:  By the end of the 80's drug addiction in Britain            had tripled.  In Liverpool there was so much heroin around, it            was known as "smack city".  And then came an even greater                 threat.                                                                   More than anything else, it has been the threat of AIDS that              has persuaded the British to return to their old policy of                maintaining addicts on the drug of their choice.                          In New York, it is estimated that more than half those who                inject drugs have contracted the AIDS virus through swapping              contaminated needles.  Here in Liverpool, the comparable                  number, the number of known addicts infected, is less than one            percent.                                                                  In an effort to get addicts away from injecting, Liverpool                pharmacist Jeremy Clitherow has developed what he called                  Heroin Reefers.  They are regular cigarettes with heroin in               them.  "Whatever you feel about smoking," he says, "these                 cigarettes hold fewer risks than needles for both the addicts             and the community.                                              Jeremy:   S, we then use this (hypodermic syringe) to put in a known                volume of pharmaceutical heroin into the patient's cigarette.             And, there we are, one heroin reefer containing exactly 60 mgs            of pharmaceutical heroin.                                       Ed:       So, that, the National Health Service will pay for the heroin             but not the cigarettes?                                         jeremy:   Oh, Yes,, of course, its the patients own cigarettes but with             the National Health Service Prescription in it.                 Ed:       Addicts pick up their prescriptions twice a week from his                 neighborhood pharmacy.  And how does this affect his other                customers?                                                      Jeremy:   The patient who comes in to pick up his prescription of heroin            in the form of reefers would be indistinguishable from a                  patient who picks any other medication.  The prescription is              ready and waiting and they pick it up just as they would pick             up their aspirin or bandages.                                   Ed:       But with all these drugs available to most people plus the                hard drugs that you have here, what's your security like?       Jeremy:   Like Fort Knox.  But we keep minimal stocks.  We buy the stuff            in regularly, frequently.  What comes in, goes out.             Ed:       And heroin isn't the only stuff to come in and out of here.               Clitherow also sells prescriptions for cocaine and that is                100% per free base cocaine.  In other words, crack.             Ed:       So, in fact, when you are putting cocaine in here you are                 actually making crack cigarettes?                               Jeremy:   Yes.                                                            Ed:       In America that has a very negative connotation, but not for              you?                                                            Jeremy:   Depends on which way you look at it.  If they continue to buy             on the street, whether it is heroin, methadone, crack, or                 whatever, sooner or later they will suffer from the                       merchandise they are buying.  I want to bring them into                   contact with the system and let them get their drug of choice,            if the physician agrees and prescribes it in a form which                 won't cause their health such awful deterioration.              Ed:       (to Dr. Marks)  And you don't have any problem giving people              injectable cocaine or cocaine cigarettes?                       Dr.       No, not in principle.  There are patients for whome I have      Marks:    prescribed cocaine, and to whom I have then stopped                       prescribing cocaine because their lives did not stabilize.                They continue to be thieves or whatever.  But, there are                  equally many more to whom we have prescribed cocaine, who have            then settled into regular sensible lives.                       Ed:       Michael Lythgoe is one who has settled into a regular sensible            life on cocaine.  He has a prescription from Dr. Marks for                both cocaine spray and the cocaine cigarettes. Before he got              that prescription, the cocaine he bought on the street cost               him nearly $1,000 a week, which at first he managed to take               from his own business, but it wasn't long before it cost him              much more than that.                                                      .... so you lost your business, you lost your wife, you lost              your kids and the house but you kept going after the cocaine?   Michael:  Yes, that is what addiction is, that is the very nature of                addiction, if the fact that one is virtually chemically and               physically forced to continue that way.                         Ed:       Now, after two years of controlled use on prescription drugs,             Mike has voluntarily reduced his does, he has got himself a               regular job with a trucking company and is slowing putting his            life back together.                                             Ed:       Where do you think you would be now if Dr. Marks had not given            you a prescription for cocaine?                                 Michael:  I wouldn't be here talking to you.  And you probably wouldn't             be interested in talking to me either.  I'd be on the street.   Ed:       Dr. Marks, how would you reply to critics who say that you are            nothing more than a legalized dealer, a pusher?                 Dr.       I'd agree.  That is what the State of England arranges.  That   Marks:    there is a legal controlled supply of drugs.  The whole                   concept behind that is control.                                 Ed:       And there are signst that control is working.  Within the area            of the clinic, Alan Perry says, the police have reported a                significant drop in drug related crime and since addicts don't            have to deal anymore to support their habit, they're not                  recruiting new customers.  So, far fewer new people are being             turned on to drugs.                                             Ed:       What about dealers around the area of the clinic?               Alan:     There are not any around the clinic.                            Ed:       You have taken away their business?                             Alan:     Exactly, there is no business there, the scene is                         disappearing.  So, if you want to get really into a problem               whih presumably all societies do, there are ways of doing it.             But you have to counter your own moral and political                      prejudices.                                                     Ed:       (to Julia)  What can you say to people who would ask why give             addicts what they want?  Why give them drugs?                   Julia:    So they can live, to have a chance to live like everyone else             does.  No one would hesitate to give other sort of maintaining            drugs to diabetics.  Diabetics have insulin, in my mind it is             no different, it is the same.  I need heroin to live.

SELF-HELP GROUPS Alcoholics Anonymous Al-Anon and Alateen Narcotics Anonymous Smoking cessation Alcoholics Anonymous Established in 1935, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA): was the first self-help group in modern times appears to be the single most powerful force in bringing dependent alcoholics to permanent contented sobriety is a self-help group for the support and rehabilitation of dependent alcoholics has the largest membership of over one million members in 110 mainly western countries. The AA philosophy and organisation is summed up in the Twelve Traditions and the Twelve Steps. The Twelve Traditions Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon AA unity. For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority � a loving God as he may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern. The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking. Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups of AA as a whole. Each group has but one primary purpose � to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers. An AA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the AA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property and prestige divert us from our primary purpose. Every AA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions. AA should remain forever non-professional, but our service centres may employ special workers. AA as such, ought never be organised; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve. 1Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the AA name ought never be drawn into public controversy. Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and film. Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities. The Twelve Steps We admitted we were powerless over alcohol � that our lives had become unmanageable. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understand Him. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. Admitted to God, and to our selves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, expect when to do so would injure them or others. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs. Note: In this context God means a 'higher power' and need not have a particular religious or Christian connotation. Doctors need to understand and cooperate with AA by: attending open meetings from time to time (the best way of beginning to understand the alcoholic-dependent person) using every possible means to bring the alcoholic-dependent to AA membership making contact with local AA members who are skilled in the 'Twelve Steps' or experienced sponsors.

We are recovering addicts who meet regularly to help each other stay free of drugs. The only requirement for membership is the desire to stop using drugs. Since its beginning in California in 1953, NA has grown to include meetings in 43 countries. There are over 12 000 groups worldwide, and since the 1980s this number grows 100% every 18 months. There are no strings attached to NA. We are not affiliated with any other organisations, we have no initiation fees or dues, no pledges to sign, no promises to make to anyone. We are not connected with any political, religious or law enforcement groups, and are under no surveillance at any time. Anyone may join us regardless of age, race, sexual identity, creed, religion or lack of religion. NA structure and services Although there is no formal organisation within NA, service boards and committees are formed by and for the groups which comprise the NA service structure. Various service committees perform services for the groups, larger areas and regions. NA is guided in all its activities by Twelve Traditions. NA members perform volunteer services which make possible many activities of NA such as arranging meeting places, answering telephones, special meetings in hospitals and institutions and providing information about NA to the public. All of this helps us to achieve our primary purpose besides 'staying clean' and that is to carry the message of recovery. NA does not provide education, counselling, drug-related research, detoxification, psychiatric or medical diagnosis. Spirituality of the Narcotics Anonymous Program Our fellowship is based on spiritual principles, not on any particular religious philosophy. The spiritual aspect of NA has been found to be of utmost importance to ongoing recovery and every member is encouraged to find his or her own interpretation of a power greater than themselves. The Twelve Steps are the basis of our personal recovery. The anonymity of members Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities. This tradition ensures that one member's personal opinion, identity and circumstances are never held in higher esteem than the program as a whole. The principle of anonymity protects our groups and members, and allows us to carry the message of recovery to addicts. NA's Twelve Traditions are the foundation which allows every member an equal chance for recovery and ensures the unity of our fellowship.

MEYERS, M.D. Professor of Pharmacology, University of California, SanFrancisco, CA   Note from Cliff Schaffer: This was sent to me personally byDr. Meyers, with a few of his own hand written notes. He was thehead of the Research Advisory Panel for the State of Californiaand states that this speech paraphrases the conclusions of theResearch Advisory Panel. The premise of this meeting--- that the legislature must atthis time accept the suggestions of the nominal experts inproblems of drug abuse here assembled and begin thedecriminalization of drug use-- appears at first glance to bepresumptuous. It is not, however, if one considers ourdeteriorating social and economic state and the forbiddingprospect of the adjustments that must be made by thelegislature at this session. I think that no area of informed, disinterested thinking willchallenge the conclusion that whatever we have attempted bylegislation to regulate the use of the emotionally loaded streetdrugs --- that is, excluding the laudable alcohol---has beenpalpably damaging. The prohibition or legal approach has not beenmerely ineffective but that approach, rather than the effects ofthe drugs themselves, is responsible for the individual andsocietal damage that so appropriately concerns us. Heroin, indeedthe non-medical use of narcotics in general, cannot be inherentlytoo dangerous or harmful or the legislature would not havemandated the provision of methadone, a pharmacologicallyequivalent narcotic, to some of our heroin habituated citizens. It is, then, the reaction of society to the use of certaindrugs rather than the drug effects themselves that cause theproblems and damage that concern us. I react to these problems as I see them in individual patientsand am most concerned about the damage imposed on the individualby social drug use less dangerous to society than the use ofalcohol and by compulsive drug use that is not that differentfrom cigarette smoking. The physical damage and consequent costto society in medical care is much less with heroin, but,cigarettes being legal and relatively inexpensive, the smoker isnot subject to the risk of prosecution or of being driven tocriminal activity. A California legislator in 1992 would, I should think, be moreinterested in the expense involved to the state and recognize anarea where budgetary relief can be achieved with a social andhumanitarian gain rather than the curtailment of a program ofsome value. The financial burden at each governmental level ofenforcing laws whose violation cannot be managed by ordinarypolice tactics is significant. Even greater is the expense anddisorganization imposed by the associated criminal activity onpolice, jail, court, prison, probation and parole activities. Now in deciding whether to accept my thesis, be influenced byyour own observations and common sense, which will establish theclinching argument: all of the enforcement activity of the pastfifty years has been wasted in that the use of more and morevaried drugs has grown progressively to its present level. Before discussing what changes should be made and in whatorder, I will acknowledge and meet the fear of legislators that ashow of rationality will be interpreted as being "soft ondrugs". This idea will be imposed, and the conclusionspresented here today will be challenged only by agents of what Icall the enforcement industry. (Or at least the administratorsof those agencies. I have not recently met an agent orinvestigator working at the street level who thinks that the waron drugs has been or can be won, and I do work with peaceofficers.) Workers in the enforcement area are given to protecting aspecial position within police work. They are not disinterestedinformants just as I am not a disinterested informant in mattersof pay and privilege for U.C. professors. They have greatinfluence on those citizens who depend on the daily media, pressor TV, or who confuse TV dramas with reality. The daily press isnot required to be accurate or comprehensive or to providefollow-up; it is required only to report more or less accuratelywhatever information, misleading or otherwise, is provided by aninformant who may not even be identified. Thus we have had a longseries of largest ever seizures, biggest dealer ever, etc, but itis street level users who resorted to crime to"maintain" who congest our system of criminal justice,and we see no relief in the face of more and more money forenforcement. I insist that if you examine more deliberate, qualityjournalism from as liberal as one dares to be today, for example,The Nation , across the spectrum to Buckley's conservativejournal; if you examine the technical literature of medicine,sociology and even economics and if you note the names andpositions of people supportive of organizations such as the DrugPolicy Foundation, you will agree with my statement above that noarea of informed, disinterested thought disagrees with theconclusions of this meeting. Their agreement is often expressedin terms of legalization of drugs, but, except for radicals likeBuckley and Greenspan, decriminalization is meant. The time for academic discussion has passed. Now it is time tothink tactically, no longer asking if the drug laws should bechanged to achieve decriminalization but looking at what changesshould be made and in what order. My discussion from here on, that is, the changes and tacticssuggested to the legislature, is almost entirely quotes orparaphrases from a report to the legislature by the ResearchAdvisory Panel. I do not appear as a representative of thatgroup, but I see no reason why I should not exploit thecompetence and effort reflected in the report. The panel first established three prior cautions or bases forderiving the changes: 1. Differentiate different drugs and different routes ofadministration. Do not discuss the drug problem. 2. Separate drug effects from associated criminal activity. 3. Consider the risk/benefit ratio for any change. The goal isto reduce the damage done by a drug without significant increase in its use. Nounregulated (legalized) drug nor any industry comparable tocigarette or alcohol industry proselytizing for drug use. The panel then suggests a stepwise approach by thelegislature. The three changes suggested for the first year woulddemonstrate that change could be safely accomplished and preparethe public for more comprehensive revisions. The suggested legislative changes are: Allow Cultivation of Marihuana for Personal Use Insofar as damage to the individual and society is concerned,the quantitatively most important drugs are alcohol and nicotinein the form of cigarettes. There remains, then, as the otherquantitatively important drug, marijuana, which has become, for alarge fraction of the population, a social drug comparable toalcohol in pattern of use and approaching alcohol in extent ofusage. Marijuana is a disinhibiting drug used socially to relieveanxiety and as such has many liabilities in common with alcohol.I acknowledge that marijuana is not without its effect on theindividual user and would not suggest any change that carried therisk of a great increase in the use of marijuana. I resist theuse of the word "legalization" in relation to any drug,including marijuana. On the other hand, an objectiveconsideration of marijuana shows that it is responsible for farless damage to the individual and to society than are alcohol andcigarettes. A further consideration in forming a reaction to thewide use of marijuana is that is a source of conflict betweengenerations and of disrespect for the law. The huge cost ofattempting to enforce these disrespected laws and to punish theirinfraction by people who do not feel guilty is, in my opinion,entirely wasteful and damaging and the monies should be appliedin areas of greater need. Also important is the economic and, to some extent, criminalactivity associated with the marketplace of marijuana. At themoment, we are adding millions to our trade deficit, off of thebooks to be sure, by our purchases of marijuana in Colombia,Mexico, Thailand, and elsewhere. Yet, thanks to a previous actionof the California Legislature, the product of this illegalactivity may be possessed and used by the citizen with thepossibility of only minor sanctions. This change has not lead toany disastrous consequences. On the contrary, it has reduced thetension between generations and decriminalized to some extent thegenerally sanctioned use of this new social drug by large numbersof people. This new situation, for which we applaud the Legislature, ishowever, not stable, in the sense that the failure to act inrelation to the supply of the drug leaves unmet the question ofthe still illegal market and the economic problem that thatentails. If this disparity could be resolved there would beeconomic gain and a great simplification of law enforcement whichnow devotes a considerable effort to seizing a small fraction ofthe illegal importations or cultivations. I therefore suggest that the law be changed to permitcultivation for personal use. Such cultivation would be permittedonly on property serving as the residence for the individual,this is, it would not authorize the cultivation of fifty plantson a National forest and it would not permit the possessionoutside of the home of more than the present one ounce, nor wouldit sanction the provision to others in or out of the residencewhether by sale or in the form "parties". Any change regulating the provision of this drug mustbe made in such a way that we do not see the development ofanother industry comparable to the alcohol or cigarette industry.Permitting the restricted cultivation would avoid that evil butachieve an of the gains promised above. There are people, including I am sure some legislators, who,out of genuine concern rather than mere timidity, will wonderwhether such a change, however, warranted by social and economicgains, would not also result in increased use. I do not dismissthis justifiable concern out of hand. the Panel insisted, and Iagree, that no attitude of approval of marijuana, or alcohol, ortobacco be projected. I would be a prohibitionist if prohibitionwould work. To the extent that prohibition creates a marketplaceor social conflict, we suggest more flexible, practical, andhumane policies. It does ,however, appear that the supply andexperience with marihuana is such that a plateau has been reached and that usage over foreseeablecircumstances will remain about at its present level, as is thecase with alcohol. Remove Penalties for Possession of Needles and Syringes The statement that heroin is inherently not a dangerous drughas been weakened by the appearance in the community of the AIDSvirus. This virus is transmitted, among other ways, by the use byone persons of paraphernalia for injection contaminated with theblood of an infected person. The AIDS virus has already spreadthrough the, drug-using community to an extent that varies withthe sanitary practices of the local population. The prevalence ofinfection is much higher, for example, in New York City than inSan Francisco and lower throughout the balance of California thanin San Francisco. There is thus some urgency and advantage ininstituting control methods. There are two suggested methods of controlling the spread ofthis relatively new virus. The first, demonstrably ineffective,is to adopt a moralizing attitude, continue our current practicesand simple add the individual tragedy and economic burden to thecommunity of more AIDS patients. Such an attitude is consistentwith the feeling that heroin users (and gays and psychotics) arebetter dead and is genocidal. The other method of controlling the spread of the AIDS viruswould be to encourage sanitary practices at the time of injectionby making it possible for each heroin user to use his own"outfit", that is, syringe and needle, rather thanaccept the risk of using one contaminated with another addict'sblood. This would become permissible as well as possible if theintravenous (IV) drug user were permitted to legally possess hisown syringe and needle. Heroin users understandably try to avoid carrying supplies oftheir drug and their injecting paraphernalia any more than isabsolutely necessary since the mere possession of the substanceand the equipment is a punishable crime. The possession ofparaphernalia is defined as a misdemeanor. The availability ofthe charge becomes a convenient mean of harassing the addict andof subjecting him, in effect, to a three-day jail sentencewithout trial. A person with a prior drug related conviction mustbe especially careful since, in such a situation, even thepossession of an ordinary spoon can be construed, according tothe statute, as possession of paraphernalia. As a result, usersare reluctant to carry their own outfits and, their compulsionbeing upon them, are quite likely to use whatever equipment isavailable at the site of drug purchase. People driven by thecompulsion that the heroin user feels, and given their choicebetween using someone else's outfit and being without their drugwill use the possibly contaminated equipment. Laudable as the"needle" exchange programs are and admirable as I findtheir practitioners, they (and the impending legislative respond)are inadequate. The situation is too urgent for an"experimental" program in one city and statutory changeis the definitive change needed to permit education in proper practices by the junkie. Prohibit (legal or illegal) Drug Use in Special StateEstablishments At the same time that we carry out what will be seen as aliberalization of some drug regulations we should demonstratethat our ultimate goal is the reduction of all drug use. Theeffectiveness of education in reducing drug abuse is obviouslydisappointing. Not even the success in controlling cigarettesmoking extends to the youthful population. However, it is fromthe successful imposition and acceptance of restrictions onsmoking by the adult population that we must learn. Drugeducation efforts have focused largely on the populations that weconsider to be deviant and at risk, that is, young people andminority groups. Our efforts to limit the use of quantitativelyimportant drugs should act to influence the entire population sothat an unambiguous attitude of disapproval is projected. The amazing progress in dissuading people from the use oftobacco, suggests additional action in relation to alcohol,already a regulated drug. That prohibition is not feasible hascertainly been adequately demonstrated, but restricted use ofalcohol in inappropriate places is justifiable and would be anessential step in projecting the attitudinal change desired. The Panel applauds the establishment of tobacco free areas inState institutions. As a condition of their funding theLegislature should now insist that certain agencies within theState system not sell or provide alcoholic beverages within theconfines of their campus or building. This should be immediatelyapplied to any medical center campus or hospital. Doctors andother care-givers have a generally favored status and acquirewith that a special responsibility to project an attitude ofdisapproval about the use of any disabling drug while they areaccepting responsibility for a dependent patient. Certainly theState acquires a liability in providing alcohol to individualswho are then going to drive or see patients. More importantly,such use then projects an attitude totally at odds with thatwhich we claim throughout our discussions as desirable. Similarly, it is impossible to rationalize the use of adepressant drug, clearly shown to impair performance after smalldoses, on a University or State University campus dedicated tointellectual activity. Conclusion These changes are minor indeed. However, they would achievesome real progress and, equally important, would demonstrate tothe alarmed citizenry that constructive change is possible andpermit a freer discussion next year. I hope that the Legislaturesenses the urgency in the situation in our state. I close bythreatening you with the aphorism of Francis Bacon of 400 hundredyears ago, "He that will not apply new remedies must acceptnew evils; for time is the great innovator."   Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Miscellaneous Statementson Drug PolicyWT01-B37-106IA087-000625-B013-148http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/Other/alc_ap6.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122041917 text/html 2941HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 04:19:10 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Monday, 16-Dec-96 05:26:42 GMTContent-length: 2726 Alcohol Handbook: Appendix 6 Appendix 6. summary of major characteristics of cannabis, methadone and heroin     Cannabis    Methadone    Heroin    Legal status     Illegala A cannabis expiation system was introduced in South Australia in 1987 and the Australian Capital Territory in 1992.

Glossary:  opiate - narcotic analgesic derived from a naturalsource(opium poppy)  opioid - narcotic analgesic that is either semi orfully synthetic - also refers to entire family of both opiatesand opioids  IM - intramuscular injection  SC - subcutaneous injection Morphine Synopsis  Morphine is naturally occurring substance in the opium poppy,Papaver somniferum. It is a potent narcotic analgesic, and itsprimary clinical use is in the management of moderately severeand severe pain. After heroin, morphine has the greatestdependence liability of the narcotic analgesics in common use.  Morphine is administered by several routes (injected, smoked,sniffed, or swallowed); but when injected particularlyintravenously, morphine can produce intense euphoria and ageneral state of well-being and relaxation. Regular use canresult in the rapid development of tolerance to these effects.Profound physical and psychological dependence can also rapidlydevelop, and withdrawal sickness upon abrupt cessation of heroinuse; many of the symptoms resemble those produced by a case ofmoderately severe flu.  Morphine is infrequently encountered in the North Americanstreet drug culture. However, mainly because of its availabilityin hospitals, there have been several documented cases ofmorphine dependence among health professionals. Drug Source  Morphine is isolated from crude opium, which is a resinousprep of the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum. Trade Name  Roxinal, MS Contin, Morphine Sulfate Street Names  "M", morph, Miss Emma Drug Combinations  Use of morphine plus cocaine, as well as of morphine plusmethamphetamine, has been reported. However, such combinationsare not frequently encountered. Medical Uses  * symptomatic relief of moderately severe to severe pain;  * relief of certain types of difficult or labored breathing;  * suppression of severe cough (rarely);  * suppression of severe diarrhea (e.g., that produced bycholera). Physical Appearance  Morphine is legally available only in the form of itswater-soluble salts. Most common are morphine sulfate andmorphine hydrochloride. Both are fine white crystalline powders,bitter to the taste. Both are soluble in water and slightlysoluble in alcohol. Dosage  ~~~~~~ Medical  For moderate to severe pain the optimal intramuscular dosageis considered to be 10 mg per 70 kg body weight every four hours.The typical dose range is from 5 to 20 mg every four hours,depending on the severity of the pain. The oral dose range isbetween 8 and 20 mg; but with oral administration morphine hassubstantially less analgesic potency (approximately one-tenth ofthe effect produced by subcutaneous injection) because it israpidly destroyed as it passes through the liver immediatelyafter absorption. The intravenous route is employed primarily forsevere post-operative pain or in an emergency; in this case thedose range is between 4 and 10 mg, and the analgesic effectensues almost immediately. Nonmedical  Irregular or intermittent users (who are not substituting thedrug for another narcotic analgesic) may start and continue touse doses within the therapeutic range (e.i., up to 20 mg).However, regular users who employ morphine for its subjectivelypleasurable effects frequently increase the dose as tolerancedevelops. To take several hundred milligrams per day is common,and there are reliable reports of up to four or five grams (4000- 5000 mg) per day. Routes Of Administration  Morphine may be taken orally in tablet form, and can alsoinjected subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously; thelast is the route preferred by those who are dependent onmorphine. Short Term Use  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Low Doses (single doses of 5 - 10 mg administered by S.C orIM injection in non-tolerant users)  CNS, behavioral, subjective:  suppression the sensation of and emotional response to pain;euphoria; drowsiness, lethargy, relaxation; difficulty inconcentrating; decreased physical activity in some users andincreased physical activity in others; mild anxiety or fear;pupillary constriction, blurred vision, impaired night vision,suppression of cough reflex.  Respiratory:  slightly reduced respiratory rate.  Gastrointestinal:  nausea and vomiting; constipation; loss of appetite;decreased gastric motility. Other:  slight drop in body temperature; sweating; reduced libido;prickly or tingling sensation on the skin (particularly afterintravenous injection). Duration  4 - 5 hours Dependency Potential  high, continued use results in both psychological andphysical dependency Codeine Drug Source  Codeine is found in opium in concentrations between %0.1 and%2. Because of the small concentration found in nature, mostcodeine found in medical products is synthesized from morphinevia the methylation of the hydroxyl group found on the secondnon-aromatic ring. Trade Name  There are no commercial name for products containing onlycodeine in US. Found under common name of codeine. Canada doeshave a codeine only syrup available under Paveral. Mainly foundin combination products. Street Name  T-three's (Tylenol #3 w/ codeine), schoolboy, cough syrup Medical Uses  * relief of mild to moderate pain  * relief of non-productive cough  * relief of diarrhea Drug Combinations  Sold under many name brand products, the most popular beingtheTylenol with Codeine series, the number on the tabletcorresponds to the amount of codeine and caffeine found in theeach tablet.  Tylenol #1 w/ codeine - 8 mg codeine, 15 mg caffeine  Tylenol #2 w/ codeine - 15 mg codeine, 15 mg caffeine  Tylenol #3 w/ codeine - 30 mg codeine, 30 mg caffeine  Tylenol #4 w/ codeine - 60 mg codeine, no caffeine  note: all tablets contain same amount of acetaminophen (300mg)  Fiorinal (aspirin, caffeine, barbital, codeine)  Many other brand name product combinations. Physical Appearance  Tylenol w/ codeine series are imprinted with number on oneside and other side is Tylenol label(McNeil). Controlled Substance Status  As a single product codeine is a schedule II controlledsubstance in the US. When combined with other non-controlledsubstance, and depending on amount per dose unit, codeinecombined products range from schedule III to V.  Canada has OTC codeine products available if product has nomore than 8 mg of codeine per unit dose. Some US areas may havecodeine preps available OTC, but usually require release form.  As an interesting fact, a travelers handbook noted thatGreece has banned codeine in that country (no idea on what it'sstatus is now) so be careful when traveling there. Dosage  ~~~~~~ Medical  Pain relief : 30mg - 220mg oral or equivalent dose SC or IM  Diarrhea relief : 10mg - 20mg orally  Cough suppressant : 5mg - 15mg orally Nonmedical  Doses can range from 30mg up to 400mg. LD50 for codeine is800mg in a average nontolerant person. At doses of > 250mgadverse effects tend to arise, including intense itching, flushedskin, dizziness, sedation, nausea and vomiting Routes Of Administration  Usually taken orally but can be injected IM or SC. The IVroute is not recommended as reactions such as facial swelling,pulmonary edema and convulsions can occur. Short Term Use  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CNS, Behavioral, Subjective:  Effects begin at 30mg and tend to mimic those of morphine,except sedation and euphoria are less intense. Respiratory:  same as morphine but less intense. Gastrointestinal:  same as morphine but nausea and vomiting are less common andconstipation less severe. Other:  alleocodone is a schedule II drug, and when combined withother non-controlled drugs, is found from schedule III-IV. Dosage  ~~~~~~ Medical  as a cough suppressant 5mg - 10mg  for pain relief 10mg - 30mg Nonmedical  doses are similar to those for pain relief Routes Of Administration  Usually taken orally but can be inject via three routes.Unknown if hydrocodone can be sniffed or smoked. Sniffing islikely possible. Short Term Use  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  CNS, Behavioral, Subjective:  Has similar effects as morphine but less sedation andeuphoria  Respiratory:  Less depression than morphine.  Gastrointestinal:  Less likely to cause nausea and vomiting than morphine. Other:  Hydrocodone is a weaker opioid than morphine but still aeffective opioid with similar potency to oxycodone. Duration  3 - 4 hours Dependency Potential  moderately low, much less potential than morphine Hydromorphone Drug Source  Synthetically produced from morphine. Trade Name  Dilaudid Street Name  Dillies Medical Uses  * relief of moderate to severe pain  * relief of severe cough Drug Combinations  most commonly used as a single product Physical Appearance  usually bought as tablets, or injectable solution Controlled Substance Status  Hydromorphone, like most single product opioids, is aschedule II opioid. Dosage  ~~~~~~ Medical  for pain relief 1mg - 2mg Nonmedical  same as pain relief doses Routes Of Administration  Can be administered orally, by three routes of injection, andby sniffing. Unknown if smoking is an effective route. Short Term Use  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  CNS, Behavioral, Subjective:  Hydrocodone has effects similar to morphine, except euphoriais similar to codeine, nausea and vomiting is quite rare, andsedation is practically non-existent  Respiratory:  Hydrocodone depresses respiration minimally.  Gastrointestinal:  Hydromorphone effects GI tract very little. Other:  Although hydromorphone's euphoria pales with other opioidsit's abuse potential comes from the fact the rush experiencedfrom IV use is very similar to heroin's.  Hydromorphone is one of the most used opioids in the reliefof pain for the terminally ill. The reasons being it's minimalside effects, and high potency. Duration  3 - 4 hours Dependency Potential  moderately high Meperidine Drug Source  Meperidine is completely synthetic and can be produced withdichlorodiethyl methylamine and benzyl cyanide. Trade Name  Demerol Street Name  Demmies Medical Uses  * originally found to be useful for muscle spasms but thediscovery of it's analgesic properties has resulted in it'salmost exclusive use for relief of moderate to severe pain Drug Combinations  usually found as a single product, with few combinationproducts.

All opioids cause both physical and psychologicaldependence with prolonged use. Depending on the opioid inquestion withdrawal can become evident after continued use in aslittle time as 2 weeks or as long as 2 months.  Withdrawal is commonly overstated by media and tends to besimilar to bad case of flu. This is due to the fact that mostopioid users don't tend to be able to acquire enough drug toresult in severe withdrawal. It must be noted that physicalsymptoms may be similar to flu, psychological symptoms can bequite painful. Depression, mood swings, hypersensitivity to painare some common symptoms. Opioid withdrawal DOES NOT endangerlife as does alcohol and other depressant withdrawal.

Ecstasy Introduction Physical effects Psychological effects Undesirable psychological effects Withdrawal symptoms INTRODUCTION Ecstasy or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a derivative of amphetamine and shares the properties of both amphetamines and hallucinogens, in its side effects and residual effects. A recent survey of ecstasy use in Australia (Solowij and Lee, 1991) reports that it is not as widely used as amphetamines and use is primarily recreational, commonly being associated with metropolitan dance parties and other social venues. The abuse potential of ecstasy is considered quite low since with increased use the negative aspects of use tend to increase while the positive effects decrease. For this reason few people with dependence problems report to treatment agencies. The effects of ecstasy are quite similar to those found with amphetamines, although it is reported that ecstasy produces a more positive mood and sense of intimacy than amphetamines. PHYSICAL EFFECTS Involuntary jaw movements; jaw clenching; teeth grinding Dry mouth Motor restlessness Tremors Headaches and dizziness Ataxia Nystagmus Tachycardia Increased sweating; hot and cold flushes Blurred vision Nausea and vomiting Anorexia Shown to be neurotoxic to serotonergic nerve terminals. PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS Facilitation of interpersonal relations Enhancement of communication and intimacy Increased self esteem Elevated mood Insightfulness Inner contentment Euphoria Changes in perception Hallucinogenic properties. UNDESIRABLE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS Visual hallucinations Anxiety, loss of control Panic, loss of reality Poor concentration Insomnia Irritability Depression. WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS Tiredness, lethargy Depersonalisation Irritability Emotional liability Depression.

Alfred McCoy is Professor ofHistory at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. In your book, The Politics of Heroin inSoutheast Asia, you demarcate very carefully that the UnitedStates was poised at the end of World War II, in 1945, to... Idon't have your exact words ... to terminate the problem of drugaddiction in the United States and it could have done so but forforces that I'd like you to discuss - was unable to do so. McCoy: The problem with America's failed chanceat essentially reducing if not eliminating drugs as a problem wasa contradiction between the needs of domestic policy and thenational security state. After World War II the United Statesbecame a global power and set up a number of agencies to exercisethis global power, most importantly the executive agency known asthe U.S. Central Intelligence Agency when it was ultimatelyformed in 1948. The CIA, in order to conduct its campaign againstcommunism, which was seen as an overweening evil that had to bestopped, was willing to ally with anybody and everybody thatcould provide during what was seen as a critical period, somestrength, some support in the global struggle against communism. In Europe and Asia the CIA allied themselveswith major drug brokers and organized crime syndicates. In sum,what they did was to create a mainline flow of narcotics from theMiddle East through Europe to the United States which dominatedAmerica's drug markets until the 1960s. At the same time, the CIAwas forging alliances and protecting the traffickers in Europe,for reasons of intelligence. They also formed similar alliancesin Asia - alliances which were actually deeper and had much moreprofound and lasting impact on the Asian drug trade. As the European trade began to diminish in thelate 1960s and early 1970s, the second stream, the flow of Asiandrug traffic came into the United States and supplanted the oldTurkey- Marseilles heroin connection. But, ultimately, when youlook at the source of supply and the politics that provided drugsto America in the post-war era, you came down to thiscontradiction between the weak drug policy and same kind of vaguecommitment to doing something about drugs versus a very highprofile, very important effort to contain communism globally. Inthis balance between an inarticulated, poorly formed narcoticspolicy and a very clear national goal of containing communism,narcotics policy was barely considered. The CIA in this era was dealing withgovernments, intelligence chiefs, warlords, gangsters,traffickers of all sorts - good character was not considered ofmoment. The only thing that counted during the period from thelate 1940s through the late 1960s was containing communism. Barsamian: You trace the involvement of theMafia - the U.S. Mafia - in the promotion of narcoticstrafficking in the United States. How did the politics getinvolved with the Mafia? McCoy: We have to step back a bit to the originof the drug problem. Since the 1800s western societies - Europe,Australia, America - have had very extensive drug problems. Now,you can really divide the western world's century of mass drugabuse into two convenient periods. From the late 1800s to thepresent we can split it down the middle. From about the 1870swhen you get big-time mass consumption of narcotics to the 1920sdrugs were legal. The name "heroin" for example, was atrade name coined by the Bayer company. In 1898 they came up witha new product which seemed to be very good for respiratoryailments. They put it on the market and called it"heroin." That's where the term comes from. It's atrade name coined by one of the world's major pharmaceuticalmanufacturers. The next year, 1899, they came up with anothernifty new product that seemed to do the same thing for headachesthat heroin did for respiratory ailments. They called the newproduct "aspirin." That one's worked out pretty well.So we got one winner and one loser during this same period of theglobal boom of pharmaceuticals. It wasn't until the 1920s that there was ageneral consensus that law would be used to regulate personalbehavior. So alcohol, gambling and narcotics were, during the1920s, globally subject to regulation. So you have laws on thebooks in the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States - notonly the nations themselves but their several states andprovinces - banning the use of narcotics. Narcotics moved from being a personal choice -something you picked up at your local pharmacy, your local drugstore - to being a criminal act. The process by which it becomesillegal varied in every country and, in some cases every state.By the time you get to about 1930, drugs were illegal around theglobe. So, suddenly, who's moving the drugs? Well,it's syndicates. The abolition or the prohibition of alcohol,partial prohibition of alcohol in some countries and fullprohibition in this country, combined with the prohibition ofnarcotics, transferred an enormous sector of the legitimateeconomy to syndicates. So that's where you got the rise oforganized crime. In 1932 the United States pulled back from theprohibition on alcohol It was gradual, it was slow, but thesyndicates got out of the alcohol trade. But we've never pulledback from the prohibition of narcotics. It's remained illegal.That prohibition has become permanent. So, during the 1930s. thesyndicates began moving into narcotics. They were of secondaryimportance initially to alcohol, but once alcohol became legalafter 1932, narcotics became correspondingly more important. During World War II things changed. All globalcommerce was disrupted. Military controls and war zonesintervened with the normal trafficking routes. The drug trade wastotally disrupted in the United States. In Asia it continued. TheJapanese military intelligence dominated the manufacture anddistribution of heroin from China. They used it very explicitlyas a weapon against the Chinese resistance. They flooded Chinawith heroin, financed all of their intelligence operations andspecial operations from the drug trade. But in the United States and Europe, the drugtraffic was disrupted. It largely disappeared. Survival had to dowith, in part, some short-term tactical alliances with the Mafia.In 1943 the United States invaded Sicily as one of its two majorinvasions of Europe, a major event in the history of World WarII, secondary to D-Day. That leap from North Africa and fightingup the boot of Italy, bloody horrible campaign that it was, wassomething that really concerned American military planners at thetime. They apparently - the U.S. Navy in particular - forged ashort-term political alliance with Lucky Luciano who'd beenconvicted for operating a brothel that employed something like athousand prostitutes in New York City; he was in Dannemara StatePrison in New York. The Navy cut a deal with him and he used hiscontacts with the Sicilian Mafia to get Mafia support because theMafia politically dominated western Sicily which was the areawhere U.S. forces landed. Mussolini, for reasons just purely of state,couldn't abide the Mafia. They didn't do what he wanted. He triedto break them. Under the U.S. military occupation of Sicily, theMafia revived. There were some American mafiosi deported toSicily after the war. They provided links back to the UnitedStates with their confreres in organized crime. Moreover, as theUnited States' campaign against communism got underway,particularly in the Mediterranean basin - in Italy and southernFrance - the United States formed tactical alliances withCorsican syndicates and with the Mafia too. It served as acounterweight to communist dockworker influence in places likeMarseilles particularly. The net result is that as a result of wartimepolicy and postwar anti-communist policy, you got a revival oforganized crime operating initially under some kind of U.S.military-government protection and ultimately under CIAprotection. As the trafficking routes got re-establishedthrough the Middle East and Europe, ultimately to the UnitedStates, a revived, restored Mafia in Sicily, Corsican syndicatesin Southern France, were major participants in this traffic. Half a world away, in Asia, you get a similarphenomenon. We can talk about that if you want. Barsamian: In fact, the recolonization ofIndochina by the French at the end of World War II in 1946 led towhat you call the first Indochina war, and the establishment of amajor international narcotics trade which the French intelligencewas very much involved with. Is that true? McCoy: Yes, but again I think we have to standback and look at this in somewhat broader perspective. It's oneof the liabilities of being a history professor - I can'tunderstand 1990 unless I know about 1890. It's just the way I seethings. Things have historical roots and if you deal with presentsuperficialities you won't have a clue as to what's going on. You have to understand, first of all, that theextensive opium trade in Indochina - mass consumption,particularly in the cities - was as a result of European colonialpolicy. Nowhere else in the world - and most of the tropicallatitudes of the globe were colonized - Asia, Africa and LatinAmerica at one time, entirely colonized. It's only in Southeast Asia that the colonialgovernments paid for their very dynamic development, massiveinfrastructural projects, irrigation that transformed thelandscape, massive road networks, rail networks, very dynamiccolonial development - all of this was paid for by direct taxesupon Indochinese consumers. Taxes on alcohol, salt andparticularly opium. In British Malaya, 40% of colonial taxes camefrom opium. In Thailand it was running about 15%. (Thailand wasan independent state but they followed the colonial model.) InFrench Indochina it ranged about 15% from the period of the 1870sup through the 1950s when, as a result of UN pressure, all ofthese governments abolished the opium trade. Thailand was thesecond last to do it. Thailand didn't abolish its state opiummonopoly - rather like an alcoholic beverage control that a lotof states have. They didn't abolish this until 1957 and Laosdidn't abolish theirs until 1961. So you had, then, mass opium consumption inSoutheast Asia as a result of this colonial policy of making thecolony pay with opium. That was the policy. Now, most of the opium was not produced inSoutheast Asia. It came from abroad - either Southern China or,particularly, India. The thing that changes significantly afterWorld War II is not the emergence of Southeast Asia as a majorarea of opiate consumption - it had been so for a century or evenmore. What is significant is the emergence of the mountain areasof Southeast Asia as major areas of global opium production.Indeed, by the early 1960s, the largest single source of opiumanywhere in the world was the so-called "GoldenTriangle" region of Southeast Asia. How did this come about? It comes about twoways. Most importantly, we have to look at North Burma. That'sthe bulk of the Golden Triangle. In fact, most of that imaginarygeographical construct penned by some unknown journalist wag orgeographer - nobody knows where this idea came from calling thissort of triangular-shaped highland zone where opium is grown inSoutheast Asia "the Golden Triangle" - most of thattriangle is in Burma, northeastern Burma in particular. So, where did opium come from? Well, if youlook at the British colonial records, because the Britishcolonized Bunna, you find opium production up until 1945 innortheastern Burma was almost insignificant. There was verylittle grown. Most of the opium consumption in northeastern Burmacame from India. Burma, after all, was a province of India underthe British, so they just brought it in and sold it legally. Now,where the opium came from was a major CIA operation. One of thebiggest - the only one I know of of its scale that is yet to beexposed by journalists or muckrakers of any sort. This was theattempt to overthrow the People's Republic of China. In 1949 the Red Army, Mao's Red Army, drovesouth and they drove the Nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-Shek intwo directions: one down to Taiwan to the East and secondly, intothis redoubt, this highland plateau which is the Hunan provincein southwestern China. The warlord of Hunan surprisinglysurrendered, betrayed Chiang Kai-Shek, and surrendered to thecommunists. Chiang Kai-Shek's plan of having his old World War IIredoubt which was the bastion of his resistance against theJapanese. This was Chiang Kai-Shek's old mountain bastion. Hethought he could hold it and maybe use it for counter-attack.Well, the warlord of Hunan betrayed him for reasons nobody quiteunderstands, turned it over to the communists, and Chiang'sforces were suddenly without a redoubt. They fled across theborder into the mountains of northeastern Burma, where the CIAset up a massive support operation, including an air link thatwas of the nature of the hump - the flight from India across thehump of the Himalayas into the Hunan province of southern Chinaduring World War II. They also rearranged the politics ofThailand. the CIA became involved in the factional politics amongthe military leadership in Thailand. They allied themselves withthe commandant of the Thai national police, a particularlycorrupt man named General Pao. General Pao went into the opiumbusiness with the nationalist Chinese forces in Laos. What you had was the CIA sustaining nationalistChinese forces in Northeastern Burma on the China border,supporting - we have records I think of two invasions of southernChina by this force which left, in a couple of battles, deadwhite men on the field of battle. One can only suspect that theywere CIA operatives or contract mercenaries working for theAgency, We don't know. No identification. But anyway, these invasions failed. So whydidn't they withdraw? Well, the CIA had the idea - and you canfind these in formal National Security Council documents - theCIA and the Pentagon had the idea that there was going to be amassive Chinese invasion of Southeast Asia at some point. Thiswas what the Vietnam war was all about: building up the SouthVietnamese Army, to integrate, to become an Allied force withinthe U.S. conventional combat forces, to resist this projectedChinese invasion of Southeast Asia. The falling dominoes were notjust going to fall from within, they were going to be pushed fromwithout by an invading China. So they kept the Nationalist Chinese forces upalong this long difficult Burma border as a kind of trip-wire todetect a Chinese invasion of Southeast Asia and to runintelligence operations. They went into China, kidnapped Chineseofficials, tapped phone lines, and bought newspapers - and theywere maintained in northeastern Burma from 1949 until 1961 when ajoint Communist Chinese-Burmese Army operation drove them intonorthern Thailand which is where they are today. But they stillmaintained their posts, even though they couldn't keep their basecamps in Burma. That group, the Nationalist Chinese forces innortheastern Burma, transferred northeastern Burma from a regionof very little opium production into the largest single producerof opium anywhere in the world today. How did they do it? They did it through theclassic colonial policy that we saw under Leopold of the Belgiansin the Congo Free State. Under Leopold every peasant had to growrubber and if you didn't deliver rubber, your children's limbswere amputated. I can show you a very famous photograph in bookpublished by Macmillan University Press, The Colonial Empires byProfessor B.K. Hildhouse(?) and there's a picture of an Africanman sitting on his porch looking at the feet of his daughterwhich had been amputated because he didn't deliver the rubber. Itwas such a brutal, horrific administration that the Europeancolonial powers held a conference, took the Congo away fromLeopold, and gave it to the Belgian parliament to administer. Itwas one of the great scandals of the 19th century, one of thehorrors of colonialism. That great novel, Heart of Darkness, thatbecame Apocalypse Now - that's written about the brutality of theBelgians in the Congo Free State. There are many legacies in the Europeanimagination of how horrible this was. Well, that's exactly whatthe Nationalist Chinese forces did to the Hill tribes ofnortheastern Burma. I've interviewed American Baptistsmissionaries who told me that ordinary peasants - hill tribesmen- who did not deliver their opium quota, suffered the loss oflimbs. Fingers would be cut and hands were taken from you andyour family. So people produced. Under this forced regime of occupation whereyou had the Nationalist Chinese forces backed by the CIAoccupying the mountain areas, the prime opium growing areas innortheastern Burma, Burma went from maybe 7 or 8 tons of opiumproduction per annum to anywhere up to 1,000 tons of productionby the time the CIA's mercenaries were driven out in 1961. Athousand tons would have been, in any given year, up to 60 and70% of the world's total illicit opium production coming fromthis one area as a result of a decade of CIA-Nationalist Chineseoccupation. The other Southeast Asian area was as youdescribe. Until 1950 France had an opium monopoly in Indochina.They were under pressure from the United States and UN to cleanup. They signed the Segal(?) Convention on Narcotic Drugs withthe United Nations and they abolished the opium monopoly. But itdidn't disappear. The opium dens and opium shops were simplytransferred from the French Ministry of Finance to Frenchmilitary intelligence and they, in turn, turned them over to acriminal syndicate that was running Saigon for the French, usingtheir funds to buy daily intelligence and ferret out communistterrorists in the streets of Saigon. The communists were running a terroristcampaign against the French. A Frenchman would sit down in a cafeand a 12-year-old boy would come up to him and put a gun to theback of his head and shoot him and disappear into a crowd. That'sthe kind of operation. The French were powerless to control thatand they set up a very elaborate intelligence apparatus to tryand stop that terror. Money was the fuel that drove that engineand the money came from drugs. Moreover, there were Corsican syndicates thatdominated the inner-city economy of Indochina, based in Saigon.They began exporting to Europe where part of the so-calledMarseilles connection which has been celebrated in films - theconnection where it's supposed to be opium from Turkey comingthrough the laboratories of Marseilles and then on to the UnitedStates - part of that production - we don't know how much - infact, came from Saigon. So, it's as a result of Frenchcounter-insurgency efforts in Indochina where they integratenarcotics into their intelligence operations, but primarily it'sas a result of CIA operations in Burma that we get the so-calledGolden Triangle where it's northeastern Burma and the adjacentarea of northern Laos going into high-scale production. When the Americans moved into Indochina afterthe French departed in 1955, we picked up the same tribes, theHmong, the same politics of narcotics, the politics of heroin,that the French had established. By the 1960s we were operating,particularly the CIA, in collusion with the major traffickersexporting from the mountains not only to meet the consumptionneeds of Southeast Asia itself, but in the first instanceAmerica's combat forces fighting in Vietnam and ultimately theworld market. Southeast Asia today, by the way, is the number onesource of American heroin. That's our major source. So it's thosevery mountains of Burma, those very fields that were cleared andput to the poppy as a result of this Nationalist Chinese-CIAcounterinsurgency intervention policy - that army that the CIAmaintained there - that's supplying America's addicts today withillicit heroin. Barsamian: Was the anti-communist ideology sopowerful and so strong that the CIA would risk the worldwideopprobrium of being linked with drug trafficking? Why would theytake that risk? McCoy: It's easy. Look, it's effective. Iinterviewed a guy named Lt. Col Lucien Conein who, since Ipublished my book now despises me, and I asked Col Conein whythey worked with the Corsicans in Saigon, for example. He saidthat there aren't very many groups that know the clandestinearts. When you think about the essential skills it takes to havean extra-legal operation - to have somebody killed, to mobilize acrowd, to do what it does when societies are in flux, when poweris unclear and to be grabbed and shaped and molded into a newstate - you want to overthrow a government and put a new one in -how do you do it? Who does this? Accountants? - They go to theoffice every day. Students? They go to classes - they're good formaybe one riot or something, but they've got to get on to medicalschool or law or whatever they're doing. Where do you get peoplewho have this kind of skill? You have your own operatives andthey're limited. Particularly if you're a foreigner, yourcapacity to move something in the streets is very limited. Youknow, sometimes you can turn to a state intelligence agency in acountry you're working with, but most effectively you can turn tothe underworld. That's why the CIA always worked very effectivelywith the warlords of the Golden Triangle. It's worked veryeffectively with Corsican syndicates in Europe, worked veryeffectively and continuously with American Mafia - because theyhave the same clandestine arts. They operate with the sametechniques. And they have the same kind of amorality. Theyare natural allies. There was a conversion of cultures betweenthe milieu of the underworld and the world of the clandestineoperative. Barsamian: The French intelligence servicesused the services of the Corsican Mafia during the firstIndochina war and many of those Corsicans remained behind and theAmericans picked them up. But then you have the introduction ofthe American Mafia itself with the full-scale Americanintervention in Indochina: people like Santo Trafficante gettinginvolved. McCoy: I was interested in discovering duringthe course of my research in Saigon in 1971 that the last of thefounding generation of the Mafia - I read these Mafia historiesand I wonder if they're accurate, but you know, if you readenough of them and they're talking about the formation of aCommission, the big five families getting together and settingthis thing up - but sometimes you wonder if it isn't a fairy talebut everybody keeps repeating it. So let's just assume as kind ofa footnote that this may not be accurate. But let's assume thisis some kind of story that's accurate. The last of the foundinggeneration of Mafia titans was Santo Trafficante, Jr. He was theboss of Tampa. He also ran Cuba for the Mafia. Cuba was one ofthe major conduits of Marseilles heroin. The raw opium would comefrom Indochina through the Suez Canal, across the Mediterraneanto Marseilles - or it would come through Turkey, down throughLebanon, then across the Mediterranean to the port of Marseilles.There it was refined and it would enter the United States. Back in 1950, because of the very substantialMafia presence in Cuba - they owned most of the casinos, theyoperated a lot of the prostitution industry and they were on goodterms with the Batista dictatorship. It was their major offshoreoperating zone. It was a kind of vice free port. SantoTrafficante is believed to have been heavily involved innarcotics importation operations in a general kind of way assomebody who was very heavily involved in Cuba. Cuba was supposedto be - again, in these Mafia fairy tales - something of aneutral zone. It was nobody's territory. But Trafficante kind ofran it, providing a certain amount of protection and order fororganized crime because he was southern Florida and it was anatural territory for him to expand into. Well, in the late 1960s, Trafficante and hisconsigliere, his counselor - again, in these Mafia charts, thenumber three man was a guy named Dominic Furchi(?). DominicFurchi and Santo Trafficante took a trip and went to Hong Kongand they went to Saigon. When they were in Saigon they met withold man Furchi's kid, Frank Furchi. Now, Frank Furchi had sethimself up in Saigon and was involved in this shady world ofcontracting all of these kind of murky private businessoperations that were what you might call black marketeering onthe fringes of this massive U.S. war effort. Wherever you getarmies operating in the midst of war zones you get an enormousamount of black market activity. Prostitution, clubs,entertainment, purloining of military equipment - you know,there's just so much men and movement and violence and such arisk that freelancers would come in there and wheel and deal andmake money. This young Furchi was in there. There was agroup of Corsicans that was still operating left over from thefirst Indochina war and they were dealing. Some of them wereex-nazi Gestapo officers that had come out there as well. It wasa remarkable polyglot group of adventurers. Trafficante isbelieved, according to Hong Kong police intelligence, to haveexplored getting an Asian heroin connection. Some police I talkedto during this period were convinced that, in fact, he didprovide the basic contacts and connections during his trip whichbegan to see the start of substantial flows of heroin fromSoutheast Asia to the United States. Now, whether or not, again,this is a Mafia fairy tale, nonetheless statistically it is afterabout 1970 that we see the flow of Number 4 pure white powderheroin moving from Southeast Asia to the United States, beingdetected in chemical analysis of street samples. Barsamian: One thing that has kind of perplexedme on this particular issue - you know, the CIA being involved indrug trafficking in Southeast Asia - very soon we see that heroinflowing into the veins of the American GIs stationed in SoutheastAsia who are reputedly there to defeat the communists. That'skind of bizarre to say the least. McCoy: When I published my book I got a lot offlak from people on the left saying that I was probably a CIAagent because I was so moderate in my analysis. The thesis in theheated political times of the early 1970s about drugs was this.The CIA had two problems - or the American ruling class - whoeverthese invisibles are that control this complex uncontrollablecountry - supposedly had two problems. One was insurgency ofminorities - I'm speaking of black uprisings in the cities ofAmerica. Another was winning the war in Vietnam. So they put oneand one together and they came up with two: the Southeast Asiandrug trade. Their vision was - you know, like the CIA DeputyDirector in charge of global narcotics trafficking sort oftelling the Hmong caravans to get moving out of the highlands ofSoutheast Asia. "Let's get that caravan now into the lab.Okay, let's get that heroin loaded onto the aircraft right. Okay,now we've got it into Harlem. Okay, get that kid, Kid, stepforward and buy the bag." Okay, you know, that's it.Potentially insurgent youth has been narcotized. Write him offfor black power. I didn't see things operating quite socomprehensively. What I saw going on was like this. And this iswhy I was accused by people on the left of being moderate andcowardly in my analysis. When you do this kind of research, whenyou move into this murky world of rumors, conspiracy, the shadowuniverse that is organized crime, narcotics and intelligence,you've got to adopt, I think, a minimalist approach. You can'tsay anything you don't have a source for. You can suspect all youwant. But when you speak or write, you just don't say it. That'sspeculation. You have a drink and you talk it over when you'reworking with your colleagues trying to figure it out, then youcan go into anything you want. But when you actually speak orwrite, you've got to stick to the facts. Otherwise, you're notdoing your job ... it's nonsense. So I adopted a policy that Ihad to have sources. In fact, my book when it was published wasgone over by a corporate lawyer at Harper & Row which is abig publishing firm. The CIA actually got a copy of themanuscript and tried to get certain passages deleted and removed.They pressured the corporation for the right to do that.Ultimately I had to stand behind every sentence. I had to havesources for it. The lawyers went through every sentence and said,"Where's this?" I had to have an interview notebook, Ihad to show my logic. What I found was this. This is my image. Ineffect the CIA's involvement in narcotics was originallyspecific. It was going on in Laos and it didn't get much beyondLaos. The Agency in Laos was, just like the agency globally inthe 1940s and 50s, myopic, short-sighted. It was fighting a war.It was trying to stop the Ho Chi Minh trail from operating. Inorder to do so it had a 30,000 man mercenary army made up largelyof Hmong hill tribesmen who lived in the area and were opiumgrowers. The consequences of their complicity in the narcoticstraffic was something they just weren't interested in. From1964-65 to 1975 they ran this secret war with a massive army of 30,000 men - an operation of anunequaled duration and size. The CIA has never, ever run as bigan operation. I think that's even bigger than the Burma operation they ran. TheNationalist Chinese forces never got to that size. Barsamian: What about Afghanistan? McCoy: That didn't last eleven years. When didit start? About '81 and it's already over. It didn't make it. Itlasted eight years. I don't think also .. you see, the Mujahadinare not as integrated with the CIA. Those were just rebels thatthe CIA was backing. This is a 30,000 man army that the CIA ran.It was their army. They bought every bullet, they trained every soldier, they had a mercenary officercorps under General Vang Pao that they ran. It wasn't a"hands-off' operation. It was their army. That's why we've got all these Hmong in Los Angelesand Minnesota and Wisconsin - because we're looking after ourloyal tribe that fought and died for us in some kind of twistedlogic. But that's why they're all here. That's why we have allthese mountain peasants trying to adapt to life in this country. Anyway, the CIA was complicitous in the Laotiandrug trade at a number of levels. First of all, let's look at thesituation. Why would the CIA be complicitous in the drug trade?Okay. They are allying themselves with a people which grows twoproducts up in the mountains: they grow rice for subsistence andthey grow opium for cash. They've grown opium really at a highlevel since World War II. They grew small amounts before, butwith the boom in production in the Golden Triangle theirproduction of opium expanded and they became dependent upon it asa source for cash. When the CIA allied itself with this tribe,after a few years, by 1970, the economy, the culture, the wholeof Hmong tribal society and the CIA's secret army were one. Itwas a total merger. It was as much an alliance between the CIAand the Hmong as it was between the United States and GreatBritain in World War II. We just didn't give the British bullets,we financed their whole economy. We integrated our economy, ourpolity with Britain. Two societies, two states merged. Well, in a funny kind of way, that's what'sgoing on in Laos right now. The rice crop disappears because ofthe Meo policy of slash and burn - they chop down the trees, theyburn it, that clears the land and leaves ash and phosphate on theground and you get maybe two or three rice crops out of it beforethe land goes bad and the men, because there's a distribution oflabor in the tribes, the men have to cut down the trees. Thewomen till the crop, harvest the rice crop. Now, opium, welldone, can go ten or twelve years whereas rice can only go two orthree. So once it was started, very quickly the Hmong ran out ofrice and the CIA began dropping rice to them. But they still hadtheir opium. Now, the Hmong growing opium meant the CIA felt thatthey had to support the Meo's opium crop because there's only twocash crops. So they started actually using their remarkablyextensive energistics network of light aircraft and helicoptersto actually move the opium out of the mountains for the Meobecause the war had disrupted the normal caravan routes ofChinese merchants that comb the hills for the opium. That wasgone by 1966 as the war spread. So the CIA collected the opiumand became the major source of transport, moving the opium fromfield to market, getting into the actual flow of regionalinternational commerce. Barsamian: This is the Air America fleet? McCoy: This is the Air America fleet, yeah.It's the CIA's contract airline. It's just a fig leaf. It was theCIA's airline. Barsamian: I notice you use Hmong and Meointerchangeably. Is that correct? McCoy: Yes. The word has been usedtraditionally, Hmong, but it means slave in Chinese. But if youlook at all the ethnographic literature before the Hmong migratedto this country, it always refers to them as Meo. Since they'vegotten here, the Hmong have regarded Meo as an impolite term andeverybody... You know, one of the dynamics of a multi-culturalsociety is that the group gets to pick its own name. IfAfrican-Americans want to be African-Americans, that's what youcall them and you don't worry about it. The oppressed get to pickthe label of their oppression. So if the Hmongs want to be calledHmongs, we call them Hmong. Anyway, the CIA was absolutely aware of what itwas doing. I went into a Meo district - I spent ten days there in1971 - and I went house to house and asked every farmer how muchopium they grew this year, last year, the year before. I wentback ten years. I said, "Okay, now, how much do yougrow." They said, "Well, we each grow about tenkilos," which will make you one kilo of heroin by the timeyou boil it down and combine it." Most of them grow aboutten kilos from their fields. So, "What do you do with yourten kilos?" "Well, up to about five years the Chineseused to come through with their mules and we'd sell it to themand they'd give us some cloth, some money, this or that andflashlight batteries, whatever, and we'd deal with them. Orsometimes we'd take it down to the market down in the provincialcapital." "So what have you done over the last fewyears?" "What happens is the Air America helicoptercomes in and officers in the army, Hmong officers in the army,get out and we sell them our opium." Opium stinks. It's like wrapping up cow dung inleaves. You've got a whole helicopter full of cow dung and you'dsay to the pilot, the American CIA pilot - do you know whatyou're carrying? He'd say, "Yeah, I'm carrying cowdung." "How do you know?" "Well, I can smellit." Opium, in that kind of confined space, load up ahelicopter with opium and you know what you're carrying.Everybody knows what it smells like. So they all knew that theywere carrying it. This entire district that I interviewedestablished a pattern beyond doubt. The helicopters came thereand left. Where did it go? It went down to a place nameLong Tien. Long Tien was one of the most secret U.S.installations anywhere in the world. It was the headquarters ofthe whole secret war in Laos, this attempt to fight the Ho ChiMinh trail, to cut it with this mercenary army. Long Tien wasclosed to any American other than somebody that had topintelligence classification. I learned from Hmong sources that Vang Paooperated a very large heroin lab there. At this point the CIA gothands off. They didn't mind moving the opium out of the hills,but when it came to actually carrying the Number 4 heroin thatcame out of that lab, they wouldn't touch that. What they did wasthey established a private air line for Vang Pao called ZengKwan(?) Air Transport, the province where he came from was ZengKwan. So they created, you know, home-town province airlines andgave it to Vang Pao. They were hands-off from that point. Then what happened was there was a flow, therewere other labs, and the Chief of Staff of the Royal Laotian army- 99% of the Royal Laotian army's budget came from the UnitedStates - the Chief of Staff of the Laotian army operated thelargest heroin refinery in the world in northwestern Laos. Thisflow of heroin went down to southern Laos where Nguyen Cao Ky'ssister ran a hotel. There were three routes into Vietnam fromsouthern Laos. One was Nguyen Cao Ky's pilots would fly over fromTonsonhut(?) Airport in Saigon and would pick up and fly back in.The Prime Minister of Vietnam, the President of Vietnam also hadtheir own distribution apparatuses. Our allies in Vietnam, thethree major political players, ran heroin distribution networks.There was a time in the 1970s when I think half a dozen membersof the South Vietnamese parliament were picked up by customs bymistake carrying heroin in from Laos and Thailand. You know, thewhole South Vietnamese government was dealing heroin to ourtroops. That was where it was coming from. The CIA didn't know about that. I mean, theydidn't care about that; they didn't worry about it. Once it wasout of the mountains and out of the labs they didn't think aboutit very much. Now, what's the legacy of Laos. Well, the legacy ofLaos, I think, is something that nobody's really thought about.Let's look at it. For ten years the CIA's biggest operation wascompletely integrated with the structure of the Indochina opiumtrade. The capacity of that army to fight and move, the capacityof those people to survive and to keep replacing soldiers(because they were killed by the tens of thousands). We werefighting with boy soldiers by the time it was over. I mean, thosesoldiers had to keep delivering the troops. The whole apparatuswas integrated with the opium trade, the whole secret warapparatus was part of the opium trade. We ran that war throughVang Pao. He was a general in the Laotian army, but moreimportantly, he was the CIA's general. Now, Vang Pao was not froma traditional elite family. He was never very popular with theHmong, certainly not at that time. And his capacity to getrecruits out of the villages once the war started taking heavycasualties and people were seeing one and two and three sonsdying, his capacity to extract more and more recruits to keepthat war going relied upon him being able to pressure thosevillages. I was in a village in Laos that stopped sendingrecruits and the CIA cut off the rice supply and those peoplewere pushed to the brink of starvation. They had lost all themales down to the 14-year-olds. The village and district leaderdidn't want to send the 14-year-olds. "This is the nextgeneration," he said. "If we lose these kids, then wewill disappear. We won't produce another generation. We can't dothis." And so he said no, we've been doing this for six orseven years now, we've lost everybody, we're not going to do itany more. So they cut off his rice. The other thing that Vang Pao had was theopium. Remember, they had the two basic commodities - rice tosurvive and opium for cash to buy everything that they needed. SoVang Pao became the big opium broker for the Hmong and, as such,he gained extraordinary power over their economy and thus overtheir lives. So that by controlling those two products, opium andrice - the supply of rice and the export of opium from thevillages - Vang Pao controlled those villages and could forcethem to support him even after the casualties began to mount. My metaphor for Vang Pao is kind of like aJudas Goat. Do you know what a Judas goat is? In the stockyards,I don't know if it's still done, but let's say when you'releading sheep to the slaughter, there's a goat that will lead thesheep through the maze of the stockyards and then, as they'reheading into the chute, the Judas goat jumps aside and the flockof sheep go pelting through to get hit with electrodes or hammersand be slaughtered. That's how you have to think of Vang Pao - askind of like a tribal Judas goat leading the males to theslaughter. Except, the Hmong are not like sheep - they knowwhat's going on - they know that they're being slaughtered. It'snot like they're being slaughtered in one room at one time -they're being slaughtered slowly over a decade. So how does heget to keep leading them? Through the control over these twoproducts. You've got, then, a CIA secret war which in anessential way, in a fundamental way is linked with the opiumtraffic. More than that, it appears that a number of CIAoperatives as individuals got involved. They started smuggling,started wheeling, started dealing and started doing a couple ofbags here and there. We know, for example, there's a famous caseof a CIA global money-moving bank called the Nugan-Hand bankwhichwas established in Australia. The founder of that was a MichaelJohn Hand. He was a green beret who was a contract CIA operativein Laos. When he first came to Australia in 1969-1970 Australianfederal police got intelligence on him - I've seen the files -saying that what he's basically doing is he's bringing down lightaircraft that are flying from Thailand to northern Australia intothose abandoned air strips that were left over from World War IIand he's dealing heroin. That's what Michael John Hand, accordingto Australian federal police intelligence, was doing. So, asindividuals CIA operatives were getting involved and more or lesswhat you've got then as a result of Laos is that the policy ofintegrating intelligence and cover operations with narcotics getsestablished. You get, then, an entire generation of covertaction warriors used to dealing with narcotics as a matter ofpolicy. In short, you get a policy and personnel which integratescovert action with narcotics. This manifests itself in a numberof ways. First of all the Nugan-Hand bank. Not only was it movingmoney globally for the CIA, but it was the major money launderingconduit that was trimming funds up to Southeast Asia fromAustralia and linking the Golden Triangle heroin trade ofSoutheast Asia with the urban markets of Australia. InAfghanistan as well, this same distributing pattern that we sawin Laos emerges. This is one case that hasn't been well studied.I've spoken to one correspondent for the Far East Economic Reviewwhich is a Dow-Jones Publication, Mr. Lawrence Lifschultz(?), afriend of mine, and what he found was something of a similarpattern that I found in Laos. He was a correspondent in Pakistanand Afghanistan during the Mujahadeen campaign and he wrotearticles in the Nation and elsewhere describing this similarpattern. You've got Pakistani government officials very heavilyinvolved in narcotics, you've got the Mujahadeen manufacturingheroin, they're exporting it to Europe and the United States.They're using it to support their guerrilla campaign. thePakistanis and the CIA are complicitous on the level of (1) notdoing anything or (2) actually getting involved in the case ofsome of the Pakistani elite. So, it's a case where the Mujahadeeoperation becomes ultimately integrated with the narcotics tradeand the CIA is fully informed of the integration and doesn't doanything about it. Moving on to our fourth instance, one close tohome, is the whole Iran-contra operation. First of all, I think the Laos parallel is verystrong in the Iran-contra operation. Just in the formal outlinesof the policy - you know, you've got the contras on the border ofNicaragua, they're a mercenary army, they're supported through ahumanitarian operation, they're given U.S. logistic support,they're given U.S. equipment and they're given U.S. air powerbackup to deliver the equipment and the logistic support. All thepersonnel that are involved in that operation are Laos veterans.Ted Shackley, Thomas Clines, Oliver North, Richard Secord - theyall served in Laos during thiten-year war. They are all part ofthat policy of integrating narcotics andbeing complicitous in thenarcotics trade in the furtherance of covert action. In this case, what I think we can see is it'snot just the same. It's not just simply that the CIA wascomplicitous in allowing the contras to deal in cocaine, to serveas a link between the Andes and across the Caribbean into theUnited States. I think we can see the situation has gotten worse.In Laos, as I said, the CIA was hands-off. Once it got beyondtheir secret base, they wouldn't touch it. They gave Vang Pao theaircraft and once it got any further they didn't really knowabout it and didn't want to know about it. They remained ignorantabout it. And ultimately what you're looking at was a trafficthat was in a remote region which, in a way I don'tthink the CIAsaw was going to happen, wound up serving Americans. An estimateof 50% of U.S. combat forces in Vietnam taking drugs, what wascommon at that time. But it's still remote and it's still notgoing directly into the United States. The level of cynicism in Central America iseven worse. We're not talking about original traffic or movingthe raw product - we're talking about taking finished cocaine,providing aircraft, moreover providing protection for thesetraffickers as they fly across the Caribbean with these massiveloads of cocaine. Now, I don't know. Can one estimate whatpercentage of the cocaine was politically protected by theseintelligence operations. Until there's a formal investigation,which there's not likely to be, it's difficult to say. I think that one can say that as you look atthe drugs flowing into the United States during the 1960s whenthis Lao operation was going, there was probably a much smallerpercentage of narcotics entering the United States frompolitically protected brokers than there is today. In otherwords, this CIA policy of integrating covert action operationswith narcotics, both at a level of individuals being involved andalso just turning a blind eye to the fact that our allies aredrug brokers, this complicity in the narcotics trade has gottenworse. It's closer to home. It's not moving the raw material outin the jungles, it's actually bringing the finished narcotics,cocaine, into the United States. So it's gotten that much closerto homeand that much more cynical. Barsamian: Could you talk about the 1971 Nixon"War on Drugs" and the 1989 version of the same warlaunched by George Bush? Do you see any parallels? McCoy: The parallel is striking and I'msurprised that commentators haven't made more of it. My ownfeeling is that the Bush war on drugs is modeled exactly on thewar fought by his mentor, president Bush's mentor, Richard Nixon.America has in its history of a century of drug abuse, attemptedtwo times a solution to the drug problem. The first one was theNixon war on drugs in 1972-73 and the second is now the Bush waron drugs. Let's look at the Nixon war on drugs in orderto get some sense of the probable outcome of the Bush war. Nixondeclared war on drugs in 1973 in the Anatolian plateau. There's apretty good book by a man named Robert J. Epstein called Agencyof Fear looking at the drug agency involved in this war on drugs.What he concluded was that Nixon was faced with a delicatepolitical problem when he took office. He'd promised law andorder. Once he got into office, Epstein says that hefound out that the federal government's actual intervention inlaw enforcement in the United States is minimal. It's localpolice that do law enforcement. It's everybody's property taxesthat put cops in their cars. So the American president may bepowerful in many respects, but he's not powerful in lawenforcement areas. What Nixon very quickly worked out is the onlysubstantive area law enforcement where the federal government hadany authority and capacity for action was in narcotics. So whathe did was he manufactured a crisis and then he came up with asolution. The crisis came from a series of press releasesfrom the Drug Enforcement Administration, releasing statisticsshowing a massive expansion in the number of addicts. Now, theyeven took me in on this. I read those statistics like everybodyelse and I said, "My god, this is getting out ofcontrol." But all they had done was to change thestatistical ratio. In the 1960s before Nixon, our numbers of drugaddicts - about 60,000 - came from two things: (1) a centralregistry of addicts into which police put the name of everyaddict. Another way figures were derived was through astatistical ratio between the number of bodies in the morgue fromoverdoses and the overall addict population. All the DEA didunder Nixon was to change the ratio between corpses and addicts.They just simply said ... I forget now the statistics - let's sayit was 1 to 2. For every corpse you're likely to have twoaddicts. Then they made it 1 to 10 - for every corpse you canhave ten addicts. So suddenly we had this massive expansion butit was just a result of statistical manipulation, changing theratio between the known (the corpse) and the unknown (the numberof addicts). In this way they manufactured this enormous sense ofcrisis. Moreover, there was more crime that wasprobably somewhat drug-related in the 60s and 70s - maybe, maybenot, I don't know. But in any case, they made this equation.We've got more drugs, we've got more addicts, we've got morecrime. Having manufactured this crisis, having"discovered" the problem of this massive expansion inheroin addiction, Nixon then declared war as his solution. Nixon's image of the drug trade went like this:that there was raw opium being diverted from licensed opiumgrowers in Turkey. There is, in fact, a legitimate pharmaceuticalneed for morphine which comes, like heroin, from the opium poppy.Turkey was a legal producer of opium for the pharmaceuticalmarket, for patient's in hospitals who are dying of cancer and inincredible pain - they needed morphine. Troops use it in battle -it's a big market for people in accidents, all sorts of things.It's an important drug and has been for millennia. Turkey was a legitimate producer but what washappening, according to Nixon, was that peasants were producingmore than their quota and selling it to the black market; it wasworking its way down through Lebanon, across the Mediterraneaninto Marseilles labs and then the United States. So Nixon saidthat he was going to fight his war on drugs, battle one on theAnatolian plateau of Turkey. It was a very simple war. It was awar that didn't involve very much. All Nixon did was announcethis war. He then used the very close defense relationshipbetween Turkey and the United States to pressure the Turksthrough normal well-established diplomatic channels, to forcetheir farmers to go out of production. The Turkish government was faced with a choice- they could risk their whole strategic relationship with theUnited States in defense of farmers from a remote small regionwho were producing a minor product. Although it offendednationalism, they did it. They went along with it. Nixon alsooffered them, I think, $35 million to develop substitute crops,so there was a carrot-and-a-stick. The stick was the threat of atroubled strategic relationship and the carrot was this foreignaid bonus that was going to help these farmers produce a newcrop. So the Turks went along and it was a verysimple battle. Nixon then declared war. He started thenmanipulating the statistics downward, changing them so the publicwould see the problem was getting under control. Then Watergateintervened and all of his political plans went awry. A number ofthe people that were hired for his super drug agency called DALEbecame, in fact, the people that were involved in the Watergateconspiracy itself. So, as Watergate erupted, his whole drugprogram blew up and he got into a whole set of different problemsand his drug strategy went away. But the DEA, long after theklieg lights were turned off and the correspondents went home,was still fighting the war on drugs and we went to Nixon to Fordand Carter. They had greatly expanded operational funds and agreatly expanded establishment. What the first war of drugs seemed to haveproduced, on balance, was a worsening of America's drug problem.The attempted interdiction failed - not only did it fail, itworsened the drug problem. Why do I say this, because it's afairly strong conclusion? It's one I reached by looking at it. The United States applied a very simple lawenforcement model to a complex global commodity trade. Let melook at those words now. What's a law enforcement model? Okay.You've got a prostitute or a group of prostitutes operating on astreet corner in a brothel. You raid them, you put them in jail,you stop prostitution. It can be done. You've got somebody, let'ssay, more localized - running peep shows. Close them down. Theregoes peep shows. You've got people doing, let's say, stealingcars and cutting up auto parts - well, you can handle that. It'slocalized. It's within police capacities. This is a simple thing.This is a small business, being run by a limited number ofdefinable vice entrepreneurs. They are subject to an enforcementoperation which can wipe out their business. This is not true of narcotics. The variables,the points of pressure are global. We can't control them all. Fortwo centuries now we've had integration of the first world demandfor drugs, initially legal and now illegal - people in thissociety, and they're different people at different times, takeillicit drugs. They take coca and opiate based products. Theytake cocaine and heroin and they have now for centuries. So thiswell-established demand for drugs, which save for the disruptionof war has never gone away, it's just constant, there's a markethere, has been tied into the complex political economy of thehighland regions of the Andes and the southern Asian mountainrim. You're not talking about small localized areas. You'retalking about the whole Andes, from Bolivia all the way throughto Ecuador for coca. In Asia, for opium, when you actually lookat a map, you're looking at almost a unitary drug zone thatranges for nearly 5,000 miles across the southern rim of Asia. Itstarts in the rest in the Anatolia plateau of Turkey, it thengoes into Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Burma, Thailand, Laos,and once upon a time North Vietnam but not any more. It runsright across the whole southern rim of the Asian land mass. Sowhen Nixon came into Anatolia and wiped out the Anatolian market,Anatolia is just one player! In fact, if you look at thepercentages, they were less than 10% of the illicit market. Whatdid that do? Well, as any farmer will tell you, if Russiadoesn't produce any wheat, we're going to do very well here. Wewill know about that - if we don't know about it this year, we'llknow about it next year - American farmers will get more money.They will go out and plant more wheat - they'll have a big bumpercrop because Russia's not producing wheat, the crop's failed, theprice goes up. Well, in the case of the Nixon drug war inAnatolia, we wiped out illicit production in Anatolia. Whathappened? The price for reliable, available illicit narcoticsshot up in the world. So Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle, whichis the world's largest supplier, met that demand. So we got thenthe Southeast Asian market, which had hitherto been justregional, coming out of the mountains of Southeast Asia to thecities of Southeast Asia - now began to export to the UnitedStates, let's say the northwestern United States. By 1974 inSeattle, nearly 50% of all the drug seizures in the streets ofSeattle were from Southeast Asia. So the Nixon White House gotupset - "We just wiped it out in Turkey! Let's get afirebreak team out to Southeast Asia!" So they sent afirebreak team out to Southeast Asia, okay. They sent 40 agentsinto Bangkok and they're all bankrolled to the hilt. They rentedan entire division of the Thai national police! They put out the word on the streets thatanybody that sells drugs can turn the drug buyer in and, noquestions asked, they'll give him a bonus. So in Bangkok if youwere a dealer you could sell to a foreign buyer and you couldthen turn around and turn them in so you get a percentage bonuson busting this guy! They actually then put what I call a"customs shield" down. The cost of expo went up becauseyou had all these seizures. For every kilo you're sending, maybeyou're losing one in three - we don't know how many they weresendingexactly, but they were losing a lot. The seizures went wayup. So, what did the drug exporters of SoutheastAsia do? Well, I wasn't privy to their councils, nobody was. Myfeeling is the drug warlords of Southeast Asia sat around andwere faced with two choices: (1) they could go out of business,but they weren't about to do that; and (2) they find a newmarket.That's what they did. They found new markets and I'm surethey thought it over like we would. Mere are only four areas ofthe world that have the standards of living to support the veryhigh cost of international narcotics trafficking. They're NorthAmerica(Canada and the United States), Japan, Europe andAustralia. Well, the North American market was closed for reasonswe just described, so what did the exporters do? They startedexporting to Australia and Europe. Australia and Europe had nodrug problem. In 1970, Holland had maybe 800 addicts. In 1976Holland had 10,000 addicts. And that's what happened all overEurope. Europe's got a big drug problem. The Southeast Asiansyndicates just started shipping straight to Europe. Australia had no drug problem in 1975. They nowhave a drug problem with heroin, as large in proportion as theUnited States. It came from the same period. So you suddenly havetwo big new markets - not only America as your destination. Well,meanwhile, American dealers can't get their stuff fromSoutheastAsia so they turn to Mexico. Mexico booms, Mexico gets closeddown and then they turn to Southwest Asia - Pakistan andAfghanistan. In short, what you get as a result of this attemptat suppression is an elaboration of global trafficking routes -not just one big market, America, but now three big markets -Europe, Australia and America. And not just one major source,Turkey, but in fact, the whole of this mountain band of Asia isready to supply the world. There's now been a disruption withcocaine in Central America because of all this pressure andthere's been some disruption in Afghanistan. Southeast Asia isnow number one. In short, what we have then is an elaboration oftrafficking routes - more areas of consumption, more areas ofproduction, more tightly knit together so that the attemptedinterdiction complicated the global trafficking to the point thatit's now beyond any interdiction effort. I would think that theprobable consequences of the Bush attempted interdiction in LatinAmerica will be similar. You can't predict quite how it's goingto work out, but based on what we knowfrom the Nixon drug wars,it'll make the problem worse. Barsamian: And in your view, the enforcementeffort has been totally compromised? McCoy: Well, yeah, the enforcement effort suchas it is. Although, you know, it's usually run by bureaucratsthat are reasonably dedicated to what they're doing. If you meetdrug agents and you talk to them about whatthey're doing, theybelieve they're trying to do something good. They think thatkeeping drugs out of America is a good thing to do and I thinkthat everybody would agree that these guys are doing an importantjob. That's why we keep hiring more of them and they get killedlike Camarena in Mexico and take a lot of risks. I'm not talkingabout them, okay? But what are they essentially trying to do?What are these drug agents trying to do? They're trying to find out who the drug brokersare, they're trying to get the drug brokers arrested, they'retrying to get the host government where they're operating -whether it be Mexico or Thailand - to use their very substantialpolice forces to crack down on the drug lords. The next thingthey're trying to do is to cut the connection between 'Thailandand Mexico or Central America and the United States. So, over theshort term, they're trying to stop the drugs, make seizures,disrupt it. Over the long term, identify the traffickers, thebrokers and their political supporters, and get these guys out ofbusiness. That's the job of the anti-drug bureaucracy. It's only been a strong bureaucracy now forabout 15 years, since the Nixon war on drugs they beefed the DEAup and it keeps getting beefed up. One of the things that willhappen as a result of the Bush drug war I expectwill be anothermajor expansion of the DEA. Working against that has been theCentral Intelligence Agency. Because of their mandate to stopcommunism or to run a secret army in Laos or to harass theNicaragua government with the contra operation - because they'vehad a political covert action mandate- they have found itconvenient to ally themselves with the very drug brokers the DEAis trying to put in jail. While you're working with the CIAyouare untouchable. The CIA backs you up. There are instances ofminor traffickers being arrested in the United States forimporting drugs and the CIA will actually go to the local policeand courts and get them off and out because oftentimes theythreaten to talk, make trouble, so the CIA just gets them out.What the CIA does in these known instances it does more broadly.I, for example, had reason to gather evidence based on talking toAmerican officials in my own inquiry that the Chief of Staff ofthe Royal Laotian Army and the commander of the CIA secret armywas involved in drugs. What happened when I made this allegation?The CIA did everything to discredit my allegations. They attackedme. 'They didn't attack Vang Pao who was operating a heroin ring.They didn't go after General Owen Radicone(?) who had the world'sbiggest heroin operation - they went after me! They tried tosuppress my book, they threatened to murder my sources, theyspent $25 million in staging a massive opium burning by theNationalist Chinese forces in northern Thailand announcing theywere retiring from the drug trade. I mean, they went through allkinds of hoops to discredit me and my allegations. They protectthese guys. While you're working with the agency, you areprotected. So at critical points in the history of theinternational drug trade, the CIA has moved in and allied itselfwith local drug brokers. Often times the brokers have been ableto use that alliance to their advantage and at a critical timewhen they were making new connections, they were reaching out andopening new markets there their whole apparatus was exposed in away that it won't be once they get it tied down and get theprocedures established. At this critical point they're underprotection from the CIA. Barsamian: Are there any facets of thedocumentation that you developed and the evidence that youuncovered in your research in writing The Politics of Heroin inSoutheast Asia, any new information that you've uncovered inrecent years that you might add or change regarding your originalinvestigations? McCoy: The book was, for whatever reason,pretty solid. A number of CIA people I've met since have saidthat it's pretty accurate. Some of them - the only complaintsI've had are some who say that "it wasn't really us inanalysis, it was really the covert action boys." It wasreally what's called "plans," the director of theplans, which is one of four divisions of the CIA. A lot of agencypeople who I'm sure are in intelligence analysis feel kind ofbesmirched and offended, but they generally agree that it's apretty accurate depiction of what's going on. Barsamian: Do you think that the current war ondrugs might be used as a vehicle of U.S. intervention in foreigncountries? McCoy: That is something I can't answer. We canonly speculate. This is a conversation, so I'll speculate. Theevidence brought out by Jonathan Marshall who's preparing a bookon cocaine in Central America - he's the op ed page editor of theOakland Tribune - and most recently by the New York Times, raisesreal questions about the Panama operation. I mean, Noriega wasportrayed as this desperate drug lord, this satanic figure thathad to be knocked out in order for the drug war to go ahead. Andwe knocked out this evil man, Noriega, and put him on trial inMiami. Then we put in a government which, according tothe New York Times g don't know if you saw that report) ... agovernment which is, in fact, linked either personally or theirrelatives are linked with the Panamanian banking industry. Now ... why is there a big banking industry inPanama? Panama is a little tiny country that wasformerly a province of Colombia before the United Statesseparated them and built the canal. For Colombians, Panama isjust like next door. It's the old province. And yet it's not apart of Colombia any more. So if you're a Panamanian cocaine merchant, if you're the Medellin cartel or theCali cartel, where do you do your banking? You don't do it inBogota, you do it in Panama City and you do it through these bigPanamanian banks. If you've ever noticed the photographs of thefinancial district of Panama City, it looks like a mini-WallStreet or a mini4owntown Los Angeles. Why? Why in this pooreconomy do you have this elaborate banking structure? It's builtfrom money laundering and the Endara government, as individuals -and of his vice presidents, several of his cabinet ministers -are an the boards of banks which have been big in the moneylaundering industry. Moreover, one of Endara's key cabinet peoplewas actually a lawyer for one of the big drug lords of Colombia.So what you're looking at is we replaced Manuel Noriega who issupposedly this evil drug dealer who moved a million dollars ofdrugs and made $4 million from the Medellin cartel - we replacethis guy with people who represent the Panamanian money-laundering industry which was moving the money from the UnitedStates to Colombia. We got rid of some petty thug, some tough guyon the street who's stealing hubcaps, and we put the Mafia inpower. Why? Why? I don't know yet. I mean, what itmeans to me is that the whole Panamanian operation didn't haveanything to do with the drug war. I think it has to do withessentially trying to maintain influence in Panama. And Noriega,whatever else he was, was a nationalist who was very good atmanipulating the United States. I think that infuriated us. Justto continue my speculative theme, my scenario - uninformed andtotally ignorant, just based at looking at Laos and then guessingwhat could be going on in Colombia and Panama - my scenario wouldbe that the hidden history of Panama maybe reads like this: You have a nationalist general who takes thiscolonial creation of the United States, this country of Panama,and gives it some dignity, a charismatic figure - General OmarTorrijos. The United States hated Torrijos. They hated him why?Because Torrijos was a convincing nationalist. He mobilized thePanamanian people, he had some kind of intentional prestige, andhe forced the United States to give up our greatest jewel ofempire - the canal, which for a certain type of American isembedded in our consciousness. I mean, what India was to theBritish, what the Netherlands Indies was to Holland, the PanamaCanal is to us. That's our empire, you know, our great triumph. So Torrijos took away the canal and - guesswhat!? - Reagan comes into office and Torrijos has an aircraftaccident. Why? How? It's never been explained. Maybe hewas killed. The CIA runs a lot of maintenance and aircraft firmsin the Caribbean - maybe they did it. Anyhow, somebody killsTorrijos so they're looking around for some new pliable man toput in power to make sure they don't have trouble. So theyinstall Noriega and they know Noriega's reliable because theyknow Noriega's been doing the drug operations for them in a smallkind of petty way. So they know they've got him. He's manageable- he moves the drugs, he does whatever he wants, he's theintelligence chief under Torrijos. Now he's the CIA's liaison andperfectly reliable. What does Noriega do? He turns around anddoes exactly what Torrijos did. He plays to the nationalistcrowd, he uses the drug money and the Panamanian economy to buildup an independent political base so that he's no longercontrollable. So what do we do? We stigmatize him as a drug lord,we go in and invade, we get rid of him, we put in an ugly,pliable government. We got rid of a man who maybe made $4 millionfrom drugs and we replace him with a cabinet who arerepresentatives of a multi-billion dollar bank-cum-moneylaundering industry. To me the logic is not so much to get rid ofdrugs but to maintain U.S. influence in a key strategic area at atime when the Canal is about to be turned over and the Canalstill remains strategically significant for the United States. Somy hunch, my guess, my uninformed opinion is that the Panamanianintervention has very little to do with drugs and everything todo with U.S. power abroad We dressed up our national strategicinterest,no longer in the ball gown of anti-communism but in theformal wear of anti-narcotics policy. We're still justmaintaining U.S. power and it's likely that the drug war is goingto have other episodes like this. Whether or not the whole drugwar will ultimately become a prisoner, a creation of U.S. globalstrategic interests I don't know. It's too early to say. Butinthis particular instance the major battle in the drug war looksvery dubious. Barsamian: In your view, there will be a markedincrease and expansion of drug addiction and drug use in theUnited States, Europe and Australia - Incidentally, earlier youmentioned that the drug flow went into Europe and Australia, butnot into Japan, is that correct? McCoy: Yes. Barsamian: Why not? McCoy: The relationship between the rulingLiberal Democratic Party (the conservatives) and the bigorganized crime syndicates, which are enormous in Japan, is avery tight one and has been historically since the end of WorldWar II. There's been a very close integration with the organizedcrime operations and the ruling conservative party. Theconservatives have been in power now in Japan since 1948. It'sone of the longest reigns of any party anywhere in the world.There's a kind of entente, an understanding between thesyndicates and the government - it's not rigid - but the basicunderstanding is no drugs. That's the basic thing. Don't movedrugs. And the Japanese police are ruthlessly efficient. If anyof the syndicates, any of the big families - some of them have10,000 members in them - broke this rule, the police havesufficient mechanisms of control to punish them for it. So inthis complex politics of organized crime in Japan, they can doprostitution, they can do all kinds of fraud, they can do manythings - but not drugs. So Japan's never opened up. DeGaulle had a very similar relationship withthe Corsican syndicates during his reign in the 1960s and early1970s. The understanding was that the Corsican syndicates inMarseilles would manufacture in Marseilles under protection. Butthey would not sell in France. They would only export to theUnited States. That began to break down. DeGaulle died, Pompidouxreplaced him and the Gaullists lost power, there was pressure onthe syndicates, some new groups came in and started breaking therule, and France wound up with a drug problem. But forpractically a decade that rule held.

It documents alleged CIA involvement in covertdrug running activities and how they supposedly interfered withthe nation's attempts to recover American prisoners of war andthose missing in action. You may find it unbelievable. You maynot be surprised at what it says. I have several comments which Iwill append to end of the document. Suffice it to say thatinformation of this type is its own shocking kind of pornography.As far as I can see Gritz's, arguments are more or less sound.The evidence from three separate sources is even more compelling.As I watched this video I felt thoroughly violated. It is notenjoyable reading, but it may well be true. Be careful when you seek the truth. Upon finding it you may beforced to change your view of the world. Jim Burnes _______________________________________________________________________ (apologies to the original quote) (Transcriber's note: The following is a transcription ofspoken English and as such can be difficult to read, much lesstranscribe. I have tried to preserve exactly as was spoken exceptfor a few places where I have organized the language used toclarify meaning. I am not an English major so don't slam me fornot using perfect English punctuation in the sometimes ratherstrange usages.) Colonel Bo Gritz Addressing the American Liberty Lunch Club: What I want to tell you very quickly is something that I feelis more heinous than the Bataan death march. Certainly it is ofmore concern to you as Americans than the Watergate. What I'mtalking about is something we found out in Burma - May 1987. Wefound it out from a man named Khun Sa. He is the recognizedoverlord of heroin in the world. Last year he sent 900 tons of opiates and heroin into the freeworld. This year it will be 1200 tons. (video showing discussionat Khun Sa's headquarters -- some translation of Burmese toEnglish going on..Bo Gritz still talking to Lunch club in theforeground) On video tape he said to us something that was mostastounding: that US government officials have been and are nowhis biggest customers, and have been for the last twenty years. Iwouldn't believe him. We fought a war in Laos and Cambodia evenas we fought whatever it was in Vietnam. The point is that thereare as many bomb holes in those two other countries as there arein Vietnam. Five hundred and fifty plus Americans were lost inLaos. Not one of them ever came home. We heard a president say,"The war is over, we are out with honor - all of theprisoners are home." and a few other lies. Now we got rid ofthat president, but we didn't get rid of the problem. We ran thewar in Laos and Cambodia through drugs. The money that would notbe appropriated by a liberal congress, was appropriated. And youknow who we used for distribution? Santos Trafficante, old friendof the CIA and mobster out of Cuba and Florida. We lost the war! Fifty-eight-thousand Americans were killed. Seventy-thousandbecame drug casualties. In the sixties and seventies you saw aninfusion of drugs into America like never was before. Where doyou think the Mafia takes the heroin and opiates that it getsthrough its arrangement with the US government? It doesn'tdistribute them in Africa or Europe. This is the big money bag here. We're Daddy Warbucks for them.So I submit to you that the CIA has been pressed for solutions.Each time they have gone to the sewer to find it. And you can'tsmell like a rose when you've been playing in the cesspool. We'vebeen embracing organized crime. Now you've all looked and heardabout Ollie North, about the Contras, about nobody knowinganything. (cut to part of Iran Contra hearings with Ollie Northexplaining the flow of funds from Iran to the Contras) North: And Mr. Gorbanifar suggested several incentives to make thatFebruary transaction work. And the attractive incentive for mewas the one he made that residuals could flow to support theNicaraguan resistance. Legislator: Even Gorbanifar knew that you were supporting the Contras. North: Yes he did. Isvestia knew it. The name had been in the papersin Moscow. It had been all over Danny Ortega's newscasts. RadioHavana was broadcasting it. It had been in every newspaper in theland. Legislator: All our enemies knew it and you wanted to keep it from theUnited States Congress. North: We wanted to be able to deny a covert operation. (back to Bo at the Luncheon Club) We have a constitution that says that the laws will be made bythe Congress, enforced by the executive branch, interpreted bythe judicial branch. But in reality we have an executive branchthat has for more than a twenty years operated in what what OllieNorth called a parallel government. When the Congress says no, itmakes no difference. They're gonna do it anyway. And it isspecial intelligence - top secret. Why? Not because thecommunists don't know what were doing, it's to keep it a secretfrom you. You're not capable of making those kinds of decisionsaccording to those in parallel government. The reason I know ...I was there. I've been a product of parallel government myself. (Narrator) Lieutenant Colonel James 'Bo' Gritz is the most decoratedGreen Beret commander of the Vietnam Era. General WilliamWestmoreland, in writing his memoirs, singled out Bo Gritz as the"American Soldier" for his exemplary courage in combatand outstanding ingenuity in recovering a highly secret black-boxthe Viet-Cong had taken from a crashed U2 spy plane. The featurefilms "Rambo", "Uncommon Valor" and"Missing in Action" were based in part upon hisreal-life military experiences. (Back to Bo) Dick Secord, General, United States Air Force, a man I knowwell, said it best. Before the senate investigating committeeDick Secord was asked - if we were supporting the Contras, whywere we selling them arms bought from a communist block nation atexorbitant profit rates. (skip to scene from hearings) Senator: If the purpose of the enterprise was to help the contras, whydid you charge Colero a mark-up? Secord: We were in business to make a living, Senator. We had to makea living. I didn't see anything wrong with it at the time. It wasa commercial enterprise. Senator: Oh..I thought the purpose of the enterprise was to aidColero's cause. Secord: Can't I have two purposes? I did. Senator: Oh..allright. (back to Bo) And then Dick Secord said in his playboy interview: "Ithink I deserve the eight million that we made from the Iran armssale for all the hard work I did." If you've got to pay apatriot, you've got the wrong guy. (applause from audience) These are patriots for profit. There has been a guise ofpatriotism that a lot of people have been hiding behind. War istheir business. Business has been good. (fade to shots of the Vietnam 'conflict' - Narrator takes overagain) Bo Gritz risked his life a thousand times in combat in Vietnambefore he was sent by a national security council staffer TomHarvey in the White House to Burma in November of 1986 in searchof American prisoners of war. He discovered instead a heroinhighway and a nation betrayed by high level American officialsinvolved in narcotics trafficking. Tom Harvey and his superiorsin the White House were not pleased with Bo's report. (fade to scene of Bo - now with beard in a field obviouslysomewhere in Southeast Asia - palm trees and oxen indigenous tothe area abound - I assume its in either Burma or Thailand) The thing that I was most concerned about was - and I thoughtwas fantastic - was the general's offer to stop the flow of opiumand heroin into the free world. When I asked him (assume he'stalking about a conversation with Tom Harvey now) he said"that's fantastic". There was a pause, then he said,"Bo, there's no one here that supports that." And Isaid, "What?! Vice-President Bush has been appointed bypresident Reagan as the Number One policeman to control drugentry into the United States. How can you say there's no interestand no support when we bring back a video tape with a directinterview with a man who puts 900 tons of opium and heroin acrossinto the free world every year and is willing to stop it?"And he said, "Bo, what can I tell you? All I can tell you is there is no interest in doing thathere." Well that made me wonder. That's because it doesn't soundAmerican and it doesn't sound right. Thats when we began to doour own investigation because for about three years people hadtold me, both in Washington DC and, interestingly enough, inOklahoma city that the whole POW situation was being underminedby US government officials involved in drug trafficking. Iwouldn't believe it. I said, "You guys aren't playing with afull deck... you've got yourselves strung out too thin." Andthey said, "Bo, you better listen, because for three yearswe've had prisoners literally within our grasp and something hashappened at the last minute." (I said), "Each time I'vemade every effort to cooperate with government officials. I can'tbelieve that people in the US government would actually, eitherovertly or covertly, do anything to undermine a rescue operation." Well, we're still without Prisoners of War and there is nointerest, we're told at the White House, in stopping the flow ofdrugs coming in from the Golden Triangle into the free world. (fade to front-page articles about Bo Gritz in Parade magazineand Soldier of Fortune...narrator picks up here) Lieutenant Colonel Bo Gritz is no stranger to controversy. Inthirty years of devoted service to the US Army and to therecovery of American prisoners of war, he has encountered plenty.The making of this American warrior began early. He was fiveyears old when his father, a B-17 pilot, was shot down overEurope during World War II. His mother, a pilot with the women'sAir Force, would later marry a master sergeant and remain withthe occupation forces in Germany after the war. Raised by hismaternal grandparents in Oklahoma, young Bo Gritz began trainingat Fort Union Military Academy in Virginia. He was named CorpsCommander in his senior year when he chanced upon a recruitingposter that changed his life. In short order, Gritz won his greenberet in the Army Special forces by passing all courses in theunconventional warfare training. After graduating from officer'scandidate school, the newly-commissioned second lieutenant theninsisted on Ranger training. Assigned to the command of the firstmobile South Vietnamese gorilla forces to be organized, Gritzalso operated secretly in Cambodia and Laos with his force ofCambodian mercenaries, or "Bos", as he called them. Byofficial body-count, over 450 of the enemy died as a result ofGritz's actions. His wartime records are replete with examples ofBo's concern for keeping Americans alive in a war gone mad. As recon chief of the supersecret delta-force, Bo was citedfor Valor in saving the lives of 30 US Infantrymen from theBigRed-One division. More often than not, his valor was inplacing himself between the enemy and his men. According to anofficial military report dated 31 July 1967 submitted on thenMajor Gritz, "His personal bravery is legendary exemplifiedby the fact that he has been awarded five silver stars andnumerous other decorations for valor." In all Bo Gritz wasawarded 62 citations for valor, five silver stars, eight bronzestars, two purple hearts and a presidential citation. Bo was ready to sign up for a fifth tour of duty when he had atalk with General Fred Weiyan (sp?), the "daddy-rabbit"in Vietnam. As Gritz described it, "I was a major andspecial operations chief. I'll never forget that day. I stoodthere and heard that man say. Bo, your not going to win the warand neither am I." That was the most disillusioning momentof my life. It meant that every man who had ever lost his fingeror his life had lost it for nothing. I decided, on the spot, toleave Vietnam. I would not kill another enemy or risk anothercomrade's life." (back to Bo at the luncheon) I've had the opportunity to do a lot of things that otherofficers have not. I was the first recon chief and intelligenceofficer for delta-force. Commanded the first gorilla forces thatwent behind enemy lines. When I commanded special forces in LatinAmerica, we did it exactly right. And we did exactly what men incamoflage are supposed to do. It was very natural that Harold R.Aaron (sp?) would single me out because, besides having asixth-degree black belt in karate, I have established an abilityto operate on my own. And I think when Aaron said, "Bo, wewant you to do this", he understood that I'm also hardheaded enough that I wouldn't cave in. He said, "I want youto consider retiring. It would only be temporary. We haveoverwhealming evidence now that people are still there, beingheld in communist prisons." Mr. H. Ross Perot had been askedby Eugene Tighe, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, toback a private mission that would look into the POW situation.Perot said, "Bo, I want you to go there. I want you to doeverything you have to do. You come and tell me there aren't anyprisoners of war left alive." (narrator) Bo returned from Indo-China with extensive evidence that therewere indeed American prisoners of war in captivity, including asolid report of 47 at one particular camp. Perot turned theproject back over to General Tighe who wrote to Secretary ofDefense, Harold Brown asking that the source, a Nguyen Dok Jong(sp?) be brought to the United States for a polygraph test. Brownrepeated the request to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. One monthlater, Vance finally responded that the commissioner ofimmigration would not permit Jong into the United States forfurther questioning. As Bo puts it, "Think about it. Oneman, not a thousand and the defense intelligence agency chief andsecretary of state can't get him into the country. That was apretty clear signal that the military was politically handcuffedon the prisoner of war issue." For eight years Gritz sought to find and free American POW's.He crossed five times behind enemy lines into communist Laos andVietnam. Three times he was within moments of embracing thoseAmerican heroes our government had declared dead. Each timesomething unexplained caused Gritz and his Operation Lazarus teamto fall short with freedom and victory in sight for the POWs. There has never been a shortage of criticism from any numberof armchair generals such as Robert K. Brown of "Soldier ofFortune" magazine who devoted an entire issue to condemningGritz's efforts. Even to the extent of publishing documentsstolen from Bo while he was on the mission in Laos. They haveeven belittled his prayer before crossing enemy lines. (Gritz isa devout Mormon...Ed) His critics said he should have looked morelike the Rambo in the movies, who actually avoided the draft inan all-girls school in Switzerland. More debilitating than the hundreds of miles on foot withinenemy territory has been the disinformation propagated by thosewithin our government who have covered up the plight of ourprisoners of war. Gritz has been accused of being a media hound.He insists he has never sought the spotlight, but when confrontedhas always been a positive voice for our prisoners of war andwill continue to be until they are home to speak for themselves. Working as an agent for the Intelligence Support Activity(ISA) in the CIA, it was fine for Gritz to travel at great perilusing false documents, as Ollie North and Bud McFarland did whenthey traveled to Iran on phony Irish passports. On one occasionhe was stopped by US customs at Seattle-Tacoma airport with fourseparate passports. He was quickly released when his intelligencecontact in Washington confirmed his mission. It was quiteacceptable with the US government for Bo Gritz to travel at suchgreat peril until he returned from Burma's infamous GoldenTriangle on December of 1986 with information concerning withinvolvement of high-level US officials involved in large-scaledrug trafficking in Southeast Asia. His tremendous courage inrefusing to back down to their threats has lead to his currentindictment for misuse of a passport in order to keep him fromgetting this information to the American public. (back to Bo at the luncheon) There a book out now called Secret Warriors, I think. Itsabout an organization called the ISA. Congress never knew aboutand everybody gives me credit for exposing it, but that's nottrue. When I was called before congress in 1983, they said,"Bo, are you working as an official agent for the USgovernment?" And I said, "Yes". And they said,"For what organization?" And I said, "I will notidentify that organization, other than to call it theactivity." This is because even the initials I-S-A were topsecret. Because it wasn't an oversight. It was created by Carter.Can you imagine that? He did one good thing that I know of.(laughter) But it was parallel government. He created a secretorganization to do things that the CIA could not do and he didn'tdare let congress know about it. Now ISA got Dosier back, the general that was captured byterrorists in Italy. And ISA did a lot of other things. You canread about them now because its in this book by some guy whowrites for the Wall Street Journal. The point is that Jerry Kingwas the head of ISA. Jerry King called me on the telephone andsaid, "Bo, we have been ordered to put operation GrandEagle...", which was the governments name for the prisonerof war rescue mission. It certainly wasn't grand and it surewasn't an eagle 'cause it never got off the ground. But he said,"We've been ordered to put operation Grand Eagle on theshelf as if it never existed." Hand before God he said,"there are still too many bureaucrats that don't want to seeAmerican prisoners of war come back alive." Now I didn'tknow what Jerry King meant then. I thought he was angry becausethere was a bureaucratic tug-of-war going on between ISA, the CIAand defense intelligence and maybe he was losing. But rememberJerry King's words, 'cause they'll tie in here. I'm wondering whythat the Vietnamese intercept Colonel Richard Walsh (a POW..Ed)moments before the turnover and capture not only him, but theGeneral also (unclear who the General is here ... Ed.) And I knewthat we still had him, because in the newspapers it appearedthat, "The Vietnamese and Lao delegations of the UnitedNations confirm that they are holding an American citizen incustody." And I said, "By golly, we in our statedepartment are going to press for an identity." Becausedoesn't it say that the president is required to safegaurdAmerican citizens in hostile hands. And I knew when when wepressed what would happen? Richard Walsh would be identified. Whois he? A prisoner of war. Hooray! Now the log jam is broken. Andwho can Walsh testify to? The other men he was with. And they cantestify. Were going to get them all out now, even though itsgoing to cost us something. Did you ever see Richard Walsh's nameidentified? I didn't. Mrs. Walsh showed me a newspaper article that said where anAir Force casualty officer came to her at this time and said:"Your husband is alive. He's a prisoner of war. We have highhopes he'll be coming home soon." They put it in thenewspaper there in Minneapolis. She was told that Air Force Twowas spooling up...who's that belong to?..George Bush...to go gether husband. That's what she told me, but it never happened and Ithought again, "What rotten luck and what a bunch of wimpsin the state department for not going and demanding that theyidentify that citizen." They probably did. They found outwho he was and they said, "lets forget it." Becausewhen I walked into the state department shortly thereafter, afriend of mine said, "Bo, we thought that you'd beencaptured. Your passport turned up in a very unlikely place."And I said, "Yeah, I know all about it." (not sure whathe's referring to here ... Ed.) Do you think that all of this has just been rotten luck. Well,when you wear the uniform of the United States you have thisfaith ... hope that the system will do it. Just like GeneralAaron said, "Let the system do the rest." Now comestruth... We were training Afghan freedom fighters in the deserts ofSouth Nevada near where I live and I was proud to do so. Incooperation with the US State Department Office For SecurityAssistance. We finished that mission. A man by the name of TomHarvey who is National Security Council Ollie North look-alike.Ollie comes from Annapolis, Harvey comes from West Point. TomHarvey called me and said, "We have information ...",and here is a copy of the letter that's why I brought all thesedocuments. I hope some of you challenge them. I hope the WhiteHouse, the Pentagon would challenge them. Because if they wouldpublicly they would have to admit to the truth. This letter wassent to Vice-President Bush by an American citizen by the name ofAurthur Soucheck, it is dated 29 August 1986. It says thatGeneral Khun Sa has American prisoners of war. It says that KhunSa tried to rescue four of them. It says his forces escorted thefour to the Mekong river. While attempting to cross the rain-swollen river, the four USpersonnel, three of Khun Sa's soldiers and two horses were sweptaway by the raging water and all drowned. It goes on to say thatKhun Sa has repeated intelligence reports of location of USprisoners being kept in Laos ... that he says that has seventyprisoners of war. Tom Harvey said, "This is getting TOPpriority." Now in G. Gordon Liddy's book, "Will", he says,"no American has ever come out of the Golden Trianglealive." But that's what we were being asked to do. TomHarvey said, "Bo, do you think you would be able toinfiltrate into Khun Sa's inner sanctum and determine if thisreport is true or not?" Do you think maybe somebody istrying to get me bumped off? (laughter) It didn't make anydifference. Brothers and sisters, you and I are small compared tothis nation and the risk that we take if there is one Americanthere is worth it. God's will they'll be home while they're stillalive. I told Harvey, "We didn't fight a war in Burma, whyshould there be prisoners of war there?" But you know a guylike Khun Sa has got connections all over. And I said,"We'll try." I speak Chinese. Khun Sa speaks Chinese. He's right along thesouthern China border. Surrounded by communists, he's fightingthe communists. He has a forty-thousand man army. Abouteight-million Shan people that make up the minority Shan state.Burma is communist. Every one of his weapons are M16s and M60 machine guns. Allthe latest stuff that we have. I found out why later. Too make along story short, we got in to see Khun Sa and he didn't have anyprisoners of war. And let me caveat it by saying this. Wetraveled three days going and three days coming by horse overmountains that were literally vertical up and down. I made thecomment at that time to Scott Weekly (sp?) who was Ollie North'sclassmate at Annapolis and went with me. I said, "I would hate to be an engineer that had to builda highway through these mountains because they're virgin teakforests ... rain forests .. tremendously beautiful." Six days coming and going. Khun Sa didn't have any prisonersof war. We gave Khun Sa the letter from the White House that Ihad. Thats the only thing that let me get in there. You don'twalk in because the CIA has a seven digit figure on Khun Sa'shead and they haven't been able to collect. You think they'regonna let somebody like me in there. Say, "Hi! I wanna go visit Khun Sa!" Doesn't work!But I guess they thought this guy is crazy enough because I gavethis letter ... I told Harvey, "We got to have a credential,guy." He said, "We can't do that, Bo. We never dothat." I said, "Harvey, has anyone ever gone to theGolden Triangle and come out alive? I need something that willconvince Khun Sa were not there to kill him, we're there forhumanitarian purposes." So Harvey said, "Well, thiswill be the language. 'You are operating in cooperation with theWhite House .. etc .. etc.'" It worked! Khun Sa didn't haveone single prisoner of war, didn't know anything about prisonersof war. (switch to a scene with Bo and Khun Sa talking at KhunSa's camp with Khun Sa's troops doing practice drills in thebackground. Bo is discussing the letter from Soucheck with KhunSa. It is nearly impossible to decipher what is specificallybeing discussed because Khun Sa's troops are incredibly loud anddrown out the conversation, so I will proceed to the next scene.Don't worry...there are more Khun Sa meetings to come. The longand short of it is Khun Sa says he will decrease or stop the drugshipments and Gritz gets it on videotape. Now back to Bo at theluncheon.) Now with Nancy Reagan saying no to drugs and Judge Ginsbergnot allowed to sit on the supreme court because he smokedmarijuana .. and you're an accessory to murder if you ever smokemarijuana, according to Nancy Reagan. I figured we'd get an'attaboy'. We didn't have prisoners, but we had three video tapesshowing Khun Sa himself. And I thought, "Boy, is George Bushgonna be thrilled about this!" (much laughter) We delivered those tapes to Tom Harvey just before Christmas.You try to call Tom Harvey now, because some news people did, andhe doesn't return your calls. We delivered those tapes justbefore Christmas, Tom Harvey called me back and said, "Bo,Fantastic! You guys actually got in to see Khun Sa. The CIA saidhe had been assasinated." Somebody needed some pocketchange. "And there he is talking." And I said,"That's right, Tom. Harvey, what about the 900 tons?" Ifigured they were just bubbling over. They were all right, theywere dripping in their knickers. But it wasn't from joy. Harveysaid, "Bo..", these are quotes ... hand on the square.. he said, "Bo, there's no interest here in that." Yoube on the other end of the phone. You've just come out of Burma.You've brought what you consider to be a way to stop 900 tons ofheroin, not marijuana and get rid of the cancer that has infectedthe bureaucracy and there's "no interest." I challenged Harvey because I'm pretty hard-headed. I said, "Tom,didn't President Reagan appoint George Bush the number one cop tostop drugs before they come into the United States?" Iwanted to remind him of these little things. And he said,"Bo, what can I tell you? There is NO INTEREST here in doingthat." Now that is White-House-ese for saying, "Get offthis subject, leave us alone." I knew that we had trod uponsome very sensitive toes. I still didn't have a clue to what wasgoing on, but I knew that we were getting close to finding outand I took off and went to Burma again. Now I want to show you some things when I got back to Burma.(he shows some newspaper headlines) The United States governmentwanted Khun Sa killed quick and here's how they did it: US CALLS FOR NO MERCY IN DRUG WAR These are over-there newspapers... AIRSTRIKES AGAINST KHUN SA's HEADQUARTERS BURMESE AND THAI TROOPS MOVE ON KHUN SA Finally it says, and there is a picture of Burmese and Thaitroops standing on top of a high mountain top: KHUN SA'S STRONGHOLD SEIZED Now many of you are soldiers, airmen, marines, sailors. Youknow that airstrikes, troops mean war. There's hair, eyes andteeth everywhere. When I went back into Burma in May I took two other Americanswith me. It was the most peaceful area. It was exactly like we left itexcept for one big change. Remember I told you it took us threedays to ride by horse to get there in November and come out inDecember. Well, when we went in May, we went by pickup truck.Straight from the Thai border all the way right to the General'sfront door. And on the other way coming back there were Thaimilitary 10 ton trucks covered and loaded. There's only one thing that comes out of the Golden Triangleand that's heroin. When we got there General Khun Sa said, "What took you solong?" I said, "General, I was waiting for the war todie down. I didn't want to get caught in all of this 26,000troops and airstrikes", and he just laughed. He said,"That was a newspaper war!" I said, "What do youmean newspaper war?" He said, "The Thai and Burmesecame to me and said that if they don't make it look like theredoing something, they stand to lose tens of millions of dollarsthis year in drug supression funds from American taxpayers."So Kuhn Sa said, "Make it look like anything you want to,but I want a road built here." They used the newspapers andI want to show you something. This one here says, "USPROVIDES ANOTHER 1.8 MILLION TO FIGHT DRUGS" So it worked!And this guy is really smiling. This is a Thai receiving a checkfrom the US Ambassador. Khun Sa got what he wanted. Now he began to assemble hisofficers. It took him a week to get them all together because hebrought them from all over the place. And now I understand why. Ithought I was just going to talk to him, but he said no and putme off for a week. He assembled officers from the entire Shanterritory from all over the Golden Triangle. They came in. He sateverybody down. He brought his secretary out. He had hissecretary read from their log. (Scene switches to Khun Sa's headquarters. All of Khun Sa'officers are here along with Khun Sa. I'd say around twenty inall. Bo and his companions are sitting with them. This is whereit gets VERY interesting. The following conversation was inbroken english from Khun Sa's end so some of the syntax may be abit wierd.) Bo: I cannot ask the General to cut your throat by revealing anycontact that would hurt your economy at this moment. But I praythat he will reveal any connections from the older time or thatwill not hurt you now. That if they are still in power, we mightbe free of them. Khun Sa: Some of the connections I can expose to you. Some were inBurma, some were in Thailand, some were in America. But I don'tremember all of their names and my secretary remembers them so hewill give you the information. Secretary: In 1965 to 1975 there is one CIA in Laos, his name wasShackley. He was involved the narcotics business. And we knowthat Shackley used one civilian to organize trafficking. Hiscivilian name was Santos Trafficante. He was the organizer oftrafficking for Shackley. This was financed by Richard Armitagewho stayed in Vietnam. After the Vietnam war Richard Armitage wasa prominent trafficker in Bangkok. This was between 1975 to 1979 he was a very active traffickerin Bangkok. He was one of the embassy employees. Then after thatin 1979 he quit from embassy and then he established a companyname the Far East Trading company. Then he used the name of hiscompany under the table for drug trafficking. He then used thedrug money to support the Lao anti-communist troops. Bo: So he used it in arms and munitions. Secretary: Yes. This Richard Armitage has a lot of friends in Laos andThailand. There is a lot of CIA personnel in Laos. One of the CIAagents is named Daniel Arnold. This Arnold was a munitionstrafficker. There is another one Jerry Daniels who organizedtrafficking for Richard Armitage. (Now back at the luncheon with Bo) One of the men named by Khun Sa, this is not me naming him.This is Khun Sa, the drug overlord reading from his records,named Richard Armitage as being a chief drug trafficker from 1965through 1979. You know where Richard Armitage went in 1979? Hewent to Dole's staff, then to Reagan's campaign staff and now heis the Assistant Secretary of Defense right underneath Mr.Carlucci. Richard Armitage has been responsible for recovery ofUS prisoners of war way back before we actually got involved withH. Ross Perot. He is still responsible for them. What I'm tryingto do is find you Khun Sa's letter because it will say it best.Here it is. Letter from Khun Sa written to the US Justicedepartment dated 28 Jun 1987. I just want to read you a couplesentences. "During the period 1965 to 1975, CIA chief inLaos Theodore Shackley, was in the Drug Business." NowTheodore Shackley would have been director of intelligence of theCIA if George Bush had not been appointed to that post. TheodoreShackley was then posted as the deputy director for covertoperations. It said, "Santos Trafficante acted as his buyingand transporting agent while Richard Armitage handled thefinancial section with banks in Australia." All of a sudden the words from Jerry King came back, "Toomany bureaucrats don't want to see American prisoners returnedalive." Why? Couldn't figure it out. Gunboat at midnight in the middle ofthe Mekong with Voice of America saying we're there to abort ourattack. Walsh and the General recaptured before turnover. Why? NowI'll tell you why. If this is true it means Richard Armitage anda lot of other people that are named here are the least men inthe world that want to see Americans come home. Because whenAmerican prisoners of war do come home, whether we bring themhome or they drag themselves across that Mekong river somehow,and report to the US Embassy and aren't destroyed there. Whenthey do come home, because they will, there will be one hell ofan investigation as to what took the greatest nation in the worldso long to bring home heroes that have been waiting for more thanfifteen years. When that investigation is conducted it will showas Khun Sa says that these men, these bureaucrats, appointed notelected, appointed, have broken the faith with you and thiscountry and its law. Have used their office as a cover to rundrugs and arms to promote covert operations that the UnitedStates Congress did not approve of. Its the parallel government.Now that may be allright, but I'll tell you something. It's notallright to leave hundreds of Americans to die alone in the handsof the enemy to a bunch of wimps that were never there. When I came back here, I thought I was a lone ranger. I said,"Boy, I've got this information. Somehow we've got to get itto the proper authorities and I'm all alone. Well, not so. Guesswho shows up in Time Magazine? H. Ross Perot ... and he's on page18, May 4th and it says, "Perot's Private Probes." H.Ross Perot was not in Burma with me, but I know now where he gothis info. Four billion dollars opens a lot of doors for you. Itdidn't open a couple of doors, however, as I'll let you in onthis story. H. Ross Perot had gained US agent investigationreports of Richard Armitage. Perot didn't know I was over inBurma. He was doing this on his own. This article said he pinnedRichard Armitage. Armitage is a fat broad. Literally. This is agiant of a man. And demanded that Armitage resign because it saysthat H. Ross Perot accused him of being an a drug smuggler and anarms dealer. That takes pretty big cajones. (laughter) It saysthat Perot then went to his friend, George Bush. It says that hegave evidence of wrong doing by Armitage. I'm quoting. Bush toldPerot to go to the proper authorities. (sounds of shock anddismay by audience) I'm still reading now. So the billionairecalled on William Webster. He's now head of the CIA. It says thatPerot made at least one visit to the White House carrying a pileof documents, yet he has received no support from the Reaganadministration. In fact Frank Carlucci... Who's he? He's the secretary of defense. And who was hebefore? Deputy directory of Central Intelligence. Frank Carluccicalled him in to ask him to stop pursuing Armitage. Talk aboutinsulation! And when four billion dollars can't even get yourfoot in the door even though the man is a good Texan fromHouston. Tell me there's no cover-up here. Now H. Ross was working on his own. He didn't know what KhunSa had told us. Khun Sa doesn't have a television or a telephone.He doesn't know who Richard Armitage is. He doesn't give a damn.All he knows is the people who are on his records that he's dealtwith. This affadavit though by a man by the name of DanielSheehan ... and you'll recognize Sheehan's name if you don't knowhim already by the Silkwood case. He jumped on Kerr-Magee (sp?).Kerr-Magee is pretty powerful. But they won the Silkwood casethere in Oklahoma and have done a few other things. (switch to a talk-show interview with Daniel Sheehan, leadattorney for the Christic Institute) Sheehan: There's little doubt at all that President Reagan was involvedin a conspiracy to violate the Neutrality Act. He's been directlyordered by the United States Congress not to mount this militaryoperation against Nicaragua. They've cut off all funds for him todo so, but he went to Saudi Arabia and various private citizensto raise the money in total violation of the Federal NeutralityAct. They're engaged in violations of the arms-export controlact. They're engaged in violations of the Federal RacketeeringAct. There is a whole federal racketeering syndicate that theylike to refer to as The Enterprise. Richard Secord referred to it as. But what it is in fact, Jim,is the off-the-shelf, stand-alone, self-financing, covertoperations capacity that Oliver North talked about Bill Caseywanting to set up. Fact is, that it has been set up. Its beenoperating for many years now. Out from under the control of anypresident. Out from under the control of the director of centralintelligence. Out from under the supervision of any intelligencecommittee. Its run by Theodore Shakley, the former director ofcovert operations worldwide by the CIA under George Bush whenGeorge Bush was the director of the Central Intelligence Agencyin 1976. And this crowd has set up the off-the-shelf operationand is carrying out not only a partnership with the drug dealersfrom Central America and from Southeast Asia, but also carryingout a major political assasination program which was participatedin by William Buckley who was the Beirut section chief for theCIA who was kidnapped in March of 1984 and who was the subject ofall the real negotiations for the sale of the TOW missiles toIran. It was not a sale to open any openings to the moderates inIran, nor was it in fact a negotiation to negotiate for thegeneral release of hostages. It was initiated solely andexclusively to obtain the release of William Buckley because heknew about the whereabouts of the off-the-shelf operation. It wasa criminal enterprise and they feared that if the American peoplefound out about that there would be a huge constitutional scandaland the President of the United States would be impeached. May I most respectfully ask that this matter not be touchedupon at this stage. If we wish to get into this I'm certainarrangements can be made during executive session. (cut to Jack Brook's summary) .. involving the US government in military activity in directcontradiction of the law, diverting public funds into privatepockets in secret unofficial activities, selling access to thePresident for thousands of dollars, dispensing cash and foreignmoney orders out of a White House safe, accepting gifts andfalsifying papers to cover it up, altering and shredding nationalsecurity documents, lying to Congress. Now I believe that the American people understand thatdemocracy cannot survive that kind of abuse. (back to Bo at luncheon) I don't think it makes a hoot who you vote for for President.The same people are gonna run this country. I stand before youtoday. You gotta know who I am. I'm an indicted felon becausepart of that phone call in Thailand said, "Bo, if you don'terase and forget, if you don't come to the apartment (that was asafehouse in Washington, DC), you're gonna be charged with 15years and your going to serve as a felon and we're going to bringup aggravated charges and hostile witnesses." That's not my kind of language. I said, "Friend, that'san insult to you, me and two hundred years of constitutionalgovernment." He said, "Bo, don't give me that. Bringeverything you've got to the apartment." I said, "Who'sgoing to be there, Joe?" And he said, "You know mebetter than that, Bo. It will just be me and Tom Harvey." Isaid, "OK, I'll bring this stuff dear citizen. I'll show itto you then you tell me to erase and forget." When I got toLA with the tapes he said, "Bo, don't come." He wasthat much of a friend. He said, "Don't come. Hide thosetapes. Everybody's laying for you." He said, "Butplease destroy and forget. That's all the state department wantsyou to do because otherwise you're going to jail as afelon." You know what they charged me with? They did chargeme. Misuse of a passport. Now that is a weeny charge for somebody thats been inclandestine warfare for more than 30 years. That throws me inleague with Jane Fonda. She was cavorting with the enemy andmisusing her passport. Ollie North and Robert McValium went to Iran on Irishpassports so they could do an illegal arms deal, but nobody hascharged them. Thats because they're cooperating. Well, I'm not worried about that. The US attorney doesn't knowhow hard to take it because I said, "I don't deny I misuseda passport. I misused it many times. Every time in pursuit of USprisoners of war." You dear citizen, see if you would erase and go back to sleepand forget. I don't think that you will. In my defense I got alawyer, he's the former US attorney for Nevada. He took my casefor free other than all the expenses it cost to bring inwitnesses. Were going to use this court as a forum for prisonersof war and for government in drug dealing because you know youcan't sue the government, but when the government jumps on younow you can turn it around on them. Thats exactly what weredoing. I got a plea the other day saying, "Bo, just go aheadand cop a plea it'll be a misdemeanor." No way Jose, weregoing all the way with this one. (Narrator) The American Warrior has traveled a long road from the junglesof Vietnam to the Pentagon to a hostile federal courtroom in LasVegas, but the commitment to God, country, honor and decency havenever wavered. It would be far easier to walk away from thisbattle, but to do so would be impossible for this soldier. Interestingly enough, the US attorney prosecuting this caseagainst a respected dissenting war hero is himself the formerroad manager for a well-known 1960's antiwar rock group. Theirony is not lost on Las Vegans, but the issues behind the trialdemand nationwide attention. One can only wonder what the chargeswill be against Oliver North. The Christic Institue, on the other hand, is facing an uphillbattle in their current appeal of Judge King's dismissal of theirracketeering lawsuit against The Enterprise last June in Miami.As Father Bill Davis, their chief investigator explains: (cut to Fr. Bill Davis from The Christic Institute) This is by far the most important case we've ever done. Ithink for the kinds of forces that we're up against, as well asfor the broader public policy implications. If this crowd can getaway with what they have been getting away with: the armsdealing, the drug dealing, the assasination programs and sell itunder the guise of some kind of blind anti-communism, having hadthe revelations that we've had: the Hasenfus flight, the Iranarms deal. If they still get away with it then I think democracy,at least in this country, is in very very serious condition. Idon't think it will survive. We're either going to win againstthese forces, this time or I am not optimistic about the survivalof democracy in this country. I think it's that serious. (Narrator) The seriousness of Gritz's discoveries during his firstmission to the Golden Triangle, however was brought homeimmediately after his return. Scott Weekly, his Operation Lazarusteam member and veteran of several POW recovery missions, wasarrested and charged with a federal violation resulting from theAfghan training program he helped Gritz conduct. Weekly was aclassmate of Oliver North's at Annapolis and has a PhD inphysics. After numerous forays into hostile enemy territoryneither he nor Gritz were prepared for the treachery that awaitedthem at home. (Bo filmed in Thailand or thereabouts) The ambassador level person for the US government in charge ofnarcotics control made a statement immediately following therelease of this tape to the White House that the United Stateswould never a agree to talk with General Khun Sa about drugcontrol because he was such a black-hearted criminal. I believethat we can show through facts that have already been establishedby the US Justice Department and on-going investigations thatthere are people currently who saw that tape in the US governmentthat all that they could to stop this interview right here forfear they would be exposed. Even to the point where they arrestedScott Weekly for a minor technicality of transporting explosivesillegally on a commercial airliner. Very briefly we were training a couple of Afghan freedomfighters through the knowledge and request of the US statedepartment and other official agencies. The explosives wereprocurred for us from Fort Sill, Oklahoma and were naturallytransported, because we were using them at a remote desert base,by aircraft. There was no danger to the civilian aircraft. Theexplosives were C4, plastic, frontline safe. You could shoot themwith a machine gun and they wouldn't go off. There were no detonating devices with us. Federal agents toldScott when he was taken into custody that it wasn't atechnicality and that the real target was me. They were underpressure by the US attorney's office to find out whether or not Iwas in kahoots with North and Poindexter since I had traveled toLatin America and to the Middle East in pursuit of variousgovernment associated projects. The fact is and the truth is thatI've had nothing to do with North and Poindexter or any illegalactivities either in South America or the Middle East. Now thetruth is that I believe that elements in the US government areafraid that they will be exposed for their illegal activities anddrug trafficking. Through that exposure that this will cease andthey will lose their power. If they had tried to put pressure by causing Scott Weekly evento be adjudged guilty ... because he was told if he would pleadguilty that there would be no problem... that he would be givenprobation... that there would be no more pursuit... that it wouldbe unsupervised probation which would allow him to continue totravel overseas. In truth, he was sentenced. The fact is thatScott was told that if he would plead guilty that there would beno further investigation and that all would go well for him andthat if he did not plead guilty there would be a tether put onall of us so that we would not be able to travel and at that timewe were very very close to negotiating the release of Americanprisoners of war. The only reason that Scott plead guilty was sothat other members of the Operation Lazarus team, myselfincluded, would be free to continue the mission of liberating USprisoners of war, which is ongoing now. (Narrator Discussing Weekly's case) Scott Weekly was made to serve fourteen months of a five yearsentence before it was demonstrated that the agents had removedsensitive documents from his pre-sentencing file which would haveexonerated him. The sentence was simply dismissed. Lance Trimmer, a former Green Beret communications specialistwith the Lazarus team, accompanied Gritz to Burma in Weekly'splace in May, 1987 where he witnessed Khun Sa naming the USofficials involved in drug trafficking. As a professional privateinvestigator, since returning he has spearheaded the effort todocument and publicize the team's findings and was instrumentalin obtaining Scott Weekly's release from LongPoke Federal Prison.In the process he has been unjustifiably arrested and detainedthree times by the police and federal authorities. (Narrator introducing Barry Flinn) Barry Flinn is the Bangkok station chief for OperationLazarus. In May of 1987 he served as the cameraman with ColonelGritz on his second trip to visit Khun Sa. Also during this timehe has made other trips into ShanLand. On one occasion heaccompanied a journalist from Australia who filmed theproceedings and made this the subject of a news program inAustralia. Barry himself was arrested immediatly upon his returnto Bangkok from ShanLand on the first trip and has been severaltimes since then as has been Khun Sa. (Khun Sa in interview with Australian journalist .. either hehimself or a translator is speaking... it sounds like Khun Sahimself) .. even if they kill me the opium will still be there. Theyonly use me as a money tree. Every time they want money, theycome and shake the tree just like a Christmas tree. Journalist: ..spraying the opium crop with the poison 24-D (orsomesuch...Ed.) (Narrator Again) One of the problems that Khun Sa pointed out in the newsprogram in Australia is the extensive use of toxic herbicidespraying over his territory not to kill the opium plants, but tokill the food crops which is very very destructive of the cultureand the people and creating a very serious refugee problem. (Khun Sa again...) We have 300 families in the hills now who have no food. Theworld body is doing something against humanity in the Shan stateand nobody knows about it. (Bo talks about Khun Sa's offer) General Khun Sa has extended an offer in writing to turn overto the United States Government on March 15, 1988 one ton ofrefined Asian heroin, that sells for $250,000 per pound todistributors, as a show of good faith that he would stop 1200tons of heroin from entering the free world in 1988. The responseof the State Department was, "no interest." (Bo talking in Southeast Asian Field) There are personalities within the United States Governmentwho have, as early as the early 1960's, trafficked in opium andheroin to finance assasination programs initially approved by theCentral Intelligence Agency, which didn't work then and aren'tworking now. If these assasinations programs spread from Vietnam,Cambodia, Laos and Thailand to Iran, to Nicaragua, to Libya andhave the potential of continuing to spread unless some exposureis finally done to eliminate these high officials. H. Ross Perot has said as a result of his investigation he hasfound a, "snake pit without a bottom." He says that thepeople involved will do anything to keep their wrongdoingscovered up. He even says that a man that was responsible for thePhoenix assasination program is now on the personal staff ofGeorge Bush. (Cut to Barry Flinn in Bangkok discussing his trip with Bo.) My name is Barry Flinn and I live in Bangkok, Thailand. I havebeen in Bangkok now for two years. I am a member of OperationLazarus and I am the station chief here in Bangkok. My functionfor Operation Lazarus is to collect information from my agents inLaos and in Vietnam on locating live Americans held captive inthese two countries. This last trip Colonel Gritz had asked me togo into ShanLand, a territory of Burma, to be a witness and acameraman to record the conversation with him and General KhunSa. I agreed to go and I did witness, I did record the meetingwith Lt. Colonel James 'Bo' Gritz and General Khun Sa. Anothermember of Operation Lazarus by the name of Lance Trimmer alsoaccompanied us. In Shanland I did record the meeting and thefacts are as follows: General Khun Sa's people, the secretariesread from a document written in the Shan language about Americanofficials dealing in heroin from 1965 to the present. Some of thenames he had given us were a man by the name of Shackley, a manby the name of Armitage and other American officials involved indrugs. Now my job is strictly locating POWS. I am not involvedwith the DEA or any other US Government agency. I am a privatecitizen. It makes you angry when you hear of the drug problems inAmerica. Children taking heroin at twelve and high officialssupplying them the heroin and all the cover-ups they did in thepast, the present and probably in the future. Now as a witness I definitely believe these men were involvedin the drug trade. General Khun Sa did say that, after giving usthe names, he wouldn't be surprised if B52 bombers started flyingover Shanland to destroy him and to kill him so that he wouldn'ttestify to the other Americans involved in the drug trade. I am staying in Bangkok, Thailand to locate POWs and if peopleare interested in more information about the interview with KhunSa and Lt. Colonel James 'Bo' Gritz they know were to find me.The American embassy knows were to locate me. Lt. Colonel James'Bo' Gritz knows were to locate me and I'm sure the peopleinvolved in the drug trade know where to locate me. Alright. One more thing. I did here about the AmericansShackley, Armitage and other Americans being named it sent achill up my spine and down my back. It made me angry. It made meshocked. I couldn't believe it, but it was there: names, files ofold papers that the Lao agents and the Shan people have on ourAmericans. Somebody has to do something. It will probably all becovered up. I don't know. It's not my business. I was only awitness and it will stay with me for the rest of my life aboutthe people in our government dealing drugs. It's nice to know,isn't it? It's really nice to know... (Bo gives summary) In summary, the reason that American prisoners of war are notat home as we speak, if what Khun Sa, the Christic Institute, andH. Ross Perot are saying is true, is because Richard Armitage,the one man responsible for their recovery is a heroin smugglerand an arms dealer. He has misused his office in order to promotecovert operations through the sale of heroin and trading in armsthat bypasses the US Congress. When prisoners come home he willbe investigated. His wrongdoings and misuse of office will beuncovered and exposed and he and the others will fall like ahouse of cards. As an American citizen it is our responsibilityto wake up to the internal threat, the treachery that threatensliterally the life of this nation. (Bo back at luncheon asks people to swear to do something) It's time that we just became Americans. Here is what I wouldask you to do, because you can't just go back to sleep on thisthing like we did on 007, the Korean airline. One is, I would askthat in your mind, if not physically here today be willing toraise you hand to the square (?) and swear again before God andwitnesses your allegiance to this heavenly banner (points toflag) and to the constitution of the United States because itwill die hermetically sealed in the National Archives if we don'tbreath some life back into it. It is hanging by a thread. The righteous people of this country, doesn't mean Democrat,Republican, right, left, conservative, liberal, the righteouspeople of this country need now to stand up and put a shoulder toit to keep it stable. I want you to commit to yourself thatyou're going to do something about it. Demand that aninvestigation be made. (Bo narrating here...) Demand a thorough and true investigation of Richard Armitage.Insist that The Christic Institute's charges go to trial and beheard by a jury of Americans. That those in our government thatrepresent sewage, that clog the bureaucracy today might becleaned out. That the American way might continue. That ourchildren might grow up in liberty and freedom with sameopportunities that we have had. (Gritz apparently is willing to run for Congress on theRepublican ticket. Back to the luncheon) In the legislature you need to seek out, identify and draftpeople that have the guts to stand up, because if you get thelegislature up there it can be through the people. It can bepulled back from the brink. I think thats our saving grace. Ithink that through the legislature we can do what no one elsewould have done to Nixon. We can wash him away, we can wash away,hopefully, it's going to be a hard fight, this cancer. I standbefore you and give you an order. You have got to do somethingabout this thing. We fought the enemy foreign. Can't we fight theenemy domestic?

Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Heroin and the opiates How bad is Heroin Withdrawal? An excerpt from: Heroin, Myths and Reality by: Jara A. Krivanek pub. 1988, Allen & Unwin and a general discussion, with references of the dangers ofheroin.  "The development of physical dependence depends as muchon regularity of use as on the amount actually used. In practice,the vast majority of addicts of not use heroin consistently on anongoing basis. Less than half of the addicts who have been on thestreets for more than a year will have used daily for that period(Johnson, 1978). They may voluntarily withdraw to reduce theirtolerance, or the scene may be temporarily too much of a hassle,or they may have an important engagement such as a trial, atwhich an appearance of addiction would be undesirable. Or theymay simply need a rest. During such times, physical dependencemay virtually disappear, yet they will still think of themselvesand describe themselves as addicts. In other cases, the users maynever use enough drug to develop significant physical dependence.Senay (1986) estimates that between 25 per cent and 40 per centof street addicts are not physically dependent. Nevertheless,such 'chippers' may wish to see themselves as addicts for reasonsof their own, and will so describe themselves. The withdrawal syndrome we have been discussing is what istermed 'primary' or 'early' abstinence. A substantial portion ofthe physical symptoms of this stage seem to depend on theactivity of a part of the brainstem called the locus coeruleus.Opiates depress this area and it would therefore be expected tobecome hyperactive during withdrawal. The locus coeruleus is animportant center in the brain's fear-alarm system, and suchhyperactivity would be consistent with the marked anxiety andagitation withdrawing addicts report. Fortunately for withdrawingaddicts, other drugs beside the opiates can depress this regionand one of them is clonidine. Clonidine is generally used as an anti-hypertensive agent, butin 1978 Gold and his colleagues reported that it could suppressor reverse the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Subsequent work hasshown that this reversal is by no means complete, but there seemsno doubt that clonidine can make opiate withdrawal much morecomfortable. Even if clonidine is not used, medical detoxification isusually accomplished by giving decreasing doses of a long-actingopiate like methadone. After a few weeks of this, the patient isusually opiate-free without having suffered any appreciablephysical discomfort. Since a percentage of the methadone marketedfor medical use finds its way into the streets, many addicts alsodetox themselves this way without formal medical help. Stillothers detox 'cold turkey'--without any pharmacological help atall. They simply tell their friends they have the flu, go to bed,and suffer in relative silence. Medical supervision and assistance is certainly not essentialfor successful withdrawal." --pages 88 and 89 That was immediate withdrawal. The author goes on to say,"the duration of early abstinence depends on the drug's rateof elimination and in the case of heroin most major symptomsshould be gone within seven to ten days." He then describes, "A protracted abstinence syndromefollows withdrawal from both heroin and methadone and... lasts atleast 31 weeks after withdrawal, and perhaps longer. Bloodpressure, pulse rate, body temperature and pupil diameter seem tobe the main physiological variables affected. Behaviorally, thesubject shows an increased propensity to sleep and there arenegative changes in mood and feeling state." Heroin in itself seems to pose no real health problems, evenwhen it is used for long periods of time. G. Dimijian in"Contemporary Drug Abuse" (in _Medical Pharmacology:Principles and Concepts_ ed A. Goth, p. 299) describes an 84-yrold physician who had been a morphine addict for 60 years andseemed to have no mental or physical problems from the addiction.In general, it seems that middle-class heroin/morphine addictsare no less healthy than the general population (see D. Musto andM. Ramos (1981) "Follow-up Study of the New England MorphineMaintenance Clinic of 1920," _New Eng J Med_ 308(30): p.1075-76; J. Ball and J. Urbaitis (1970) "Absence of MajorMedical Complications among Chronic Opiate Addicts" in _TheEpidemiology of Opiate Addiction in the United States (eds J.Ball and C. Chambers), p. 301-6.) There may be some problems associated with long-termcontrolled use of H, but they aren't well documented and they arecertainly not comparable to those associated with either tobaccoor alcohol. So where do the health problems of heroin come from? Primarilyfrom the use of needles, the presence of adulterants in the drug,the poor nutrition and health care associated with the hard coreaddict liife-style; and the violence associated with saidlife-style. Before I discuss these, we should note that all ofthese factors except adulterants are controllable by the user.The many "chippers" (that being the term fornon-addicts who use addictive drugs in a controlled fashion; see,for example N. Zinberg and R. Jacobson's (1976) "The NaturalHistory of 'Chipping,'" _Amer J Psych_ 133(1): p. 37-40.)who avoid injections (usually by "chasing the dragon"ie smoking it) have few problems. Let's start with needles. There are two reasons to useneedles: it gives a bigger rush, and it makes more effective useof the drug. This second reason is, of course, only aconsideration because the drug is expensive and difficult to get.The problems with needles are that you inject a lot of crap intoyour body (adulterants and dilutants), you run the risk ofinfecting yourself with something (HIV or a Hepatitis virus), andyou wreck your veins and skin. Most IV Heroin users areconstantly plagued by irritated, infected skin. Hey, you injecttalc into your skin, that's what you get. Even the quinine (whichis believed to have originated in heroin during an outbreak ofmalaria among addicts) can cause numerous health problems(there's a large literature on the problems of adulterants anddilutants in heroin and cocaine). The life-style that an addict leads is generally prettyunhealthy as well. Often, addicts don't get an adequate diet.Vitamin deficiencies are not uncommon. Constipation caused by acombination of poor eating that the effects of the drug on thebowels can lead to hemorrhoids. Chest infections seem prettycommon too, especially among cigarette smokers. Then you've got the problems of trafficking in the(potentially) violent underworld. Joe and Leishman (et al (1982),"Addict Death Rates During a Four-Year Post-TreatmentFollow-up," _Amer J of Public Health_ 72: p. 703-9.) foundthat 28% of deaths among addicts were from violence (17% werefrom natural causes, and 44% were drug related). So, it would seem that if one had clean heroin from a reliablesource and avoided the IV route, there'd be few health problems.Potential problems would arise from becoming addicted andbecoming unproductive or from accidentally ODing. It seems that"Chippers" avoid addiction by setting strict limits ontheir use ("I'll only do it on weekends" being a commonlimit). In the lab, it takes a couple weeks of 3 shots a daybefore one gets withdrawal symptoms. So, if you avoid hangingaround hardcore addicts, it is not that hard to avoid anaddiction. The existence of non-addict users shouldn't be surprising. Itis only because of silly people like Anslinger and Henry Giordano(head of the FB of Narc, who testified that anyone who used Hmore than six times would become an addict). Admittedly,controlled heroin use is difficult to locate, since the usersstay out of trouble to the best of their abilities. However, ifwe look at who has used heroin daily (a nice substitute for thevague notion of 'addict'), we find substantial numbers of regularusers who have never taken H on a daily basis (see, for example,J. O'Donnell's (1976) "Young Men and Drugs," _NIDA ResMon_ 5, p. 13, where only a third of the users taken from across-section of American males had ever used H daily). In fact,considering the small amount of H in street samples, it is awonder that users can even become true addicts. (As a side note,many of the people who present themselves or are presented by theFeds to clinics are not physicially dependent on cocaine, heroin,etc.) D. Waldorf's _Careers in Dope_ provides examples of Haddicts who have held employment for long periods of time. So,even addicts can hold down jobs. Dr. William Halsted, a greatsurgeon and one of the founders of Johns Hopkins was a morphineaddict. Overdose is a probably largely due to people not knowing thepurity of their H, the presence of adulterants which act inconjunction with the H, and addicts misjudging their tolerance.Using non-IV routes probably reduces the chances of ODing. R.Gardner (1970) in "Deaths in UK Opioid Users 1965-69"_Lancet_ 2: p. 650-3 found that 26 of the 42 accidental ODsrecorded happened after a period of abstinence, so maybe 60% ofODs are from misjudging tolerance. Since abstinence is often forced, I can only imagine that mostOds could be avoided entirely by proper measures. Oddly enough, British addicts, who get clean heroin, haveabout as high a mortality rate as Americans who shoot street shit(see T. Bewley et al (1968) "Morbidity and Mortality fromHeroin Dependence, 1: Survey of Heroin Addicts Known to the HomeOffice," _Brit Med J_ 23 March: p 725-26). Tolerance is a funny thing. Addicts have been known to diefrom their second shot of the day after dividing their dailyamount into three piles. It would therefore seem that theirtolerance had been reduced since the first shot. Someoneconjectured that tolerance was partially a matter ofplace-conditioning and that addicts who shoot in a particulargallery get conditioned so that their body begins to gear up fora shot when they go their and that therefore they have highertolerance there. When they shoot up someplace else, their bodyisn't ready and they OD. Before I quit typing, I'll say something about the myth of"pushers." John Kaplan (1983), in his excellent book_The Hardest Drug_, points out the numerous holes in this myth.The idea of the "pusher" is that a dealer tries to getpeople hooked through free samples so that he can have a helplessand reliable market for high-priced drugs. This model workspretty well for cigarette companies. However, it is totally offthe mark with respect to H sellers. To begin with, as Big BillBurroughs has documented, the model is empirically wrong sincethere is no clear distinction between users and sellers. Mostusers sell to their friends, making a little profit. In thesocial network of users, some will sell on a large scale, buttypically not for a long period of time, as it is a hassle. Theonly real organization in drug dealing is at the higher levelswhere the drugs are purified, smuggled, and cut. Furthermore,ignoring empirical facts, the image of the pusher is prettyunsound. It only makes sense to spend time hooking people if youplan on selling to them for a long time and they will not be ableto go elsewhere. Neither condition tends to be true. Addicts are notoriously unreliable customers. Furthermore, asI have already mentioned, it is difficult to get hooked on H.Addiction is rare within the first 6 months of H use. (SeeKaplan, p. 27). So, you'd have to be giving out samples for awhile before you had an addict customer. Finally, associatingwith non-addicts is the surest way to get busted. Dealers stickto themselves; they don't hang out on play grounds.   Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Heroin and the opiates WT01-B37-114IA087-000628-B027-86http://206.61.184.43:80/schaffer/heroin/heroalc.htm 206.61.184.43 19970122061419 text/html 6305HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wednesday, 22-Jan-97 06:14:11 GMTServer: WebSitePro/1.1f (S/N wpo-0deb)Allow-ranges: bytesContent-type: text/htmlLast-modified: Saturday, 28-Dec-96 05:43:00 GMTContent-length: 6088 Ethanol (Alcohol) Abuse in the Etiology of Heroin-RelatedDeaths  Contents | Feedback | Search DRCNet Library | Schaffer Library | Heroin and the opiates THE ROLE OF ETHANOL ABUSE IN THE ETIOLOGY OF HEROIN-RELATEDDEATHS Ruttenber, A.

"The concomitant use of heroin and ethanol is wellrecognized and considered dangerous..." "The phenomenon of combining ethanol and opiate use andthe resultant toxic effects were noted as early as 1881 [Hubbard,F. H., The Opium Habit and Alcoholism, Barnes, New York, 1881, pp3-14]." Possibilities examined: 1. Ethanol and heroin act additively or synergistically on thecentral nervous and respiratory systems, producingcardiopulmonary arrest that is more often fatal than thatproduced by heroin alone. 2. Ethanol interferes with the metabolism of heroin,prolonging toxic effects. 3. Ethanol consumption is commonly associated with infrequent(nonaddictive) use of heroin, [Greene, M. H., Luke, J. L., andDupont, R. L., "Opiate 'Overdose' Deaths in the District ofColumbia," Medical Annals of the District of Columbia, Vol43, #4, April 1974, pp 175- 181] which results in reducedtolerance to acute toxicity of heroin. Decedents with toxicological evidence of drugs other thanheroin/ethanol were excluded from the study. p. 895 "We determined that HE [High Ethanol] decedents hadsignificantly lower blood morphine concentrations than LE [LowEthanol] decedents and identified a significant inversecorrelation between concentrations of ethanol and morphine in theblood. These findings suggest that there is a dose-responserelationship between consumption of ethanol and the acutetoxicity of heroin. However, blood ethanol concentrationsexplained only 11% of the variation in blood morphineconcentrations, indicating that additional factors are probablyinvolved in the etiology of fatal overdose by users of heroin andethanol." "There is no evidence from our study that ethanolinterferes with the metabolism of heroin."

M.,"Temporal clustering of Heroin Overdoses in Washington,DC," Journal of Forensic Sciences, Vol. 34, No. 1, Jan.1989, pp. 156- 163.] indicate that fatal heroin overdose can beinfluenced by the toxic effects of other drugs and by other riskfactors and is not merely the consequence of injecting unusuallyhigh doses of heroin. Our results suggest that simplydiscouraging the practice of drinking and injecting heroin maynot be effective in preventing fatal overdose. Combining chronicethanol abuse with infrequent (nonaddictive) heroin use shouldalso be discouraged. Since fatal overdoses are commonlyassociated with ethanol use, public health measures directedtowards those who use both drugs may help reduce the incidence ofthese deaths."

McKim.    One of the greatest risks of being a heroin addict is deathfrom heroin overdose. Each year about one percent of all heroinaddicts in the United States die from an overdose of heroindespite having developed a fantastic tolerance to the effects ofthe dr ug. In a nontolerant person the estimated lethal dose ofheroin may range from 200 to 500 mg, but addicts have tolerateddoses as high as 1800 mg without even being sick[1]. No doubt,some overdoses are a result of mixing heroin with other drugs,but appear to result from a sudden loss of tolerance. Addictshave been killed one day by a dose that was readily tolerated theday before. An explanation for this sudden loss of tolerance hasbeen suggested by Shepard Siegel of McMaster University, and hisa ssociated, Riley Hinson, Marvin Krank, and Jane McCully.  Siegel reasoned that the tolerance to heroin was partiallyconditioned to the environment where the drug was normallyadministered. If the drug is consumed in a new setting, much ofthe conditioned tolerance will disappear and the addict will bemore likely to overdose. To test this theory Siegel andassociates ran the following experiment[2].  Rats were given daily intravenous injections for 30 days. Theinjections were either a dextrose placebo or heroin and they weregiven in either the animal colony or a different room where therewas a constant white noise.  The drug and the placebo were given on alternate days and thedrug condition always corresponded with a particular environmentso that for some rats, the heroin was always administered in thewhite noise room and the placebo was always given in the colony.For other rats the heroin ways given in the colony and theplacebo was always given in the white noise room. Another groupof rats served as a control: these were injected in differentrooms on alternate dates, but were only injected with thedextrose and had no experience with the heroin at all.  All rats were then injected with a large dose of heroin: 15.0mg/kg. The rats in one group were given the heroin in the sameroom where they had previously been given heroin. (This waslabeled the ST group.) The other rats, the DT group, were giventhe he roin in the room where they had previously been given theplacebo.  Siegel found that 96 percent of the control group died,showing the lethal effect of the heroin in nontolerant animals.Rats in the DT group who receieved heroin were partiallytolerant, and only 64 percent died. Only 32 percent of ST ratsdied, showing t hat the tolerance was even greater when theoverdose test was done in the same environment where the drugpreviously had been administered.  Siegel suggested that one reason addicts suddenly lose theirtolerance could be because they take the drug in a different orunusual environment like the rats in the DT group. Surveys ofheroin addicts admitted to hospitals suffering from heroinoverdose tend to support this conclusion.  Many addicts report that they had taken the near-fatal dosein an unusual circumstance or that their normal pattern wasdifferent on that day[2].  [1] Brecher, E.

It documents alleged CIA involvement in covertdrug running activities and how they supposedly interfered withthe nation's attempts to recover American prisoners of war andthose missing in action. You may find it unbelievable. You maynot be surprised at what it says. I have several comments which Iwill append to end of the document. Suffice it to say thatinformation of this type is its own shocking kind of pornography.As far as I can see Gritz's, arguments are more or less sound.The evidence from three separate sources is even more compelling.As I watched this video I felt thoroughly violated. It is notenjoyable reading, but it may well be true. Be careful when you seek the truth. Upon finding it you may beforced to change your view of the world. Jim Burnes _______________________________________________________________________ (apologies to the original quote) (Transcriber's note: The following is a transcription ofspoken English and as such can be difficult to read, much lesstranscribe. I have tried to preserve exactly as was spoken exceptfor a few places where I have organized the language used toclarify meaning. I am not an English major so don't slam me fornot using perfect English punctuation in the sometimes ratherstrange usages.) Colonel Bo Gritz Addressing the American Liberty Lunch Club: What I want to tell you very quickly is something that I feelis more heinous than the Bataan death march. Certainly it is ofmore concern to you as Americans than the Watergate. What I'mtalking about is something we found out in Burma - May 1987. Wefound it out from a man named Khun Sa. He is the recognizedoverlord of heroin in the world. Last year he sent 900 tons of opiates and heroin into the freeworld. This year it will be 1200 tons. (video showing discussionat Khun Sa's headquarters -- some translation of Burmese toEnglish going on..Bo Gritz still talking to Lunch club in theforeground) On video tape he said to us something that was mostastounding: that US government officials have been and are nowhis biggest customers, and have been for the last twenty years. Iwouldn't believe him. We fought a war in Laos and Cambodia evenas we fought whatever it was in Vietnam. The point is that thereare as many bomb holes in those two other countries as there arein Vietnam. Five hundred and fifty plus Americans were lost inLaos. Not one of them ever came home. We heard a president say,"The war is over, we are out with honor - all of theprisoners are home." and a few other lies. Now we got rid ofthat president, but we didn't get rid of the problem. We ran thewar in Laos and Cambodia through drugs. The money that would notbe appropriated by a liberal congress, was appropriated. And youknow who we used for distribution? Santos Trafficante, old friendof the CIA and mobster out of Cuba and Florida. We lost the war! Fifty-eight-thousand Americans were killed. Seventy-thousandbecame drug casualties. In the sixties and seventies you saw aninfusion of drugs into America like never was before. Where doyou think the Mafia takes the heroin and opiates that it getsthrough its arrangement with the US government? It doesn'tdistribute them in Africa or Europe. This is the big money bag here. We're Daddy Warbucks for them.So I submit to you that the CIA has been pressed for solutions.Each time they have gone to the sewer to find it. And you can'tsmell like a rose when you've been playing in the cesspool. We'vebeen embracing organized crime. Now you've all looked and heardabout Ollie North, about the Contras, about nobody knowinganything. (cut to part of Iran Contra hearings with Ollie Northexplaining the flow of funds from Iran to the Contras) North: And Mr. Gorbanifar suggested several incentives to make thatFebruary transaction work. And the attractive incentive for mewas the one he made that residuals could flow to support theNicaraguan resistance. Legislator: Even Gorbanifar knew that you were supporting the Contras. North: Yes he did. Isvestia knew it. The name had been in the papersin Moscow. It had been all over Danny Ortega's newscasts. RadioHavana was broadcasting it. It had been in every newspaper in theland. Legislator: All our enemies knew it and you wanted to keep it from theUnited States Congress. North: We wanted to be able to deny a covert operation. (back to Bo at the Luncheon Club) We have a constitution that says that the laws will be made bythe Congress, enforced by the executive branch, interpreted bythe judicial branch. But in reality we have an executive branchthat has for more than a twenty years operated in what what OllieNorth called a parallel government. When the Congress says no, itmakes no difference. They're gonna do it anyway. And it isspecial intelligence - top secret. Why? Not because thecommunists don't know what were doing, it's to keep it a secretfrom you. You're not capable of making those kinds of decisionsaccording to those in parallel government. The reason I know ...I was there. I've been a product of parallel government myself. (Narrator) Lieutenant Colonel James 'Bo' Gritz is the most decoratedGreen Beret commander of the Vietnam Era. General WilliamWestmoreland, in writing his memoirs, singled out Bo Gritz as the"American Soldier" for his exemplary courage in combatand outstanding ingenuity in recovering a highly secret black-boxthe Viet-Cong had taken from a crashed U2 spy plane. The featurefilms "Rambo", "Uncommon Valor" and"Missing in Action" were based in part upon hisreal-life military experiences. (Back to Bo) Dick Secord, General, United States Air Force, a man I knowwell, said it best. Before the senate investigating committeeDick Secord was asked - if we were supporting the Contras, whywere we selling them arms bought from a communist block nation atexorbitant profit rates. (skip to scene from hearings) Senator: If the purpose of the enterprise was to help the contras, whydid you charge Colero a mark-up? Secord: We were in business to make a living, Senator. We had to makea living. I didn't see anything wrong with it at the time. It wasa commercial enterprise. Senator: Oh..I thought the purpose of the enterprise was to aidColero's cause. Secord: Can't I have two purposes? I did. Senator: Oh..allright. (back to Bo) And then Dick Secord said in his playboy interview: "Ithink I deserve the eight million that we made from the Iran armssale for all the hard work I did." If you've got to pay apatriot, you've got the wrong guy. (applause from audience) These are patriots for profit. There has been a guise ofpatriotism that a lot of people have been hiding behind. War istheir business. Business has been good. (fade to shots of the Vietnam 'conflict' - Narrator takes overagain) Bo Gritz risked his life a thousand times in combat in Vietnambefore he was sent by a national security council staffer TomHarvey in the White House to Burma in November of 1986 in searchof American prisoners of war. He discovered instead a heroinhighway and a nation betrayed by high level American officialsinvolved in narcotics trafficking. Tom Harvey and his superiorsin the White House were not pleased with Bo's report. (fade to scene of Bo - now with beard in a field obviouslysomewhere in Southeast Asia - palm trees and oxen indigenous tothe area abound - I assume its in either Burma or Thailand) The thing that I was most concerned about was - and I thoughtwas fantastic - was the general's offer to stop the flow of opiumand heroin into the free world. When I asked him (assume he'stalking about a conversation with Tom Harvey now) he said"that's fantastic". There was a pause, then he said,"Bo, there's no one here that supports that." And Isaid, "What?! Vice-President Bush has been appointed bypresident Reagan as the Number One policeman to control drugentry into the United States. How can you say there's no interestand no support when we bring back a video tape with a directinterview with a man who puts 900 tons of opium and heroin acrossinto the free world every year and is willing to stop it?"And he said, "Bo, what can I tell you? All I can tell you is there is no interest in doing thathere." Well that made me wonder. That's because it doesn't soundAmerican and it doesn't sound right. Thats when we began to doour own investigation because for about three years people hadtold me, both in Washington DC and, interestingly enough, inOklahoma city that the whole POW situation was being underminedby US government officials involved in drug trafficking. Iwouldn't believe it. I said, "You guys aren't playing with afull deck... you've got yourselves strung out too thin." Andthey said, "Bo, you better listen, because for three yearswe've had prisoners literally within our grasp and something hashappened at the last minute." (I said), "Each time I'vemade every effort to cooperate with government officials. I can'tbelieve that people in the US government would actually, eitherovertly or covertly, do anything to undermine a rescue operation." Well, we're still without Prisoners of War and there is nointerest, we're told at the White House, in stopping the flow ofdrugs coming in from the Golden Triangle into the free world. (fade to front-page articles about Bo Gritz in Parade magazineand Soldier of Fortune...narrator picks up here) Lieutenant Colonel Bo Gritz is no stranger to controversy. Inthirty years of devoted service to the US Army and to therecovery of American prisoners of war, he has encountered plenty.The making of this American warrior began early. He was fiveyears old when his father, a B-17 pilot, was shot down overEurope during World War II. His mother, a pilot with the women'sAir Force, would later marry a master sergeant and remain withthe occupation forces in Germany after the war. Raised by hismaternal grandparents in Oklahoma, young Bo Gritz began trainingat Fort Union Military Academy in Virginia. He was named CorpsCommander in his senior year when he chanced upon a recruitingposter that changed his life. In short order, Gritz won his greenberet in the Army Special forces by passing all courses in theunconventional warfare training. After graduating from officer'scandidate school, the newly-commissioned second lieutenant theninsisted on Ranger training. Assigned to the command of the firstmobile South Vietnamese gorilla forces to be organized, Gritzalso operated secretly in Cambodia and Laos with his force ofCambodian mercenaries, or "Bos", as he called them. Byofficial body-count, over 450 of the enemy died as a result ofGritz's actions. His wartime records are replete with examples ofBo's concern for keeping Americans alive in a war gone mad. As recon chief of the supersecret delta-force, Bo was citedfor Valor in saving the lives of 30 US Infantrymen from theBigRed-One division. More often than not, his valor was inplacing himself between the enemy and his men. According to anofficial military report dated 31 July 1967 submitted on thenMajor Gritz, "His personal bravery is legendary exemplifiedby the fact that he has been awarded five silver stars andnumerous other decorations for valor." In all Bo Gritz wasawarded 62 citations for valor, five silver stars, eight bronzestars, two purple hearts and a presidential citation. Bo was ready to sign up for a fifth tour of duty when he had atalk with General Fred Weiyan (sp?), the "daddy-rabbit"in Vietnam. As Gritz described it, "I was a major andspecial operations chief. I'll never forget that day. I stoodthere and heard that man say. Bo, your not going to win the warand neither am I." That was the most disillusioning momentof my life. It meant that every man who had ever lost his fingeror his life had lost it for nothing. I decided, on the spot, toleave Vietnam. I would not kill another enemy or risk anothercomrade's life." (back to Bo at the luncheon) I've had the opportunity to do a lot of things that otherofficers have not. I was the first recon chief and intelligenceofficer for delta-force. Commanded the first gorilla forces thatwent behind enemy lines. When I commanded special forces in LatinAmerica, we did it exactly right. And we did exactly what men incamoflage are supposed to do. It was very natural that Harold R.Aaron (sp?) would single me out because, besides having asixth-degree black belt in karate, I have established an abilityto operate on my own. And I think when Aaron said, "Bo, wewant you to do this", he understood that I'm also hardheaded enough that I wouldn't cave in. He said, "I want youto consider retiring. It would only be temporary. We haveoverwhealming evidence now that people are still there, beingheld in communist prisons." Mr. H. Ross Perot had been askedby Eugene Tighe, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, toback a private mission that would look into the POW situation.Perot said, "Bo, I want you to go there. I want you to doeverything you have to do. You come and tell me there aren't anyprisoners of war left alive." (narrator) Bo returned from Indo-China with extensive evidence that therewere indeed American prisoners of war in captivity, including asolid report of 47 at one particular camp. Perot turned theproject back over to General Tighe who wrote to Secretary ofDefense, Harold Brown asking that the source, a Nguyen Dok Jong(sp?) be brought to the United States for a polygraph test. Brownrepeated the request to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. One monthlater, Vance finally responded that the commissioner ofimmigration would not permit Jong into the United States forfurther questioning. As Bo puts it, "Think about it. Oneman, not a thousand and the defense intelligence agency chief andsecretary of state can't get him into the country. That was apretty clear signal that the military was politically handcuffedon the prisoner of war issue." For eight years Gritz sought to find and free American POW's.He crossed five times behind enemy lines into communist Laos andVietnam. Three times he was within moments of embracing thoseAmerican heroes our government had declared dead. Each timesomething unexplained caused Gritz and his Operation Lazarus teamto fall short with freedom and victory in sight for the POWs. There has never been a shortage of criticism from any numberof armchair generals such as Robert K. Brown of "Soldier ofFortune" magazine who devoted an entire issue to condemningGritz's efforts. Even to the extent of publishing documentsstolen from Bo while he was on the mission in Laos. They haveeven belittled his prayer before crossing enemy lines. (Gritz isa devout Mormon...Ed) His critics said he should have looked morelike the Rambo in the movies, who actually avoided the draft inan all-girls school in Switzerland. More debilitating than the hundreds of miles on foot withinenemy territory has been the disinformation propagated by thosewithin our government who have covered up the plight of ourprisoners of war. Gritz has been accused of being a media hound.He insists he has never sought the spotlight, but when confrontedhas always been a positive voice for our prisoners of war andwill continue to be until they are home to speak for themselves. Working as an agent for the Intelligence Support Activity(ISA) in the CIA, it was fine for Gritz to travel at great perilusing false documents, as Ollie North and Bud McFarland did whenthey traveled to Iran on phony Irish passports. On one occasionhe was stopped by US customs at Seattle-Tacoma airport with fourseparate passports. He was quickly released when his intelligencecontact in Washington confirmed his mission. It was quiteacceptable with the US government for Bo Gritz to travel at suchgreat peril until he returned from Burma's infamous GoldenTriangle on December of 1986 with information concerning withinvolvement of high-level US officials involved in large-scaledrug trafficking in Southeast Asia. His tremendous courage inrefusing to back down to their threats has lead to his currentindictment for misuse of a passport in order to keep him fromgetting this information to the American public. (back to Bo at the luncheon) There a book out now called Secret Warriors, I think. Itsabout an organization called the ISA. Congress never knew aboutand everybody gives me credit for exposing it, but that's nottrue. When I was called before congress in 1983, they said,"Bo, are you working as an official agent for the USgovernment?" And I said, "Yes". And they said,"For what organization?" And I said, "I will notidentify that organization, other than to call it theactivity." This is because even the initials I-S-A were topsecret. Because it wasn't an oversight. It was created by Carter.Can you imagine that? He did one good thing that I know of.(laughter) But it was parallel government. He created a secretorganization to do things that the CIA could not do and he didn'tdare let congress know about it. Now ISA got Dosier back, the general that was captured byterrorists in Italy. And ISA did a lot of other things. You canread about them now because its in this book by some guy whowrites for the Wall Street Journal. The point is that Jerry Kingwas the head of ISA. Jerry King called me on the telephone andsaid, "Bo, we have been ordered to put operation GrandEagle...", which was the governments name for the prisonerof war rescue mission. It certainly wasn't grand and it surewasn't an eagle 'cause it never got off the ground. But he said,"We've been ordered to put operation Grand Eagle on theshelf as if it never existed." Hand before God he said,"there are still too many bureaucrats that don't want to seeAmerican prisoners of war come back alive." Now I didn'tknow what Jerry King meant then. I thought he was angry becausethere was a bureaucratic tug-of-war going on between ISA, the CIAand defense intelligence and maybe he was losing. But rememberJerry King's words, 'cause they'll tie in here. I'm wondering whythat the Vietnamese intercept Colonel Richard Walsh (a POW..Ed)moments before the turnover and capture not only him, but theGeneral also (unclear who the General is here ... Ed.) And I knewthat we still had him, because in the newspapers it appearedthat, "The Vietnamese and Lao delegations of the UnitedNations confirm that they are holding an American citizen incustody." And I said, "By golly, we in our statedepartment are going to press for an identity." Becausedoesn't it say that the president is required to safegaurdAmerican citizens in hostile hands. And I knew when when wepressed what would happen? Richard Walsh would be identified. Whois he? A prisoner of war. Hooray! Now the log jam is broken. Andwho can Walsh testify to? The other men he was with. And they cantestify. Were going to get them all out now, even though itsgoing to cost us something. Did you ever see Richard Walsh's nameidentified? I didn't. Mrs. Walsh showed me a newspaper article that said where anAir Force casualty officer came to her at this time and said:"Your husband is alive. He's a prisoner of war. We have highhopes he'll be coming home soon." They put it in thenewspaper there in Minneapolis. She was told that Air Force Twowas spooling up...who's that belong to?..George Bush...to go gether husband. That's what she told me, but it never happened and Ithought again, "What rotten luck and what a bunch of wimpsin the state department for not going and demanding that theyidentify that citizen." They probably did. They found outwho he was and they said, "lets forget it." Becausewhen I walked into the state department shortly thereafter, afriend of mine said, "Bo, we thought that you'd beencaptured. Your passport turned up in a very unlikely place."And I said, "Yeah, I know all about it." (not sure whathe's referring to here ... Ed.) Do you think that all of this has just been rotten luck. Well,when you wear the uniform of the United States you have thisfaith ... hope that the system will do it. Just like GeneralAaron said, "Let the system do the rest." Now comestruth... We were training Afghan freedom fighters in the deserts ofSouth Nevada near where I live and I was proud to do so. Incooperation with the US State Department Office For SecurityAssistance. We finished that mission. A man by the name of TomHarvey who is National Security Council Ollie North look-alike.Ollie comes from Annapolis, Harvey comes from West Point. TomHarvey called me and said, "We have information ...",and here is a copy of the letter that's why I brought all thesedocuments. I hope some of you challenge them. I hope the WhiteHouse, the Pentagon would challenge them. Because if they wouldpublicly they would have to admit to the truth. This letter wassent to Vice-President Bush by an American citizen by the name ofAurthur Soucheck, it is dated 29 August 1986. It says thatGeneral Khun Sa has American prisoners of war. It says that KhunSa tried to rescue four of them. It says his forces escorted thefour to the Mekong river. While attempting to cross the rain-swollen river, the four USpersonnel, three of Khun Sa's soldiers and two horses were sweptaway by the raging water and all drowned. It goes on to say thatKhun Sa has repeated intelligence reports of location of USprisoners being kept in Laos ... that he says that has seventyprisoners of war. Tom Harvey said, "This is getting TOPpriority." Now in G. Gordon Liddy's book, "Will", he says,"no American has ever come out of the Golden Trianglealive." But that's what we were being asked to do. TomHarvey said, "Bo, do you think you would be able toinfiltrate into Khun Sa's inner sanctum and determine if thisreport is true or not?" Do you think maybe somebody istrying to get me bumped off? (laughter) It didn't make anydifference. Brothers and sisters, you and I are small compared tothis nation and the risk that we take if there is one Americanthere is worth it. God's will they'll be home while they're stillalive. I told Harvey, "We didn't fight a war in Burma, whyshould there be prisoners of war there?" But you know a guylike Khun Sa has got connections all over. And I said,"We'll try." I speak Chinese. Khun Sa speaks Chinese. He's right along thesouthern China border. Surrounded by communists, he's fightingthe communists. He has a forty-thousand man army. Abouteight-million Shan people that make up the minority Shan state.Burma is communist. Every one of his weapons are M16s and M60 machine guns. Allthe latest stuff that we have. I found out why later. Too make along story short, we got in to see Khun Sa and he didn't have anyprisoners of war. And let me caveat it by saying this. Wetraveled three days going and three days coming by horse overmountains that were literally vertical up and down. I made thecomment at that time to Scott Weekly (sp?) who was Ollie North'sclassmate at Annapolis and went with me. I said, "I would hate to be an engineer that had to builda highway through these mountains because they're virgin teakforests ... rain forests .. tremendously beautiful." Six days coming and going. Khun Sa didn't have any prisonersof war. We gave Khun Sa the letter from the White House that Ihad. Thats the only thing that let me get in there. You don'twalk in because the CIA has a seven digit figure on Khun Sa'shead and they haven't been able to collect. You think they'regonna let somebody like me in there. Say, "Hi! I wanna go visit Khun Sa!" Doesn't work!But I guess they thought this guy is crazy enough because I gavethis letter ... I told Harvey, "We got to have a credential,guy." He said, "We can't do that, Bo. We never dothat." I said, "Harvey, has anyone ever gone to theGolden Triangle and come out alive? I need something that willconvince Khun Sa were not there to kill him, we're there forhumanitarian purposes." So Harvey said, "Well, thiswill be the language. 'You are operating in cooperation with theWhite House .. etc .. etc.'" It worked! Khun Sa didn't haveone single prisoner of war, didn't know anything about prisonersof war. (switch to a scene with Bo and Khun Sa talking at KhunSa's camp with Khun Sa's troops doing practice drills in thebackground. Bo is discussing the letter from Soucheck with KhunSa. It is nearly impossible to decipher what is specificallybeing discussed because Khun Sa's troops are incredibly loud anddrown out the conversation, so I will proceed to the next scene.Don't worry...there are more Khun Sa meetings to come. The longand short of it is Khun Sa says he will decrease or stop the drugshipments and Gritz gets it on videotape. Now back to Bo at theluncheon.) Now with Nancy Reagan saying no to drugs and Judge Ginsbergnot allowed to sit on the supreme court because he smokedmarijuana .. and you're an accessory to murder if you ever smokemarijuana, according to Nancy Reagan. I figured we'd get an'attaboy'. We didn't have prisoners, but we had three video tapesshowing Khun Sa himself. And I thought, "Boy, is George Bushgonna be thrilled about this!" (much laughter) We delivered those tapes to Tom Harvey just before Christmas.You try to call Tom Harvey now, because some news people did, andhe doesn't return your calls. We delivered those tapes justbefore Christmas, Tom Harvey called me back and said, "Bo,Fantastic! You guys actually got in to see Khun Sa. The CIA saidhe had been assasinated." Somebody needed some pocketchange. "And there he is talking." And I said,"That's right, Tom. Harvey, what about the 900 tons?" Ifigured they were just bubbling over. They were all right, theywere dripping in their knickers. But it wasn't from joy. Harveysaid, "Bo..", these are quotes ... hand on the square.. he said, "Bo, there's no interest here in that." Yoube on the other end of the phone. You've just come out of Burma.You've brought what you consider to be a way to stop 900 tons ofheroin, not marijuana and get rid of the cancer that has infectedthe bureaucracy and there's "no interest." I challenged Harvey because I'm pretty hard-headed. I said, "Tom,didn't President Reagan appoint George Bush the number one cop tostop drugs before they come into the United States?" Iwanted to remind him of these little things. And he said,"Bo, what can I tell you? There is NO INTEREST here in doingthat." Now that is White-House-ese for saying, "Get offthis subject, leave us alone." I knew that we had trod uponsome very sensitive toes. I still didn't have a clue to what wasgoing on, but I knew that we were getting close to finding outand I took off and went to Burma again. Now I want to show you some things when I got back to Burma.(he shows some newspaper headlines) The United States governmentwanted Khun Sa killed quick and here's how they did it: US CALLS FOR NO MERCY IN DRUG WAR These are over-there newspapers... AIRSTRIKES AGAINST KHUN SA's HEADQUARTERS BURMESE AND THAI TROOPS MOVE ON KHUN SA Finally it says, and there is a picture of Burmese and Thaitroops standing on top of a high mountain top: KHUN SA'S STRONGHOLD SEIZED Now many of you are soldiers, airmen, marines, sailors. Youknow that airstrikes, troops mean war. There's hair, eyes andteeth everywhere. When I went back into Burma in May I took two other Americanswith me. It was the most peaceful area. It was exactly like we left itexcept for one big change. Remember I told you it took us threedays to ride by horse to get there in November and come out inDecember. Well, when we went in May, we went by pickup truck.Straight from the Thai border all the way right to the General'sfront door. And on the other way coming back there were Thaimilitary 10 ton trucks covered and loaded. There's only one thing that comes out of the Golden Triangleand that's heroin. When we got there General Khun Sa said, "What took you solong?" I said, "General, I was waiting for the war todie down. I didn't want to get caught in all of this 26,000troops and airstrikes", and he just laughed. He said,"That was a newspaper war!" I said, "What do youmean newspaper war?" He said, "The Thai and Burmesecame to me and said that if they don't make it look like theredoing something, they stand to lose tens of millions of dollarsthis year in drug supression funds from American taxpayers."So Kuhn Sa said, "Make it look like anything you want to,but I want a road built here." They used the newspapers andI want to show you something. This one here says, "USPROVIDES ANOTHER 1.8 MILLION TO FIGHT DRUGS" So it worked!And this guy is really smiling. This is a Thai receiving a checkfrom the US Ambassador. Khun Sa got what he wanted. Now he began to assemble hisofficers. It took him a week to get them all together because hebrought them from all over the place. And now I understand why. Ithought I was just going to talk to him, but he said no and putme off for a week. He assembled officers from the entire Shanterritory from all over the Golden Triangle. They came in. He sateverybody down. He brought his secretary out. He had hissecretary read from their log. (Scene switches to Khun Sa's headquarters. All of Khun Sa'officers are here along with Khun Sa. I'd say around twenty inall. Bo and his companions are sitting with them. This is whereit gets VERY interesting. The following conversation was inbroken english from Khun Sa's end so some of the syntax may be abit wierd.) Bo: I cannot ask the General to cut your throat by revealing anycontact that would hurt your economy at this moment. But I praythat he will reveal any connections from the older time or thatwill not hurt you now. That if they are still in power, we mightbe free of them. Khun Sa: Some of the connections I can expose to you. Some were inBurma, some were in Thailand, some were in America. But I don'tremember all of their names and my secretary remembers them so hewill give you the information. Secretary: In 1965 to 1975 there is one CIA in Laos, his name wasShackley. He was involved the narcotics business. And we knowthat Shackley used one civilian to organize trafficking. Hiscivilian name was Santos Trafficante. He was the organizer oftrafficking for Shackley. This was financed by Richard Armitagewho stayed in Vietnam. After the Vietnam war Richard Armitage wasa prominent trafficker in Bangkok. This was between 1975 to 1979 he was a very active traffickerin Bangkok. He was one of the embassy employees. Then after thatin 1979 he quit from embassy and then he established a companyname the Far East Trading company. Then he used the name of hiscompany under the table for drug trafficking. He then used thedrug money to support the Lao anti-communist troops. Bo: So he used it in arms and munitions. Secretary: Yes. This Richard Armitage has a lot of friends in Laos andThailand. There is a lot of CIA personnel in Laos. One of the CIAagents is named Daniel Arnold. This Arnold was a munitionstrafficker. There is another one Jerry Daniels who organizedtrafficking for Richard Armitage. (Now back at the luncheon with Bo) One of the men named by Khun Sa, this is not me naming him.This is Khun Sa, the drug overlord reading from his records,named Richard Armitage as being a chief drug trafficker from 1965through 1979. You know where Richard Armitage went in 1979? Hewent to Dole's staff, then to Reagan's campaign staff and now heis the Assistant Secretary of Defense right underneath Mr.Carlucci. Richard Armitage has been responsible for recovery ofUS prisoners of war way back before we actually got involved withH. Ross Perot. He is still responsible for them. What I'm tryingto do is find you Khun Sa's letter because it will say it best.Here it is. Letter from Khun Sa written to the US Justicedepartment dated 28 Jun 1987. I just want to read you a couplesentences. "During the period 1965 to 1975, CIA chief inLaos Theodore Shackley, was in the Drug Business." NowTheodore Shackley would have been director of intelligence of theCIA if George Bush had not been appointed to that post. TheodoreShackley was then posted as the deputy director for covertoperations. It said, "Santos Trafficante acted as his buyingand transporting agent while Richard Armitage handled thefinancial section with banks in Australia." All of a sudden the words from Jerry King came back, "Toomany bureaucrats don't want to see American prisoners returnedalive." Why? Couldn't figure it out. Gunboat at midnight in the middle ofthe Mekong with Voice of America saying we're there to abort ourattack. Walsh and the General recaptured before turnover. Why? NowI'll tell you why. If this is true it means Richard Armitage anda lot of other people that are named here are the least men inthe world that want to see Americans come home. Because whenAmerican prisoners of war do come home, whether we bring themhome or they drag themselves across that Mekong river somehow,and report to the US Embassy and aren't destroyed there. Whenthey do come home, because they will, there will be one hell ofan investigation as to what took the greatest nation in the worldso long to bring home heroes that have been waiting for more thanfifteen years. When that investigation is conducted it will showas Khun Sa says that these men, these bureaucrats, appointed notelected, appointed, have broken the faith with you and thiscountry and its law. Have used their office as a cover to rundrugs and arms to promote covert operations that the UnitedStates Congress did not approve of. Its the parallel government.Now that may be allright, but I'll tell you something. It's notallright to leave hundreds of Americans to die alone in the handsof the enemy to a bunch of wimps that were never there. When I came back here, I thought I was a lone ranger. I said,"Boy, I've got this information. Somehow we've got to get itto the proper authorities and I'm all alone. Well, not so. Guesswho shows up in Time Magazine? H. Ross Perot ... and he's on page18, May 4th and it says, "Perot's Private Probes." H.Ross Perot was not in Burma with me, but I know now where he gothis info. Four billion dollars opens a lot of doors for you. Itdidn't open a couple of doors, however, as I'll let you in onthis story. H. Ross Perot had gained US agent investigationreports of Richard Armitage. Perot didn't know I was over inBurma. He was doing this on his own. This article said he pinnedRichard Armitage. Armitage is a fat broad. Literally. This is agiant of a man. And demanded that Armitage resign because it saysthat H. Ross Perot accused him of being an a drug smuggler and anarms dealer. That takes pretty big cajones. (laughter) It saysthat Perot then went to his friend, George Bush. It says that hegave evidence of wrong doing by Armitage. I'm quoting. Bush toldPerot to go to the proper authorities. (sounds of shock anddismay by audience) I'm still reading now. So the billionairecalled on William Webster. He's now head of the CIA. It says thatPerot made at least one visit to the White House carrying a pileof documents, yet he has received no support from the Reaganadministration. In fact Frank Carlucci... Who's he? He's the secretary of defense. And who was hebefore? Deputy directory of Central Intelligence. Frank Carluccicalled him in to ask him to stop pursuing Armitage. Talk aboutinsulation! And when four billion dollars can't even get yourfoot in the door even though the man is a good Texan fromHouston. Tell me there's no cover-up here. Now H. Ross was working on his own. He didn't know what KhunSa had told us. Khun Sa doesn't have a television or a telephone.He doesn't know who Richard Armitage is. He doesn't give a damn.All he knows is the people who are on his records that he's dealtwith. This affadavit though by a man by the name of DanielSheehan ... and you'll recognize Sheehan's name if you don't knowhim already by the Silkwood case. He jumped on Kerr-Magee (sp?).Kerr-Magee is pretty powerful. But they won the Silkwood casethere in Oklahoma and have done a few other things. (switch to a talk-show interview with Daniel Sheehan, leadattorney for the Christic Institute) Sheehan: There's little doubt at all that President Reagan was involvedin a conspiracy to violate the Neutrality Act. He's been directlyordered by the United States Congress not to mount this militaryoperation against Nicaragua. They've cut off all funds for him todo so, but he went to Saudi Arabia and various private citizensto raise the money in total violation of the Federal NeutralityAct. They're engaged in violations of the arms-export controlact. They're engaged in violations of the Federal RacketeeringAct. There is a whole federal racketeering syndicate that theylike to refer to as The Enterprise. Richard Secord referred to it as. But what it is in fact, Jim,is the off-the-shelf, stand-alone, self-financing, covertoperations capacity that Oliver North talked about Bill Caseywanting to set up. Fact is, that it has been set up. Its beenoperating for many years now. Out from under the control of anypresident. Out from under the control of the director of centralintelligence. Out from under the supervision of any intelligencecommittee. Its run by Theodore Shakley, the former director ofcovert operations worldwide by the CIA under George Bush whenGeorge Bush was the director of the Central Intelligence Agencyin 1976. And this crowd has set up the off-the-shelf operationand is carrying out not only a partnership with the drug dealersfrom Central America and from Southeast Asia, but also carryingout a major political assasination program which was participatedin by William Buckley who was the Beirut section chief for theCIA who was kidnapped in March of 1984 and who was the subject ofall the real negotiations for the sale of the TOW missiles toIran. It was not a sale to open any openings to the moderates inIran, nor was it in fact a negotiation to negotiate for thegeneral release of hostages. It was initiated solely andexclusively to obtain the release of William Buckley because heknew about the whereabouts of the off-the-shelf operation. It wasa criminal enterprise and they feared that if the American peoplefound out about that there would be a huge constitutional scandaland the President of the United States would be impeached. May I most respectfully ask that this matter not be touchedupon at this stage. If we wish to get into this I'm certainarrangements can be made during executive session. (cut to Jack Brook's summary) .. involving the US government in military activity in directcontradiction of the law, diverting public funds into privatepockets in secret unofficial activities, selling access to thePresident for thousands of dollars, dispensing cash and foreignmoney orders out of a White House safe, accepting gifts andfalsifying papers to cover it up, altering and shredding nationalsecurity documents, lying to Congress. Now I believe that the American people understand thatdemocracy cannot survive that kind of abuse. (back to Bo at luncheon) I don't think it makes a hoot who you vote for for President.The same people are gonna run this country. I stand before youtoday. You gotta know who I am. I'm an indicted felon becausepart of that phone call in Thailand said, "Bo, if you don'terase and forget, if you don't come to the apartment (that was asafehouse in Washington, DC), you're gonna be charged with 15years and your going to serve as a felon and we're going to bringup aggravated charges and hostile witnesses." That's not my kind of language. I said, "Friend, that'san insult to you, me and two hundred years of constitutionalgovernment." He said, "Bo, don't give me that. Bringeverything you've got to the apartment." I said, "Who'sgoing to be there, Joe?" And he said, "You know mebetter than that, Bo. It will just be me and Tom Harvey." Isaid, "OK, I'll bring this stuff dear citizen. I'll show itto you then you tell me to erase and forget." When I got toLA with the tapes he said, "Bo, don't come." He wasthat much of a friend. He said, "Don't come. Hide thosetapes. Everybody's laying for you." He said, "Butplease destroy and forget. That's all the state department wantsyou to do because otherwise you're going to jail as afelon." You know what they charged me with? They did chargeme. Misuse of a passport. Now that is a weeny charge for somebody thats been inclandestine warfare for more than 30 years. That throws me inleague with Jane Fonda. She was cavorting with the enemy andmisusing her passport. Ollie North and Robert McValium went to Iran on Irishpassports so they could do an illegal arms deal, but nobody hascharged them. Thats because they're cooperating. Well, I'm not worried about that. The US attorney doesn't knowhow hard to take it because I said, "I don't deny I misuseda passport. I misused it many times. Every time in pursuit of USprisoners of war." You dear citizen, see if you would erase and go back to sleepand forget. I don't think that you will. In my defense I got alawyer, he's the former US attorney for Nevada. He took my casefor free other than all the expenses it cost to bring inwitnesses. Were going to use this court as a forum for prisonersof war and for government in drug dealing because you know youcan't sue the government, but when the government jumps on younow you can turn it around on them. Thats exactly what weredoing. I got a plea the other day saying, "Bo, just go aheadand cop a plea it'll be a misdemeanor." No way Jose, weregoing all the way with this one. (Narrator) The American Warrior has traveled a long road from the junglesof Vietnam to the Pentagon to a hostile federal courtroom in LasVegas, but the commitment to God, country, honor and decency havenever wavered. It would be far easier to walk away from thisbattle, but to do so would be impossible for this soldier. Interestingly enough, the US attorney prosecuting this caseagainst a respected dissenting war hero is himself the formerroad manager for a well-known 1960's antiwar rock group. Theirony is not lost on Las Vegans, but the issues behind the trialdemand nationwide attention. One can only wonder what the chargeswill be against Oliver North. The Christic Institue, on the other hand, is facing an uphillbattle in their current appeal of Judge King's dismissal of theirracketeering lawsuit against The Enterprise last June in Miami.As Father Bill Davis, their chief investigator explains: (cut to Fr. Bill Davis from The Christic Institute) This is by far the most important case we've ever done. Ithink for the kinds of forces that we're up against, as well asfor the broader public policy implications. If this crowd can getaway with what they have been getting away with: the armsdealing, the drug dealing, the assasination programs and sell itunder the guise of some kind of blind anti-communism, having hadthe revelations that we've had: the Hasenfus flight, the Iranarms deal. If they still get away with it then I think democracy,at least in this country, is in very very serious condition. Idon't think it will survive. We're either going to win againstthese forces, this time or I am not optimistic about the survivalof democracy in this country. I think it's that serious. (Narrator) The seriousness of Gritz's discoveries during his firstmission to the Golden Triangle, however was brought homeimmediately after his return. Scott Weekly, his Operation Lazarusteam member and veteran of several POW recovery missions, wasarrested and charged with a federal violation resulting from theAfghan training program he helped Gritz conduct. Weekly was aclassmate of Oliver North's at Annapolis and has a PhD inphysics. After numerous forays into hostile enemy territoryneither he nor Gritz were prepared for the treachery that awaitedthem at home. (Bo filmed in Thailand or thereabouts) The ambassador level person for the US government in charge ofnarcotics control made a statement immediately following therelease of this tape to the White House that the United Stateswould never a agree to talk with General Khun Sa about drugcontrol because he was such a black-hearted criminal. I believethat we can show through facts that have already been establishedby the US Justice Department and on-going investigations thatthere are people currently who saw that tape in the US governmentthat all that they could to stop this interview right here forfear they would be exposed. Even to the point where they arrestedScott Weekly for a minor technicality of transporting explosivesillegally on a commercial airliner. Very briefly we were training a couple of Afghan freedomfighters through the knowledge and request of the US statedepartment and other official agencies. The explosives wereprocurred for us from Fort Sill, Oklahoma and were naturallytransported, because we were using them at a remote desert base,by aircraft. There was no danger to the civilian aircraft. Theexplosives were C4, plastic, frontline safe. You could shoot themwith a machine gun and they wouldn't go off. There were no detonating devices with us. Federal agents toldScott when he was taken into custody that it wasn't atechnicality and that the real target was me. They were underpressure by the US attorney's office to find out whether or not Iwas in kahoots with North and Poindexter since I had traveled toLatin America and to the Middle East in pursuit of variousgovernment associated projects. The fact is and the truth is thatI've had nothing to do with North and Poindexter or any illegalactivities either in South America or the Middle East. Now thetruth is that I believe that elements in the US government areafraid that they will be exposed for their illegal activities anddrug trafficking. Through that exposure that this will cease andthey will lose their power. If they had tried to put pressure by causing Scott Weekly evento be adjudged guilty ... because he was told if he would pleadguilty that there would be no problem... that he would be givenprobation... that there would be no more pursuit... that it wouldbe unsupervised probation which would allow him to continue totravel overseas. In truth, he was sentenced. The fact is thatScott was told that if he would plead guilty that there would beno further investigation and that all would go well for him andthat if he did not plead guilty there would be a tether put onall of us so that we would not be able to travel and at that timewe were very very close to negotiating the release of Americanprisoners of war. The only reason that Scott plead guilty was sothat other members of the Operation Lazarus team, myselfincluded, would be free to continue the mission of liberating USprisoners of war, which is ongoing now. (Narrator Discussing Weekly's case) Scott Weekly was made to serve fourteen months of a five yearsentence before it was demonstrated that the agents had removedsensitive documents from his pre-sentencing file which would haveexonerated him. The sentence was simply dismissed. Lance Trimmer, a former Green Beret communications specialistwith the Lazarus team, accompanied Gritz to Burma in Weekly'splace in May, 1987 where he witnessed Khun Sa naming the USofficials involved in drug trafficking. As a professional privateinvestigator, since returning he has spearheaded the effort todocument and publicize the team's findings and was instrumentalin obtaining Scott Weekly's release from LongPoke Federal Prison.In the process he has been unjustifiably arrested and detainedthree times by the police and federal authorities. (Narrator introducing Barry Flinn) Barry Flinn is the Bangkok station chief for OperationLazarus. In May of 1987 he served as the cameraman with ColonelGritz on his second trip to visit Khun Sa. Also during this timehe has made other trips into ShanLand. On one occasion heaccompanied a journalist from Australia who filmed theproceedings and made this the subject of a news program inAustralia. Barry himself was arrested immediatly upon his returnto Bangkok from ShanLand on the first trip and has been severaltimes since then as has been Khun Sa. (Khun Sa in interview with Australian journalist .. either hehimself or a translator is speaking... it sounds like Khun Sahimself) .. even if they kill me the opium will still be there. Theyonly use me as a money tree. Every time they want money, theycome and shake the tree just like a Christmas tree. Journalist: ..spraying the opium crop with the poison 24-D (orsomesuch...Ed.) (Narrator Again) One of the problems that Khun Sa pointed out in the newsprogram in Australia is the extensive use of toxic herbicidespraying over his territory not to kill the opium plants, but tokill the food crops which is very very destructive of the cultureand the people and creating a very serious refugee problem. (Khun Sa again...) We have 300 families in the hills now who have no food. Theworld body is doing something against humanity in the Shan stateand nobody knows about it. (Bo talks about Khun Sa's offer) General Khun Sa has extended an offer in writing to turn overto the United States Government on March 15, 1988 one ton ofrefined Asian heroin, that sells for $250,000 per pound todistributors, as a show of good faith that he would stop 1200tons of heroin from entering the free world in 1988. The responseof the State Department was, "no interest." (Bo talking in Southeast Asian Field) There are personalities within the United States Governmentwho have, as early as the early 1960's, trafficked in opium andheroin to finance assasination programs initially approved by theCentral Intelligence Agency, which didn't work then and aren'tworking now. If these assasinations programs spread from Vietnam,Cambodia, Laos and Thailand to Iran, to Nicaragua, to Libya andhave the potential of continuing to spread unless some exposureis finally done to eliminate these high officials. H. Ross Perot has said as a result of his investigation he hasfound a, "snake pit without a bottom." He says that thepeople involved will do anything to keep their wrongdoingscovered up. He even says that a man that was responsible for thePhoenix assasination program is now on the personal staff ofGeorge Bush. (Cut to Barry Flinn in Bangkok discussing his trip with Bo.) My name is Barry Flinn and I live in Bangkok, Thailand. I havebeen in Bangkok now for two years. I am a member of OperationLazarus and I am the station chief here in Bangkok. My functionfor Operation Lazarus is to collect information from my agents inLaos and in Vietnam on locating live Americans held captive inthese two countries. This last trip Colonel Gritz had asked me togo into ShanLand, a territory of Burma, to be a witness and acameraman to record the conversation with him and General KhunSa. I agreed to go and I did witness, I did record the meetingwith Lt. Colonel James 'Bo' Gritz and General Khun Sa. Anothermember of Operation Lazarus by the name of Lance Trimmer alsoaccompanied us. In Shanland I did record the meeting and thefacts are as follows: General Khun Sa's people, the secretariesread from a document written in the Shan language about Americanofficials dealing in heroin from 1965 to the present. Some of thenames he had given us were a man by the name of Shackley, a manby the name of Armitage and other American officials involved indrugs. Now my job is strictly locating POWS. I am not involvedwith the DEA or any other US Government agency. I am a privatecitizen. It makes you angry when you hear of the drug problems inAmerica. Children taking heroin at twelve and high officialssupplying them the heroin and all the cover-ups they did in thepast, the present and probably in the future. Now as a witness I definitely believe these men were involvedin the drug trade. General Khun Sa did say that, after giving usthe names, he wouldn't be surprised if B52 bombers started flyingover Shanland to destroy him and to kill him so that he wouldn'ttestify to the other Americans involved in the drug trade. I am staying in Bangkok, Thailand to locate POWs and if peopleare interested in more information about the interview with KhunSa and Lt. Colonel James 'Bo' Gritz they know were to find me.The American embassy knows were to locate me. Lt. Colonel James'Bo' Gritz knows were to locate me and I'm sure the peopleinvolved in the drug trade know where to locate me. Alright. One more thing. I did here about the AmericansShackley, Armitage and other Americans being named it sent achill up my spine and down my back. It made me angry. It made meshocked. I couldn't believe it, but it was there: names, files ofold papers that the Lao agents and the Shan people have on ourAmericans. Somebody has to do something. It will probably all becovered up. I don't know. It's not my business. I was only awitness and it will stay with me for the rest of my life aboutthe people in our government dealing drugs. It's nice to know,isn't it? It's really nice to know... (Bo gives summary) In summary, the reason that American prisoners of war are notat home as we speak, if what Khun Sa, the Christic Institute, andH. Ross Perot are saying is true, is because Richard Armitage,the one man responsible for their recovery is a heroin smugglerand an arms dealer. He has misused his office in order to promotecovert operations through the sale of heroin and trading in armsthat bypasses the US Congress. When prisoners come home he willbe investigated. His wrongdoings and misuse of office will beuncovered and exposed and he and the others will fall like ahouse of cards. As an American citizen it is our responsibilityto wake up to the internal threat, the treachery that threatensliterally the life of this nation. (Bo back at luncheon asks people to swear to do something) It's time that we just became Americans. Here is what I wouldask you to do, because you can't just go back to sleep on thisthing like we did on 007, the Korean airline. One is, I would askthat in your mind, if not physically here today be willing toraise you hand to the square (?) and swear again before God andwitnesses your allegiance to this heavenly banner (points toflag) and to the constitution of the United States because itwill die hermetically sealed in the National Archives if we don'tbreath some life back into it. It is hanging by a thread. The righteous people of this country, doesn't mean Democrat,Republican, right, left, conservative, liberal, the righteouspeople of this country need now to stand up and put a shoulder toit to keep it stable. I want you to commit to yourself thatyou're going to do something about it. Demand that aninvestigation be made. (Bo narrating here...) Demand a thorough and true investigation of Richard Armitage.Insist that The Christic Institute's charges go to trial and beheard by a jury of Americans. That those in our government thatrepresent sewage, that clog the bureaucracy today might becleaned out. That the American way might continue. That ourchildren might grow up in liberty and freedom with sameopportunities that we have had. (Gritz apparently is willing to run for Congress on theRepublican ticket. Back to the luncheon) In the legislature you need to seek out, identify and draftpeople that have the guts to stand up, because if you get thelegislature up there it can be through the people. It can bepulled back from the brink. I think thats our saving grace. Ithink that through the legislature we can do what no one elsewould have done to Nixon. We can wash him away, we can wash away,hopefully, it's going to be a hard fight, this cancer. I standbefore you and give you an order. You have got to do somethingabout this thing. We fought the enemy foreign. Can't we fight theenemy domestic?
