If the FDA, in its smokescreen game of "Pharmaceutical Cop" doesn'tcare about your health, we do! There are few things in life that have aroused mypassion more than my current quest for improving the health of this nation. Ifmy endeavor is to become a full-blown reality, alternative medicine must take itsrightful place in our health-care policies. I have created the AlternativeMedicine Digest in an effort to help ensure that right - a right that must begranted to each of us, free of interference from misguided orfinancially-motivated special-interest groups. WE MUST, WE CAN, WE SHALL RELEASE FROM POWER THOSE WHO GET IN THE WAY OF THE NEW HEALTH AGEIN AMERICA. The Alternative Medicine Digest is the voice ofalternative medicine - loud, clear, and honest: a compilation of the latestfindings. Not only is my purpose to raise public awareness of health options,but also to influence conventional medical practice - to encourage ongoingresearch and national health policies whose basic tenets are truly in your besthealth interest. I envision this unity of traditional and alternativemodalities as the hallmark of future medicine - the catalyst for the dawning of anew Health Age in America. We must, we can, we shall release from power thosewho get in the way of making this happen.

[Go to the Table of Contents] WHY ISN'T THE FDA DOING ITS JOB? No one can deny that cancer is epidemic. Yet medical journals abound withprestigious research demonstrating the value of nutrient supplementation in itsprevention and treatment. Why, then, is our Food and Drug Administration (FDA),led by commissioner David Kessler, waging a relentless campaign to eliminatealternatives that include supplementation? Why is the emphasis so strongly tiedto drug therapy? And why is the sick and tired American public getting sick andtired of not being told the truth? "THE EXISTENCE OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS SHOULD NOT ACT AS A DIS-INCENTIVE FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT." A new law, the Nutritional Labeling and Education Act (NLEA),scheduled to go into effect in July 1994, will severely limit the public'sability to buy vitamins and minerals. This will be accomplished by permittingthe FDA to reclassify hundreds of dietary supplements as "illegal drugs." Therationale? The labels of these supplements suggest that they may have possiblehealth benefits. Totally ignored is the fact that many of them do indeed havehealth benefits and that endless studies reported by our own physicians validatethese very benefits! So why does the FDA want to restrict their use? Jonathan Wright, M.D., has offered information that helps shed light on theanswer to that question. Dr. Wright, a prominent physician with more than twentyyears of experience in family practice and one of the world's experts innutritional biochemistry, is an outspoken critic of FDA policy. (You are probablyalready familiar with the widely-publicized incident involving the gestapolikeFDA raid on Dr. Wright's office that took place on the morning of May 6, 1992.) Dr. Wright has compiled statements from congressmen, FDA officials, andjudges that paint a compelling picture of the "hidden" agenda of the FDA in itsproclaimed role as guardians of our nation's health. Read them and see what youthink. "THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SEPARATE REGULATORY CATEGORY FOR SUPPLEMENTS COULD UNDERCUT EXCLUSIVITY RIGHTS ENJOYED BY HOLDERS OF APPROVED." DRUG APPLICATIONS."

Source: FDA Hotline (Altamonte Springs, Florida, January 1994, a news letter focusing on investigative reporting). There's more, much more. These nine excerpts, however, should give you a clearpicture of why the FDA does what it does. What do you think? With new regulations, no information relating correlations between nutrients anddiseases can appear on the labels of supplements - relationships between fiberdeficiency and colon cancer, lack of chromium and diabetes, vitamin E deficiencyand heart disease, vitamin C and tissue integrity, vitamin D and bone health, guargum and blood sugar metabolism, etc. "92 PERCENT OF 109 DRUG COMPANY ADVERTISEMENTS VIOLATED FDA REGULATIONS." Here's one more excerpt for you to think about: The February 1994 issue of HealthFreedom News, a natural health magazine that claims it "dares to tell the truth,"advises that "The FDA has been lying to the public since it has been given thepower to regulate supplement labels for decades and it has failed to do so. Tocomplain that it needs more power, when it has not used the power it already has,is hard to understand. If the FDA had been taking care of business, theL-tryptophan problem would never have happened. A label could not help the peoplewho died from a bad batch of Tylenol. However, unlike L-tryptophan, Tylenol isstill on the market." Editor's note: A tainted batch of L-tryptophan, traced to a single manufacturer, caused the FDAto withdraw this product from ALL sources. Physicians had been prescribingL-tryptophan successfully for more than 20 years. No one except the drug-orientedFDA wanted to replace this safe relaxant with harmful drugs. Physiciansprotested, but to no avail. "THE LABEL CANNOT REVEAL THAT NUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES AND DISEASES MAY BE RELATED. T.K. Vodrey, the publisher of Let's Live magazine, urges everyone to help getCongress to pass the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in 1994. "Thebest way to insure this passage," says Vodrey, "is more letters, faxes and phonecalls to your representatives in Washington. Ask them to co-sponsor S. 784 andH.R. 1709 if they haven't already. We all need to keep the pressure up so therewill be a positive chance of having this act passed into law." Finally, Vodrey shares our view by thanking everyone for the support of thenatural health industry.

Marcuswrote a warning about strong evidence linking the addition of fluoride to ourdrinking water with our increased cancer death rate. "STRONG EVIDENCE LINKS FLUORIDE IN DRINKING WATER WITH INCREASED CANCER DEATH RATE." Marcus declared that there could be in excess of 10,000 avoidable fluoride-relateddeaths per year. As you know, fluoride is added to public drinking water with the"promise" that it will safely fight tooth decay What you may not know is that theuse of fluoride stems from a search to dispose of this industrial waste productthrough profit-producing channels. Instead of alerting cities using fluoridatedwater, the EPA alerted Marcus - to cease and desist such warnings. When Marcusrefused, he was fired. If you have lost faith in our justice system, take heart: Marcus was reinstatedand compensated by court order. The Department of Labor found the EPA guilty offalsifying employment records, discrimination, and retaliation against an employeewhistleblower.

Mammographydetects many non-infiltrating and small, non-palpable tumors, but it is not knownwhether these would ever cause symptoms or threaten a woman's life. It isdoubtful, according to this study, that the time gained by early detection confersany survival benefit over physical examination in terms of human and economiccosts.

"The question we should be asking,� state the researchers, "is not how to refinemammographic screening but whether we need it at all ...

Current evidence suggests that screeningby physical examination is as effective as screening mammography in reducingmortality from breast cancer." Source: Lancet, February 5, 1994. "VARIATIONS IN BREAST THICKNESS COMPOSITION CAN PRODUCE A RANGE OF EXPOSURE WHICH EXCEEDS THE LATITUDE OF MAMMOGRAPHY TESTING EQUIPMENT." The rationale for asking this question stems from accumulating evidence againstthe need for mammography. Several potentially-harmful effects of mammographyscreening must be considered, including over-diagnosis, radiation exposure, andfalse positive results. Source: British Medical Journal, 1993 Dec 4, 307(6917):1481-3. Recently published seven-year results from the Canadian National Breast ScreeningStudy showed that in women aged 40 to 49 years, no reduction in breast-cancermortality was observed when screened women were compared with unscreened women. In women aged 50 to 59 years, breast-cancer mortality was similar when annualscreening using mammography and physical examination was compared with annualscreening using physical examination alone. The American Cancer Society advocatesmammography screening for all women from age 40, whereas in Europe it is notrecommended for women below age 50. Much remains unknown about the efficacy ofmammography. Additional problems relate to women with mammographically-dense breasts. Variations in breast thickness and composition can produce a range of exposurewhich exceeds the latitude of mammography testing equipment.

The same hormone that helps to build bone back can also restore or prevent the occurrence of vaginal dryness - at any age. Hormonal imbalances of estrogen and progesterone are the core of the problem. Applying a cream containing three percent natural progesterone and sold over the counter has been reported to alleviate (or prevent) the problem.

In a follow-up study seven years later, 41 men had died. Researchers found that men who had no stressful events accounted for 3.3 percent of the deaths. Men who said they had at least three stressful events made up I percent of the deaths. When the study began, researchers also asked the men how many profound, emotionally-supportive relationships they had. The researchers determined that for men with insufficient emotional support, stressful events may be a contributing factor to death. Source: British Medical Library, October 30, 1993.

GTF is needed for insulin activity and is responsible for normal insulin function. Therefore, insulin's effects on carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism are dependent on the maintenance of adequate chromium stores. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), our food supply is dangerously low in chromium. Add to this the fact that athletes may have an increased requirement for chromium, and it appears that supplementation of a chromium compound is the way to go! The restoration and maintenance of chromium stores via supplementation promotes optimal insulin efficiency, necessary for high-level athletic performance.

American settlers, traveling across the west, often put a silver dollar in milk to delay spoilage. Today, more than half of the world's airlines use silver water filters to guard against such waterborne diseases as dysentery. When prepared under suitable conditions, colloidal silver has a destructive action on toxins. Studies with test animals show that it protects against lethal doses of toxins in amounts ten times that which would be harmful. Almost a century ago, colloidal silver was reported to subdue inflammation and promote the healing of lesions. Today, physicians use it for acne, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis - even athlete's foot and ringworm. The low toxicity of silver opens interesting for use of silver as a potential antiviral agent. Source:Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications, 1992, vol 189:1444. For acne, the recommendation is 2 teaspoons of liquid colloidal silver a day for seven days; then I teaspoon a day until clear. Can be used for two to three months. For rheumatoid arthritis, I tablespoon a day is recommended for ten days, followed by 2 teaspoons a day for six months to one year. Bladder infections? One tablespoon a day until symptoms are gone, which usually takes about seven to ten days. Source: Joe Cardot, N.D., Arvada, Colorado.

Perhaps more relaxed? Less relaxed and more excited? You may be familiar with aromatherapy and essential oils. Two researchers from Britain explain how they work. "THE ODOR OF LEMON AFFECTS PEOPLE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY REPORT FEWER HEALTH SYMPTOMS." The researchers report that brain wave patterns caused by odors are different from those initiated by sight and sound; the brain processes information about odors leading to an alteration in awareness, mood, or physiological response. The result may also be caused by a cascade of reactions created by the aromatic compounds exerting a drug-like action on a molecular level. Complex? Suffice it to say that smells can evoke reactions. Subjectivity plays an important role, so reactions may vary. Some are consistent, however. Lavender, for example, is sedative; jasmine is stimulant. The odor of lemon affects people in such a way that they report fewer health symptoms - perhaps by association of the odor with freshness, cleanliness, and thus improved health feelings. The fragrance does not have to be intense to be effective. The more intense the odor, the less pleasant it becomes. Source:Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine, 1994, Vol 12:16.

"Putting osteoporosis in perspective. "Osteoporosis is characterized by a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD). Dietary patterns that encourage adequate calcium intake are essential to maximal development and later maintenance of bone mass. The majority of white women are at risk for osteoporosis related fractures, especially in the wrist, spine, and hip." [So far so good.]"The degree of fracture risk at a specific bone site is best assessed by measuring BMD with singleor x-ray-photon absorptiometry. BMD in adults of any age is quite variable. Numerous diet and lifestyle factors influence BMD and, in turn, fracture risk. Sufficient evidence exists for a relationship between BMD and diet, particularly calcium and vitamin D; amenorrhea; body weight; alcoholism; smoking; and physical inactivity." [Errors by ommission. Magnesium and other minerals are as important as calcium. Vitamin D must be converted by your liver and kidney to a hormonal form if it is to be helpful in bone formation.] "Less convincing evidence exists for a relationship with dietary protein, dietary phosphorus, and caffeine intake." [Less convincing? We have a very thick file of research data demonstrating these relationships!] "To minimize fracture risk, young women should have regular menses, consume a nutritionally adequate diet (according to the principles of the Food Guide Pyramid), perform regular physical activity, only consume a moderate intake of alcohol (if any), and not smoke. Postmenopausal women should follow those same guidelines and should seriously consider estrogen replacement therapy." [Here's the part that arches our back! No mention of supplements!

This month's story is presented by Serafina Corsello, M.D., director of theCorsello Centers in New York City and Huntington, New York: "Stress increases energy requirements and creates a demand for an expandedsupply of energy-yielding glucose. Wouldn't it be wonderful if emotions such as anger, anxiety,depression, fear, grief, guilt, jealousy, and shame - emotions associated withstress could be tempered simply by controlling blood sugar levels? I havediscovered in my clinical practice that GTF chromium polynicotinate may be ableto do just that in some circumstances. "Sadly, a whole generation of medical doctors and scientists in this country appear to be unaware that stress and anxiety can be diminished through nurtritional manipulations that can normalize metabolic pathways. "Sarah came to me complaining of feeling 'stressed out.' She reported extrememood swings, with frequent exaggerated perceptions of threatening events. Sarahwas a noninsulin-dependent diabetic, needing to rely on lifestyle diet changesfor control. Like all diabetics, she loved sugar. As her poorly-regulated sugarlevels seesawed, so did her insulin and adrenalin causing mood swings, fatigue,sweats, dizziness, headaches, and disorientation. Because insulin is lipogenic(fat-producing), her cholesterol level was 320 and triglycerides, 225. Her LDL(the "bad-guy" cholesterol) was elevated and she assumed the fatty and flabbyappearance of poorly-regulated diabetics." "I PRESCRIBED 800 MICROGRAMS OF GTF CHROMIUM." "I prescribed 800 micrograms of GTF chromium. Diabetics need at least 600 to 800micrograms, especially if they are overweight. Sarah weighed 250 pounds. "I also instructed Sarah to walk daily, eat five small meals instead of three larger ones with emphasis on fish and vegetables. The change in diet helped to eliminate her distended stomach and her cravings for sugar. "Eating large meals triggers insulin production and disregulated sugar levels,creating cardiovascular problems and mood fluctuations. Soon, Sarah lost weightand began to feel human again. Today, Sarah's blood sugar metabolism, lipidprofile, and moods are in total harmony, and she looks ten years younger! "For those interested in understanding why Sarah was helped with the addition ofchromium, its answer is that chromium regulates insulin, which in turn helps toovercome insulin resistance, which in turn helps to optimize the function of thehypothalamus a deep brain structure that controls all internal organ functions." "PART OF THE ANSWER: CHROMIUM REGULATES INSULIN." "When stress signals are set off, the reaction begins in your brain.The responsetravels to your cerebral deep structures and from there to all endocrine glands.Your hypothalamus is top kingpin of your brain's functions, including reactionsto the stress response. It works like the dispatching station of atelecommunications center its call of warning ready to sound at a microsecond'snotice. "So you can see how proper lifestyle modifications and keeping your metabolismin good shape with chromium is essential for relieving stress symptoms andreversing cardiovascular problems. And it surely doesn't hurt that all thismakes you look younger, too."

One of the elements in the progression of this disease is thecholesterol that sets up roadblocks in those narrow arteries. It has beenconcluded that dietary cholesterol is a major cause of this disease, and soyou'd better cut down on foods containing cholesterol. Right? Wrong. Certainly cholesterol is part of the problem - cholesterol does help toimpede the flow through your arteries. But how it gets there is a verycomplicated story. In attempting to understand heart disease, it mustn't beforgotten that heart disease didn't exist in 1890. It exists today largely dueto nutrient deficiencies incurred because of our denuded food. THE ROLE OF DIETARY CHOLESTEROL AS A CAUSE OF HEART DISEASE IS RELATIVELY MINOR. Considerable evidence suggests that the role of dietary cholesterol as a causeof heart disease is relatively minor especially in view of the damage caused byhydrogenated fats and oils, lack of exercise, stress, obesity, thehomocysteine/nutrient-deficiency connection (explained in our cover story), andother cell-damaging agents. Advice to minimize foods containing cholesterol andto reduce fat intake has been failing because it paints the picture with too broada brush. The medical community at large makes no distinction between dangerousfats and healthful ones - an important deception. Far from being an evil substanceyou should try to avoid, cholesterol is one of the most significant chemicals inyour body. Without it your life would come to a grinding halt. This issue of theDigest is dedicated to setting the cholesterol/oil/fat/ heart-disease factsstraight.

Such a loss makes one philosophical - youstop to wonder why things happen the way they do. Perhaps the loss of that personhas you reflecting on your own health, lifestyle, and inherited predispositions. You probably know about the strong correlation between heart disease andcholesterol specifically between coronary heart disease and blood cholesterollevels. You may not know, however, that doubt exists concerning the causeand-effect relationship between the two. Treatments based on this relationship arenot only ineffective, but often counterproductive. CHOLESTEROL THAT CLOGS YOUR ARTERIES IS JUST AS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED BY YOUR OWN BODY. We're told that cholesterol from food finds its way into the interior ofarteries where it builds until it forms a significant barrier to the freecirculation of blood. But cholesterol is just as likely to have been manufacturedby your own body. Furthermore, the obstruction begins to develop inside the wallslining your arteries, not as surface deposits. Some researchers believe thatthe presence of cholesterol may even be an attempt to keep your damaged arteriesfunctioning better. The source of THE PRESENCE OF CHOLESTEROL MAY EVEN BE AN ATTEMPT TO KEEP YOUR DAMAGED ARTERIES FUNCTIONING BETTER. damage that leads to heart disease is still elusive, but a few facts are inplace. One promising view, validated by research, holds that in the absence ofvitamin B-6, folic acid, and vitamin B- 12, an important amino acid calledmethionine is converted to a substance called homocysteine in much greater thannormal quantities. Homocysteine has a toxic effect on certain cells in your arterywalls. Its presence eventually causes the inner walls of your arteries to becomeuneven and rough - resulting in an accumulation of unwanted stuff, includingcholesterol. Having an adequate supply of B-6 (50 mg), B-12 (0.1 mg), and folicacid (0.4 mg) could be insurance against this process. Another critical factoris the condition of dietary fats and oils. Naturally-occurring fatty acids have aparticular shape, which changes under the action of beat, oxygen, time, and evenlight. Intentionally manipulating an oil is beneficial for the food manufacturer(the oil is cheaper and processing takes less time), but the finished product isforeign to human metabolism - resulting in a debilitating loss of cellular healthfor you. So listing soybean, cottonseed, or corn oil on a label hardly tells thewhole story! You have no way of knowing how the oil has been altered. Highamounts of these altered fatty acids are found in cakes, muffins, crackers,cereals, donuts, precooked french fries, shortenings, potato chips and corn chips. Referred to as trans-fatty acids, their introduction began after 1912 ! 2 We nowknow that they can injure the lining of your digestive tract by causinginflammation, in addition to causing heart damage. Beware foods with trans-fattyacids. Margarine, with a high percentage of these mutated fatty acids but longpromoted as a heartfriendly substitute for butter, has been finally proved to havethe opposite effect - something the nutrition-aware community has known for a longtime. Now everyone knows that trans-fatty acids are directly related toheart-disease risk.' The "French paradox"(Iow incidence of coronary heart diseasedespite a high intake of total fat in France) is suggested to be due to the limiteduse of trans-fats in French foods. Your liver manufactures between one and fourgrams of cholesterol per day An egg, for comparison, has about one-quarter of agram. So your liver is producing cholesterol equivalent to between four to sixteeneggs daily - a high cholesterol diet by anyone's standards. Plus, every cell inyour body (with a few exceptions) can manufacture cholesterol. HAVING AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF B-6 (50 MG), B- 1 2 (0. I MG), AND FOLIC ACID (0.4 MG) COULD BE INSURANCE AGAINST HEART DISEASE. You can see that the route from dietary cholesterol to heart disease isindirect at best. (For Betty Kamen's paper on the much-maligned egg - why you shouldand can eat them - send a self-addressed stamped envelope to: Eggs, PO Box 5847,Novato, CA 94948.) There are other important foods and nutrients affectingundesirable cholesterol levels. Lots of fiber in your diet can have the effect ofreducing dietary cholesterol absorption, so a simple bowl of oatmeal INTENTIONALLY MANIPULATING THE FORM OF AN OIL IS BENEFICIAL FOR THE FOOD PROCESSOR, BUT FOREIGN TO HUMAN METABOLISM. for breakfast or brown rice for lunch can be heartprotective. Garlic (eitherfresh or in capsules), gamma oryzanol (from rice bran oil, available in capsuleform), and the essential fatty acids from fish oil (also sold in capsules), havebeen shown to reduce unwanted cholesterol, reduce mortality, or both. How much ofeach of these should you take? Follow manufacturer's instructions - preparationsand sources vary. Please note that these are just the tip of the iceberg. Thelist of nutrients and foods reducing unhealthy cholesterol is a very long one! Good nutrition and supplements can activate natural control and healing processes,rather than intervene using an artificial mechanism like cholesterol-loweringdrugs. Such drugs block absorption of other nutrients and impair liver function. They also reduce alertness and are the cause of increased accidents. Isn't itsurprising that patients take these drugs even after physicians warn about the needfor routine check-ups because of potential danger? Most people don't realize thattesting devices can't perceive liver damage until far too many cells have beendestroyed. Sidney M. Wolfe, MD, advises that drugs should not be the firstchoice for lowering cholesterol unless other circumstances exist. "A change fromanimal to vegetable proteins often corrects high cholesterol," says Dr. Wolfe.'"Supplementation [of fiber]," he continues, "can significantly lower totalcholesterol and LDL cholesterol by absorbing water and softening the stools in yourintestine."

Lambert Co., 1265 Oakmond Pkway, Sunnyvale, CA94086. 1-800-350-8350.1 Why, in light of all this, has dietary cholesterol - andthe extreme measures associated with lowering it - acquired the reputation as thesingle most significant factor in heart disease? This view persists even though avery significant proportion of coronary heart disease cases also occurs in peoplewith normal or low cholesterol. In 1982, a ten-year study costing $115 millionand involving over 12,000 subjects concluded that diet was important and thatchanged eating habits could save lives.' Any nutrition-oriented practitioner couldhave spared the researchers all that time and expense, saving many lives in theinterim. It has become increasingly more difficult to separate nutritionknowledge from advertising copy. Let us remind physicians that by the first decadeof this century, consumption of animal fat and cholesterol in the United States hadalready come close to the levels of mid-century. Yet the epidemic THINK ABOUT THESE FACTS THE NEXT TIME YOU HEAR OR SEE AN AD FOR A CHOLESTEROL-FREE FOOD OR A CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING DRUG. spread of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease did not appear forgenerations. And after coronary heart disease peaked in the 1950s, there followeda slow but gradual decline between 1960 and 1980, while cholesterol in our dietscontinued to climb slightly. Think about these facts the next time you hear or seean ad for a cholesterol-free food or a cholesterol-lowering drug. And whatabout population groups like Eskimos and other non-industrialized societies whoconsume huge amounts of dietary cholesterol and have high blood cholesterol, yetvery low mortality due to coronary heart disease? Or the group of Indians who catsmall amounts of fat but suffer seven times more acute heart attacks? Why doNorthern Asiatic Indians eat a very high percentage of their calories as fat,mostly from butter, yet have exceptionally-low cardiovascular disease?' The same istrue for a group of American Indians, the Mvskoke. Clearly there are gapingholes in the logic of cause-and-effect as far as cholesterol in your diet andcoronary heart disease are concerned. We cannot discuss diet without noting theimportant differences between good food and bad food. Within each nutrientcategory (fats, proteins, etc.), food can be healthful or deadly, full of nurturingstuff or toxins, and yet major research efforts make no distinctions. In theinterest of your own health, give some thought to the following: Does theunsaturated oil you consume come from rancid cooking oil used for deep frying - orfrom fresh oil-bearing seeds and nuts? Are your carbohydrates from sugar-sweetenedjunk foods - or from fruits and vegetables? Were your eggs scrambled (a methodpromoting free radicals) - or poached (the better way to prepare an egg; try tokeep that yolk runny)? Your grilled meat ground to bits (inducing trans-fattyacids), laden with harmful chemicals to make them tasty and with nitrates to makethem pretty - or organically-derived? Has the saturated fat been on a hot, slattedgrill where the fat dripped into the coals and the fire threw it back up to thefood (creating trans-fatty acids) - or grilled on a pan to prevent this fromhappening? Has the unsaturated fat been hydrogenated into artificial shortening? WERE YOUR EGGS SCRAMBLED OR POACHED? Major food suppliers aren't likely to touch a research Project if results wouldpoint to their standard practices as a major cause of widespread death and disease.(Congress is finally investigating the tobacco industry for withholding research. Do you think there's a chance that the food industry will be next?) To reverseits findings now, the medical establishment would result in a serious loss ofcredibility Of course, saving face is probably a minor concern compared to money,even in the world of medical research. While it's not our intent to malign themedical research community, it should be understood that money from drug companiesand the food industry is distributed throughout the research institutes of theworld. Remember when Eisenhower cautioned us to beware of themilitary/industrial/ complex taking over? The medical/drug/food/complex is just asdangerous, causing even more misery and death than Hitler! What this means foryou and me is that we have to take a very long, hard and critical look at anyproposed treatment that involves a patented drug. A dietary recommendation,however simple, that threatens the food industry has a tough time in our supposedlyfree market of information. You can't patent garlic, rice, fish, or exercise, andno food conglomerate will make money if you, the consumer packaged oils and fatscooked at high temperature. Meanwhile, as stated in a June 1994 issue of Lancet,"understanding heart disease, our most serious health disorder, is now confused,its management at stalemate."

It does this by preventing cholesterol-transporting particles from accumulating inside artery walls. This same technology can reverse existing deposits, providing an alternative to the surgical treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Developed by Matthias Rath, MD, the treatment uses ascorbate (vitamin C), other antioxidants, and the amino acids proline and lysine. LOW LEVELSOF VITAMIN CFACILITATE CHOLESTEROLBLOCKAGES. How does Dr. Rath's treatment work? Low levels of vitamin C facilitatecholesterol blockages, while high levels prevent the formation of free radicals -the out-of-control molecules that damage your healthy cells. Free radicals initiateartery obstruction by damaging your artery walls. Vitamin C also helps to heal theimpaired areas of artery walls before they fill with cholesterol. The otherantioxidants and the proteins in Rath's regimen all work synergistically to makethis happen. Dr. Rath describes the symptoms of one of his patients: "George is a patientwith a severe heart muscle weakness. He is an entrepreneur in his fifties. Threeyears ago his life was changed by a sudden occurrence of cardiac failure - aweakness of the heart muscle leading to decreased pumping function and to anenlargement of the heart chambers. He could no longer fully meet his professionalrequirements and had to give up his sports activities. "On some days George felt so weak he couldn't climb stairs and he had to holdhis beverage glass with both hands. Because of the continued weak pumping functionof his heart and the unfavorable prognosis of this disease, his cardiologistrecommended a heart transplant operation. AFTER TWO MONTHSGEORGE'S CARDIOLOGISTNOTED A DECREASEIN SIZE OF THEPREVIOUSLY ENLARGED HEART. "At this point George started to follow my cardiovascular healthrecommendations. His physical strength improved gradually. Soon he could againfulfill his professional obligations on a regular basis and was able to undertakedaily bicycle rides. After two months his cardiologist noted a decrease in size ofthe previously enlarged heart, another sign of a recovering heart muscle. One monthlater, George was able to undertake a business trip abroad by plane, and he couldattend to his business affairs without any physical limitations. "I firmly believe that America's number one killer can be prevented by anoptimum intake of essential nutrients."

It's theprocess of modifying fat artificially converting liquid fats into solids as inmargarine, lard, non-dairy cream, bakery products, and nut butters. One reasonmanufacturers prefer the use of hydrogenated oils is because they extend shelf life(life of the food, not yours!). And don't be fooled by the label reading "made frompartially-hydrogenated fat" - that's like being "just a little bit pregnant!" The higher levels of harmful fats are at the expense of essential fatty acids. The term "essential" in nutrition jargon means your body can't make it, so it mustbe on your plate! Since it has become virtually impossible to avoid a consistent,daily dietary intake of trans-fatty acids, Medical Hypotheses advises that "aprecautionary, preventative supplementation of the diet with supplements containingessential fatty acids would be prudent.

SEXUAL IMPOTENCE IN MEN IMPOTENCE RELATED TO HEART OR BLOOD VESSEL DISORDER Men with heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes are up to four times more likely to become totally impotent than men without these diseases, according to a new study of nearly 1,300 men aged 40 to 70. Smoking, says the study, boosts impotence odds even higher. Sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the research showed for the first time that middle-aged and older men with low levels of high-density HDL were more likely to become impotent than men with higher HDLs. Irwin Goldstein, MD, a urologist and researcher in the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, from which the impotence study results were taken, says the findings should be good news because they show that impotence is not necessarily tied to aging, as many doctors traditionally thought. Impotence is a possible warning sign of heart or blood vessel disorder, because blood flow is related to erection. The good news is that men have some control over HDL levels through lifestyle habits. Goldstein warns: "When blood flow to the penis is impaired, it's likely that circulation to other organs in the body, including the heart, is also restricted."

You don't have to remember to take it and you don't have tomeasure amounts: it's a food you would normally use on a daily basis. Any health researcher will tell you that it's hard to come by a product,especially an everyday household oil, that both raises HDL and lowers LDL.Grapeseed oil, brand new on the American scene, does just that. Dr. David Nash,research cardiologist at the SUNY Science Center in New York, published a studyin Arteriosclerosis, revealing the beneficial HDL-effect of grapeseed oil. Theresearch shows that just one ounce daily is all that is necessary for thisbeneficial outcome. According to both the Helsinki and Framingham Heart Studies performed onthousands of patients over several years, each percentage increase in HDL affects a verysignificant decrease in the incidence of cardiac events. As a bonus, triglyceridesalso decrease. A second report recently confirmed Nash's findings, adding thatgrapeseed oil reduced LDL in just three weeks. To the best of current knowledge, grapeseed oil, a high linoleic product, is theonly food known to raise HDL and lower LDL. Linoleic acid is one of two essentialfatty acids that you cannot manufacture yourself - you must eat it! You may knowlinoleic acid as Omega 6. Studies indicate that linoleic is sadly deficient in ourdiets. Grapeseed oil is 76-percent linoleic acid! Low levels of HDL are also related to impotence. In fact, the results of theMassachusetts Male Aging Study show that as HDL levels decrease, the probability ofimpotence increases. (See details of this study inHealth Updates,page 9.) GRAPESEED OIL IS THE ONLY FOOD KNOWN TO RAISE HDL AND LOWER LDL. Grapeseed oil also: reduces platelet aggregation (that is, it prevents cells from sticking together, which causes processes leading to heart disease); helps to prevent hypertension caused by sodium excess; helps to normalize lesions occurring from obesity and diabetes; is ecologically sound because it is made from grape seeds after the wine pressings. Grapeseed oil is now available for all forms of cooking and is also ideal for saladdressings and mayonnaise. It has no fatty after taste and brings out the flavor offood, so it can be used for anything from an everyday tuna salad to delicate culinaryparty preparations. It has a non-greasy, slightly nutty flavor and will not cloud whenchilled. When used for regular or deep frying at normal temperatures, its unusually-highsmoke point, over 485 degrees F, means no smoking, no splattering, no burnt taste. Bestof all, there is no conversion to the harmful trans-fatty acids as with other oils. Naturally high in vitamin E, maximum benefit can be obtained by using it raw. Thepresence of vitamin E also graces grapeseed oil with a shelf life of at least two years. Editor's note:Our research shows that grapeseed oil is best for heart-health.

A SUPPLEMENT FOR HEALTHY GUMS Periodontal disease affects 80 percent of all adults and causes more tooth loss thandental decay, according to new research disclosed at the Eighth International Symposium onthe Biomedical and Clinical Aspects of Coenzyme Q-10, held in Stockholm. Research showed that many cases of periodontal disease can be successfully treated usinga nutritional substance, Coenzyme Q-10, in place of traditional periodontal treatment! More than 20 years ago dental research showed that patients suffering from periodontaldisease have low levels of Coenzyme Q- 10 in the tissues surrounding their teeth. Sincethen, several studies have shown definite improvement in periodontal disease as a result ofCoenzyme Q-10 supplementation. MANY CASES OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED USING COENZYME Q-10. Coenzyme Q-10 is a vitamin-like substance which is present in every cell of the humanbody and is an important part of energy production.

In fact, this trial raises thepossibility that these supplements may actually have harmful as well as beneficial effects. Within hours, Citizens for Health countered via fax and phone with the following information: The media has given enormous coverage to a single badly flawed Finnish study which supposedly showed negative results. The Finnish study appeared in a publication that is heavily dependent on pharmaceutical advertising support and shows a bias against vitamin supplementation. The researchers used only 1/8th to 1/40th the dosage of vitamin E shown by more than 20 previous studies to lower risk of lung cancer. Researchers used only 1/10th the dosage of beta carotene recommended for the prevention of lung cancer in smokers. The more potent vitamin C was curiously absent from the study. Researchers used as subjects the people from Finland, despite the fact that Finland is one of the worst countries in the world for cancer/nutrition studies for several reasons. Among them: Finns have one of the world's highest rates of per capita alcohol consumption bysmokers, and alcohol interferes with the utilization of vitamin E and beta carotene. Finland has an extremely low level of the essential mineral selenium in the soil. Selenium acts in connection with vitamin E in promoting cancer prevention. Thishighly-questionable study was funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), using taxdollars provided by the American public. The NCI must answer to Congress and the Americanpeople: Why was such an inappropriate study supported? Source: Citizens for Health, special bulletin. THE FINNISH STUDY WAS RUSHED OUT FOR POLITICAL CONVENIENCE. The National Health Federation added additional information: Even the authors of the study admit that the report may be subject to chance and error. The dietary intake of the water-soluble nutrients vitamin C, folic acid, and B vitamins is extremely low in Finland. The molecular mechanisms by which beta carotene and vitamin E protect against lung cancer in smokers depends on adequate levels of water-soluble nutrients. Men who had adequate levels of beta carotene or vitamin E were intentionally excluded from the Finnish study, which meant that only men with very high risk factors for developing lung cancer (that is, poor diets and heavy smoking) were allowed to participate. This distorted the real value of proper nutrition for cancer prevention. A study published in the British Journal of Cancer (1992, 66:1164) showed that beta carotene reduced pre-cancerous DNA damage to smoker's lungs by 47 percent within a relatively short period of time. Source: National Health Federation Action Alert, June 1994. Editor's Note: It has also been suggested that a carcinogenic dye had beenused in the coating of the beta carotene used in the study. MORE OLDER PEOPLE SURVIVINGHEART ATTACKS A report in a journal revered by conventional practitioners informs thatmortality rates at 30 days and at one year after a heart attack fell 10 percentbetween 19 87 and 1990.

But a small percentage of men who ride long distances and/orride very often experience sexual problems that can be traced to their bicycle's hardseat.

In the first study of its kind, reflexology has shown clear effectiveness againstpremenstrual syndrome. Reflexology involves manual manipulation of key reflex points- especially nerve endings in your feet, which correspond to specific body parts andsystems. (See pages 108-109 in Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide for moredetailed information on reflexology.) WOMEN WHO UNDERWENT A TWO- MONTH REFLEXOLOGY PROGRAM HAD 46-PERCENT MILDER PMS SYMPTOMS THAN WOMEN GIVEN PLACEBO REFLEXOLOGY. Los Angeles researchers found that women who underwent a two-month reflexologyprogram had 46-percent milder PMS symptoms than women given placebo reflexology Thereason this works may be because reflexology helps to normalize the adrenal hormonesreleased during stress. These hormones are known to increase in the premenstrualperiod. Source: Brain/Mind - Bulletin of Breakthroughs, March 1994.

The scene of this incongruity is Ellis Island, where a museum exhibit depictedtraditional medicine and folk remedies from all over the world, as brought here bythe flood of immigrants early in this century. The exhibit displayed modern examplesof how these ancient practices are being used today-demonstrating the continuedpopularity, if not the emerging scientific validation, for modern forms of old-worldtreatments. A couple of self-proclaimed "quackbusters" wrote letters of complaint. The displaywas promptly (and somewhat mysteriously) shut down. But this is a public facility,and the exhibit was popular and noncontroversial. Even worse, a book offered forsale by a private concessionaire in the museum gift shop was suddenly pulled from theshelves. The book singled out was our Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide! So now they're attacking books along with vitamins and herbs. A couple of self-proclaimed "quackbusters" wrote letters of complaint. Thedisplay was promptly (and somewhat mysteriously) shut down. One of the quackbusters is a well-known enemy of alternative therapies. We don'tknow what motivates him or his allies. Perhaps it's misguided zealotry Perhaps it'sself-interest. Perhaps there is some need to defend the pharmaceuticalestablishment. We're accustomed to seeing the constitution trampled when it comes to our rightto disseminate information on alternative medical practice. But in a museumassociated with the Statue of Liberty? Yes, folks, this really happened!

It began on May 10, 1994,when the Ellis Island Museum opened an exhibit entitled "Immigrant Health Traditions"in six historic dormitory rooms on the third floor of the museum. Ellis Island wasthe entry point for some thirteen million immigrants to the United States between1892 and 1924. Now the facility is run by the Statue of Liberty National Monument,which in turn is part of the National Park Service. The island was opened as a museumand rapidly became one of New York's most popular historic sites. Now even the "huddled masses " have to toe the AMA line. The Immigrant Health Traditions exhibit depicted the wide and varied range oftraditional health care practiced by immigrants of that period-everything fromleeches to litchl nuts. It featured herbal medicine, acupuncture, and folk remediesfrom ethnic traditions the world over. The last room of the six-part exhibitdemonstrated how many of these old-world health practices survive today in the formof "alternative" medical and therapeutic practices. On display were the covers ofrecently-published books, used to convey a sense of the continued popularity of manyof these techniques. No claim was made that these treatments are preferable toconventional medicine, or even that the practices depicted were valid for their own time and culture oforigin. "The treatments presented should be viewed in an educational context andshould not be substituted for the advice and treatment of a physician or otherlicensed health professionals" read some of the introductory text. Certainly afair statement. Enter one Victor Herbert, a self-proclaimed "quackbuster" who hasbeen waging a high-profile campaign against alternative medicine since at least 1982.Herbert visited the museum on June 5th and went into action: "This room of quackbooks is home-grown U.S. fraud" says a letter written by Herbert and addressed tothe superintendent of the museum. (The letter was obtained through a Freedom ofInformation Act request, and the author's name was deleted by the Park Service in theinterest of "privacy.") The"quack books," according to Herbert, included books byAvery publishing and the World Health Organization. Among them are: Natural Healing from Head to Toe, Foods that Heal, The Doctor's Book of Home Remedies,The Complete flook of Homeopathy, Smart Nutrients, and Third Opinion. This lastone earns the description, "the international cancer quackery Mafiadirectoryl"in Herbert's letter. Herbert's primary attack is A1ternative Medicine.-The Definitive Guide, compiled by The Burton Goldberg Group and published by FutureMedicine Publishing (which also publishes this newsletter). According to Herbert, this book, which was sold in themuseum gift shop, is "organized quackery's 1993 encyclopedia of frauds representedas legitimate remedies." "Organized quackery?" Sheesh. There was no mention of the380 medical practitioners who contributed to this extraordinary compilation ofinformation. But Herbert's analysis is that, "either you have a quackery mole onyour staff or you have been conned, possibly by former U.S. Congressman Guy Molinari,now Staten Island chief executive, who used his Congressional office [one of hisaides was in the pay of organized quackery] to promote some of the most viciousfraudulent cancer 'therapies' which ever came down the pike.." Substitute"communism" for "quackery" and we're back in the '50s listening to Joe McCarthyranting about communist spies under every barrel-naming names. There was no mention of the 380 medicalpractitioners who contributed to this extraordinary compilation of information. Here's another gem from Herbert's letter: "I am stunned that the National Park Service and the Ellis Island Foundation were conned into giving their imprimatur of credibility to home-grown U.S. health frauds, which rip the American people off for $25 billion/year while maiming and killing them." With rhetoric like that, it should be easy to dismiss Herbert's letter as the ranting of someone who is sadly out of touch with trends in health care throughout the world. Unfortunately, Herbert is not alone in his zeal to attack our right to make our own decisions about health care. The museum received one other letter of complaint (also unearthed by the Freedom ofInformation Act request, and also with the signature deleted), dated June29th. The writer, believed to be an associate of Herbert, admitsto having assisted the FBI in "formulatingways to prosecute those involved in healthfrauds." So the popular exhibit evoked only two letters of complaint, each from aprofessional "quackbuster" rattling his saber against imagined conspiracies. AnnBelkov, Superintendent of the Ellis Island National Monument, answered the originalcomplaint on June 30th with a letter that listed various institutions consultedin putting the exhibit together. They were no less than Albert Einstein College ofMedicine, American University, Boston College, Howard University, Mutter MuseumCollege of Physicians, National Museum of Health and Medicine, New York BotanicalGarden, NewYorkAcademy of Medicine, Smithsonian Institution, United States Departmentof Agriculture, and United States Public Health Service. Are these places wherethe "International cancer quackery Mafia" is hiding out? Just think-in the museum of the Statue of Liberty our most treasured symbol of freedom, a book has been banned! Beikov's letter contained a very well-reasoned explanation of what should have beenobvious to any objectivevisitor: She explained that the exhibit pre-sented the various practices in a totally non-judgmental way and that the final room was intended to help thevisitor trace the old-world practices to theirmodern alternative counterparts. She quoted a text panel from the exhibit:Úquot;Public interest in all aspects of personal health, including spiritual harmony andmental focus as well as nutrition and exercise, has produced volumes of scientificand popular literature.quot; That's where the matter should haveended. But on July 5th, Ms Belkov announced that the last room of the exhibit wouldbe closed and a new ending for the exhibit would be designed. And then, on July7th, an inter-office memo proclaimed that the museum bookstore, a privately-runconcession, would pull, Alternative Medicine: the Definitive Guide from theshelves. Just think-in the museum of the Statue of Liberty, our most treasured symbolof freedom, a book has been banned! For a store to do this by the Statue of Liberty National Monument strains credibility to the breaking point Despite a pending Freedom of Information Actrequest, no documents have been obtained that explain the reversal of policy or thedecision to cave in to the two complaints. The bookstore acknowledges that the bookwas pulled "as per your request ... until we are further advised from you." So muchfor the free press. Maybe now it's time for us to analyze. It's not hard to imaginewhat economic and political forces could be driving repression and the banning ofinformation. Some external pressure must have changed the superintendents mind on thestatus of the exhibit. Even a private museum can't close a popular, runningexhibit without suffering condemna- tion, irrespective of the merits of the exhibit'scontent. Museums that shut down controversial displays make national news. Andbanning a book by any store, museum or otherwise, is enough to get the attention ofcivil libertarians nationwide. For a store to be directed to do this by The Statueof Liberty National Monument strains credibility to the breaking point. What isreally going on here? One thing is clear: someone or some groups believe that certain books contain things we should not know. Why? Perhaps they believe thatinformation, if allowed to flow freely, will cost them money. The American CivilLiberties Union of Washington State and the People for The American Way haveexpressed their concern. They are consulting with our lawyers, along with otherattorneys from a diverse group of professional civil liberties associations. These groups care not only about freedom of speech, but about freedom of your medicalchoices as well. Future Medicine Publishing has only just begun to investigate thistravesty. Our lawyers continue to press the Freedom of Information Act request andare pursuing other investigative avenues as well. But regardless of the legalimplications, our real goal is to insure that information about alternative medicinecontinues to be available to the people who need it most. One thing is clear: someone or some groups believe thatcertain books contain things we should not know. We know we will succeed,because information wants to be free.

A NEW ANTICARCINOGENIC SUPPLEMENT: MAGNESIUM PEROXIDE FOR OXYGEN ENHANCEMENT Magnesium peroxide, new on the scene, takes its place among supplements helpingour cells to more oxygen and thereby to better health. This kind of supplement isespecially beneficial to anyone who is a fast-food consumer, doesn't exercise,drinks (even moderately), smokes, uses drugs (even those medically prescribed), or isunder excessive stress. (Is there anyone left?) Any of these tendencies contributesto oxygen deficiency and/or cell destruction, and cell-destruction sets the stage forcancer and other degenerative diseases. But we also know how difficult it is tochange lifestyle habits. There are many roads to Rome, however, and a high-oxygenenvironment may be initiated with a product called magnesium peroxide. Magnesium andoxygen-producing constituents are merged into a matrix and further enhanced by theaddition of a vitamin C/ bioflavonoid complex. When ingested orally, the bond isbroken on contact with stomach acids, releasing active oxygen. These nutrients add tothe healthful balance.

LACTOBACILLUS HAS POSITIVE HEALTH EFFECTS Studies show that viable yogurt alone or yogurt with fiber can be of benefitto your colonic environment.Source: Journal of Nutrition, Jan 1994, 124(l):18-23. Editor's note: Food history reveals that societies that have enjoyed good health almost alwaysinclude,a fermented product in their daily diet. "Viable" yogurt signifies the presence of live, friendly bacteria, so yogurt should not be pasteurized after the fermentation process. In fact, federal law dictates that yogurt can only be so named if pasteurization precedes the fermentation process. Not all states follow this ruling, however. (Check with your local FDA office.) Another viable-yogurt bottleneck is the use of stabilizers and emulsifiers (tapioca and cornstarch are examples), which have been reported to inhibit access of friendly bacteria in the intestine. One portion of viable yogurt daily or one to two tablespoons of liquid acidophilus after every meal is highly recommended for general health improvement. SOUR PICKLES, NOT SWEET Dill or sour pickles contain three calories an ounce; sweet pickles, thirty calories an ounce. All, however, contain about 300 milli-grams of sodium per ounce. So go for the dill or sour variety-but watch your salt intake for other meals on days you indulge in pickles.

Donald Angeletti, MD, of WestCaldwell, New Jersey, related the following case history: "In November,Fred, 43 years old, came to see me with cancer of the colon. He was tired, verytired! He had lost 25 pounds and was so lacking in energy that he finally had tostop working. "I put this patient on shark cartilage." A CAT scanrevealed a lesion in the right lobe of his liver. His oncologist hadadministered chemotherapy. Well, lesions on the liver are not usually responsiveto chemotherapy. "I put this patient on shark cartilage. By February, theliver mass had shrunk by 50 percent, and Fred regained 10 of the 25 pounds lost,in spite of the chemotherapy that had weakened his immune system. He had enoughenergy to return to work. "The specifics? Fred took 80 grams of sharkcartilage, four times a day, applied rectally. Shark cartilage willwork only if the body is saturated with it. A multivitamin helped toimprove Fred's appetite. He will probably have to continue using sharkcartilage forever, but he will be monitored to see if the amount can bedecreased. If the scan still shows shrinkage three or four months from now, wewill decrease the amount gradually-with a watchful eye." Editor's note:Beware of the shark cartilage capsules that are permeating the marketplace. Theprocess of pulverizing, which creates heat, can destroythe protein strain of thecartilage and cause denaturing. For serious problems, large quantities of sharkcartilage are imperative. Recommended amounts are about a gram per two poundsof body weight, so an average of 100 capsules would be necessary where need iscritical. Liquid vials make much more sense than capsules-they work faster andare more potent. One vial is the equivalent of 80 to 100 grams!That's why Dr. Angeletti used liquid vials. Five very significantconstituents have been identified in shark cartilage, some of which areselectively cytotoxic-attacking the toxic enemy like air-to-air missiles. Keepin mind, too, that shark cartilage can work for many blood or lymph disorders,including cardiac, breast, and brain problems. It has even been shown to behelpful for inflammation.

CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME Exercise to relieve and prevent pain If your work involves computers, hair styling, sewing, or any activityusing repetitive work with your hands or arms, you are at risk for entrapmentand compression of a nerve in your wrist. Resulting symptoms are numbness,tingling, and severe pain. The problem is identified as carpal tunnel syndrome. Those who have it know how debilitating it can be. Certain exercises are helpful, including wrist stretching: Place the thumb ofyour right hand on the top of your left wrist, thumb pointing toward the elbow,and curl your fingers around the outer part of your left hand. This will supportyour left hand. Move the supported hand, flexing and extending it (up and down)as you press your thumb into your wrist. Move your thumb slowly across yourwrist, pressing into the tendons of your wrist, as you continue to flex andextend it. Perform this stretch three times. Repeat as often as needed. Thefollowing rubber band exercise is preventive-it helps to increase the strengthof tendons and muscles in your hands and fingers: Place a rubber band aroundyour fingers. Open and close your fingers ten times, two to three times a day.Increase the number of times you do this as your fingers becomestronger. Also increase the rubber tension of the band to add resistance. Source: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: Prevention & Treatment, ANon-Surgical Drug-Free, Approach, Kate Montgomery.

FIBROIDS Nutrient regimen fights fibrolds Are you worried about developing fibroids? Here are some things to avoid: A high-sugar diet (because sugar depletes B-complex nutrients, which inturn impedes your ability to process and inactivate estrogen, a fibroidpromoter). Caffeine and alcohol (because they deplete nutrients and disrupt liverfunction). Nutrient fibroid fighters: Choline-1000-15000 mg. Inositol-1000-5000 mg. Methionine-500-750 mg. Beta-carotene-25,000 IU Vitamin C-1000-3000 mg. Bioflavonolds-500-1500 mg.

SEXUAL PERFORMANCE Nasal spray can interfere with sexual performance Nasal spray does not affect a man's sex drive-that is, his desire forsex-but it can affect the ability to get an erection."Sometimes it makesthe penis wilt,"says Perry Nadig, MD, urologist and clinical professor ofurology at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. Nasalsprays contain a substance phenylephrine (also known as neosynephrine). This isthe same substance used to reverse prolonged erections. "So we know that itinterferes with erection."Phenylephrine derives from epinephrine, which weused to call adrenaline, the "fight or flight" chemical secreted bythe adrenal glands when we are anx- ious or afraid. The spray works byshrinking blood vessels that are swelling the sinuses, helping you to breathemore easily. Since the sub- stance also shrinks blood vessels throughout thebody-including those of the penis-it can have an adverse effect on erectileresponse. (This effect is only temporary.)

"Those who consume high-fiber diets or take antioxidant supplements may behealthier than those who do not, for reasons that have nothing to do with thediet or the supplements.

DRUG HELPS PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS [OH, REALLY] Hip fracture incidence increases over the long term with the use of a drug It's not easy to be a good researcher, mainly because many studies areflawed. One example involves a drug prescribed for women who have (or are atrisk for) osteoporosis. Research has shown that this drug does inhibit boneresorption, and that's good-bone density will be preserved. But, although thereis a very modest increase in bone mass after two years of treatment, hipfracture incidence increases in the third or fourth year with the use of thisdrug. The drug has other side effects, too. Among them: it contributes to theincidence of microfractures because of the decreased bone turnover. The drugis also very costly. A new study appeared in the medical journals confirmingthis drug's ability to retard bone loss. But the study was terminated after twoyears! If it had been continued for a longer period of time, surely the resultswould have matched those of research that had been done previously, showingthat, in the long term, there was more risk than benefit. Physicians readingthis article would have no way of knowing that the results would have beendifferent had the study been continued. The drug in question is etidronate, andwe bring this to your attention because it is a widely prescribed medication.There are far better ways to preserve bone integrity.

One is prospective; the other isretrospective. Retrospective care looks back at why you got sick. Prospectivecare looks ahead to prevent future afflictions that might present themselves ifyou don't do something now. The following advice is prospective. If you're on the pill Include the following foods to offset nutrient losses incurred: Organ meats-from range-grown animals (for B complex vitamins, includingfolate, vitamin B 12, and vitamin B6) Brewer's yeast and soybeans (for additional B6) Asparagus and spinach (for additional folate) Fermented foods such as tempeh (for additional vitamin B12) Almonds and whole grains (for magnesium) Green leafy vegetables (for calcium, magnesium, and vitamin C) Raw cabbage, raw broccoli, and red peppers (for vitamin C) If you want better calcium absorption Among the factors influencing calcium absorption are foods ingested in thesame meal. Foods that enhance the absorption of calcium are fatty fish, eggs,butter, and liver. Foods that diminish the absorption of calcium are sodas,unleavened bread, and milk. So two people with the same calcium intake willabsorb different amounts of calcium if one is enjoying scrambled eggs forbreakfast, salmon salad for lunch, and liver and onions for dinner, while theother has cornflakes and milk for breakfast, drinks a Tab midmorning, has ahamburger and a Coke for lunch, another soft drink in the afternoon and/or witha dinner of beef stew, and consumes pita pouches or unleavened bread on a dailybasis. Both diets offer calcium of equal quantity, but the amount of calciumutilized will be very different. If you want adequate Vitamin D Vitamin D is hard to come by in the American diet.

Our culture places a very high value on human life and health. We spend enormousamounts of money on health care, we have the world's most advanced medicaltechnologies, we've conducted the most sophisticated medical research. You'd thinkthat by 1994 we'd be good at taking care of ourselves. And yet we're aII stumblingthrough the dark ages of health care. For every "miraculous" cure, immunization, ortreatment that's been introduced over the course of this century, there is a wholenew class of degenerative and systemic disease that the medical establishment appearspowerless to control. Even more alarming, diseases once associated with much olderpatients are moving down into the not-so-old age categories. Cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, diabetes, even fatigue-all haveorigins in environmental factors (with few debatable exceptions). Some of thesefactors, such as air and water pollution caused by industry and transportation, havebecome an integral part of our economy. One could argue (although I would disagree)that the economic and cultural benefits from these polluting activities have beenworth the adverse health effects. But large-scale environmental pollution is only one of many factors. Considerthe food pollution that is routinely a part of the SAD (Standard American Diet). Asif the environmental pollution that finds its way into our food supply isn't badenough, we go on to deliberately add contaminants known to be deadly. Meat is the worst offender. Even without contaminants, there are compellingreasons to be careful when consuming commercial meat products: Oxidized saturated fat After three decades of media misinformation about fat, the conventional wisdom isthat saturated fat is bad, whiIe unsaturated fat 's good - or at least okay. You cantrace it back to the margarine and cooking oil commercials of the '60s. And eventhough advertisers were forced to broadcast retractions when their claims of cardiachealth-giving properties from polyunsaturates were shown to have virtually noscientific basis, the myth persists. In reality, nearly all naturally occurring fats can be healthful and all can bedeadly. The difference is not the degree of saturation but the degree of heating,aging, and oxidation. It's the sizzle, not the steak, that makes the fat deadly. That sizzle is a free-radical factory, turning natural fat into billions of chargedparticles ready to wreak havoc on your own lipid-management systems. There's no way around this one-grilled, blackened, seared, or even well-done meatshould be off limits. Meanwhile, some progressive nutritionists are recommendingthat meat be well cooked to help break down residues of artificial hormones andantibiotics used to raise the animals. Meat Is The Worst Offender Cholesterol. This is still an area of widespread misconception. Cholesterol has its goodside, and if this unique fat isn't burned during cooking or oxidized during storage,it's nothing to worry about. We know that the cholesterol you eat is generally notthe cholesterol that may end up in your arteries. The problem with meat is not thecholesterol itself, but certain amino acids. Meat is high in methionine, which isnormally metabolized by vitamin B6 and other nutrients plentiful in fresh organmeats. If we consumed the organ meats with the rest of the animal, there would be noproblem. But most of the time the lack of these nutrients allows methionine to turninto homocysteine, a substance shown to be toxic to artery walls. The cholesterolbegins to accumulate after the homocysteine-induced damage begins. (Thiswidely-accepted theory is explained in more detail in Digest #I.) Calcium and osteoporosis Other amino acids from meat degrade into ammonia, which in turn results in asignificant amount of calcium being excreted. If calcium isn't readily available, itis pulled out of bone tissue. The long-term result is a drastically increasedpropensity to osteoporosis. One counter measure is to eat more of the animalincluding digestible bones. Another is to go heavy on very fresh leafy greenvegetables, free of pesticides and herbicides, with lots of available calcium. Neither strategy is very common. Additives - four main categories of contaminants: Antibiotics, Penicillin, tetracycline, and related antibiotics are used virtually withoutregulation in raising livestock. There's no need to wait for the animals to getsick-a subtherapeutic" dose is routinely included with their food. This preventsdisease and wipes out large classes of natural intestinal microbes. For reasons thatare still not clear, the use of subtherapeutic antibiotics increases growth rates,especially in the overcrowded conditions this technology has made possible. The abundant use of antibiotics has also produced strains of bacteria that areamazingly resistant. The genes that carry the coding for this resistance cansometimes be transferred to the microbes responsible for human diseases. There'slittle question that antibiotics, especially tetracycline, are showing dangerousaccumulations in our agricultural environment. Penicillin-resistant bacteria areable to destroy penicillin. But tetracycline-resistant strains generally reject thetetracycline, returning it to the environment. These substances are considered drugs for human use - you need a prescription tobuy them. But farmers can use them almost indiscriminately as long as they complywith withdrawal times before slaughter. This rule, however, is difficult to enforce. For more on the problems with meat, see "Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide" p 171 Hormones Diethylstilbestrol, or DES, is a synthetic form of estrogen commonly used topromote growth in livestock from the 1950s until it was banned in 1979. DES was alsoadministered to more than three million pregnant women. The ban was only possiblewhen it was found to be clearly linked to vaginal cancer and other very seriousproblems in the recipients' children. Not only has enforcement of the DES ban beennotoriously lax, but other estrogen-containing hormone products have remained in use. Without the benefit of the tragic human ìtesting" that highlighted the dangers ofDES, these other products enjoy a strong market. An estimated 99 percent of allcommercial feedlot cattle are now implanted with a hormone pellet! An estimated 99 percent of all commercial feedlot cattle are now implanted with a hormone pellet! This environmental estrogen has been shown to be a crucial player in thedevelopment of cancer, osteoporosis, menopause, and even PMS, as reported in theInternationaI Journal of Health Services (I 990, 20:277). There are significantgaps in our knowledge here. But considering the power of the meat and drugindustries combined, it's doubtful that answers will come quickly or easily. Preservatives and colorings We've known for a generation that nitrites are extremely carcinogenic, yet theiruse in cured meats persists. A recent study in Cancer Causes and Controls reportsthat children who eat more than 12 hot dogs per month have nine times the averagerisk of contracting childhood leukemia. Other articles in the same issue link hotdog consumption to brain tumors. Even the fathers' consumption of these foods beforeconception was found to be a risk factor. These single food-specific results suggest other socioeconomic dietary healthlinks at work. But the message is clear-high-risk additives are widely used, and theFDA's assessment of acceptable risks might be very different from your own. Pesticides DDT has been banned for decades, but we are still exposed through airborneexposure from foreign sources. And other insecticides and herbicides have taken itsplace. When we eat meat, we are putting ourselves at the top of a short food chainfrom feed grains to livestock to our own fatty tissue, in which measurable residuesof DDT can still be found. Chlorinated hydrocarbons, the general class of chemical that includes manypesticides, is easily stored in fat. So, meat remains one of the most common meansof transportation for poisons to find their way into your body. Rachel Carson's words from her 1962 book, Silent Spring, still ring true: "Ascrude a weapon as the caveman's club, the chemical barrage bas been hurled againstthe fabric of life." How tragic and ironic that Rachel Carson died of breast cancer! Rachel Carson's words from her 1962 book, Silent Spring, still ring true: "As crude a weapon as the caveman's club, the chemical barrage bas been hurled against the fabric of life." How tragic and ironic that Rachel Carson died of breast cancer! Is there any hope for getting meat and poultry cleaned up? For raising awarenessabout these hazards? For research organizations such as the National CancerInstitute with its two-billion dollar annual budget to proclaim the perils of theseadditives and contaminants? Samuel Epstein, MD, speaking at the American Association of NaturopathicPhysicians at their 1994 annual convention in San Diego, said: ìIn all the vast amount of money that NCI [National Cancer Institute] has spenton the dietary studies, and ACS [American Cancer Society] has spent on the role ofdiet, there hasn't been a single dollar spent on the role of dietary contaminants." You don't have to look far into the composition of the boards of directors of NCIand ACS to discover major conflicts of interest. Pharmaceutical manufacturers,chemical companies, big (polluting) industries, and major media are all wellrepresented. It should not be a surprise that the official line from NCI is thatonly 2 to 3 percent of all cancer in the U.S. is the result of industrial productsand environmental pollution, while they estimate that 4 percent is the result ofoccupational exposure. On the other hand, NCI acknowledges 30 percent from smoking. What causes the other 63 percent? You decide! Meanwhile, the NCI spends one billion dollars per year on research, attempting tounravel the inner workings of the living cell. It's good stuff, and they've achievedimpressive new depths of understanding. But researchers who seriously believe thatthis will ever result in a cure for cancer are few and far between. Only 2.5 percentof the NCI budget goes for ìavoidable exposure "and none of it for looking at foodadditives. Perhaps you have seen the documentaries on TV revealing that standards for meatinspection have not changed in 87 years; that we can't see, smell, or touch thebacterial contamination; that glass, hair, pieces of bone, fecal material, and metalshavings have been found in meat; that 9,00O Americans die each year fromcontaminated food. Death. Final. What about the hundreds of thousands sufferingfrom arteriolosclerosis and breast cancer, now theorized to be related, at least inpart, to toxin-carrying cells in our food? The FDA goes vitaminbashing instead ofusing that money and energy to clean up this mess. I'm sure your stomach turned as mine did as I watched these films and saw the pusfrom animal sores pour out all over the meat-cutting table, and then witnessed howother meat, as it was sliced, came in contact with the pus. And my brainflip-flopped as I pondered the news that babies are born with antibiotics in theircells before a pediatrician ever administers the child's first prescription for the drug. What to do? Is it reasonable to expect the NCI to recognize that cancer isalmost totally preventable? All we really have to do is: - Keep carcinogens out ofour food and environment - Educate the consumer about these findings - Identifydestructive foods and cooking/processing styles that result in carcinogenic products - Educate the consumer about the importance of supplements as long as ourfood and environment are not safe. "You're dreaming," I hear you say. And you're right. The political will, thepopulation of educated consumers, and the access to unbiased research simply aren'tthere. To be sure, there are technical controversies to be worked out at every turn. One would think that's how a two billion-dollar budget should be used. The inescapable conclusion, from a personal health perspective, is simply toavoid meat. And yet, among all the cultures of the world, there is none that is orhas been traditionally totally vegetarian. Animal protein is important for humanhealth. Meat can be good for you. When free of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics,harmful bacteria, and additives, very lightly cooked or raw, it can be the mainstayof a healthful diet. But such meat is largely unavailable in North American culture,and its production is incompatible with a modern urban life-style. I'll see you in the organic produce section. GOOD MEAT IS AVAILABLE! No drugs or chemicals. Not even antibiotics. No pesticides or herbicides. Purefood. Pure water. Don't you wish you could have grown up in such an environment? Or perhaps raisedyour children this way? An uncontaminated setting Is hard to come by in today'sworld, but that's exactly how Coleman's animals are raised in an effort to supply uswith top-quality, safe meats! Maybe that's why Coleman provides the number onebest-selling natural beef in the United States-with an 80-percent industry marketshare. What about pleasing your palate, you ask? The scores are high here, too:Coleman meats rated a gold medal in numerous taste awards (including Monde Selectionin Europe and Chefs of America in the United States).

These potatoes,we've been warned, contain dangerous-even lethal compounds. The food industry hascome up with a solution: a sprout inhibitor, namely isopropylN-(3-Chlorophenyl)-carbamate, referred to as CIPC. According to researchers at Cornell University, CIPC may contribute yet anothertoxin on the dinner plate. CIPC is now used on 90 to 95 percent of stored potatoes. It not only helps to avoid sprouting, but also prevents shrinkage, blackening, andsusceptibility to bruising. Does that sound like something you want to consume? After treatment, the skin of the potato retains twenty times more of the toxicresidue than the pulp. Source: Cornell University Press Release, Cornell Study Finds, July 8, 1992. Editor's note: One conclusion is to avoid the commercial potato skins sold atfast food places. But should you peel the potatoes you cook at home? Potatoes are anextremely nourishing food, provided they are eaten with the skin! It appears thatthe answer to the dilemma is to seek organic potatoes. Keep in mind that if enoughpeople ask for a particular product, the vendors will eventually comply. BUTCHER BLOCK FORBLOCKING BACTERIA Surprise! Innocent-looking plastic boards for cutting foods in your kitchenmake comfortable homes for bacteria, unlike wooden cutting boards or butcher blocks. It seems there is a natural bactericide in wood that is protective, totally lackingin the plastics. Once again, we demonstrate that natural is better. According to studies done at the University of Wisconsin, pathogens thrive onplastic but disappear on wood. Salmonella, listeria, and E coli did not survivewithin three minutes of application on a wooden board. This was not the case withthe plastic boards. Even cleaning the plastic boards with hot water and soap did notget rid of the bacteria, yet wiping the surface of wood proved to be sufficient.Source: Science News, 1993, 1439(6):84-85.

Well, notexactly-frozen broccoli is usually packaged with more of the florets, the tender budsof the plant. The stalks have less beta-carotene than the florets. When you preparefresh broccoli, a portion contains both the stems and the florets. When you preparefrozen broccoli, the serving is comprised of the florets only. The darker the buds, the more nutritive value. Source: Bioenergy Health Newsletter, Sep 1994. Route 3, Box 121, Murray, KY42071. $24 Annually. 1-502-753 2613.

Certain animals mimic adultaddictive behavior, and so they are used for studies. Once alcohol is introduced toSyrian Golden hamsters, they voluntarily consume a fairly large and steady quantity. Furthermore, this species-has been shown to respond favorably to the same drugs thatappear to reduce human alcoholic craving: lithium carbonate, bromocriptine,buspirone, and zimelidine. When a natural substance is shown to have significant value in reducing theSyrian Golden hamster's craving for alcohol, it's worth taking notice. The naturalsubstance is kudzu and its derivatives, daidzin or daidzein. Kudzu, or Radixpuerariae, is a traditional Chinese herb that has had medicinal uses for centuries. It's a fast-growing vine now common throughout the American south. The treatment of alcohol abuse has been one of the traditional uses of kudzu inChina since about 600 A.D. It has also been used against flu, fever, dysentery (orany other overacid condition), and for snake and insect bites. Kudzu is available inone of two forms. Kudzu root starch comes in 3.5-ounce packets in a pebble or powderform. Dilute one teaspoon in one cup of cold water and stir until translucent. Addto teas, soups, cakes, or puddings. Or purchase in tablet form, comprised of kudzuroots and flowers, and take two tablets two or three times a day between meals.(Combine with ginger root and citrus peel in small amounts to enhance the effects.) In a laboratory test conducted in 1993 at the Center for Biochemical andBiophysical Sciences and Medicine at Harvard Medical School, it was found that dailyinjections with an extract of kudzu lowered alcohol intake by an average of 56percent. The hamsters tested were offered a free choice-a placebo or a solutioncontaining 15 percent alcohol (ethanol). The dosage of kudzu administeredcorresponded to about 3.6 ounces for a 150-pound human. The extract daidzein, whichis a further refinement of kudzu, had a similar effect at approximately one-sixth thedosage. Traditional western medicine isn't likely to incorporate any of this researchinto practical treatment for years. Don't expect this protocol to be part of generalpractice until it has been thoroughly studied and the active ingredients isolated (asa pharmaceutical product). Meanwhile, if you or someone you know might benefit fromthis herb, the herbalists should have kudzu in their arsenal of tools 'just as theChinese had for centuries.

DETOXIFICATION:A FIRST STEP Serafina Corsello, MD, Director of the Corsello Centers in New York City andHuntington, NY, offers first-step advice on detoxification. Toxicity is a word that has become part of household language. "While Rome is on fire, most politicians play the lyre' - of medical control,that is, ignoring issues we alternative physicians have been screaming about foryears. Meanwhile, our toxic environment accelerates aging, causes permanent damageand DNA mutations, and is responsible for disease states from allergy to cancer. "Toxicity is a word that has become part of household language-from NASAscientists to school board members to the seventh-grader doing his homeworkassignment. Most people, however, don't really know what toxicity is all about andhow it can pervade every cell in their bodies. More importantly, people don't knowthey can do something very simple about the toxic soup we live in-to protectthemselves on a personal level. "A patient and her husband complained of constant fatigue, incessant headaches,and general malaise. At first, I was confused because this couple had been doing allthe ërightí things for 30 years-from abstaining from 'junk-food, cigarettes, andalcohol to growing their own food, using organic farming techniques. Theirafflictions just didn't seem to fit their lifestyle. When I learned they lived neara major highway, the reasons for and the solutions to their problems were obvious. "The cause: Fumes from the highway were a constant source of contamination fortheir home-grown crops and, ultimately, their livers. Toxic poisons displacenutrients, contributing to weak and ineffective foods. The soil itself can belikened to a poorly fed mother delivering a twelfth child. We now know that smalldaily exposures have more devastating effects than exposure to sudden, one-timeblasts. "The resolution: A simple detoxification program, considering the fact that mostof the toxic substances go through your digestive tract. You can block some of theseresidues if you have bowel movements two or three times a day-as most vegetarians doand as our evolutionary ancestors did. Primates eliminate after every meal-an idealprocess for avoiding internal contamination. "The first step in the detoxification program involves a morning 'cocktail'consisting of fiber and vitamin C. Place a teaspoon or more of your favorite fibermix in a glass. (My favorite contains 80 percent organic flaxseed fiber and 20percent pectin.) Add about I teaspoon (formulas vary) of vitamin C powder equivalentto about two to three thousand milligrams in the ascorbate form (that's two to threegrams)-in two ounces of juice for taste. (The hardy can eliminate the Juice.) Addeight ounces of pure water. Drink before breakfast. Toxic poisons displace nutrients, contributing to weak and ineffective foods. "If your bowels are sluggish perhaps because of overweight-slowly increase thequantity of ascorbate until you have a gushing, cleansing bowel movement that expelsthe 'ëcrudí that has accumulated for years. This is called adding vitamin C to boweltolerance. "Buy a good lactobacillus supplement, and take the amount indicated on the label(no harm in even doubling that amount) every day. The lactobacillus ëgood guyíbacteria have a natural antibiotic effect and help to begin the process ofdetoxification. Caution: Abrupt consumption of fiber by a digestive system not accustomed to such bounty may cause adverse reactions at first. If this happens, back off for a day or so, and then start again with diminished amounts, building to the recommended dosages gradually. "If you have any chronic condition, proceed very slowly. If you have intestinalbleeding, active Crohn's disease, or any other serious stomach or digestive problems,please refer to your physician. "Until you get your detoxification program in action, you may want to start bydrinking a large glass of warm water or herbal tea upon awakening. This helps toremove mucus and toxic residues that accumulate on the surface of your digestivetrack, otherwise absorbed with your breakfast. Keep in mind that your digestive system is a large ecological field. The villi(tiny hairlike structures that reach out to absorb nutrients) in your smallintestines can, if stretched, cover an entire football field. Be good to them!"

BRAIN TUMORS Vitamins C and E during pregnancy protect children from brain tumors A report from the Children's Cancer Group (United States and Canada) shows that amaternal diet that includes vitamins C and E inhibits the formation of carcinogenicnitrosamines. Nitrosamines are compounds that develop from the ingestion of nitritesand nitrates, and can lead to brain tumors. Nitrites are used as a color fixative inthe multibillion-dollar-a-year cured-meat business. They impart a blood-redness toprocessed meats such as bacon, bologna, frankfurters, deviled ham, meat spread,potted meats, spiced ham, Vienna sausages, and even smoke-cured tuna fish products. Nitrates come from vegetables grown in soils with nitrate fertilizers. Nitrates turninto nitrites on exposure to air. Source: Cancer Causes and Control, Mar 1994, 5(2):177-87. Editor's note: The amount of vitamin E generally recommended is 400 IU. VitaminC reqtiirements vary with individuals and should be taken to "bowel tolerance," astaught to us by Robert Cathcart, MD, of San Mateo, CA. Cathcart advises that we takejust enough to avoid causing a bubbly stomach. For some people, one or two gramssuffice; for others, more than 10 grams daily are necessary before reachingtolerance. If taking large amounts, buffered or ester-C is recommended. CANCER Bladder Cancer Help for bladder cancer with megadose vitamins A total of 65 patients with bladder cancer were enrolled in a random study. Onegroup was given vitamins in the low RDA amounts; another group was given 40,000 unitsof vitamin A, I 00 milligrams of vitamin B6, 2,000 milligrams of vitamin C, 400 unitsof vitamin E, and 90 milligrams of zinc-far in excess of the RDAS.

Childhood Cancer Consumption of cured meat related to childhood cancer The association between cured meat consumption of pregnant women and children wasexamined in relation to childhood cancer. Five meat groups (ham, bacon, or sausage;hot dogs; hamburgers; bologna, pastrami corned beef, salami, or lunch meat;charcoal-grilled foods) were assessed. Maternal hot-dog consumption of one or moretimes per week was associated with childhood brain tumors; for children, eating hotdogs one or more times per week caused the same association. Among children, thecombination of no vitamins and eating meats was more strongly related to brain cancerthan either no vitamins or meat consumption alone. Source: Cancer Causes and Control, Mar 1994, 5(2):141-8. Colon Cancer Fiber and vegetables protective against colon cancer Evidence suggests that diets high in animal fat or red meat may increase the riskof colon cancer, whereas high intake of fiber or vegetables may be protective. Intake of red meat has most often been shown to be a stronger risk factor than totalfat intake. Source: Cancer Research, May 1, 1994, 54(9):2390-7.

Adverse role of sugar in colon cancer One hundred nineteen colorectal cancer patients were interviewed about theirpersonal dietary habits using a questionnaire concerning the frequency of consumptionof 70 foods and beverages. An equal number of control subjects were randomlyselected from the lists of general practitioners during the same period andinterviewed with the same food frequency questionnaire. The risk of colorectalcancer increased nearly threefold for the highest level of consumption of foods witha high content of refined sugar. An inverse relationship was revealed for thehighest consumption of raw and cooked vegetables. Source: Nutrition and Cancer, 1994, 21(3):233-46.

Most fats are mixtures of all three types but are groupedaccording to the most prevalent. Saturated fat remains solid at room temperature. Saturated fats are inexpensive, have a long shelf life, and don't break down duringfrying. Fats included in this category are animal fats such as lard, butter, andbeef fat as well as some tropical fats. Polyunsaturated fat is liquid at roomtemperature and is derived from plant oils such as corn, sunflower, and safflower. -Monosaturated fat is liquid at room temperature and clouds at lower temperatures. Olive oil is a common example of a monosaturated fat. Gastric cancer related to whole-milk consumption Increased gastric-cancer risk was found to be related to whole-milk consumption. Research confirms the protective effects of a high consumption of vegetables andfruit. Source: International Journal of Cancer, Sep 9, 1993, 55(2):181-9. Prostate Cancer Lower meat consumption reduces risk of prostate cancer The results of research support the hypothesis that animal fat, especially fat from red meat, is associated with an elevated risk of prostate cancer. These findings suggest recommendations to lower intake of meat to reduce the risk. The role of carcinogens formed by cooking animal fat in the progression of prostate cancer needs to be explored.

Tearing problem aided with multivitamins The tear stability (that is, not too little or too much eye moisture) of 60normal healthy subjects was measured and repeated ten days later. Twenty of theparticipants took a daily dietary supplement of a mixture consisting of vitamins(vitamins A, B 1, B2, B6, E) and trace elements (calcium, iron, manganese). Twentyother participants took only additional vitamin C and so acted as controls. The tearstability of both treated groups increased.

It could do this by simply allegingthat the products contained unapproved food additives. And it could do this even ifthe products had been medically validated to have beneficial use. But no more, FDA,no more! It was a hard-fought victory. With only hours to spare in the 103rd Congress,the House of Representatives Joined the United States Senate in approving, byunanimous consent, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. You, thepeople, helped make it happen! Phenomenal grass roots pressure from every state andCongressional district in the United States, combined with determined politicalleadership by the bill's sponsors, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Congressman BillRichardson (D-NM), contributed to the bill's unopposed passage. If you swallow a single supplement, this bill represents a major victory for you. It's certainly an important conquest for those of us who "rattle" when we leave thetable. As for the natural products industry, a holiday mood pervades despite a fewminor concerns. For the first time, the FDA will be required to notify any individual,establishment, or business in writing ten days in advance of an intended enforcementaction. No more drawn guns and surprise attacks! The bill also benefits consumers by permitting information about conditions ofuse to appear on the label of a dietary supplement, without allowing the FDA tomisbrand the product a "drug." Under the new law, a significant amount of informationpreviously unavailable to consumers may now be at hand for the first time. The billamends labeling provisions by eliminating burdensome, useless, and nonessentialinformation previously required. Manufacturers only need to declare what is actuallyin the product. How pleased Carlton Fredericks and Adele Davis would have been to hear thatCongress now acknowledges the link between nutrients and dietary supplements and theprevention of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and osteoporosis. Howhard they worked to get that message out against a tide of government and mainstreammedical disapproval. And how right they were! Wouldn't Hippocrates have been pleased if he could see the current medicalcommunity and learn that Congress has accepted the fact that consumers want moreholistic consideration of their needs! And wouldn't Linus Pauling rejoice about the recognition, finally, that thenutritional supplement industry is an integral part of the economy of the UnitedStates. The best news is that third-party literature such as books, chapters from books,and newsletters such as the Digest-containing articles and information to help youstay well or get well-are no longer considered "labeling" and so may be used inhealth food stores in conjunction with the sale of a product. The literature doesneed to be separated from a particular product but may be sold from the book sectionsof stores in an effort to educate everyone about nutrients that engender health. We don't mind that the manufacturer cannot make a direct health claim. It's okaythat the label on vitamin C cannot read, "Vitamin C prevents cancer" or that it cannot say, "Vitamin C helps to lessen inflammation or infection.: The good book corner will cite the good studies. And we'll all know the gfood truth about taking supplements for good health.

Unless you're cast in the role of a pregnant woman in a TV sitcom, you'd never thinkof mentioning pickles and yogurt in the same breath. And as for interferon, thatpromising "cancer cure" in headlines a few years ago, what does that have to do witheither? Well, pickles and yogurt do have something in common: They're both fermentedproducts, loaded with living microorganisms. (Or, at least the microorganisms wereliving before the food processors, packagers, and preservatives got their hands onthem.) Do we really want to eat something that's loaded with living microorganisms? Wesure do! These microorganisms help with digestion and elimination. They contributevitamins and enzymes and are natural antibiotics. They're the sacrificial soldiersof your intestine that fight and die for your health. If you eat a fermented foodwith viable bacteria, you have billions of these warriors at your service. Yourintestinal flora is more than just important for good health-it's vital for life. In fact, modern nutritionists are even beginning to view the intestinal flora asan organ In its own right, responsible for some very specific functions in digestionand disease-resistance. Among the most important roles, intestinal flora isresponsible for: production of digestive enzymes; adaptogenic control (normalization)of constipation and diarrhea; counteracting lactose (milk sugar) intolerance, by itsassociation with lactase which breaks down otherwise indigestible milk sugars;intercepting carcinogenic (cancer-causing) substances before they are absorbed,causing them to be eliminated instead of assimilated; destroying tumors in thedigestive tract with anticarcinogens, and probably also by producing enzymes thatdegrade cancer-causing nitrosamines. There's more. Also involved: detoxification, by binding to unwanted metabolitesand causing them to be excreted; immune functions of the intestinal tract lining, byprotecting the surfaces of intestinal mucous membranes; suppression of undesirablebacteria by maintaining an antibacterial and antifungal environment; reduction of badbreath by replacing organisms responsible for unpleasant odors with neutralorganisms; reduction of flatulence (intestinal gas) by breaking down sugars(including lactose) that promote and are consumed by certain bacteria; cholesterolcontrol, by promoting normal absorption of dietary fats and facilitating eliminationof unwanted cholesterol before it is absorbed; production of additional supplies ofvitamins and other trace nutrients. Synthesis of digestive enzymes help supplement the natural food enzymes in otherfoods that are destroyed by cooking. Suppression of candida, as well as a number ofother intestinal disorders, is accomplished by replacing undesirable intestinal florawith desirable microorganisms. Now let's shift to Kyoto, Japan, three hundred years ago. Kyoto was alreadyfamous for its pickled delicacies. One species in particular, which grew only in therich soil and clear water of the Kamigamo River region to the north, developed areputation for exceptional medicinal effects. This was the suguki, a white vegetableresembling a turnip. It became a favorite of the clergy and nobility. Eventuallythe popularity of fermented suguki pickle spread to all the people of Kyoto, whodeveloped a reputation for health and longevity. Back to the present. The suguki pickle remains an important part of traditionalKyoto cuisine, and today the life expectancy of the Kyoto resident is several yearslonger than that of the average American. When researchers at the Institute Pasteurde Kyoto took a close look at the fermented suguki pickle, they found a subspecies ofLactobacillus, called Lactobacillus brevis subspecies coagulants, or Labre. This microorganism is notable for its ability to stimulate the natural productionof interferon! Interferon is composed of-small proteins produced by various kinds ofcells as part of the defense mechanism against viruses and virus-related diseases. Modern nutrition is beginning to look at disease differently It's not always theconsequence of an undesirable parasite or other foreign enemy invader, but can alsobe the result of the absence of a necessary factor. Supplementation with Labre couldhelp to insure that your intestinal flora is maintained at peak condition. Itprovides the most basic factors necessary for optimal health in our very non-optimalenvironment. Source: Labre, available from L & H Vitamins, 1-800-221-1152. 30 for $21.20; 60for $41.50. THE NATURAL SLEEP SEDATIVEOF THE PACIFIC The kava plant, piper methysticum (which has nothing to do with java or coffee),is a member of the pepper family Its root yields a group of fat-like substancescalled kavalactones, which have a significant pharmacological effect. Used as both atraditional remedy and ceremonial intoxicant for thousands of years throughoutPolynesia, Melanesia, and parts of Micronesia in the South Pacific, kava is amuscle relaxant and a mild tranquilizer. In small amounts, the beverage preparedfrom its root produces euphoria; in large amounts, relaxation, lethargy of lowerlimbs, and eventual sleep. It does not impair mental alertness and encourages arather cheerful and friendly attitude. If it's been used for thousands of years, why discuss it in our segment onSupplement Updates? Because it is new on the scene in most health stores today! Pacific Islanders have traditionally used kava to treat everything from epilepsyto toothaches. In New Guinea, scrapings of the root are chewed to relieve sorethroats. Other cultures have used kava in various ways against headache, menstrualproblems, tuberculosis, asthma, urinary disorders, gonorrhea, and even to provokeabortion by inserting kava leaves vaginally. In traditional use, the root of the kava plant is pounded, ground, or chewed(with kava ceremonies often calling for the chewing to be performed by a virgingirl), and the substance is mixed with saliva or water to make a drink. Thepsychoactivity of this drink is described as both complex and subtle. Captain Cookobserved that the members of his crew who experimented with large doses experiencedan effect similar to that of opium. Kava is not hallucinogenic, however. The kava "high" appears to be much more mellow than that achieved from alcohol,and socialization appears to be enhanced rather than 'jeopardized. Because of theseadvantages, alcoholics on the islands have been known to cure themselves of theiraddiction with the use of kava. Kava has suddenly become the focus of attention because it offers a far morenatural alternative to frequently-prescribed drugs such as valium-having thepotential for achieving similar results without the known side effects of commonlyused drugs. (Unlike valium, for example, kava usually leaves the consumer alert.) Diseasemay becaused bytheabsence ofa necessaryfactor Kava mayturn out tobe anattractivealternativeto alcohol,tobacco,and otherdrugs One of the primary uses of kava is to promote sleep. With tryptophane off themarket due to serious damage caused by the tainting of one manufacturer's product,there is a strong demand for a sleep-inducing substance that is safe and natural. Kava has also been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety In two recentdouble-blind, placebo-controlled German studies, this effect was significant, asmeasured by standardized tests after only one week of use. Is kava safe? The fact that kava has been used for centuries by people all overthe South Pacific with remarkable absence of negative side effects or addictionspeaks well for its safety. Another new study shows enhanced performance on word association tests with theuse of kava. And, in 1992, it was demonstrated that kava extract exhibitedneuroprotective activity against ischemic brain damage in test animals. Pulverized kava root can be found in health stores. Keep in mind that whileaqueous kava extracts may have some value, it is the fat-soluble kavalactones fromkava resin that have the primary psychoactive action. It's interesting to note that the world's most popular drugs are stimulant drinkssuch as coffee, tea, and cola. Considering the nature of our society, there may be alegitimate place for a sedative drink among these, especially one that's safe andnatural and keeps us clear-thinking. In addition to the important medical role thatcan be foreseen for this pepper plant root, kava products or beverages might turn outto be attractive alternatives to alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs that find theirway into our lives.

Almost all whole foods start with potassiumoutweighing sodium by a far larger ratio. But after the processors, packagers, andcooks have finished their work (not to mention what may be added at the table), thisrelationship has been drastically altered, and in many cases reversed. Without an ample supply of potassium in your plasma between your cells, your cellmembranes are restricted in their ability to remove sodium from the cell's interior. If sodium can't be removed, many processes don't run at full power, and the sodiumcan back up in the cell like cars on a freeway on a rainy day. It takes potassiummolecules on the outside to remove that excess sodium from the inside. Note what happens to the potassium-sodium ratio as food becomes processed: Potassium & Sodium Content of Intact &Disturbed Foods in milligrams/ I 00 grams food (100 grams is approximately 3 1/2 oz, or the amount of food equal to the size of a closed fist) Potassium Sodium Flour, whole 360 3 White Bread 100 540 Pork, uncooked 270 65 Bacon, uncooked 250 1400 Beef, uncooked 280 55 Corned beef 140 950 Haddock, uncooked 300 120 Haddock, smoked 190 790 Cabbage, uncooked 390 7 Cabbage, boiled 130 230 Horseradish, raw 564 8 Horseradish, prepared 290 96 Asparagus, raw 310 2 Asparagus, canned 250 200 Peas, fresh 380 0.9 Peas, frozen 135 115 Peas, canned 96 236 Peas, canned, served with 1/2 oz salted butter 99 374 Adapted from Everything You Wanted to Know About Potassium but Were Too Tired to Ask, by Betty Kamen (Nutrition Encounter, Novato, CA 94948). See the problem? Even haddock, a salt water fish, naturally contains nearly two-anda-half times as much potassium as sodium. But when turned into an easily-preserved tasty treat, the ratio of the two minerals becomes almost four to one in the wrong direction. If you continue with quick-fix pudding, instant coffee, jiffy-fast supper, and super swift-quick dinners, you can look forward to an early, quick, swift, instant death.

The dentists insist, however, thatmercury amalgam is perfectly safe, and they have their own list of researchpapers to prove it. Why the discrepancy? It's like vitamin C: Only 50 milligramsa day prevent scurvy, so that's the level set for "minimum daily requirement."Nothing to do with the amount necessary for optimal health, which may be 10 or100 times as much. Flip the equation around for mercury. A large dose thatproduces an acute toxicity response is acknowledged to be dangerous. But whatabout a very small level of contamination over a lifetime? "If you can't proveit, it must be safe" appears to be the official line from the American DentalAssociation (ADA). It's not easy to prove an effect that takes a long time tomanifest itself to the point of obvious recognition, even if deadly. Mercury, leaking from your amalgam fillings, wreaks havok with the nervous system, immune responses, and with normal antioxidant functions-more deadly than arsenic! There's little question about the danger of very small amounts of mercury.Mercury wreaks havoc with the nervous system, immune responses, and with normalantioxidant functions-more deadly than arsenic! But the ADA has quickly movedthe issue from the technical to the political arena. Dentists who replaceamalgam fillings with less harmful alternatives in response to patients' healthconcerns are subject to sanctions. This incredible inertia to change may simplybe the result of150 years of doing things one particular way. To change nowwould be to concede that the entire profession was doing it wrong all that time. But change is inevitable. Read our cover story to learn the truth. Meanwhile,take care of your teeth, and keep the poisons out of your mouth.

So reads an unsigned certificate published anddistributed by one progressive dentist. The intent is for people to bring thismessage to their own dentist as a test. If the dentist won't sign, we knowhe/she doesn't believe that mercury amalgam is safe. If the certificate issigned, you have a weapon to use when amalgam is finally designated as harmfulby mainstream dentists. How dare the patient imply that material used for fillings foe the last 150 years is anything but safe! Some time back, my dentist expected that kind ofstuff from me, and he wouldsimply laugh it off. (I use a different dentist now.) It is not known how muchweight this declaration would have as a legal instrument, but the reactions ofmost dentists to such a challenge from a patient can range from polite rejectionto open hostility. How dare the patient imply that material used for fillingsfor the last 150 years is anything but safe! One would think this long historyof apparently successful use would be strong evidence of mercury amalgam'stotal safety. In the face of mounting evidence ofthe dangers of mercuryproducts, however, the century and a half of use has created an establishedtradition that resists change with astonishing inertia. The fact is that, inspite ofthe pandemic use of amalgam, most dentists and doctors are ignorantabout the level of mercury exposure and its very harmful health implications. Most dentists and doctors are ignorant about the level of mercury exposure and its very harmful health implications Mercury is a simple substance, mixed for dental use on the spot, as needed.About half the finished product going into your mouth is comprised of liquidmercury. The other half contains powdered silver, tin alloy, copper, and zinc.The mixture appears to have the perfect mechanical and chemical properties forthe job of filling cavities. So what's the problem? Mercury is chemicallyrelated to cadmium and zinc, although it is much heavier than the other twoelements. After iron, zinc is perhaps the most important of the trace elements.Zinc can be classed as an antioxidant, largely because it plays a key role inthe enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). This is the primary line of defenseagainst oxidation damage. SOD is an oxygen scavenger, a first step in a processthat is complex but highly protective. Without the protection of SOD, the fatcontent in the thin membrane encircling every cell in your body would beoxidized. This results in the alteration of each cell, compromising itsfunction. Cellular proteins and DNA would be damaged. Enzymes would be"neutralized," shutting down cell respiration-which is essentially the same askilling the cell. Mercury not only damages cell membranes but also affects yournervous system and is generally regarded as an immunosuppressant. Mercurycompromises, inhibits, or destroys the protective activity of SOD and otherenzymes. Bacteria in the stomach and intestine can also convert mercury to this hazardous form It's amazing how a substance like mercury, which is difficult to absorb,can be converted to a form that is easily assimilated-a process that occurs whenyou chew. Methyl mercury is produced by bacteria exposed to the mercury on thesurface of a dental amalgam and is considered extremely dangerous. Otherbacteria in the stomach and intestine can also convert mercury to this hazardousform. There are several mechanisms by which mercury can be released andtransported: Vapor release. The discovery in 1979 that the simple act ofchewing food releases mercury vapor from mercury amalgam fillings rang thefirst alarm bells. This led to the initial series of studies linking amalgamfillings to blood and tissue levels of mercury. Galvanic corrosion is anotherrelease mechanism, especially if two or more different mixes of amalgam are inclose proximity. The slight differences of the two materials can actuallyproduce a measurable electric current, resulting in amalgam ions being releasedinto saliva. When swallowed, a small but significant portion of the mercuryis absorbed. Abrasion (scraping or rubbing). Physical abrasion of thefilling is a third route that mercury can take from the filling to your tissue.Abrasion also removes the protective film surface. Chewing, bruxism (teethgrinding during sleep), eating very hot or acidic food, and even tooth brushingall contribute to abrasion. One study demonstrated that amalgam fillings insheep led to rapid deterioration of kidney function, among other disorders. Thestudy was widely publicized by the television program 60 Minutes in 1990. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) isthe primary line of defense against oxidation damage. Another study revealed the following amounts of mercury vapor released underthese circumstances: 35 micrograms (per cubic meter) with unstimulated emission;70 micrograms released when you chew food or gum; 270 when you brush yourteeth; 500 after a hygienic cleaning; 600 after having your teeth polished withwater spray; and 4,000 when teeth are polished dry, with no water! To whatextent does the amount of mercury present in something as small as a toothfilling represent a real hazard? In laboratory tests, cell death has beenreported at concentrations from 0.2 to 12 parts per million. That's between13.6 and 816 milligrams, distributed evenly over a 150-pound body. Inreality, mercury is likely to accumulate in certain organs, allowing amuch higher concentration to develop from a smaller supply. Nerve cellssustain damage from mercury at only 0.1 parts per million, and in one study,cells were destroyed when exposed to only 2 parts per billion of methylmercury for only one hour. That's 0.002 ppm, or 0.14 micrograms in 150pounds of tissue! Don't Use Hot Water Rinses Rinsing your mouth for one minute can increase theevaporation rate of mercury from your fillings by a factor of 1.7 when thewater temperature is increased from 95 degrees to 113 degrees (F). Source:Scandinavian Journal of Dental Research, Dec 1992, 100(6):354-60. So you see that mercury amalgam fillings are essentiallytime capsules that release a continuing supply of mercury in more than amplequantities to maintain trace concentrations in your body. Mercury has beenimplicated in multiple sclerosis, in reduced immune cell (T-lymphocyte)activity, birth defects, miscarriages, and a host of neurologicaldisorders. One study suggests that amalgam mercury may be a factor indepression, excessive anger, and anxiety-because mercury can produce suchsymptoms, perhaps by affecting the neurotransmitters in the brain.2 (Aneurotransmitter is a chemical agent that carries signals from nerve tonerve.) Female dental assistants are less fertile than unexposed controls.3 Andhow ironic that mercury can play a major role in the deteriorating processofgingivitis and periodontal disease.4 Are dentists paying attention? Mercury can play a major role in the deteriorating process of gingivitisand periodontal disease. Are dentists paying attention? Aninteresting research project looked at the smoking habits of people withoutmercury dental fillings as compared to those with amalgams. The amalgam grouphad 2.5-times more smokers per group than the non-amalgam group-a highlysignificant difference. The results of a study reported in Scandinavia indicatethat removal of amalgam can be very helpful in reducing lesions of the mouth.The stimulus causing the lesions? Mercury from corroding amalgam fillings! The American Dental Association (ADA) had always maintained that no mercury evercame out ofan amalgam filling. Confronted with evidence to the contrary, theorganization eventually acknowledged that an "insignificant" amount ofmercury is in fact released over time. In 1987, the Swedish Health Boarddetermined that amalgam was unsuitable for use as a dental filling materialdue to its toxicity. Our ADA described the finding as "bogus." Then in 1988, theUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified removed dentalamalgam scrap as a hazardous material. The most important polluting materialsare the heavy metals, with mercury near the top ofthe list. Detailed guidelinesfor the special handling of this toxic waste must by law be available in everydentist's office. There's a hefty fine for allowing a scrap ofthis stuff to godown the drain or into the solid waste stream. But it's perfectly okay to storeit in your mouth! It'sinteresting to note that in 1989 Denmark followed suit with a ban on theimportation, sale, and use of all products containing mercury. Enforcement ofthis ban, however, has not yet occurred due to "procedural" problems. Thepressure is on, however. The largest manufacturer of mercury amalgamfillings in Europe has closed its doors. Mercury is likely to accumulate in certain organs, allowing a much higher concentration to develop from a smaller supply. Some dental associations have takenthe position that any dentist who removes amalgam fillings for the purpose ofeliminating a possible source of mercury toxicity is guilty of a "breach ofethics." But note that it's still perfectly okay to remove an amalgam fillingto replace it with a more expensive one for cosmetic reasons. Yes, that'sright. This is from an advertising campaign waged by the Alaska State DentalAssociation in 1989, attempting to head off the tide of public concern aboutmercury amalgams. It's also interesting to note that mercury fillings have beenbanned in Germany for pregnant women. Now the ADA has retreated to theposition that "there is no scientifically documented evidence of a cure orimprovement of a specific disease due to the removal of amalgam...." Fine. Thedamage is nonspecific, incurable, and the accounts of improved health, rangingfrom subtle to dramatic, are all nonscientific. Suppose I accept that. Does thatmean I still want the stuff in my mouth? Not after I have looked at the studies. Public awareness and legislative action march on, despite the ADA. In Decemberof 1993, Jeneric/Pentron, Inc., a manufacturer of amalgam, agreed to include aconsumer warning label with their product. This was in response to a suitbrought against them under California's toxicity warning laws. The label reads: Warning: This dental office uses amalgam filling materials which contain andwill expose patients who use them to mercury, a chemical known to the State ofCalifornia to cause birth defects and other reproductive harm. Please consultyour dentist for more information. Are dentists taking this warningseriously? In the face of compelling evidence, some practitioners willadapt to the new knowledge, while others will continue to fall back on thecentury of ignorance. Meanwhile, California is the only state demanding thatmanufacturers of mercury-amalgam fillings note on its labels that highlevels can cause damage. I called a dozen dentists in California and asked ifthey impart this information to their patients. None said they did! Is yourdentist sharing this information with you? And there's one more fundamentalproblem. Although we address dentists as "doctor" in this country, they reallyaren't trained as doctors-not in the common understanding of that awareness.Their area of training is limited. Not so in other parts of the world, wheredentistry is a specialization of medical practice, on a par with otherspecialties. Dentists in Europe earn the title of doctor-but "biologicaldentistry" in the United States is still considered to be out on the fringe.

Filament Brush Recommended For Gum Health The HolisticDental Digest suggests that today's high-tech can be carried too far. "If aregular toothbrush can cause abrasion ofthe root surface and recession ofthegums, think what you can do with one that adds that sort ofvibration energy tothe equation," reports the Dental Digest. It recommends the Rota-Dent, which hasfilaments rather than bristles. The filaments are finer than human hair. EachRota-Dent tip contains 5,600 filaments in it-a tip that has a diameter of about1/4 inch. This gives them the ability to clean without abrading. The shape ofthe tip eases itself in between the teeth and under the gum line to removeplaque thoroughly and gently. Source: Holistic Dental Digest, Sep-Oct 1994.

How to Correct Gum Disease For healthier gums, prepare a mixture of one part salt and six parts bakingsoda. Place ingredients in blender and mix for thirty seconds. Place incontainer. Wet the tip of your index finger, place in salt and soda, pat a lightcoat on your gums. Start with the upper outside of your gums, then the inside ofthe upper, followed by the lower outside of the gums, then the lower inside.Spit out excess-two or three times. Some of the salt and soda will remain toremove the plaque. After fifteen minutes, rinse. You can follow this procedureby placing a small amount of aloe gel in the palm of your hand. Blot your brushlightly in the gel and gently pat on your gums, using the same sequence as thesalt and soda mix. The aloe will kill parasites on contact.

Editor's Story: How Betty Kamen Avoided Root Canal Therapy At age twelve, a kind uncle took me to a dentist for my first visit, and tono one's surprise I had a dozen teeth drilled and filled. By age 25, I was veryfamiliar with root-canal therapy. As a senior citizen and spokesperson forhealthful living since that time (I have very definitely walked my talk over thedecades), the only part of me that has not responded to optimal nutrient intakehas been the man-made, nonliving dental insertions. They continue to break down. The only part of me that has not responded to optimal nutrient intakehas been the man-made, nonliving dental insertions. They continue to break down. A few months ago, I was in agonizing pain-the kind one thinks only deathcould possibly relieve. I went to a local dentist who told me I had a largeabscess under a decayed filling-so large, in fact, that I would have to go to anendodontist immediately. Don't even go home, he cautioned. I would be cut,drained, medicated, root-canalled, and unable to function for at least a week. Well, I did go home, where I decided to use the testing laboratory that stood mein good stead over the years: ME! I lined up every supplement bottle in thecupboard and fridge-at the ready for ingestion each half hour, with theexception of vitamin C, which I took every twenty minutes in one-gram doses. Iate nothing but The Soup-a detoxifying recipe loaded with nutrients (see belowfor recipe). By day two, I felt incredibly better. On the third day, I went backto the dentist to confirm my suspicion that the abscess was gone. The nurseshovered around, hanging on my every word in wonderment at the "miracle" as theytook turns inspecting my mouth. The dentist slithered into the background, nocomment. The initial cause of the problem did not go away. But I know that acontinued healthful lifestyle and daily detoxification program, as described byDr. Corsello in the last issue and in this issue of the Digest, will help toprevent the nasty symptoms from surfacing again. The Soup Toss a little of each of the vegetables on hand in yourrefrigerator into a pot of filtered water. If possible, try to include manygreens, such as carrot tops, beet tops, kale, and parsley. Even better, includedaikon leaves, daikon root, burdock, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, and garlic.Bring to a boil; then simmer for several hours. Drink only the broth on thefirst day. Consume broth and vegetables the next two days. During this three-daydetoxification program, eat nothing else, but take your supplements in greaterquantities, including acidophilus and, especially, large amounts of vitamin C.Continue beyond three days if necessary. Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed In Dr. George Meinig's excellent book, Root Canal Cover-up Exposed, hedescribes the work of Dr. Weston Price and the critical information that wasliterally buried over the years, thereby contributing to undermining the healthof so many people who seek dental treatment. Dr. Weston Price's and the critical information that wasliterally buried over the years, thereby contributing to undermining the healthof so many people who seek dental treatment. Vitamin C, one gram every 20 minutes, helped eliminate the abcess Dr. Meinig, a founding member of the American Association of Endodontists(root-canal therapists), explained that, while dentists fill the root canal,there are still over three miles of inaccessible, untreated tubules from whichgerms can pour toxins into your body. These poisons can affect your heart,kidneys, lungs, eyes, stomach, brain, and countless other body tissues. Whatmost dentists are not aware of, Meinig says, is that the bacteria causing theinfections are not in the root canal itself but are organisms that become lockedin the tubules that make up all of the dentin of teeth. When they escape fromteeth, the germs involved act much like cancer cells, which metastasize to otherparts ofthe body. In other words, root-canal-filled teeth always remain infectedand thus threaten health and life. So what's a person to do? We all know thatprevention is best and that the factors that create dental caries can bemodified by diet. Here is one example: Dentin isn't as hard as enamel because itis composed oftiny hollow tubules that contain a fluid carrying nutrients tokeep teeth healthy. But the fluid flow in the dentin tubules is actuallyreversed when a person eats sugar! The flow has even been shown to reverse whensugar is injected under the skin ofthe abdomens of test animals. So sugardoesn't have to touch teeth at all for its presence to result in a severe amountof tooth decay. "It is time for dentists and patients to realize that the decay of teth isnot just a local disturbance but is actually a systemic disease that involvesthe whole body." Needless to say, other good-health factors are involved, too, explained indetail in Meinig's book. But what if you are already a root-canal victim? Not toworry! If you keep your immune system in tip-top shape, you'll be able to keepthe germs under control. Heroic efforts will be needed, however, should yousuffer an accident or stress. Just don't be fooled into complacency because yourdentist told you that you have "totally healed." It is difficult for yourdentist to believe that you are still harboring infection when he sees whatappears to be the healing of large bone areas. As Dr. Meinig concludes, "It istime for dentists and patients to realize that the decay ofteeth is not just alocal disturbance but is actually a systemic disease that involves the wholebody."

The thumbs indicated classic osteoarthriticsymptoms: bony swelling, plus creaking and cracking and pain when moved. Awareof the conventional medicine normally prescribed for the condition, Smith choseto seek an alternative course of treatment. After research in his local library,Smith decided to undergo a series of acupuncture treatments. The six-treatmentcourse, administered by Anne Strozier of Silver Spring, Maryland, appeared to besuccessful. Smith's pain was relieved, and he emerged with a feeling ofwell-being. His practitioner, however, was not totally satisfied. She wascurious about what recent occurrence had caused the thumb problem. About halfwaythrough the acupuncture treatment, Smith obtained a copy of AlternativeMedicine: The Definitive Guide. On page 536, Hal Huggins, DDS, of ColoradoSprings, Colorado, described the relationship between arthritis and dentalamalgams. This suggested a possible cause for Smith's attack. He had a largemercury amalgam come loose. It had been drilled out and replaced with anothermercury amalgam about a month before his thumbs had started hurting. With thehelp of Anne Strozier, he found a Maryland dentist who specialized in treatingpeople with silver-amalgam problems. The dentist replaced the silver fillingwith space-age plastic. Within a few months, the symptoms completelydisappeared, and Smith was able to resume his full physical routine.

This mistake was made for short-sightedeconomic reasons and certainly without a vision of the suffering that it wouldproduce in succeeding generations. While the mistake is one of science, itwas based more on economic demands of the time rather than on scientificresearch." Dr. Huggins has treated heavy-metal toxic patients for 19 years. Hehas developed a list of factors that indicate potential problems and, mostimportant of all, the potential for improvement. "Some of these factors arechemistries," explains Dr. Huggins, "some are symptoms, some attitudinal, somehabits, some environmental. As you can see, it is a broad subject with manyvariables."

According to the Journal of Nutrition (Sep 1994, 124 (9 Suppl): 1747S-1753S), the tenth edition of the Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA) discusses carbohydrates in the context of dietary fiber and digestible carbohydrates, which provide energy. It recommends that more than half the energy requirement beyond infancy be provided by carbohydrates and that a desirable intake of fiber be achieved by consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole-grain cereals. The association between high fiber foods and protectionagainst cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, and diabetes is clear The researchers continue to assert that the association between high fiberfoods and protection against cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, anddiabetes is clear. But, they add, helpful information for consuming a diet highenough in fiber is often confusing and sometimes even erroneous. They remind usthat dietary fiber as well as nondigested starch are the only known dietarycomponents that increase stool weight and promote microflora in the largeintestine, both necessary for good health. Mainstream physicians recommendbetween 25 and 35 grams of fiber daily. Many nutrition-oriented practitionerssuggest even more-as much as 50 or 60 grams for optimal health. When youconsider that five heads of lettuce contain only 6 grams of fiber, and thatfruit is not in the high-fiber category, you realize how difficult it is toget the desired amounts every day. To help your fiber awareness, note thehierarchy of fiber content: Fiber Foods in Order of Fiber Quantity Highest quantity of fiber Whole-grain cereals wheat rice corn barley rye buckwheat millet A little less fiber Legumes peas beans lentils Nuts Seeds Dried fruits Still less fiber Root vegetables potatoes carrots parsnips turnips Even less fiber Fruits Leafy vegetables lettuce cabbage celery As you can see, foods that are highest in fiber are the ones we mush, mash,and mangle before consumption. Whole-grain cereals have more fiber than theircellulose-containing companions; fruit is not exactly a high-fiber food; andleafy greens, although teeming with other virtues, have the least amount offiber in the garden patch. Fruit is not exactly a high-fiber food When whole plant foods have been processed, the fiber is usually leftbehind. Among the most extreme revisions have been the fiber-stripping thattakes place in the production of white flour and sugar. Other foods running aclose fiber-depleting detrimental second include processed white rice, cornflour, corn flakes and other so-called "cold" cereals, pearled barley, molasses,glucose, and maple syrups. Add fruit juices, wines, and even beer (whichcontains fiber-free maltose), and it is obvious that you would have to be on anunusual diet to be totally exempt from consuming processed, fiber-bankruptfoods. Source: B Kamen, New Facts About Fiber (Novato, CA: Nutrition Encounter,1994). Think about what you ate today. Did your meals contain enough fiber? TABLE TALK FIBER NOTES: Although more is better in the case of fiber, more isnot better when you initially start increasing fiber use. Increase gradually toavoid flatulence! One cup of hot Wheatena cereal contains 3.6 grams offiber; One cup of Wheaties has 2 grams. Nuts are good fiber foods. Almondsare among the most stable of nuts and are even more stable than most other nutsonce shelled. A portion of All-Bran contains 30 grams of fiber and offers8.3 calories per gram of fiber. A portion of Rice Crispies contains only 1/5thof one gram of fiber and offers 1,975 calories per gram of fiber. Weingest more food when its fiber is removed. Fiber offers protectionagainst an increase in triglyceride levels in those who are consuming largeamounts of sugar. Answers to quiz: Broccoli. Just because a food is crispy (celery)doesn't mean it has a lot of fiber. Don't be fooled by crunchiness. Also notethat if a food didn't "grow crispy," it's not in your best health interest. Pears have almost twice the fiber content of an apple. Figs have considerablymore fiber than prunes or dates. Two dates contain 1.2 grams of fiber; two figscontain 4 grams. Brown rice. Surely you knew the answer to this one! Fibercontent is almost always in the husk of a grain-the part that's sheared away inprocessing. Too bad beans have the general reputation of being a "lowly"food in this country. Not only are beans high in fiber, but they have othernutrition benefits, too. Chicken or beef? Yogurt or milk? These are trickquestions! There is absolutely no fi ber in any animal product! A portion of Rice Crispies contains only 1/5th of one gram of fiber and offers 1,975 calories per gram of fiber.

This helps to impede the reabsorption oftoxic substances into the liver and ultimately into the bloodstream. The toxins,unfortunately, come from the food and water we inadvertently ingest. Bowelcleansing is a very essential first step. (For details ofthis first step indetoxification, see Alternative Medicine Digest, issue 4.) Serafina Corsello,MD, Director of the Corsello Centers in New York City and Huntington, NY,continues her advice on detoxification. The liver is the central seat of detoxification. "Let's now discuss what happens, primarily in our liver, when the toxicsubstances find their way back into this very important organ, the central seatof detoxification. For the record, food and water are not the only sources oftoxic substances entering our system. Our respiratory tract and our skin are twovery important ports of entry as well. " In the previous issue, we told you thestory of the couple who got lead poisoning from the organic food raised in theirbackyard because of its close proximity to the highway. Let me tell you nowabout Marilyn, a young, intelligent housewife who was poisoned by her own newhouse. "Most insulation, presswood, and building materials contain formaldehyde,a formidable toxic substance that accumulates in our fatty tissues and finds itsway into the liver. For years, Marilyn's liver had to contend with unhealthfuleating habits. Now the toxic invisible fumes were more than her body couldhandle. "By the time she came to me, Marilyn was a universal reactor. This meansshe could have a host of unpredictable reactions ranging from crying spells toanger to migraines at the slightest provocation. Even a smell, including myperfume, could set her off. Universal reactors are very unfortunate people whohave exhausted most of their liver detoxification resources. They are dead ducksin a very dangerous pond. Most insulation, presswood, and building materials contain formaldehyde, a formidable toxic substance that accumutates in our fatty tissues and finds its way into the liver Bowel cleansing remains a veryessential first step of a detoxification process. "Marilyn changed living quarters, but to no avail. Even with all theknowledge she had acquired, unless she rebuilt lost cellular reserves in herbody, the slightest insult would assume the impact of an atomic war. "We startedwith bowel cleansing, added the lactobacillus to build the friendly flora, andbegan to build her liver glutathione reserves. Glutathione is a very importantdetoxifying nutrient. Universal reactors are dead ducks in a very dangerous pond "Let's step back for a moment and see what has happened to the liver throughall these wars, which include petrochemical exposure, toxic metal exposure, fastfoods that deplete enzymatic reserves, and the foods that fail to replenishthem. Under desirable circumstances, the liver quickly tries to dispose oftoxicsubstances through Phase One and Phase Two detoxification processes. Phase Onerequires enzymes that are zinc-dependent. Government-run epidemiological studieshave shown that the American diet is grossly defective in zinc intake. "If thisfirst step is not brought to its proper end, the attempted detoxification leadsto the formation of even more deadly toxic substances. One of these is chloralhydrate, which causes a toxic brain syndrome and further impairs liverfunctions. "Let us assume that we are lucky enough to have the zinc enzymes inplace and move further down on Phase One detoxification. This time we needmolybdenum-rich enzymes, another casualty of modern agricultural practices. "Through all this, we need lots of magnesium, which is a cofactor in 300 or morecellular biochemical reactions, including liver detoxification. Most Americandiets are very poor in magnesium, the major sources of which are vegetables andalmonds. "If our luck continues and we are still left with the need to get ridof toxic substances, here comes Phase Two, called Conjugation Phase-a moresophisticated process that requires enzymes such as glutathione. Glutathione iscomposed of three amino acids: cysteine, glutamic acid, and glycine. Whencombined with selenium, this very important enzyme gives birth to glutathioneperoxidase, which protects us from our own internal toxins that burn holes intoour fatty tissue-including tissue in liver and brain. "Sress produces more free readicals and also depletes zinc, vitamin b6, magnesium, and other important nutrients." "Most American diets are defective in selenium. Is it any wonder that thereare so many more universal reactors today than I ever saw when I first came tothis country 32 years ago? As you have already surmised, the reasons aremultiple. The environment has become more polluted by the day. Our lack ofrotation crops fails to replenish the soil. Pesticides not only add to the toxicload but also displace the nutrients that would serve to protect us. "Stressalso plays a role by producing more free radicals and depleting zinc, vitaminB6, magnesium, and other important nutrients. Stress not only depletes nutrientsbut also makes more demands for the antioxidants dependent on the nutrients thathave been excreted. Anyone working in this field for as long as I have knowsvery well that well-nourished cells help us to have a higher tolerance forstress. "Harmful formaldehyde enters our environment every time we bring clothes home from the cleaners. remove bags and allow clothes to air before placing in the closet." "In Marilyn's case, the question ofwhich came first, the chicken or the egg(the stress or the nutrient deficiencies), would have been a purely academicquestion. Marilyn was in such bad shape that she needed rebuilding, which becamea painstaking two-year process of infusions of glutathione and otherantioxidants, lots of love and understanding, change in diet, and a prayer hereand there. So please do not get to this point-it is not fun. Remember the good,sound American saying: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Morethan for any other condition, this saying must be kept in mind for the universalreactor, especially since there are cases that are so far gone that the patienthas not been able to be brought back to a normal, healthy life. Your antioxidant mix should contain glutathione, n-acetyl cysteine, and taurine. "In Part One ofour discussion, we recommended bowel cleansing as the first step of anydetoxification program, plus vitamin C and minerals. The ascorbate recommendedalso contains selenium, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and more. Now we suggestthat you add the next step in the program. This includes eating lots ofvegetables, rich in antioxidants. If you can, please buy organic produce-it'ssafer. Also, be aware of fumes, not only radon, but the ever-presentformaldehyde that enters our environment every time we bring clothes home fromthe cleaners. Remove bags and allow to air before placing in the closet. This isjust one little thing you can do, but a significant one if you use the drycleaner as much as I do. "I advise taking a good multi-vitamin-mineralcombination, high in magnesium, plus an antioxidant mix that containsglutathione, n-acetyl cysteine, taurine, and more! Of course, those of youalready taking a panoply of nutrients know that vitamin C and the mineralsmentioned are the standby in any supplement program. These are the bare minimumnutrients with which to start a detoxification program. "Definitely use air andwater filters. Next time, we'll talk about why water filters have become anecessity for all of us."' Editor's note: Dr. Corsello, like othernutrition-oriented physicians, is ahead of her time.

Nosugar, sodium, saccharine, aspartame, or fructose in these wonderful MCTcakes. They're made with figs, dates, barley, oat bran, amaranth, psyllium,raspberries, strawberries, and a few other good ingredients, including MCTs(medium chain triglycerides). It's the last ingredient that sets it asidefrom any other good-for-you health bar or cookie. MCTs are specialty fatsmanufactured from high-grade vegetable oils, having unique properties overregular vegetable oils. (Coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and butter containrelatively large amounts of MCTs.) MCTs are not metabolized through your gutlike regular fats and oils but, rather, in your liver, like carbohydrates, sothey are not deposited as stored fat but instead are burned for energy. Body builders and runners have been usingMCTs as a dense source of easily absorbed, rapidly utilizable energy. The importance of vitamin E on overall health and longevity is no longerquestioned. We now know, for example, that smoking reduces blood and tissuelevels of vitamin E and that heart disease, our number-one killer, is associatedwith vitamin E deficiency. MCTs enhance the absorption of vitamin E. Becausethey deliver more energy than glucose, body builders and runners have been usingMCTs as a dense source of easily absorbed, rapidly utilizable energy. A studywas done to determine whether MCTs could be of benefit in the control of bodyweight by reducing food intake. Thirty minutes after consuming MCTs, subjectswere offered a varied self-selection lunch. The result? A significantlydecreased caloric intake in the lunch. The researchers conclude that MCTs canreduce short-term food intake in some individuals. Other studies show thatmore energy is expended when MCTs are part of the meal, thereby promoting weightloss. In cancerous test animals receiving MCTs, there was a marked reduction intumor size. Animal studies show that MCTs do not suppress the activity ofcertain membrane enzymes important for immune integrity, as do other fattyacids. More energy is expended when MCTs are part of the meal, thereby promoting weightloss. Excellent results have been described in many malabsorption syndromes,especially in individuals with gluten-induced problems-that is, those who aresensitive to wheat.

Editor's note: Asthma is theleading cause of disease and disability in children and teens. SerafinaCorsello, MD, recommends a minimum of 25 milligrams of B6 twice a day-but not tobe taken late at night. This nutrient works with zinc and vitamin C to helpregulate antibodies and also functions as a diuretic to diminish allergicresponses. Elimination of wheat and milk from the diet can be very effective inminimizing or even eliminating asthma symptoms. But according to a report in theJournal of Pediatric Child Health (Feb 1993, 29:32-5), health professionals whomanage children with asthma have poor knowledge of what contributes to theillness, such as the use of cow's milk. For more information on asthma and children, see Alternative Medicine,The Definitive Guide, pages 814-815. Allergies Diet and Prolonged Breast-Feeding Prevent Allergies Several studies performed in high-risk babies have demonstrated asignificant reduction in the prevalence and severity of allergic diseases withthe use of dietary and environmental manipulations. It has been demonstratedthat prolonged breast-feeding and the avoidance of cow's milk, avoidance of[commercial] eggs, and avoidance of fish during the first three months oflactation significantly decrease both the prevalence and the severity ofallergic disease up to the age of five years.

Several of the 32 patients showedpartial tumor regression. In one of these cases, the dosage of CoQ10 wasincreased to 390 milligrams. In one month, the tumor could no longer be felt,and in another month, mammography confirmed the absence ofthe tumor. Encouraged,another patient having a verified breast tumor was then treated with 300milligrams of CoQ10. After three months, the patient was in excellent clinicalcondition, and there was no residual tumor tissue. The bioenergetic activity ofCoQ10 may be one of the mechanisms causing the regression of breast cancer. Source: Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Mar 30, 1994,199(3):1504-8.

Vitamin C Helpful for Older Diabetics and Normal People In older healthy and non-insulin-dependent diabetics, the changes in insulinsecretion and action after vitamin C intake were determined.

This enzyme is responsible for the conversion oflinoleic acid to gamma linolenic acid. Many factors interfere with this conversion process.Hence, supplementation of gamma linolenic acid in patients prone to developing eczema avoidsthe conversion process. Patients treated with GLA showed less inflammation, dryness,scaling, and overall severity compared to controls. Source: Clinical Investigations,Feb 1992, 70(2):167-71.

Heart Disease Black Tea, Onions, and Apples for Heart-Disease Prevention Dietary flavonoids, highly concentrated in common foods such as black tea, onions,and apples, are inversely associated with coronary heart disease mortality rates. The moreof these foods you consume, the less chance of suffering from this country's most commoncause of death. Antioxidants, found in these whole foods, are reported to beimportant in helping to keep your immune system in top form. Source: Lancet, Nov 1994,344(8933):1356. Nicotine Addiction Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Helpful for Smokers In addition to advice to give up smoking (advice we all know is so hard to follow),smokers should be counseled to improve their diet. The positive message to eat more freshfruit and vegetables would be particularly helpful. Source: Preventive Medicine, May 1994,23(3):354-61. Parasites Fiber Helps Prevent Parasite Infection Test animals were maintained on a low-fiber (5 percent) or a high-fiber (20 percent)diet in which the major fiber source was cellulose. The animals were inoculated with anintestinal parasite. Animals in the low-fiber diet group were much more likely to becomeinfected than were animals in the high-fiber group. The fiber creates mucus in the gut,entrapping the parasite. Then it travels to the large intestine, where its demise is almostguaranteed. Wheninfected animals on the low-fiber diet were placed on the high-fiber diet for twenty-fourhours, clearing occurred in the lower small intestine. The fiber content of the diet after inoculation determined the infection rate. Wheninfected animals on the low-fiber diet were placed on the high-fiber diet for twenty-fourhours, clearing occurred in the lower small intestine. So, in the case of infections, ahigh-fiber regimen can be of help even after infection has set in. Source: American Journalof Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, Nov 1989, 41:512-20. Editor's note: Cellulose is aninsoluble fiber, the only truly fibrous component of the plant cell wall. An importantproperty of cellulose is its ability to take up water and swell. The sponge-likecharacteristic of cellulose is the explanation for its ability to increase fecal weight.Although not yet totally definitive, there is a correlation between stool weight and freedomfrom disease. By the way, this easily discernible characteristic of waste matter is atelltale sign of health status. Pregnancy Supplements Recommended for All Pregnant Women Recent studies show that, rather than being selective and seeking out a "high risk"population, supplements should be given routinely to all pregnant women because of theirlow cost in relation to expected health benefits. Source: Revue Francaise de Gynecologie etD Obstetrique, Apr 1994, 89(4):210-5. Protein Breakfast Essential during Pregnancy Pregnancy causes women to awaken with a lowered blood sugar level than occurs in thenonpregnant state, so pregnant women are more prone to fatigue and even depression. Whenprotein is ingested, it is broken down into amino acids. The roles ofthe individual aminoacids are many and complex, but among them is the stimulation of hormones that transmitimportant substances from brain cell to brain cell, promoting feelings of well-being, withthe number one priority that of regulating blood-sugar levels. A high-quality breakfastcontaining good protein is essential for pregnant women. Source: B Kamen, Total NutritionDuring Pregnancy (New Canaan, CT: Keats Publishing, 1981), p 50. Editor's note: Eggscontain the highest quality of protein. Egg protein has very high digestibility, whichmeans it is absorbed most efficiently. Since, during pregnancy, there is an increasedneed for proteins of high biologic value that will be metabolized with ease, eggs fit thebill. For greatest nutrient benefit from eggs, they should be fertile and prepared so thatthe yolk is still runny: soft boiled, poached, or sunny-side up. If you are concerned aboutcholesterol, relax. It has never been shown that heart disease is caused by theconsumption of cholesterol-containing whole, natural foods, especially if one is on awholesome, varied diet. Prostate Cancer Preventing Erectile Impotence Considering that it weighs only 15 grams, the ability of the prostate to causemisery as a consequence of bladder outflow obstruction or cancer is astonishing.Each year in the United States, 34,000 men die of prostate cancer, and thedisease is detected in 140,000 men. (Some reports indicate even higher numbers.)It is the most common male cancer and the second most common cause ofdeath fromcancer in men. Between 1980 and 1988, the incidence of prostate cancer increasedby 30 percent. Each year in the United States 34,000 men die of prostate cancer, and thedisease is detected in 140,000 men. The prostatectomy can be done with great safety, but there are two problems.It doesn't get to the cause and there is a 50 percent risk of erectileimpotence. To avoid the problem of erectile impotence, let's avoid the cause.Antioxidant vitamins, such as beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A), vitamin E, andvitamin C, are believed to decrease cancer risk by preventing tissue damage.Over 100 studies have assessed the relationship of dietary antioxidant intake orblood nutrient levels with cancer risk.

It was the worst of times. Nutritional science had long sincediscovered and promoted the importance of exercise, fiber, and fresh vegetables. The yearwas 2000. But the great civilization was plagued with a long list of debilitatingdegenerative diseases, against which the full force of themedical-industrial-food establishment could make only temporary gains. Thescience that had once conquered the deadly infectious diseases was proving to bea blunt instrument against heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Many sufferedfrom allergies. Even dangerous infectious diseases, thought to have been put torest generations ago, were serious threats once again. And yet, in the same location, a few centuries earlier, degenerativedisease had been unknown. At that time, food was sometimes scarce, sometimesadequate. People lived short lives, succumbing to infectious disease or violentaccidents. But they were free of the diseases that were epidemic in modern NorthAmerica. Even those lucky enough to live long and peaceful lives were free fromdisorders that would afflict those living on the same ground, 300 years later. Sparrow was a typical member of this pre-industrial, pre-agriculturalsociety-a society we might call "primitive" but one that represents the sort oflifestyle, environment, and diet for which our bodies were designed. Here's thetale of two centuries. Sparrow wakes when the first trace of daylight is visible in her tinydwelling. Silently, she sets off to check out the best places for new nests.Today there are eggs-small eggs from wild land birds. She is lucky to find thembefore other foragers lay claim. She brings back an even dozen. Eggs for breakfast! Some things never change. People are awake when shereturns, and the eggs, still warm, taste great over acorn meal. The portion issmall, but the nutrients are intact, exactly as they were when this viable eggwas ready to become a young chick. There�s no hot frying pan with smoking butteror sizzling fat, so none of the carcinogens of later centuries are added to themeal. Goodcholesterol is necessary for the production of sex hormones. Nor are the eggs pasteurized-a common practice started shortly after World War II toextend shelf life. The cholesterol in the eggs is free from the oxidative damage ofovercooking. This may be part ofthe reason these women have a high fertility rate; goodcholesterol is necessary for the production of sex hormones. But breakfast isn't very satisfying. The children are turning up theirnoses at more acorn meal. So, after the families ofthe small village have madetheir morning greetings, Sparrow sets off again to find some greens. Many types ofyoung wheat grasses are sprouting all over the other side ofthe first hill. Sparrow plucks a basketful and, on her way back, swings by thehuckleberry bush to add some berries. The children pick out the berries first. The desire for sweetness is partof being human. Even a fetus increases its swallowing actions when sugar isinjected into the amniotic fluid! We have a sweet tooth before we have teeth! The whole family polishes off the sprouts. These tiny blades of grass,loaded with chlorophyll and densely packed with antioxidants, provide the energyboost to get the day's activities underway. The older boys join the men who aregetting ready to fish. Before settling in to make a new batch of acorn meal and finish a largerbasket for sprout-collecting, Sparrow goes on another excursion. It's low tide,so she walks down to the mudflats by the bay to gather oysters. No thought isgiven to the problem of "who's going to watch the kids." In a small communalvillage, if a child needs help (or discipline), it is provided instantly. Shellfish are abundant. Sparrow enjoys a few raw oysters before returningwith a basketful for her friends. She also adds her favorite kind of kelp to useas seasoning for the fish, should there be some for dinner tonight. Although Sparrow would much rather work on her basket, the acorn mealmust come first. The acorns are stored in a large bin next to the house, linedwith special aromatic herbs to repel insects and suppress acorn mold. Nochemical pesticides here! The most nutritious parts, those that tastebest to the sophisticated indigenous palate, are the variousorgans. The men return with salmon, several largeones. When these people eat fish or any other animal, they don't limitthemselves to the white meat. The most nutritious parts, those that taste bestto the sophisticated indigenous palate, are the various organs. The liver isdense and sweet and loaded with vitamins A, D, and Bs. The brains taste goodtoo, and are a great source of iron in addition to B vitamins. The eyes are adelicacy. The heart and spleen are sought after for their special taste. Theblood is good to drink, and the bones are ground up and added to soup. For dessert, there's a root resembling a yam, baked slowly in the coalsof the cooking fire. When dinner is over, there's nothing to throw away exceptfor a few inedible entrails. After dinner, with light fading, stories are told and songs sung-alldesigned to illustrate the importance of behavioral rules and taboos that keepthe population stable and resources balanced. Not all of this lifestyle is perfect from a health perspective. The mensmoke tobacco and spend long hours in the sauna-like sweat houses, breathingbadly contaminated air. Respiratory ailments are common among the men, but theydo not associate the illness with their sweat-house habits. Smoked and dried meats and fish are used as a hedge against timesofscarcity or when traveling. Natural methods are used for smoking, rather thanchemicals. Fruits are sun dried-and they are not coated with sulphites, anadditive that, at best, wreaks havoc with your lungs, at worst, causes death inasthmatics. Sparrow is free from worry about breast cancer, diabetes, and heartdisease. She has no allergies, nor does she know anyone who does. Let's fast-forward a couple of hundred years to the same area, where amodern condo stands. Robin awakens at the same time in the morning by her clockradio, close enough at bedside to offer a toxic exposure. She hits the snoozebutton and, five minutes later, hears the second warning. Now she gets up. Notime for breakfast. A quick cup of sweetened coffee-caffeine to get her going and sugar forblood glucose. Never mind the insulin load. Robin is health conscious, so shegulps down a glass of orange juice before running out the door. It's "frozen,from concentrate." That means it was shipped from Florida and reconstitutedwith water laden with fluoride and chlorine. Chlorine causes calcium excretion.No wonder osteoporosis tripled in the time frame in which our populationdoubled! Respiratory ailments are common amongthe men, but they do not associate the illness with their sweat-househabits. Robin grabs lunch at a fast-food place andmeets a friend for dinner at an upscale restaurant. Once home, she watchestelevision. We all know that an hour of TV doesn't have the same emotional valueas telling stories and singing songs with family and friends. We can learn a lot by contrasting the diets of Sparrow and Robin. Sparroweats a bit less, but most of her food has been freshly picked, freshly caught,or freshly killed. Sparrow and Robin both have a sweet tooth. Sparrow's family went for thesweetest grass sprouts and the freshest sweet berries. Robin has to fight hersweet tooth every minute of the day. Robin's pancreas works overtimemanufacturing insulin to deal with the imbalance of the refined sugar that findsits way into her diet. But it does this on limited chemical budget, withnutrients on short supply.Robin is a canidate for one or more degenerativediseases and like her mother, can look foward to miserable menopause. Sparrowwill have to uneventful menopause (although there might be some ritualassociated with it), and she won't worry about osteoporosis. Not unlike the menin the Sparrow's community, Robin will never know exactly why she has sufferedwith these illnesses. Robin will never know exactly why she has suffered with these illnesses. Robin's body has been set for the same high-nutrient requirements asSparrow's. To see where the problem lies, we would have to zoom in to thecellular level. Aware practitioners understand how this works. Most mainstreamphysicians do not. Robin is also exposed to toxic oxidizers never imagined in Sparrow'sworld: food additives, toxic metals, petrochemicals, drugs, pesticides,synthetic hormones in food, pollution, radiation. Is it possible for Robin to get everything she needs for optimal healthfrom food? Perhaps, if, like Sparrow, she ate just about everything freshlypicked, freshly caught, or freshly killed. She would have to maintain a largesprout garden in her kitchen and a vegetable garden in her backyard. She'd haveto drive to the country to get fruit directly from the orchard and fish directlyfrom the fisherman. She'd need a hot-line to the greengrocer and the organicbutcher so she could respond at a moment's notice to fresh new arrivals. She'dhave to avoid every imaginable prepared food because of added salt andsweeteners. And, of course, she could forget about ever eating in a restaurantagain. Is it possible forRobin to get everything she needs for optimal health from food? In short, it would leave no time for a life! The realistic approach is to usesupplements. Potassium tonics, fiber mixes, antioxidant vitamins, minerals, anda range of adaptogenic supplements are vital to good health if you live in thiscentury and don't want to become a nutritional ascetic. The discovery of vitamins in the early 1900s, their chemicalcharacterization, and our understanding of their functions are aspects of abrilliant chapter in the history of modern nutritional science. Despite ourcurrent knowledge about the subject, inadequate vitamin status abounds. Learn about good supplementation in the pages of the Digest.

Instead, she turned to thenutritional therapy of Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, M.D., and has been cancer-freeever since. What prompts a person with cancer to say "no" to chemotherapy and radiation? As suspicions build today that scientists are misfiring in their battle with cancer, more people like myself are investigating other ways of treatment. One third of Americans are now choosing alternative care, and not just those needing cancer treatment. But if you want to know about cancer, I have a firsthand understanding on why this is so. My own medical experiences opened my mind to alternative medicine. It all began in July 1991 when a tumor on my knee and three moles on my back were surgically removed. The surgeon told me the tumor was merely fatty tissue and the moles were benign. The following month the lump returned to the same place on my knee. But all my surgeon said was this: "It's scar tissue, don't worry about it." In December I was back in his office again because the lump had grown dramatically and it felt hot. No longer thinking it was scar tissue, he operated at once. He told me it was a high grade malignancy, a kind of cancer called histiocytoma. He said he was sure he got it all with his scalpel. But the next day the lab said he had to cut out an even bigger chunk of my knee, which he did, leaving me with a 15 inch scar, somewhat disabled, and in constant discomfort. Two weeks later I sat in the oncologist's office. He glanced through my medical file, then recommended the maximum treatment of chemotherapy and radiation over the next 6 months to kill any remaining cancer cells. He said he wanted to check with other institutions over the weekend for a second opinion. But when I saw him again the next week and asked him what he had learned, he said he had gone skiing instead. When I told him I'd be seeking a second opinion at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and with New York City physician Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, he abruptly stood up and walked out. One of the first shocks I got at the Mayo Clinic was that while my surgeon had said there was no evidence of a malignant melanoma, the Mayo Clinic doctors indicated otherwise. After examining the pathology slides for my moles, they called it "a superficial spreading level 3 melanoma." They also told me, for the first time, what the likely side-effects of chemotherapy for the "histiocytoma" might be, such as damage to my kidneys, heart, and gall bladder. Back home again, my surgeon asked me to visit his office. He "warned" me that I had been the topic of conversation with 15 top cancer specialists and that none of them had heard of Dr. Gonzalez' metabolic-nutritional therapy. They all said I shouldn't waste my time on a New York City "quack." The way the surgeon looked at me would have crushed the hopes of many patients, I'm sure; but when he saw I wasn't convinced, he looked uncomfortable, dropped his surly posture, and changed the subject. He pulled out a report from the National Cancer Institute that said basically there weren't grounds for believing chemotherapy would be effective for my histiocytoma. Yet here he was telling me I should go through with it because alternative treatments were useless. Meanwhile, my knee wasn't working right because the surgeon had removed my patella tendon. Of course nobody told me about this until much later, when I discovered it by reading through my records. Now my knee wasn't strong enough even for me to walk upstairs. I thought about things. I'm 43. There is cancer in my family. My father,grandfather, and great grandfather all died of cancer. With that kind ofhistory, I thought maybe it's time to take a different approach to treatment.When you are diagnosed with cancer, you are introduced to yourself. You find outwhat you are made of. And when you choose an alternative therapy, you findyourself living in a glass house. People watch what you do-they watcheverything-and often with a skeptical eye. In February of the next year, or 7 months after my first office visit for my knee problem, I walked into the Park Avenue offices of Nicholas J. Gonzalez, M.D., in New York City for my first 2 hour appointment. I was reassured to learn that he tapes his office visits for future reference. I suppose I wasn't quite as desperate as many of his patients who come to him bearing prognoses of 2-3 months more to live, after having survived unsuccessful courses of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Still, the results from his analysis of my blood and hair weren't good news. I had a great deal of cancer in my body, most of it in my lymphatic system. I saw Dr. Gonzalez again the next day for 2 hours when he laid out the details of his comprehensive program of metabolic therapy. This is based on the 25 years of research by a dentist named Dr. William Donald Kelley who developed a program featuring nutrition, detoxification, and supplements as a way of treating many degenerative diseases, including cancer. Dr. Kelley described 10 categories of metabolic types. As he saw it, there are 10 different body styles of needing and assimilating foods. Nutritional therapy should be based one's metabolic type, he said. Dr. Gonzalez spent 5 years studying cancer patients in Dr. Kelley's program to be sure it worked. As I drove back home, I thought that maybe more doctors should ask patients about their bowel movements. All my life I have been constipated. If I went once a week, I considered that normal. Now I see how abnormal and toxic that was, how it contributed to my illness. After all, if a body is smart enough to create a disease, then it makes sense that it must be smart enough to cure it, too. "Who do you think you are that you can drink some carrot juice, pop vitamins, do coffee enemas, and get well when there are sophisticated technologies for cancer?" Except they aren't winning the cancer war with these supposed marvels." Sometimes I had doubts about it all. I would say to myself: "Who do you think you are that you can drink some carrot juice, pop vitamins, do coffee enemas, and get well when there are sophisticated technologies for cancer?" Except they aren't winning the cancer war with these supposed marvels. My doubts usually came when I wasn't feeling well or was over-tired. My husband was a strong supporter. "It's a done deal," he'd say whenever he saw me in these funks. He meant that as far as he was concerned, this was the best and only way to whip cancer. That made me able to trudge on. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. The same applies to completing acomprehensive regimen like this one. Just hit away at it one day at a time untilit becomes second-nature to you-which took me about 3 years, by the way.Anyway, the alternative to the alternative doesn't really work. Looking back at the last 40 years of cancer research, it seems like digging in your pocket for a coin that's not there. They've been looking in the wrong place.Somewhere in my healing journey I took on the attitude of this Chinese proverb: "Man who says it will not work, shouldn't disturb man who's making it work." And I thought: until God opens another door, this alternative treatment is the best for me. Perhaps my greatest discouragement comes from the fact that a program like this that works, even though it costs less than chemotherapy, is not covered by insurance. I paid for this all out of my own pocket. The supplements ran me about $400 a month and my 2 sessions with Dr. Gonzalez cost $1800. It was a huge financial burden, yet it was a price I was willing to pay to get well. Of course it meant I had to keep my full-time job as church secretary during this period even though Dr. Gonzalez generally recommends you concentrate your time on healing. Today, after 3 years on Dr. Gonzalez' program, I am nearly cancer-free. According to a standardized blood test used by conventional cancer doctors, I do not have any cancer. But according to the more refined test that Dr. Gonzalez uses, I still have some cancer activity. So I will always have to keep up a nutritional maintenance program. Am I lucky? Yes, I am lucky-lucky to have taken control of my ownhealth care. Lucky to have been introduced to this form of treatment. Lucky notto have burned up my body with chemotherapy and radiation. Let me tell you something a little grim. In the 3 years I've been on thisprogram, I have known many people with cancer who chose chemotherapy andradiation. They are now either dead or on yet another chemo series for arelapse. Yes, I am lucky!-By Cheryl Wilkens EDITOR'S NOTE: No physician can successfully treat or cure all cancers. Be cautious when you consider a practitioner for cancer treatment. On the other hand, the clinical work of Dr. Gonzalez has been so impressive that the National Institutes of Health is now backing further research into his approach. We hope that when the results are announced, they will be presented fairly and accurately and not distorted by the cancer establishment. Making Dr. Gonzalez' Program Work For Me I began to figure out how best I could make Dr. Gonzalez' program work for me. It called for a daily regimen of, literally, 150 vitamins, minerals, and enzymes, starting at 3:30 a.m. I had to do 4 coffee enemas a day, starting at 2 a.m., to help rid my system of the toxins being released as the tumor dissolved. This was to especially help my liver and gall bladder, which would respond quickly to the caffeine and contract vigorously, releasing stored wastes. About once a month I did a special bowel clean-out (Dr. Gonzalez calls it the "clean sweep") using psyllium seed husks and a bentonite liquid. This scrubbed out my colon. Along with this I did a liver flush (using olive oil, apple juice, ortho-phosphoric acid, and other ingredients) to help purify my liver. Both of these procedures took about a week. There were other practices I didn't have to do but that Dr. Gonzalez oftenprescribes to cancer patients. There is a detoxification program Dr. Gonzalezcalls the "purge." You drink a mixture of citrus fruit juices andEpsom salts. This is to aid in the rapid removal of metabolic wastes from mybody. Dr. Gonzalez also has patients do skin rubs, salt and soda baths, mustardfoot soaks, and castor oil compresses-and again, all of this is to drawthe toxins out of the body. I had to start eating organically grown foods and whole grains and only meatsproduced without hormones or antibiotics. Raw vegetables and fresh fruits, freshjuices, especially 8 ounces of carrot juice every day, and no canned, processed,or deep-fried foods-these were also part of my program. I figure that by the end of my first year on the Gonzalez program I had consumed the juice from over 2000 pounds of carrots and an untold amount of apples. I avoided refined sugar out of consideration for my pancreas; I avoided aluminum cooking utensils, as well as aluminum-containing deodorants and lotions. White flour, soybean products, and peanuts also had no place in my diet as part of this program. -Cheryl Wilkens Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing WT01-B17-71IA043-000786-B013-233http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue06/i06-a02.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305103509 text/html 7711HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 10:32:46 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html A Profile of the Gonzalez Intensive Nutritional Treatment Plan for Cancer    [Go to the Table of Contents] A Profile of the Gonzalez Intensive Nutritional Treatment Plan for Cancer Each of our cancer protocols is highly individualized, says NicholasGonzalez, M.D., a classically trained immunologist now among the nation'spreÎminent practitioners of alternative cancer treatment with a busyclinic in New York City. "It is essential, though, that each patient comply100% with their individual program in order for them to survive." When they do, the results can be quite astonishing-an estimated 80%success rate, Dr. Gonzalez claims. Add to this the fact that most of thepatients that show up in Dr. Gonzalez' Park Avenue offices have received their"death sentences" in so many months-to-live from their conventionalcancer specialists, after having "failed" with chemotherapy andradiation. Failed?-not from Dr. Gonzalez' viewpoint. For him, thesepeople have barely begun the real struggle against their cancer, the one withthe positive outcome. In some respects this dramatic case study stands for the powerful healingpossibilities of the Gonzalez approach, or for any alternative cancer treatmentthat genuinely is open to an alternative outcome, which is to say, remission andlife after cancer. A lawyer, age 28, had advanced leukemia; her doctors said shehad only a few days left to live. Three months after starting the Gonzalezprogram, she was still alive; in fact, she was much better. A yearlater-some 362 days after the "few days" she supposedly hadleft to live-she was in complete remission and back at work. The Gonzalez program has 6 main features. First, appropriate diet, whichmeans one of 10 basic diets with 94 variations depending on the metabolic typeof the cancer patient and of the cancer itself. Second, intensive nutritionalsupport, which means a huge amount of vitamin and mineral supplements. Third,proto-morphogen support-these are pills made from raw beef organs andglands. Fourth, general digestive aids, including pepsin and hydrochloric acid.Fifth, pancreatic enzyme therapy, taken orally to help liquefy tumors. Sixth,detoxification, to help the body eliminate the unhealthy abundance of toxins andwaste products as the tumors decompose. As Cheryl Wilkens mentions in the accompanying article, much of the Gonzalez program is based on the earlier work of William Donald Kelley, D.D.S. In the 1960s, faced with his own pancreatic cancer, Kelly, by profession a dentist, figured out a bold new approach to cancer treatment based on an understanding of how the body metabolizes protein. It seemed to him that cancer might be caused by the body's inability to handle protein caused by inadequate amounts of proteolytic enzymes in the pancreas. Apparently, the pancreas secretes these special enzymes into the bloodstream where, under normal healthy conditions, they digest and deactivate potentially cancerous cells. Kelley also realized that each person has a unique biochemical, nutritional con-dition, so any approach, if it is to be effective, must be individually tailored. Even so, there are some general broad categories which he called the 10 metabolic types, and these become the basis for the individual nutrition plans. Is there proof all this works? Yes, a fair amount, but Dr. Gonzalez is now recruiting patients with pancreatic cancer to take part in a new clinical study to test his therapies. Years ago, Dr. Gonzalez studied some of Kelly's pancreatic cancer patients to see how long they survived. Normally, pancreatic cancer comes with a 5 year survival probability. Dr. Gonzalez found that those patients who followed the program to the letter survived 9 years, compared to 8 months for those who did so only partially, and 67 days, for those who started it then quit. "The ultimate goal for all of us is to try and get clinical trials so we can get our therapies tested," Gonzalez says. "Then if it really does work, the world will have the facts to confirm it."

Nambudripad, D.C., O.M.D., Ph.D., will come as good news. But for the 50% ofAmericans-128 million people-who suffer from problems caused, unknown to them,by allergies, Dr. Nambudripad's techniques will come as a great surprise. For the last 12 years, she's been using her own discovery, the NambudripadAllergy Elimination Technique (NAET), at her Buena Park, California, clinic, topermanently heal between 80-90% of her patients' hidden allergies. People cometo her from all over America for this unprecedented degree of relief. She'staught NAET to about 625 other doctors which means this innovative allergy cureis now available in many parts of the U.S. This couldn't come at a better time because according to Dr. Nambudripad, farmore people have allergies than doctors, or the patients themselves, have eversuspected. The shocking fact is that "there is hardly any human disease or condition inwhich allergic factors are not involved," claims Dr. Nambudripad. Even morechallenging is this statement: "Any substance under the sun, including sunlightitself, can cause an allergic reaction in any individual." In other words, potentially you can be allergic to anything. If you check withenough people, as Nambudripad has, you'll find allergies to almost everything.Foods, clothing, plants, chemicals, vitamins, tap water, vaccines, furniture,plastic, metals, wedding rings, piano keys, water, heat, acrylic fingernails,saliva, even your own adrenaline-the list is staggering. (See below, "You Can Be Allergic to Nearly Anything") Your brain re-interprets what it used to think was a poison, seeing it now as aharmless, acceptable substance. "This produces a totally new, permanent andirreversible response to the allergen," Nambudripad says. Your nervous systemlearns a different response to the same stimulus and you are suddenlyallergy-free. Undiagnosed allergies can produce symptoms, illnesses, even chronic diseaseslike cancer, that affect every system and organ in your body. Chronic fatigue,migraines, hyperactivity, arthritis, asthma, anxiety, depression, backaches,addictions-all these and more can be allergy-based. Unless you understand thesecret of allergies, you may spend years fruitlessly visiting medicalspecialists, never getting better. In her bold new book, Say Goodbye to Illness, Dr. Nambudripad promises to"revolutionize the practice of medicine." It may sound like an exaggeration, butfor Nambudripad, who is a licensed chiropractor, acupuncturist, registerednurse, and a Ph.D., it's the simple truth. Dozens of dramatic case studiespresented in her book support her strong claim. Diagnosing hidden allergies in itself is not revolutionary. Environmentalmedicine has been doing that for several decades. Usually you remove theallergenic substance from your life, go on a rotation diet, and you can manage.But Nambudripad's techniques allow you to continue using the very substancethat has made you sick-and without any further bad results. The secret to NAET is to retrain your brain and nervous system to no longerreact to the offending substance. "We can reprogram our brains to perceiveunsuitable energies as suitable ones and use them for our benefit rather thanallow them to cause energy blockages and imbalances." Let's see how this worksin a few stories from her clinic. Susan was a 19 year old woman, newly married, who came to Nambudripadcomplaining of severe lower back pain. She'd suffered with this for 5 days, andwas now having fever, chills, and severe headaches. A urine test suggested apossible kidney infection. Aspirin and a light antibiotic helped reduce hersymptoms. Then she had a cup of fenugreek herbal tea. Within 10 minutes she hadan intense reaction: chills, muscular stiffness, and high fever. Nambudripad tested her at once for an allergy to fenugreek tea then used NAET tolower her temperature to normal within 30 minutes. It turns out Susan had drunkfenugreek tea 5 days earlier as well, starting the chain reaction of symptoms. Thomas was a computer programmer, age 28, who started experiencing extremefatigue only a year after taking a new job. He was so tired he started to hategoing to work. His job performance dropped, he could barely walk withoutsomebody's help, and soon he was diagnosed as having chronic fatigue syndrome.He took time off from work, seemingly facing a grim future. Yet he started tofeel better, just by being home. But when he returned to work, he got worseagain. This cycle continued for 4 years until he had the good fortune to visit Dr.Nambudripad. She tested Thomas for allergies and found he was allergic to theplastic material of his computer keyboard and to computer screen radiation. Sheused NAET on Thomas and he was able to resume full-time work with no furtherallergic reactions. How is this possible? Normally, you remove the allergenic substance and stayaway from it forevermore, yet here are Susan and Thomas able to resume livingwhile in contact with a substance that had made them terribly sick. The secretof NAET lies in the energy pathways through the body that acupuncture callsmeridians. Here's what happens, according to Dr. Nambudripad. Your energy system and braininterpret a particular substance as potentially harmful to your body. For otherpeople this item-a diamond ring, a carob-coated cherry, a peanut, hot water-is aharmless, everyday item; but for your system, it's toxic. Your energy pathwaysfreeze up as a way of defending the body against this unsuitable substance. Thisin turn blocks your energy meridians and if the condition never changes, theoverall functioning of your body suffers. "With the first bite of most allergic foods, the brain begins to block theenergy channels to prevent the entrance of the adverse energy of the food intothe body," Nambudripad explains. This is what produces allergies. In Susan'scase, it was her kidney meridian that got blocked and kept generating theallergic symptoms of fever, chills, headaches, and kidney infection. "The suddenblocking of the meridians is one of the quickest defense mechanisms of the brainto stop the allergen from entering deeper into the body." So, the offending substance causes an energy disturbance in a meridian, thisblocks the energy flow, the body becomes unbalanced, symptoms show up, andeventually, you get sick. But how can Nambudripad figure out what is the offending substance in the firstplace? She uses an ingenious technique called muscle testing, familiar tochiropractors as Applied Kinesiology. (See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide, "Applied Kine-siology," pp. 47-52.) The idea is simple: the patient holds a substance that you think producesallergies while the physician tests the strength of certain muscles. You extendyour arm and resist as Nambudripad gently tries to push it down. Allergenicsubstances weaken your muscles, so if you arm goes down, you're probablyallergic to the substance you're holding in your other hand. This is somethingyou can do at home with a partner whenever you suspect an allergy, as thesection below, ("How to be Your Allergy Detective") shows. This is quick and straightforward if you already suspect a substance. But ifyou're not sure, Nambudripad uses a faster, computerized system of muscletesting based on the principle of electroacupuncture and biofeedback. the genius of Nambudripad'sapproach: it takes the allergy out of any substance and turns the allergic bodyinto the allergy-free body. This device (see Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide, "Energy Medicine, pp. 192-204 and"Prevention-you Can See Disease Coming" by Burton Goldberg,this issue) registers minute changes inelectrical response through your skin, mainly your fingertips, as you holddifferent materials. It gives Dr. Nambudripad an idea of the intensity of theallergy on a scale of 0-100. It's a fast, thorough, and efficient way to findout what a person is allergic to, says Nambudripad. The next step is to actually reprogram the patient's nervous system not to reactanymore to the allergenic substance. This is the genius of Nambudripad'sapproach: it takes the allergy out of any substance and turns the allergic bodyinto the allergy-free body. Remember Susan and the fenugreek tea? Dr. Nambudripad used finger-deliveredacupressure (she'll also use needle-based acupuncture when appropriate) to treatSusan's kidney meridian and organ imbalance at the same time Susan held thefenugreek tea in her hand. The effect is to reorganize the body's way ofreacting to a substance. Because the energy pathways are unblocked, your bodydoes not have to defensively recoil every time it comes in contact withfenugreek, or computer plastics, or hundreds of other allergenic substances. Your brain re-interprets what it used to think was a poison, seeing it now as aharmless, acceptable substance. "This produces a totally new, permanent andirreversible response to the allergen," Nambudripad says. Your nervous systemlearns a different response to the same stimulus and you are suddenlyallergy-free. Using Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Techniques, you undo your body'sconditioned response and allow it to co-exist again with everyday items. Youonly have to stay away from the substance for 24 hours as your energy meridians"reset" themselves. Let's not forget, too, that in hundreds of cases, NAET transforms people who areacutely or chronically ill into healthy, happy, functioning allergy-free humanbeings again. "Is a permanent cure for allergies possible? At last the answer is a definiteyes, "Nambudripad says. "You can retrain the body to go back to its originalfunction, so you can make the nervous system accept the presence of otherrejected items without creating blockages or unpleasantness in the body." Dr. Nambudripad learned the principles of NAET the best possible way-throughbeing sick herself. She was sick since childhood with multiple illnesses. Shehad eczema, arthritis, joint aches, bronchitis, insomnia, clinical depression,sinusitis, migraine headaches, chronic exhaustion, plus she suffered 3miscarriages. By the time she arrived in Los Angeles nearly 20 years ago from India, she wastaking 30 aspirin a day to survive. She tried all sorts of doctors, techniques,medicines, herbs, vitamins, and nutritional programs, but everything made herworse. The only things she wasn't allergic to were white rice and broccoli."Every inch of my body ached." Finally, she stumbled upon an acupuncturist who tested her for allergies. He wasthe first physician Nambudripad encountered who made the link between her ratherstunning list of problems and undiagnosed allergies. "I followed my teacher'sadvice and ate white rice and broccoli exclusively." All of her symptoms startedto lift, but as soon as she started to add more items to her food list, theallergic reactions returned. "I was simply allergic to everything under thesun." Was she to live on rice and broccoli the rest of her life? That is what she didfor the next 42 months. Then one day she ate a carrot and made a discovery thatled to NAET. After eating only a few bites of carrot, Nambudripad instantly felt tired andlethargic, as if she were going to faint. She used muscle testing on herself andlearned she was highly allergic to carrots. Was this to be just another itemadded to her list of untouchable substances? No. This time Nambudripad had anidea. She gave herself an acupuncture treatment, working the points she knew wouldkeep her awake or from going into shock. Then she slept for 45 minutes. When shewoke, she felt completely different, no longer sick and tired. Compared to howshe'd felt for years, this was a new state of "supreme well-being." Then shelooked at her hands. She was still holding pieces of carrot. That's when she saw the link between holding the allergenic substanc within yourbody's electromagnetic field while receiving a treatment for adverse foodreaction. Somehow the combination of the two took the allergic charge out of thecarrots. Her body was no longer repulsed by the energy of the carrots. To proveit, she ate a carrot and had no allergic reaction. She tested her muscles forcarrots and got nothing. Carrots had lost their allergic bite. The result is NAET. In the last 12 years of clinical use it has entirelyrelieved allergy symptoms or produced satisfactory improvements in 80-90% of herpatients, which number in the thousands. "In every case, allergies were clearedout, never to return." And all this without any strict rotation or eliminationdiets to avoid the allergy-producing substance. The experience opened Nambudripad's eyes to a new world of cause and effect inunderstanding allergies. "I discovered that although it has been gainingacceptance as a separate area of medical study in the last few years, allergycertainly has not been given the recognition it deserves as a primary cause ofmany types of disorders and illnesses." Both physicians and patients attest to the high degree of success with NAET. Many have said goodbye to illnesses they thought were permanent afflictions. "NAET is a practical potent, and proven method ofchanging the body's unbalanced response to a substance, be it food orenvironmental. "Dr. Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Technique is the most incredible practicetool I have seen in health care in my 40 years of practice," states chiropractorJohn Kasler, D.C., of Charlotte, North Carolina. "I have seen NAET put myextremely sick patients back in control of their lives once again," commentsacupuncturist Jan K. Steele, L.Ac., O.M.D. "After completion of an NAETtreat-ment program, they are free of symptoms, free of excessive medication, andfree once again to enjoy good health." Ask Novato, California, chiropractor Dr. Eleanor Chin, D.C., about NAET, and youget more positive feedback. "NAET is a practical potent, and proven method ofchanging the body's unbalanced response to a substance, be it food orenvironmental. A number of my patients have told me that this work is the singlemost powerful booster of their immune function, while also integrating the mind,body, and emotional aspects of healing." Even the allergy specialists, such as environmental medicine physician, SandraDenton, M.D., of the Alaska Alternative Medicine Center in Anchorage, admit thatNAET has shown them something new about treating allergies. Dr. Denton herself had endured chronic fatigue syndrome and serious asthma foryears until Dr. Nambudripad revealed the host of substances she was allergic toand freed her body of its need to react against them. "She pointed out to methat many health problems in people all over the world are undiagnosed allergicreactions or due to the lowering of the immune system by multiple allergicreactions that allow diseases to attack the weakened host," Denton says. Perhaps this patient's comment from an NAET-using acupuncturist's casebook saysit all: "I felt as if I was let out of jail, that I escaped from allergy hell!"This happy patient, like many others, has seen there is a way to transform theallergic body into a healthy, balanced, and livable body. -By Richard Leviton EDITOR'S NOTE: You can contact Dr. Nambudripad for appointments or referrals for other doctors using NAET at Pain Clinic, 6714 Beach Blvd., Buena Park, CA, 90621; tel: 714-523-0800.

STEP 1: Lie down in a flat surface, table, bed, or floor, your arms at your side. STEP 2: Raise your left arm to a 90� angle. As the tester tries to push it down towards your toes, pushing lightly against the hand or forearm, gently resist it. Tester applies 5-10# pressure for 3-5 seconds. STEP 3: If your arm goes weak right away, your energy is unbalanced. Tester places right forefinger at a point 1.5 inches below the navel and left forefinger at base of sternum. Gently tap these two points simultaneously with the fingertip for 20 seconds. STEP 4: Retest the arm, following STEP 2. If the arm remains strong, go to STEP 5. STEP 5: In your writing hand, hold the substance you suspect you are allergic to. Make sure your fingernails are scrubbed clean and carry no trace of perfume or other substances. STEP 6: Tester presses against each of the 12 meridian points one by one, trying to push your arm down at the same time. Use the tip of your index finger to apply light pressure for 60 seconds at each point. Where your arm goes weak and drops down, that is the acupuncture meridian that is blocked by the substance in your hand. STEP 7: Remove the allergenic substance from your energy field. Do not eat it or use it. Make an appointment with one of the 600 practitioners of NAET to reprogram your nervous system to not react to this substance any more.

It also allows you to find indicators of diseaseat its earliest possible phase and then to take measures to halt its progress.When you can do this, you're already taking the first step in preventingillness. Alternative medicine has two diagnostic devices that make this far-seeing possible. I'm talking about the live-cell microscope and the EAV, aform of computerized testing based on acupuncture. In both cases, the doctor can actually see a disease brewing before itmanifests in the body. You "read" the condition of the patient's live bloodthrough the microscope and you can study it after a series of treatments to seeif you're making progress. The letters "EAV" mean Electroacupuncture According to Voll. Reinhold Voll,M.D., was a German doctor who devised a way to give acupuncture diagnosis abiofeedback dimension. With EAV, you can test organs and acupuncture points tosee how they will respond to different medications. By taking readings at the different acupuncture points, doctors can tell thehealth of the organs and of the body itself. Then by having the patient holdsubstances or remedies while the EAV tested the acupuncture points, you can tellwhat the patient is reacting to and what might heal them. The EAV computerizedsystem is a marvelous diagnostic tool. In this way, EAV can be used to detect many disease states, plus the presenceof chemical toxins, food and substance allergies, and imbalances in the body.More sophisticated devices can formulate and deliver the healing remedy (itsenergy equivalent) to the body through the acupuncture meridians. The EAV can give you an enormous amount of information about a person. Youcan also use Applied Kinesiology (or muscle testing) for diagnosis�there aremany roads to Rome. But my point is this: holistic physicians who use thisapproach do far better work than those who don't. Now, we all know it's difficult to get people to spend their money, time,and effort in prevention. But let me tell you, it's worth it. I'm 68 years old.I have no health problems, no aches or pains, and I feel great, but I'm doingchelation therapy. Why? Because I know that I have thickened arteries. I wantto widen my veins, open up their circulation, and I know chelation will do this.I want to prevent having strokes or heart disease later. In heart disease the problem doesn't rear its head until you're 90% gone, soI had some early testing to find out my condition. I have some occlusions so I'mdoing chelation therapy now, long before it becomes a major problem. That'sprevention. Prevention means catching the disease before it develops. But it also meanscatching the possibility of an adverse reaction to a drug before you take it.Consider the DPT vaccine, routinely given to young children. Pertussin is adangerous substance for a lot of children; too many children have a bad reactionto this vaccine and some experience permanent damage. It doesn't have to be thisway. This is what I did with my own son working with Harold Whitcomb, M.D., inAspen, Colorado. First, Dr. Whitcomb tested him with the EAV. The DPT shot atfull-strength would have blown my son away, so Dr. Whitcomb gave him half thedose. You can reduce the side-effects of the vaccine by reducing the dose towhat the child can accept. Second, you use homeopathics to remove the vaccineresidue. The funny thing is I wasn't always sold on the EAV device. Twelve years agoJoseph McGovern, M.D., had to retire from Harvard University because he hadenvironmental illness and was allergic to a huge list of chemicals. When I firstvisited a clinic that used the EAV, I laughed. I thought it was quackery. Butwhen I told McGovern about it, he taught me something important. "Don't laugh," he said. "The EAV cured one of my failures, a farmer withpesticide poisoning. How was I to know what poisons were inside this man dyingin the hospital? This device saved his life because it identified the toxins;then it indicated the homeopathics that would remove the toxins from his body." You don't have to fly blind anymore when it comes to prevention. You can catch the disease before it ever makes you sick. That's prevention. About 85,000 practitioners worldwide use computerized testing for diagnosis.Unfortunately, it's not yet widely respected in the U.S. A lot of holisticphysicians don't know about it or are fearful of the political reprisals if theyuse it. At present, the FDA allows physicians to use this on an experimentalbasis solely for screening purposes. Depending on what state you live in, thereis a more supportive or less favorable attitude about this approach. But as I see it, anybody who doesn't use this is flying blind. EAV is theleading edge and it will be proven down the line that you can do miraculousthings with it. Persuading people to take this opportunity is what my life isall about. As the Zen Master says, "In the beginner's mind, there are manypossibilities; in the expert's mind, there are few." Let's keep medicine an openfield of possibilities. You don't have to fly blind anymore when it comes to prevention. You canknow from your instruments that you're on course. I'm devoting my life toeducating the public that they're getting poisoned to death, to explaining howto detoxify themselves, and to show them that there are powerful, effectiveways to get better. You can catch the disease before it ever makes you sick.That's prevention. And that's an alternative worth living for.

SCHACTER, M.D. Question: What is chelation therapy and how can it help my health? Answer: Do you or someone you know suffer from heart disease?Chances are the answer is "yes" because heart attacks are the leading cause of death inour country. Heart disease is caused by atherosclerosis, or thickening of the arteries,which results from the accumulation of fats, calcium and other substances in the arterialwall. Blockage of a coronary artery leads to a heart attack and possibly death.Atherosclerosis can also cause strokes when arteries to the brain are blocked. Modern conventional treatment for coronary artery disease emphasizes bypass surgery,balloon angioplasty, and medications. But there is another approach called EDTA chelationtherapy. This is a remarkably safe and effective treatment that has largely been ignoredby conventional physicians. Chelation refers to the ability of a chemical compound to grab on to a mineral. Chelationtherapy is used to remove toxic minerals (such as lead) and metabolic wastes from thebody. It also increases blood flow and removes arterial plaque. Basically, chelationremoves charged minerals, but in doing so, it also may help your body's enzymes tofunction better, thus directly leading to the elimination of toxic wastes. The chelating agent EDTA was first used in the 1950s to treat lead poisoning in shipworkers. When workers with chest pain from heart disease reported improvement during thetreatment, the physicians began to explore the use of this therapy for atherosclerosis.The results were remarkable. In chelation, the patient recieves a series of EDTA infusions, plus vitamin C, magnesium,and other ingredients, given in the doctor's office. Usually 2 infusions per week aregiven, lasting 3 hours each. Most patients get at least 20 to 30 infusions, each costingbetween $90-$125 per infusion. Unfortunately, because mainstream medicine does not acceptthis approach for treating heart and blood vessel disease, Medicare and most otherinsurance plans do not reimburse for this therapy. Although most conventional physicians believe no medical literature exists to support theuse of EDTA chelation therapy for heart disease, this is not true. At least 40 clinicalstudies have been published and 38 show positive results. Meanwhile, you should know thathundreds of physicians in the U.S. and other countries believe chelation therapy is thebest available treatment for these conditions. With regard to safety, the American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), whichconducts workshops for doctors on chelation therapy, estimates that at least 500,000patients have received this therapy without a single death attributable to EDTA, when theACAM protocol is followed. This makes it one of the safest therapies of modern medicine. Question: Is there proof that chelation really improves the health of people using it? Answer: Patients who have been recommended for coronary artery bypass surgery or balloonangioplasty should consider EDTA chelation therapy as an alternative. In contrast tobypass or angioplasty, which treat only the particular arteries that are bypassed orballooned, chelation treats all of the arteries in the body simultaneously. This leads toimproved circulation in all organs of the body. However, patients who choose to undergobypass surgery or balloon angioplasty may also benefit from chelation therapy, whichhelps keep these ballooned or bypassed arteries open. Chelating physicians report good to excellent results in 70-80% of theirpatients who have circulation problems. If chelation therapy were done on a large scale in the U.S.,the health care cost savings would be 8 billion dollars a year. Chelating physicians also recommend dietary changes, nutritional supplements, an exerciseprogram, and stress management. They report good to excellent results in 70-80% of theirpatients who have circulation problems. Symptoms that improve include chest pain due toangina, shortness of breath, pain and cramps in the legs when walking, dizziness,impaired memory, and general weakness and fatigue. Here is an example of a typical chelation therapy patient drawn from my own practice. A50 year old man had 3 angioplasties during a 6 month period. This kept the veins open 12,8, and 10 weeks, respectively. When his cardiologist recommended a fourth angioplasty, hechose chelation therapy instead. On his first visit to me, 4 months after his last angioplasty, he could walk only 2 cityblocks without severe chest pains. After 24 EDTA infusions, he could walk for 60-90minutes, 3 times per week, with little or no discomfort. At the same time, he reduced hisuse of cardiac medications by 50%. Is EDTA chelation therapy cost effective? A recent Danish study says yes. Of 470cardiovascular patients treated with EDTA chelation therapy, 85% improved. Of 72 patientson a waiting list for coronary bypass surgery, 65 did not require bypass followingchelation. Of 30 patients scheduled for leg amputation, only 3 required amputation. Asidefrom the reduced human suffering, the estimated cost savings to the Danish government was$3 million dollars. In the U.S., the estimated cost savings if EDTA chelation therapy were done on a largescale would be $8 billion a year, based on the savings from coronary artery bypasssurgery alone. Surely that's an alternative worth pursuing. Chelating physicians report good-to-excellent results in 70-80% of their patients whohave circulation problems. If chelation therapy were done on a large scale in the U.S.,the health care cost savings would be 8 billion dollars a year. MICHAEL B.

Stay Open to All the Factors in Healing I've always been interested in the multifactorial nature of illness. This means illness hasmultiple causes. Ideally the doctor should use a multifactorial approach in treating it. I'muncomfortable with the term "holistic" because it's become a political term, so I preferecologic, by which I mean looking at all the aspects of the inner person and their outerworld-the whole system of relationships. It's essential to know the unique characteristics ofyour patient. Based on a symptom, you don't necessarily know the cause; usually many factors contribute tothe onset of illness. These can include genetics; emotional state; functional, structural,psychological, and nutritional conditions; the presence of toxic environmental pollutants;endocrine, immune, and musculoskeletal system status; the effect of the climate(biometeorology); and the effect of the landscape (geopathic stress). The clinician needs tobe open and receptive to the fact that there are multiple influences acting upon the patient.Don't look for one simple answer. In mainstream medicine there is too much emphasis on the classification of disorders. Ittries to pigeonhole a patient into tight categories so a single specialist can work on theproblem. The trouble is they'll often pursue things in the wrong direction if they followonly one lead. The same symptom can have many causes, but you don't get this perspective whenyou do a pigeon-hole diagnosis. Let me explain with a case. A nurse in her forties came to see me complaining she was depressed and spontaneously cryingall the time. She was convinced her problem was candidiasis, or yeast overgrowth. She knewthis is common in women of her age group, that crying is part of the syndrome, so she assumedshe probably had it. Evaluating her, I felt she didn't meet any clinical criteria for yeast overgrowth, but shedid have a psychological history showing strong reasons for why she might be depressed. Isuggested her condition was fundamentally a depressive state unrelated to yeast overgrowth.In addition to psychotherapy and medications, several natural substances help depression,such as the amino acids phenylalanine, tryptophan, and L-methionine, plus hypericin, from theherb, St. John's Wort. Conversely, women have seen me because of depression-I am, after all, a psychiatrist bytraining-thinking they needed psychotherapy or medication. Yet after I evaluated them, Ifound their depression was actually caused by yeast overgrowth. In this case, I wouldimmediately get them off refined sugars, yeasts, and molds, fortify them with megavitaminsand mineral supplements, and perhaps prescribe caprylic acid and acidophilus. It is just as important for the patient not to start off with the conviction that she knowsthe cause of her illness and simply seek out somebody who's going to reinforce thatconviction. People often do that. In these two examples you can see how one person looked tome as a candida specialist, while the other saw me as a psychiatrist. Patients are alsoseduced by single-factor diagnosis just like most allopathic doctors, forgetting that illnesscan have many causes. Let's look at depression. Depression can result from the failure of a body system or it canbe a psychological defense, protecting the person from material they don't want to deal with,or it can be a warning sign that something is going to collapse in terms of their mindbodybalance. It can also be based on bodily toxicity or allergic sensitivity and reactivity toenvironmental substances. A very pleasant, calm woman came to see me. She brought her knitting in with her and satthere smiling, knitting away, as I tested her for allergies. I gave her a particular antigenand she became depressed almost instantly. She stopped knitting and started crying. After Ineutralized the effect of the antigen, she told me that if my office had windows that opened,she would have jumped. She couldn't even express to me how suicidal she had been feeling. Evaluation is half the picture, but treatment is the other. This should also be understood asbeing multifactorial. Treatments should be selected on the basis of 6 factors: safety, cost,efficacy, speed, availability, and patient preference. Most allopathic health professionalsdon't think in terms of these 6 factors. The decision about what to do should be a workingalliance between the physician and the patient. I believe the physician's job is to educatethe patient. Together, doctor and patient make the decisions in line with the patient'spreferences and the physician's knowledge of the best outcomes. Healing is the key word here. Healing, in part, means restoring the patient to a state ofhealth; yet there's more to it than that. There should be a growth aspect from experiencingillness and restoring health. When you're dealing with illness, it's not simply a matter of returning to a past state ofhealth. I encourage patients to see it as an opportunity to move forward to a higher level ofwellness. I've encouraged many patients to view their psychiatric hospital experience as anopportunity to arrive at a more advanced place in themselves; with great insights from havingworked through their pain.My advice to patients is this: look for a health practitioner who is open and knowledgeableabout a broad variety of treatments-and be sure to stay that way yourself.

In order of prevalence, these include fatigue, low-grade fever, muscle pain,sleep disorder, impaired mental abilities, depression, headache, allergies, sorethroat, anxiety, muscle weakness and joint pain, and about another dozen. But regardless of what you call it, alternative medicine has an answer forChronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) that you can put into action today. According toJulian Whitaker, M.D., popularly known as "America's wellness doctor," there are4 crucial steps you must take to get the energy up to get over CFS. 1 Start practicing the Whitaker Wellness Program. Adopt a healthy lifestyle,which means get good nutrition, exercise, quit using tobacco, alcohol, andrecreational drugs, and take responsbility for your health. Take a megavitamin-mineral supplement daily so that your intake is well abovethe RDAs. Supplement this with a strong antioxidant program including vitamins Cand E. Then fortify everything with extra amounts of magnesium (1000 mg daily,minimum) and potassium (about 400 mg daily), and essential fatty acids such asomega-3s, and omega-6s, available through Evening Primrose, flaxseed, blackcurrant seed, borage, and fish oils. Finally, eat a diet high in complexcarbohydrates and low in fats. 2 Strengthen your immune system vitality. Do this by taking calf thymusextracts. If taken in the form of the commercially prepared ThymuPlex brand,take 2 tablets (each containing 375 mg of active calf thymus components) twicedaily with your meals. The wonder herb Echinacea is also a powerful ally Gettingthe Energy here, in dosages of 2-4 ml (1-2 teaspoons) of extract 3 times daily. 3 Strengthen your adrenal function which is probably blown out by chronic stressand inadequate nutrition. Useful here are bovine adrenal extracts, taken orally(dosage depends on your individual constitution and condition), and Siberianginseng extract (100 mg, 3 times a day). 4 Here is Dr. Whitaker's shopping list of additional supplements to master CFSand re-energize your life. If you're not already doing so, take extra vitamin Cso that your daily intake is in the range of 3000-8000 mg; extra vitamin E (1200IU daily); elemental magnesium (1000 mg); and 1 tablespoon daily of flax seedoil. Dr. Whitaker says his approach is simple, straightforward, and effective. "It isbased on a simple truism of non-drug health care: a multifactorial problem isbest addressed with a multifactorial solution."

Natural Remedies for Osteoarthritis In case you're one of the 40 million Americans who have some degree ofdegenerative joint disease, called osteoarthritis, or among the 80% of peopleolder than 50 who suffer from this most common form of arthritis, alternativemedicine has some good news for you. Typically, all the joints in your body that bear any weight, plus your handjoints, are the ones most affected by osteoarthritis. Joint cartilage starts tostiffen up, restricting easy movement; then it starts to degenerate, and withthis comes pain, inflammation, deformity, and a restriction in your range ofmotion. First, you should know that foods can have both a beneficial and negative effecton your condition. Foods that help all arthritic conditions include the highflavonoid fruits such as cherries, blueberries, and blackberries. You also needhigher amounts of sulfur which you'll find in garlic, onions, brussels sprouts,and cabbage. On the other hand, you might want to cut back on your consumption of DeadlyNightshade family foods such as potatoes, eggplants, peppers, tomatoes, andtobacco. A study of 5000 arthritis patients showed that 70% of those whoeliminated these foods from their diet had relief from their aches. Second, there is the matter of nutritional supplementation. You need extraamounts of antioxidants, which fight free radicals in your system released fromnormal metabolism and environmental toxins. Useful here are vitamins C(1000-3000 mg daily) and E (600 IU daily), plus the minerals selenium,manganese, zinc, and boron, and vitamins B3 (as niacinamide, up to 900 mg daily), B6, and pantothenic acid. Naturopaths who work with osteoarthritis also recommend glucosamine sulfate (500mg, 3 times daily) which will stimulate your system to repair its cartilage.Along with this, take cartilage extracts, which include sea cucumber,green-lipped mussel, shark cartilage, and purified chondroitin sulfate. There are a handful of effective plant remedies to try out as well. Theseinclude licorice root, dong quai, and alfalfa, all of which containphytoestrogens that keep your body's own estrogen from binding to yourcartilage cells. The Indian herb Boswellia serrata gets good results, in dosages of 400 mg, 3 times daily. The African herb Devil's Claw works againstinflammation and has an analgesic effect, taken in dosages of 4-6 ml, 3 timesdaily, as an extact, or 1-2 g as a tea made from dried powdered root. -SOURCE: Arthritis.

A Thumbnail Guide to Living Headache-free A headache can ruin your day yet you don't want to survive on aspirins andTylenol. Alternative medicine has a headful of practical answers, starting witha look at how you can change your diet to stop the lightning bolts from searingthrough your brain. For one thing, your conventional pain medications may be giving you theheadaches in the first place. Vitamin B6 supplementation can take care of thispossibility. High levels of dietary copper, found in foods such as chocolate,nuts, wheatgerm and shellfish, have been linked to migraines. If you get PMS headaches, it might be because the magnesium count in your redblood cells is too low; try 100-200 mg of magnesium for a few days as a remedy.If cluster headaches are your bane, your red blood cells may be lacking choline,which you can get through fish oils and omega-3 fatty acid supplements. Don't overlook the possibility of undiagnosed food sensitivities and allergicreactions to favorite items in your diet (see our cover story, The Allergy-freeBody, this issue). More specifically, sub-stances such as aspartame, caffeine,cheese, chocolate, milk, nitrates and nitrities (in hot dogs and cured meats),red wine, and tyramine (found in aged cheeses, some red wines, fermentedsausages, sour cream) are all known to provoke headaches in susceptible people. So how do you undo the vise-clamp in which your headache holds your brain?Capsaicin, the active ingredient in cayenne pepper, can give you some relief;rub it directly on your temples, using a commercially prepared ointment ifavailable. Inhaling it gently through the nose is also effective for clusterheadaches. The herb feverfew, available as an extract, works against migraines.Try a dosage of 25 mg dried leaves, 2 times daily, or perhaps 1 dosage of 80 mgif you feel a migraine attack coming on. But if it's already in progress, 1-2 gmay be needed. And there's always ginger to consider for relief of migraine, especially for thenausea and vomiting part of it. A woman who had a long history of migrainesstopped all medications and started taking 500 mg of dried ginger, mixed withwater, as soon as she felt the earliest signs of migraine. She repeated thisevery 4 hours for the next 4 days. She felt better within the first 30 minutesand had no side effects. Afterwards, she started using fresh ginger as a regularcondiment in her cooking. She had migraines much less frequently, and when theycame, they were much milder than ever before. -SOURCES: Botanical Influences on Illness: A Sourcebook of Clinical Research, Melvyn R.

Use Houseplants Against Indoor Pollution The idea of using common houseplants as air filters to remove pollution fromindoor air and tightly-sealed environments first came out of NASA space researchin the 1970s. Scientists discovered that not only could plants recycle oxygen,but they seemed to be able to remove air pollutants, too. Here are recommendations to use in for your home or office for filtering outtoxic air-borne chemicals and out-gassed fumes.

Eliminate it or be forever clogged up-that's one way to paraphrase one of thekey principles of well-being. Your body is equipped with a variety of naturalchannels of elimination, including the colon, skin, lungs, kidneys, andlymphatic system. The ease and success of your body's natural rhythms ofelimination in turn depend on healthy metabolism and digestion. But too often our lifestyle and dietary choices and the simple stress of livingcan weaken, even clog up the whole works. Naturopaths suggest that at least oncea year you do an internal housecleaning. Here are some herbal suggestions,courtesy of herbalist Richard Scalzo, president of Gaia Herbs of Harvard,Massachusetts, for your complete self-care detoxification program. MOVE IT OUT. Mix 3 parts psyllium husks, 1 part Ayurvedic Triphala powder, and the powdersof marshmallow root (1/3 part), licorice root (1/4 part), and ginger root (1/8part). This makes a blend that will gently dredge and empty the 25 feet of yourintestines. Use 1 teaspoon of dry mixture with 10 ounces warm water, shakethoroughly, and drink this twice daily, on rising and before bed. ENERGIZE YOUR LIVER. Make an Elixir of Bitters to aid your liver and digestive system. Mix driedamounts of Indian gooseberry (2 parts), tumeric root (3 parts), milk thistleseed (2 parts), calamus root (1 part), wild yam root (1.5 parts), gentian root(1 part), fennel seed (1 part), cardamon seeds (1 part), ginger (1/4 part),bitter orange oil (pinch), extract of marine algae (pinch). Boil in 1/2 gallonof water for 45 minutes; then strain off liquid and dispose of herbs. Drink 4ounces of this tea, 3 times a day, before meals. RELAX YOUR KIDNEYS. Your kidneys never get a vacation, not even for a minute, so give them a littlesupport. Prepare a mixture of dried herbs including juniper berry (4 parts),goldenrod flowers and leaves (3.2 parts), horsetail (2 parts), corn silk (2parts), cleavers (2 parts), marshmallow root (1 part). Boil in 1/2 gallon ofwater for 45 minutes; then strain off liquid and dispose of herbs. Drink 4ounces of this as tea, 3 times daily, between meals. LET YOUR BLOOD BE GOOD.This mixture helps remove metabolic wastes from your blood while remineralizingit. Mix fresh amounts of red clover blossoms (3 parts), stinging nettle leaf(1 part), cleavers (1 part), yellow dock root (1.5 parts) burdock root (2parts), yarrow flowers (1 part), plantain leaf (1 part), licorice root (1 part),prickly ash bark (1/2 part). Boil in 1/2 gallon of water for 45 minutes; thenstrain off liquid and dispose of herbs. Drink 4 ounces of this as tea, 3 timesdaily, between meals. Gaia Herbs president Richard Scalzo recommends that you maintain this 4-partherbal internal cleansing program for 6-8 weeks. At the same time, give yourwhole system a break by eating lighter and fresher, less frequently, and simplyless. Increase your liquid intake, especially warm water, having a cup every 20minutes.

Normally, the he he dried rind of the fruit of G. cambogia makes a pungentcondiment for Indian curries, but in the last 30 years researchers havediscovered it also contains a natural chemical ingredient called hydroxycitricacid. This substance, when prepared synthetically (commercially called Citrin®) can make major changes in how much youweigh and whether you gain any more unplanned weight. When taken as a dietary supplement, Citrin can accelerate fat-burning, preventyour body from making new fat tissue, block fatty acid ken as a dietarysupplement, Citrin can accelerate fat-burning, prevent your body from makingnew fat tissue, block fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, supress appetite, and promote cardiovascular health, according to a number of studies. In a 1987 study of obese men, taking 800 mg daily for 1 week produced an average weight loss of 3.5 pounds a man. A 1994 study of 75 volunteers supportedCitrin's reputation as a weight-loss leader. In this study there were 60 womenand 15 men, ages 21-65 and weighing 135 to 253 pounds. They took a Citrinsupplement that included 250 mg of hydroxycitrate and 100 mcg of chromium. Although all were reasonably healthy, 74% had higher than normal blood lipidlevels and 53% were on prescription drugs for either elevated lipids or beingoverweight. After 8 weeks on the program, 42 people, or about 55%, lost an average of 10.8pounnds each;11 showed important drops in their cholesterol and triglyceride levels; and 8had significant reductions in their blood glucose levels. For the approximately 50% of American women and 25% of men who are on some kindof diet every day, perhapsthis obscure ingredient from the rind of anIndian evergreen tree may hold an answer to losing weight naturally.

The "Dancing Mushroom" May Be The New Healing King Prized for centuries by Japanese herbalists for its ability to strengthen health, Maitake mushroom (which means "dancing mushroom") is now being investigated in Japanand America for its healing abilities in a number of diseases. AIDS. A maitake extract can prevent the destruction of certain immune cells (T-helperlymphocytes) by HIV by as much as 97% and it also appears to reduce the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma. DIABETES. Studies with mice show that maitake can keep blood glucose levels from rising and keep blood serum insulin and triglyceride levels lower by almost 50%. WEIGHT LOSS. A Japanese researcher gave 30 patients a powdered maitakesuplement at the rate of 20 tablets daily of 500 mgeach for 2 months; no other factors in their diets were changed. All 30 patients lost from1.4-5.5 lbs or about 2.3-2.7 lbs on the average per person. UTERINE FIBROIDS. An American M.D. gave my maitake to 6 patients with uterine fibroids at therate of 2 tablet, 3 times daily (3 g). After 6-12 months on this program, none of the womenrequired surgery and all of them had substantial reduction in fibroid size. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. In over 30 cases, maitake mushrooms gradually decreased hig blood pressure to normal levels. A woman, age 61, had taken hypotensive drugs for 20 years but could never get her systolic blood pressure lower than 150; it was usually 190. Aftertaking maitake at 5 g daily for 30 days, it went down to 130. A man, age 73, saw his blood pressure drop from 170 to 128 after taking 4 g daily foronly 3 weeks. A diabetic man, age 45, reduced his blood glucose from 139 to 80 and his blood pressure from 165to 132 after only 3 weeks, taking 4 g daily. A heavy drinker, aeavy drinker, a and his blood pressure from 165 to 132after only 3 weeks, taking 4 g daily. A heavy drinker, age 48, dropped his blood pressurefrom 180 to 130 in only 2 weeks at the rate of 3 g daily of maitake. Maitake is available in tablet form as Grifron® from Maitake Products, P.O.

Fast Wound Healing With Amino Acids Next time you have a serious wound or altogether unavoidable surgery, consider the merits of L-arginine,an amino acid, to speed up your wound healing. Normally, you consume about 5 g a day of L-arginine in the average Western diet.In addition, your kidney makes more, synthesizing it from its precursor,L-citrulline. But when your body sustains an injury or surgical cal wound, youneed a lot more L-arginine to keep all systems running smoothly. Otherwise, youstart losing nitrogen and body weight. Numerous studies show the benefits of taking supplemental L-arginine before andafter surgery. Surgical patients who took 15 grams daily of L-arginine for 3 days lost much less nitrogen (important to woundhealing) than patients under conventional nutrition. Patients undergoingsurgery for gastrointestinal tumors who took 25 g a day for 7 days had a muchimproved nitrogen balance a week after surgery than those who had no supplementation. Probably the most impressive study came out in Surgery in 1990. Here, 36patients were divided into 3 groups: one group had a placebo; a second took 17g of L-arginine daily; and the third took 24.8 g-all for 14 days. All thesubjects were surgically wounded, then the scientists sat back to watch thehealing process. Both L-arginine groups showed enhanced wound healing and asignificant increase in the amount of collagen made at the wound site, a keyindex for wound healing. Besides accelerating wound healing, L-arginine seems to enhance the size andfunction of the thymus gland, which is a vital player in the human immunesystem. The amino acid also appears to stimulate the release of growth hormonefrom the pituitary gland in the brain. This fact alone may account for thepositive effect of L-arginine on both wound healing and immune systemenhancement. Medical researchers speculate that one of the main reasons for the decline ofboth immune function and muscular strength with age is because of a dramaticdrop in growth hormone secretion. This implies that L-arginine supplementationmay have an anti-aging effect on the body.

Cancer Remedy-From the Throats of Cows to You Long before there was shark cartilage, there was cartilage from the trachea ofcows. One hundred cases suggest that bovinetracheal cartilage may gain its rightful place in the roster of effectiveanti-cancer remedies. Back in 1954, John F. Prudden, M.D., discovered that bovine cartilage had aremarkable ability to help wounds heal faster. In fact, bovine tracheal cartilagetoday is one of the few substances proven to accelerate wound healing, which iswhy most surgical textbooks mention it. But Dr. Prudden became deeply intriguedwith the wider therapeutic potential of this obscure substance. When he watchedit dramatically shrink a breast tumor and reduce the malignant ulceration of thechest wall of a desperate patient, he was hooked for life. Since the 1950s, Dr. Prudden has sponsored more than $7 million worth ofclinical studies and documentented 100 cases in which bovine tracheal cartilagemade a big difference in treating cancer. Not surprisingly, William Lane,Ph.D, the proponent of shark cartilage, acknowledges that Dr. Prudden is "thefather of cartilage therapy." A quick look at Dr. Prudden's case book helps makethe point. In a now classic study released in 1985, Dr. Prudden reported on the results ofa trial with 31 cancer patients all of whom had failed to respond toconventional therapies or had a cancer that was not treatable at all. After starting a regimen of cartilage-typically 9 grams daily, takenorally in 3 g installments 3 times daily-90% of the patients had a partial orcomplete response. Dr. Prudden also reports success in causing a large rectal tumor to disappear,leaving the patient cancer-free for 18 yearsafter treatment. Bovine cartilage produced a complete healing of breast cancerafter all other therapies failed; this patient remained free of cancer for 10years until her death from other causes. A man with prostatic cancer thathad spread to the bones had a complete remission. As impressive as these early results sound, bovine tracheal cartilage is not a cancer curebut a successful palliation. It's not, strictly speaking, a cure because patients whorespond to it must continue taking it at the rate of 9 g daily for the rest of their lives to avoid a possible remission. It alsotakes up to 4 months for the initial positive effects to show up in the system, Dr. Pruddenadvises. In more than 25 years, hehas never observed any toxic side effect from using bovine cartilage, even with doses 3 times as high as the therapeuticdose. While shark cartilage is grabbing the lion's share of media attention thesedays, there are certain facts about bovine cartilage that may recommend it as aworthy contender inthe cartilage-against-cancer field. For example, while it takes about 70 g of shark cartilage to get healingresults, you need only 9 grams of bovine cartilage. In terms of how much you need totake (therapeutic dose), bovine cartilage is 4 times less expensive than sharkcartilage. Shark cartilage is 22% calcium, which puts 14 times the normal RDAfor calcium into your system which might be too much. By comparision, bovine cartilage at therapeutic dosagehas only 10% of the calcium RDA and it contains a chelating substance that helpsremove excess calcium from your system.

Prudden, "The Treatment of Human Cancer with Agents Preparedfrom Bovine Cartilage," Journal of Biological Response Modifiers, Vol. 4, pp.551-84, 1985, and recen A 2000 Year Old Medicine from Deer Antlers The cartilage of antlers fm the velvet deer is poised to be one of the most versatile multipurposenatural remedies to arrive in the West. The Chinese have known about it for atleast 2 millennia according to an ancient medical scroll that recommends it for52 health problems. Russsians haveused velvet deer antler for decades, especially as an endurance-buildingsupplement called Pantocrine for athletes. And for those living in Asia, Korea,and New Zealand, velvet deer antler is a medicinal food in high demand. The medicinal claims for velvet deer antler are comprehensive and ambitious, and preliminaryresearch tends to support most of them. Among the numerous claims, velvet deer antler can: increase the quality and quantity of blood production in treating kidneydisorders and anemia; treat infertility in women and impotence in men; modulate the immune system, bringing it back to an even keel when it it'sdepressed or overactive; improve blood circulation, reverse atherosclerosis, and possibly reduce theincidence of fatal heart attacks; increase muscular strength and nerve function; and generally boost energy. In 1992, a New Zealand magazine published a story about a woman who cured her arthritis after taking velvet deer antler for 2 years. The story also chronicled a woman with multiplesclerosis who reduced her aches and pains by taking the substance for 2 years. What's in the antlers that can produce effects like these? Cartilage, for one,which contains a substance which speeds up wound healing. The antlers also contain an anti-inflammatorysubstance (chondroitin sulfate) that in concentrated form has been shown toreduce the incidence of fatal heart attacks reportedly by 400%, according toone 6 year study. A natural growth is found in high levels in velvet deerantlers; this substance helps to keep the body lean and the muscles well-developed. Velvet deer antler is available as a powdered capsule (250 mg each) from theProlongevity brand. The recommended dosage is 1-4 capsules per day for 4 weeks followed by 1 week off; users are advised that it may take 6-12 weeks to notice effects.

He had peptic ulcers,chronic constipation and flatulence; he was hyperactive as a child but lethargic as anadult; and he had excessive exposure to toxic chemicals and had taken a great deal ofantibiotics. His body itched all over from eczema. Allergy shots only made him feelworse. He was easily irritated, shouted a lot, and felt little self-confidence. It took 2 different remedies to help him. First his homeopath gave him Lycopodium, whichis made from Club Moss, and this improved his energy, digestion, and moods for severalmonths. Then he had several doses of Theridion, made from the venom of the orange spider,and this cleared up nearly all his symptoms. This relatively fast improvement is remarkable considering how many layers of physicaland emotional illness this man was living with. -SOURCE: Simillimum: The Journal of the Homeopathic Academy of Naturopathic Physicians.

Patients who had been diagnosed as having senile dementia took 80 mg ofGingko biloba extract 3 times daily for 3 months; they showed marked improvements inmemory and attention, as well as mind and body coordination. Ginkgo is gaining a reputation for success in the early stages of senile dementia as away of slowing down its development and improving the quality of life among the afflictedelderly. Not only is Gingko now proven to be useful in slowing down the development ofAlzheimer's but it is generally recognized as a brain power-building herb that canenhance mental abilities in healthy adults. In some people, a high dosage can producebrief headaches or dizziness; if this happens, start lower at 120 mg daily then climb to240 mg daily over a period of 6-8 weeks. -SOURCES: Townsend Letter for Doctors, February/March 1995, p. 158.

ANXIETY Valerian root, used in combination with either lemon balm or passion flower, is a safeand effective way to reduce general anxiety or to withdraw from anti-anxietymedications. One study, based on measuring brain wave activity, showed that a combinationof valerian root (100 mg) and passion flower (45 mg) taken 6 times daily lowered thebrain waves of patients into a more relaxed zone (called alpha and theta) in only 2 weekscompared to the conventional medications that took 6 weeks. Used on its own, valerian is one of the best nervine herbs for treating problems with thenervous system, stress conditions, pain, and childhood behavioral disorders. A study of120 children who exhibited a wide range of behavioral problems showed that after takingvalerian for only 3 weeks, 75% showed a marked improvement. Recommended dosage forextract is 10-20 drops mixed with water, taken 3 times daily. For children, ages 7-14,use half this amount. -SOURCE: Quarterly Review of Natural Medicine, Fall 1994, pp. 221-224. Alternative &Complementary Therapies, October 1994, pp. 48-49. ATHSMA Playing and listening to music may be the newest way to successfully treat asthma. A man,age 33, had been suffering from bronchial asthma for seven years. He had frequentasthmatic attacks, especially when he was exposed to cold weather, and it would take himmonths to recover. He had tried all sorts of therapies, including antibiotics, massage,diet, aromatherapy baths, but nothing helped him. Finally he turned to music therapy aspracticed in anthroposophic therapy. For 30 minutes once a week, he worked with a music therapist, alternating betweenlistening to music and playing it. His therapist played live music for him, using wind or string instruments and percussion-but she played it to his back while he listenedattentively. The idea is that the live flow of pure musical sounds worked therapeuticallyon his chest and back and thus on his breathing. He also learned to play a copper flutewhich demanded a special breathing technique. Both approaches improved his breathing andreduced stress. After only a few sessions, he felt more relaxed, his breathing had eased up, and hissense of well-being increased. After 6 months he told his therapist that music therapywas the only approach that had given him good results. During the 18 months of musictherapy, he didn't have a single asthma attack, nor did he have any in the yearsfollowing.

ATHLETE'S FOOT Mark, age 22, had lived with athlete's foot for about 3 years when he met up with anaromatherapist. This was the prescription: do footbaths twice daily with 8-10 drops of tea tree oil in alarge basin of water; put a tea tree oil compress on the most afflicted toes at night;apply an aqueous cream made of 15 drops of tea tree oil to 50 g of body cream; wear onlycotton socks and change them every day; put 6-8 drops of tea tree oil in your bath waterevery night; and wash hands regularly in a basin of water to which 3 drops of tea treeoil have been added. It worked. Within 1 week, the infection on one foot was nearly cleared up and the other foot showedgreat progress. Within a month, or after Mark's fourth aromatherapy session, hisathlete's foot condition was history. -SOURCE: The International Journal of Aromatherapy, Vol. 6, No. 2. 1994, pp. 24-25. CANCER Ever since 1920, European M.D.s have been using mistletoe to successfuly extend the livesof cancer patients. Originally conceived by Austrian scientist Rudolf Steiner, thetherapeutic success of mistletoe-better known by its trademarked name, Iscador-has nowbeen reported in over 4600 case studies. Iscador (which is injected as a serum) bothinhibits the growth of malignant cancer cells and often actually destroys them. Ifanything, it is the fabled "magic bullet" so passionately sought after by conventionalmedicine. After more than 70 years of continuous use, the effectiveness of Iscador in cancertreatment is generally considered well proven in Europe. Even so, it's still not licensedby the FDA for use in the U.S. There is no argument that Iscador definitely gives the cancer patient more months, evenyears, of life, ranging from 4 to 44 months depending on the type of cancer. With breast cancer, one study showed that more of 319 patients treated with Iscador werealive after 10 years than 228 patients who had no Iscador. Those with cervical cancer whohad a combination of surgery, Iscador, and radiation therapy showed an 83% survival rateafter 5 years compared to a 69% survival rate for those who had radiation alone. Iscador seems to block the development of bladder papillomas into malignant tumors.Normally 50% of these become malignant in 3 years, but with Iscador, only 3 out of 14did. Of patients with bronchial cancer, 75% of those under Iscador treatment were still aliveafter 4 years compared to only 35% of those without Iscador. With skin cancer, thesurvival rate after 3 years for those on Iscador was 80% compared to 65% for thosewithout it. Iscador gets its best results with solid tumors that do not respond well tochemotherapy or radiation, but it does not do well against leukemia or acute lymph nodecancers. Mistletoe, or Iscador, is available in the U.S. for use by qualified health carepractitioners in the form of Viscum Compositum (as liquid for oral use) from BHI, Inc.,11600 Cochiti S.E., Albuquerque, NM, 87123. tel: 800-621-7644.

WEIGHT LOSS A combination of 3 herbs from classical Indian, or Ayurvedic, herbalism can produce good results in a weight loss program. In one study, 48 obese people used 1 of 3 Ayurvedic herbal mixtures, including Triphalaguggul, Gokshuradi guggul, or Sinhanad guggul, taking them 3 times daily for 3 months.Their average weight loss was 8 kg compared to only 2 kg in a group taking a placebo.They experienced no loss of appetite or changes in blood pressure (although 20%experienced some diarrhea), and many saw a lowering of their blood cholesterol levels.

Americans are telling the pollsters they're not satisfied with their conventionaldoctors. They're getting better results with alternative physicians, they're placing muchmore confidence in alternative medicine, and keeping they're options open. That's whattwo different consumer polls recently revealed. TOO MANY M.D.s DON'T LISTEN TO THEIR PATIENTS A new survey of 70,000 readers of Consumer Reports, probably the largest survey conductedto date on the doctor-patient relationship, reveals that many patients feel theirconventional M.D.s are not open to their questions or views and don't give them enough(or any) advice on how to have a healthy lifestyle. The survey shows that too manyconventional doctors don't know how to talk with their patients or how to work with themcooperatively in the healing process. These are "potentially serious problems," the studyconcluded. The greatest patient grumbling is in the area of chronic ailments for which no standardtreatment is available. In the past year, 23% of patients were disatisfied with theirconventional doctor over poor results for chronic headache, 28% for lower back pain, 15%for depression, 14% for arthritis and intestinal problems, 12% for allergies, and 11% forcancer and respiratory problems. Patients of mainstream M.D.s are also complaining about problems in the examining room.Many doctors, they feel, do not put the patient first. Among the patient gripes withtheir regular doctors, 29% said the M.D. didn't seek their opinion or explain lifestylechanges that might improve the problem; 26% complained their doctors didn't go over thepossible side-effects of the drugs; 22% said their doctors never took a complete medicalhistory; 20% found their doctors discouraged patient questions; and 15% said theirdoctors didn't seem to care about the patient's emotional well-being. The writing isdefinitely on the waiting room walls. A separate survey of 600 people dramatically shows that patients are asking questions,demanding information, and keeping their alternatives open. In this group, 65% askedtheir doctors to explain unfamiliar terms; 62% asked about side-effects and alternativesto the drugs prescribed; 50% wanted to know about risks in surgery; 48% did their ownindependent research on their condition. The survey also showed that 44% asked about alternatives to the standard tests or surgeryor wanted to know; 44% wanted to know about other treatments available; 43% queried theirM.D.'s experience in similar cases; 36% wrote their questions down in advance; 26% tooknotes on their office visit; 25% complained that what their doctor recommended wasn'tworking; 19% asked to see their medical records. Clearly the days of the passive,compliant patient are history. PATIENTS WANT ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE-Their Office Visits Prove It SELF Magazine polled its readers, mostly upmarket, well-educated, professional,forty-something women, about their opinions and practices regarding alternative medicine.The findings are good news indeed for the medical alternative. When SELF asked its readers if they had ever consulted an alternative practitioner, 84%said yes. When asked what they thought of alternative medicine in general, 53% saidsometimes it works, sometimes not; but 36% admitted they have more faith in it than inconventional medicine; 8% worried about possible dangers to its use; and only 2% wereopenly skeptical. So much for the "unproven quackery" issue that opponents ofalternative medicine so often insist on. Among the most popular alternative therapies consulted are chiropractic (60%), massage(58%), herbalism (42%), relaxation techniques (40%), acupuncture (30%), and reflexology(24%). But among those disciplines SELF readers haven't yet tried but would like to,acupuncture ranked highest. Regarding cures with alternative therapies, 75% said they knew someone (includingthemselves) who had been cured, while only 25% said they had been disappointed by theresults. Then came the clincher: When asked on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest,how much confidence do you place in conventional medicine, only 11% gave it the highestmarks. But when asked the same question about alternative medicine, 30% ranked it incategory 5. In other words, these well-informed health care consumers have 3 times moreconfidence in alternative medicine than in the conventional approaches. The Key to Real Freedom of Choice in Medical Care The real politics of medicine in the 1990s is not about who is going to pay the $1trillion annual health care bill, but why there isn't a cheaper, more effectivealternative. Alternative medicine, as many now know, is that more effective alternative,yet the key issue nobody is talking about is this: how come it's not more widelyavailable in every state and how come the insurance companies aren't paying for it whenit would save them money? The reason is a little known political fact that took shape in the 1920s and has neverbeen changed since. It's called the Medical Practices Acts. These were similar lawspassed by all the States to insure that only M.D.s could be licensed and thuslegitimately practice medicine. The idea was to deliberately set up a medical monopolythat favored conventional doctors. The idea was also to keep homeopaths, naturopaths,herbalists, and chiropractors out of the marketplace by regulating the licensing ofphysicians. The practical result is that there is no free and open competition in the Americanmedical marketplace. You have the right to choose your physician, provided it is anallopathic M.D., but you cannot, in most cases, choose between an M.D. and an N.D.(naturopath) and expect to get insurance reimbursement. Freedom of choice is available in most areas of American life except medicine. There itis tightly held by the conventional medical establishment and the strong economic andpolitical interests supporting it. Repeal of the Medical Practices Acts, at the statelevel, would throw the medical marketplace open to free competition among all the medicalspecialities-for the first time in 100 years. The alternative would quickly become the new mainstream, just as it did in 1830's Americawhen the M.D.s had a similar "death-grip" on medicine and were faced with honestcompetition from a new wave of homeopaths and herbalists. What happened 160 years agoought to happen again: "The public, disgusted with the maltreatment it was receiving,stripped the licensed profession of its legal protection and threw the practice ofmedicine open to all comers," says medical historian Harris Coulter, Ph.D. -SOURCE: Divided Legacy: Twentieth Century Medicine-;The Bacteriological Era. A History ofthe Schism in Medical Thought, Vol. IV, Harris L. Coulter, North Atlantic Books andCenter for Empirical Medicine, Berkeley, CA, 1994. America's Gestapo, The FDA, Strikes Again-With No Basis While Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D., was on CBS' This Morning March 24 in New YorkCity, proudly presenting 3 of his cancer patients whom he had healed with hisantineoplaston therapy, the Fda barged into his Houston offices with a search warrant andseized 15 patient records. FDA officials claimed Dr. Burzynski was "illegally" shippinghis medicines interstate. However, they evidently forgot that they had alreadycommissioned Dr. Burzynski as a special clinical investigator with the legal right toship his medicines interstate to patients. In their desperate zeal to squash allsuccessful alternatives, the FDA doesn't hesitate to break even their own rulings. CANCER RESEARCH DEADEND For the last 40 years, cancer research has been based on a false model of biology-no wonder it's failed to come up with any cures. Imagine if the prevailing theory in astronomy were still the incorrect notion that theSun revolves around the Earth. Would you trust the findings and techniques that came outof such a clearly mistaken view? Yet for the last 40 years cancer research has beenfounded on a similarly mistaken model. As 500,000 die from cancer every year, the medicalestablishment wages its costly but ineffectual "war against cancer" based on a completelyfalse model. That model is based on studying cancer cells in a petri dish, far removed from theircontext, the living human body. This procedure is called "cell lines" and has beenfavored by cancer researchers for decades. The trouble is, it has nothing to do with thereality of cancer within the body. Cell lines represent a unique new form of life that has very little to do with thereality of cancer. Cancer cells implanted in a petri dish do things cells never doanywhere else: they don't die. They are immortal. Their behavior is completely differentthan cells in a living body. And some of them are 40 years old. In 1951, cells from the cancerous cervix of Helen Lane were removed from her body afterdeath at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. They were placed in a petri dishand allowed to grow. This was the first cell line, now called HeLa, and 44 years later,cancer researchers around the world are still using descendants (cell lines) from heroriginal tumor. In other words, hardly any cancer research is done on freshly obtainedmalignant cells. Virtually the entire multibillion dollar cancer research edifice is founded on thiserroneous model of biology reports researcher Gerald B. Dermer, Ph.D. Not only that, butmany cancer researchers know the cell line model is incorrect but don't wish to losetheir funding by admitting it publicly. This explains why the leading cancer"therapies," such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation, based on the cell linemodel, work so poorly. The contradictions between the real world of cancer in living men and women and theartificial, theoretical world of cancer in a glass dish is the core of the scandal anddeception in cancer research. Meanwhile, scientists keep the truth under wraps to keep the research dollars flowing.This is the secret of the astonishing failure of cancer research. As one researcherprivately admitted, "The bottom line is dollars." -SOURCE: The Immortal Cell: Why Cancer Research Fails. Dr. Gerald B.

Patricia Kaminski, Richard Katz The Flower Essence Society, P.O. Box 459, Nevada City, CA, 95959; tel: 800-548-0075; 1994,$19.95, 406 pp, paper. Ever since Dr. Edward Bach, an intuitive English physician and botanist, first developed the39 Bach Flower Remedies in the 1930s, the use of liquid extracts made from the subtle energyessences of flowers for natural healing has been gaining momentum in the West. In Americatoday there are some 1600 different individual flower essences now on the market prepared bymore than a dozen companies. But leading the field in terms of research and understanding of the therapeutic marvels offlower essences are Kaminski and Katz. They offer the distilled practical experience of their15 years of study and practice in this new handbook. Since 1980, they have broadened theoriginal Bach repertory to include more than 100 new flower essences made from Americanplants. Flower essences are a do-it-yourself way of virtually redesigning your psyche. With floweressences, you can "address profound issues of emotional well-being, soul development, andmindbody health," Kaminski and Katz explain. After providing the reader with a comprehensiveintroduction to the idea of flower essences and information about how they're made, theauthors devote the rest of the book to making flower essence therapy work for the reader. Allof the essences described in the book are available in natural foods stores or by mail-order. Of immense value here is their alphabetical organization of problems and conditions, withcross references to all the flower essences that are useful in each case. Have a problemwith procrastination? Kaminski and Katz briefly outline 6 flower essences that can help,depending on the nuance of your avoidance behavior. If you put off action out of fear offailure or lack of self-confidence, then Larch may be your flower essence. Turn to Larch inthe Repertory and you get a half page of lucid description of this flower essence and theunderlying nature of this kind of procastination. This feature alone makes the book one of the most user-friendly self-help natural healingbooks around today. Flower essences are part of an emerging field of "non-invasive,life-enhancing subtle vibrational therapies," write Kaminski and Katz, "which promises tomake a major contribution to health care in coming years." When this comes to pass, it willbe due in no small measure to the contributions of this excellent book. Poisonous Metals in Your Head May be Draining Away Your Brain Power Toxic Metal Syndrome:How Metal Poisonings Can Affect Your Brain Dr. R. Richard Casdorph, Dr. Morton Walker Avery Publishing Group, 120 Old Broadway, Garden City Park, NY, 11040; tel: 800-548-5757;1995, $14.95, 413 pp, paper. Having troubles with your memory? Before you bemoan the supposedly inevitable decline of yourbrain power and the slipping away of IQ with age, consider the possibility that your braintissues may be contaminated with heavy metals. New research, summarized in this valuable study from Casdorph and Walker, suggests that toxicmetals such as aluminum, mercury, lead, iron, and cadmium, can accumulate in the brain andproduce an array of behavioral and cognitive problems, from memory loss to Alzheimer's. The toxic metals come from your foods and environment, the air and your cooking utensils,from tap water, prescription drugs, and dental amalgams. They lodge in your brain becauseyour body doesn't have the energy or means to flush them out. But there is a technique thatcan and the authors devote a large portion of the book to explaining how it works and to extolling its successes. It's called chelation, it's been around since 1952, and 1800medical studies have proved that it's effective for treating many conditions (See Ask theHealer, this issue). In the case of brain power decline, chelation gives the Alzheimer's patient an intravenousinfusion of a synthetic amino acid (protein) called EDTA, which stands for ethylene diaminetetra-acetic acid, plus a vitamin and mineral mixture. It works, as numerous case studiespresented here demonstrate. EDTA apparently binds with these toxic metals and carries themout of the brain and into the blood for excretion from the body. According to Casdorph and Walker, "Such findings may make EDTA chelation therapy the bestkept medical secret of the past half-century. The message of this book is that a realbreakthrough exists for stopping the deterioration of cells of the brain." It's a message ofcrucial importance and one the Digest hopes reaches many ears. Taking to the Streets Against the Quackbusters Joseph Lisa, an investigative journalist, has spent the last 25 years probing into thesystematic harassment of practitioners of alternative medicine in America. In this explosivereport, he tells you why and how it happened, all the "dirty politics and dirty tricks," andwho is profiting from it. Read about the conspiracy against chiropractic, the "unholy medlock" between medical vestedinterests and the government, and the "quackbusters" infamous October Plan to bust "healthfraud." Study a handful of harrowing cases in which Lisa shows how the powerful collusiveinterests of conventional medicine snuffed new and promising alternative medical productslike Herbalife and NutriCology, and how they kept naturopaths, homeopaths, and chelationtherapists on the run. Lisa's resume includes time spent as a private detective and "undercover operative" whichexplains his uncanny knack at putting his fingers on the most outrageous and incriminatingdocuments that reveal what the conspirators are doing in the dark. What's it all about? "Thevested interests want the whole pie and thus more of the profits available in the healthcaremarketplace," Lisa says.Reading Lisa is like stumbling upon the secret memos of the CIA regarding their plans for theinternal affairs of small governments. If you've ever protested injustices in your life, likethe Vietnam War or civil rights, this book will surely drive you out into the streets withreawakened 1960's zeal. In case you're feeling complacent or disinterested in politics in the1990s, reading even a couple chapters of Lisa will set a fire under your bottom. In case you find yourself mobilizing in the streets, Lisa has a shopping list of verypolitical and legal steps to take. File a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission;initiate individual and class action lawsuits; look into filing Rico conspiracy and antitrustsuits; write your Congressmen; organize media events; make noise; act up; and don't settlefor less than a radical upheaval of the "medlock" status quo. Wellness Against All Odds Sherry Rogers, M.D. Prestige Publishing, Box 3068, 3500 Brewerton Road, Syracuse, NY, 13220; 800-846-6687;1994, $17.95, 384 pp, paper. Dr. Sherry Rogers, one of the country's leading practitioners of environmental medicine, nowoffers us an excellent new work designed to instruct physicians and patients alike. Dr. Rogers' own story is a classic tale of the wounded healer. Over the years she's struggledto cure herself of serious allergic problems and to understand the mechanisms of illness andtreatment. Even though she is a physician, she understands that, "the patient is the keeperof the keys to wellness." She also knows from her two decades of practice and study that there is "a whole silentunderground of people who have done the impossible"-healed when they shouldn't have, that is,according to conventional medicine. "The patient dedicated to wellness against all oddsactually has to go to medical school, so to speak." Rogers' strong suits are a macrobiotic diet, nutritional supplementation, and systemicdetoxification, for which she provides detailed biochemical reasons. Her new book is richwith techniques for body purification, using enzymes, live juices, bowel cleansing, baths, and nutritional supplementation. Study Rogers: the time it takes for a careful reading is aninvestment that will repay you many times over in better health. Video: Cancer Doesn't Scare Me Anymore! Lorraine Day, M.D., Rockford Press, P.O. Box 952, Rancho Mirage, CA, 92270; VHS-Color, 77 minutes, $19.95. Tel:1-800-574-2437. Cancer doesn't scare Dr. Lorraine Day anymore because like 1 out of every 3 Americans shedeveloped cancer, but unlike most of that vast number, she got well, with no thanks tochemotherapy. She refused conventional medicine's "therapies" for her breast cancer (which she calls the"cut, slash, and burn"approach) and took the route of alternative medicine instead. Today,her woman's body intact, she is back on the job as a prominent orthopedic trauma surgeon.More importantly for the rest of us, she is out there in the public telling people how toovercome cancer using alternative medicine. In this inspiring video, Dr. Day gives it to us straight. As a true physician ought to, shelucidly lays out the politics of the cancer industry that keep most people from learningabout the alternatives. Cancer therapy in the U.S., Day states, is a total monopoly of toxictherapies, a theater of lies and propaganda. How absurd to poison your already weakenedimmune system with chemotherapy in an attempt to get better, she notes. Are alternativemedicine approaches "unproven?" Unproven really means you can't patent them and they arenontoxic. Listening to Dr. Day lay it all out on the table is sobering and refreshing, like an hourspent with a counselor who knows her business, states her facts calmly but with a cuttingwit, and has no tolerance for the incompetencies of conventional medicine. She discusses aseries of holistic approaches for cancer and healthy living, such as nutrition, organicfoods, live juices, coffee enemas, bowel cleanouts, ozone therapy, shark cartilage, greenbarley essence, and others. Take charge of your own health and do it today, says Dr.Day-and, we would add, follow her good example.

Vincent Van Gogh, the renowned artist who committed suicide aftersuccumbing to a lifetime of schizophrenia, could have been curedof this disease with something very simple. As a nurse working in a psychiatric hospital, I feel frustratedat the seeming hopelessness of the schizophrenic patient. It issuffering on the scale of a chronic nightmare, a living death.The brain is without thought much of the time and the body withoutits senses. Worse still, the fragments of thought that remainare scattered messages produced by the chaotic firing of braincells. For years you give the patient increasingly more drugs only tosee her become more vegetable-like or childlike in her handicaps.I should know, because I lived the schizophrenic's nightmare for10 years. It began when I was a teenager. I was 16 when I was first diagnosedwith schizophrenia. I spent many days in the hospital, being treatedwith many types of medicines, psychotherapy, even two series ofelectroshock. Still I kept deteriorating. My appetite was enormousbut I kept resisting the urge to eat so I could stay skinny. Ihad been on a crash weight-loss diet since I was 15. Finally, when I was 19 and in the hospital again, I gave in, atea lot, and gained 30 pounds in a few weeks. Strangely, my psychologicalsymptoms went into remission until I returned to my weight lossdiet. When my slender figure returned so did my schizophrenia. The strange connection alerted my parents and physician that nutritionmust play an important role in my illness. For better or worse,this would be the first of a long series of experimental nutritionalprograms my parents put me through in an attempt to heal me. In the fall of 1975, when I was 21, I was hospitalized again andput on mega-vitamin therapy plus major tranquilizers. Unfortunately,the strong doses of vitamins (especially niacin) irritated mystomach and I began vomiting so severely I had to be fed intravenouslyand treated with anti-nausea injections. When I was medicallystable again, a nutritionist told me that caffeine, sugar, additives,and preservatives were toxic to the schizophrenic's brain-meaningmine. This angered me because at that time I craved sodas andI thought my doctor must be a quack for suggesting that I eliminatethem. The next stage in my long journey towards healing was to havefood sensitivity tests under the care of a renowned nutritionexpert. I was hospitalized again. There I was given small dosesof tranquilizers, intramuscular megavitamin injections 2-3 timesweekly. I was put on a rotation diet based on natural foods andwithout sugar or caffeine. For the first time I showed some improvement.In fact, I felt so much better that I actually wanted to helpmyself get better. For the first time, instead of longing to die,I desired to be well. Once I left the hospital, however, it became difficult to getthe necessary megavitamin injections. With this, plus the strenuousdiet and managing a daily intake of numerous pills, I grew discouragedand began to go downhill again. My mother obtained a referral to Dr. Francis Waickman, M.D., animmunologist and pediatrician practicing in Akron, Ohio. Dr. Waickmantested me for food sensitivity by placing food concentrates undermy tongue. The idea here is that if you have a brain allergy,the food substances will have a toxic affect on your brain's biochemistry.My brain-was allergic to many foods, it turned out. Frankly, during those years I felt like a human guinea pig. Minewas a life of lengthy hospital stays, treatments, brain studies,drugs, diets, and multiple vitamins. It seemed nearly all foodswere my brain's enemy. I used to say to myself: "If I'm notmeant to eat, I'm not meant to live!" I felt very unfreebeing locked up all the time. I say "unfree" because, unlike the patient with canceror high blood pressure who can choose a treatment approach, the hospitalized psychiatric patient is not given a choice. The patientis forced to take medications; alternative treatments are noteven discussed. Therefore, many psychiatric patients are neveraware of the alternatives and remain locked in a treatment lifestylethat has no possibility of a cure. All the years that I was ill, I fought against the medicines.Even in my illness, I always had a bad sense about the conventionaldrugs. In fact, many psychiatric patients refuse their medicines.The main reason, I believe, is that the medicine actually makesthem feel worse, as the side-effects from such drugs can be severeand dangerous. Let me suggest what it's like to be hospitalized as a mental patient,as I was, off and on, between the ages of 16 and 25. First ofall, I was devastated at being in the mental hospital. My lifestarted fading into a mist, that became thicker every day. Daysdisappeared into blackness, and the days when I could think, mythoughts were only garbled messages. My vision was so distorted that the rough plaster walls of theinstitution seemed to smother me as if I were trapped in a cave.I constantly had nausea; noises buzzed in my ears; voices echoedthroughout my mind. My muscles were always quivering and my nervesfelt like they were full of squirming maggots. My brain filledwith explosive pressure. I laughed when I wanted to cry. A near-comawith a zombie-like stare lasting for hours-this was the only calmI had. I suppose I was lucky not to know that the worst of all the researchon my behalf was yet to come. "Mine was a life of lengthy hospital stays, treatments, brainstudies, drugs, diets, and multiple vitamins. Frankly, I feltlike a human guinea pig. Yet one week on Dr. Rudin's simple programof omega-3 and omega-6 oils, plus vitamin E, and my 10 year psychosissubsided, never to return again." When I was 24, I entered a double-blind research study using kidneydialysis for schizophrenia. I was taken off all my medications;the treatment was very long and complicated and I almost diedat one point. The kidney dialysis was thought to wash toxins outof the blood stream that had accumulated from foods to which thepatient was allergic. The trouble with this is that valuable nutrients are flushed fromthe body leaving you exhausted, especially after being attachedto a machine for 6 hours at a time, twice a week. After 10 monthsof this approach, I was ready to give up altogether, not to mentionthe fact that as I was not, technically, a kidney patient, insurancefunds did not cover this procedure. I was still sick, but my parents and I pieced together at least3 major components in my schizophrenia. There is a genetic factor,as there is a family pattern to this illness; there is the allergyfactor, which means an altered immune system; and there is a nutritionallink. This third link, at last, led me to the doctor who finallyhelped me heal. An article my parents read out to me from a mental health bulletincaught my attention. The author, Dr. Donald O. Rudin, M.D., describeda kidney disease that is generated by an immune system disorderthat then mimics the symptoms of schizophrenia. My mother calledDr. Rudin at once. He told her he suspected that schizophrenia might involve a deficiencyin an essential fatty acid from the omega-3 family of oils (foundin borage and flax plants, among others), also called linolenicacid. Dr. Rudin recommended that we buy food-grade linseed oilas this contains adequate amounts of this nutrient. Dr. Rudin also asked my mother if I had moments of lucidity duringeach 24 hour cycle. She said yes. He reasoned that with even 5minutes a day of being psychologically stable, it would mean therecould not be permanent brain damage. It could also mean I stooda better chance at recovery. I must admit at first the whole idea sounded bizarre. Both mymother and I were skeptical. Was this doctor a mad scientist pushingsome kind of snake oil? After all the research trials I had beenthrough, surely this was the silliest idea yet. I tried Dr. Rudin's approach anyway. I took 2 tablespoons of linseedoil plus a vitamin E supplement which acted as a catalyst. "Ohwell, how could it hurt me?" I said to myself. Thirty minuteslater I noticed how calm I was becoming. The sensation of wormsin my nerves and quivering in my muscles diminished considerably.After one week on this simple program, my 10 year psychosis subsided,never to return again. Each day as I took the linseed oil, other symptoms went away.For years I had slept under a heap of blankets, even in the summer.Now my body thermostat was improving and I wasn't always chilled.My vision improved, my hearing became more acute, and the "cobwebs"disappeared from my mind. As my chronic fatigue subsided, I beganfeeling radiant. I could sleep without any medications. I couldconcentrate my attention at will. Laughter was suddenly beautiful,and my emotions were intact and appropriate for the first timein my adult life. That was in 1980 and I've been free of schizophrenia ever since.Not only was I cured of my 10 years of schizophrenia, but my yearsof acting as a medical guinea pig actually paid a dividend. Iwas Dr. Rudin's case #1 in a breakthrough cure for this devastatingdisease. I became the living example of the missing nutritional link in this mental illness. He wrote up my case in his first book andhas since documented good results with 44 patients suffering abroad range of health problems. In fact, Dr. Rudin labelled mynutritional deficiency as "substrate pellagra." Pellagrawas once a common but dangerous illness brought on by a B-vitamindeficiency; it could produce symptoms including insanity. For the record, I should mention that it took a little experimentingto get the right dosage level of omega-3 fatty acids. Too muchis as bad as too little. If you take too much omega-3, you canbecome toxic and start showing symptoms such as fatigue, severeheadaches, even return of symptoms. It's best to start with a low dose and increase it gradually,according to how your body responds to it. My vitamin E dosagebegan at 200-600 I.U. daily, then was cut back to 200-400 I.U.per day. After my original high dose of omega-3s, I no longerneeded to take them regularly, except on occasion. I took my linseedoil in complement with fish oil capsules, starting with a strongdose (such as 6 capsules of linseed oil, 3 of fish oil, daily)and gradually dropping back to a lower dose (3 linseed and 1 fishoil capsules per week). The linseed oil, which comes from theflaxseed plant, contains alpha linolenic acid which regulatesthe immune system and helps to balance the activity of neurotransmitters(special brain chemicals). Bear in mind that the cure for schizophrenia is not just a matterof shoring up your body's supply of a few missing nutrients. itis also a matter of balancing the immune system. This involvesthe careful balancing of two essential fatty acid families, theomega-3s and omega-6s, as part of a special dietary program thatincludes a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, mental health professionals lack essential knowledgein managing psychiatric patients. I became a nurse in 1987 andhave worked with both cancer and psychiatric patients since then.There are days I hold back the tears for those who are a mirrorimage of what I once was. During my recovery, I developed into a whole and new person. Mythoughts changed so drastically, it was as if I had been givena new brain. Even so, it took me 8 years before I could look ata painting by Vincent Van Gogh again without catching my breath,for I could feel every nauseating, demented horror of his insanityas he portrayed it on canvas. And I now know that without thegrace of a simple vegetable oil and an insightful alternativephysician, I might have hit the same dead end as Van Gogh.

Rudin, M.D. Debi Erin is a lovely, bright, and vivacious young woman. She has shown courage andintelligence in recounting her own story. For a number of years, she has been asuccessful nurse. But for a decade, starting in her mid-teens, she suffered fromwhat can only be called, in lay terms, the "horrors." She was repeatedly hospitalized and treated by a dozen different psychiatrists forschizophrenia, a diagnosis which seems as accurate as any other, for she wasafflicted by daily visual and sometimes auditory hallucinations, intrusive thinkingand compulsive behavior including attacks forcing her into a peculiar sideways walk,in addition to head-banging and other violent behavior. She also had a wide varietyof physical disorders, some probably related to immune system problems; all of themwere aspects of her mental illness. Debi fell into the group of about 30% of schizophrenics who neither deteriorate norspontaneously recover but show a more or less constant illness pattern over theyears. Consistently, she remained intellectually bright and had insight into herillness, recognizing that she was "crazy." While this gave hope that she couldrecover, it meant that she experienced the "horrors" of it all, for she knew when shewas hallucinating and consciously suffered the many other aspects of her illness. Under the guidance of a devoted mother and father, Debi submitted to every treatmentknown, from antipsychotic drugs to dialysis. While the dialysis helped temporarilyfor a few days after treatment, nothing gave her permanent relief. Most observerswere convinced she would be severely ill for the rest of her life. At this point in her prolonged illness, I was contacted by her astute and dedicatedmother who had read some of my publications dealing with what I considered to be thenutritional missing link in the diet. This is the omega-3 oils orultrapolyunsaturates (alpha-linolenic acid), which are about 80% depleted in themodern diet. This means we obtain only 20% of these essential fatty acids, so necessary for optimal health, in our standardAmerican diet. They're depleted as a result of hydrogenation, oil refining, and the consumption ofwarm-climate foods and oils by people of cold-climate, or northern extraction,especially if they're still living in the north. Moreover, this family of essentialnutrients seems to be especially important for primates in brain function. Yet mostnutritionists have missed it all. Although I had seen remarkable improvement of a variety of physical disorders onomega-3 dietary supplements, Erin was my first patient with a mental disorder. Herfavorable response, starting with the first tablespoon of food grade linseed oil-thiswas a traditional cooking oil in common use before 1940-was one of the great thrillsof my life. For the sake of the patient, of course, we physicians are supposed tokeep such feelings to ourselves. Over the the next year, Erin learned to adjust her dosage level while all hersymptoms gradually improved. For many years now, she has been almost entirelysymptom-free, leading a productive life to the astonishment of her friends andpsychiatrists. After working with Erin, I suspect that a significant fraction of modern illness iscaused by an extensive omega-3 essential fatty acid deficiency. All of this produces what can best be called the Modernization Disease Syndrome,possibly the single most common cause of illness today and one afflicting every organsystem depending on genetic susceptibility. This is, in every way, the parallel ofthe catastrophic vitamin deficiency syndromes of the last century and the early partof this one, e.g., pellagra and BY Donald O. Rudin, beriberi, which were caused byindiscriminate food refining. EDITOR'S NOTE: This article was adapted from Dr. Rudin's Foreword to Debi Erin'sbook. Donald O. Rudin, M.D., a graduate of Harvard Medical School and former directorof the Department of Molecular Biology at Eastern Psychiatric Institute inPhiladelphia, has been researching essential fatty acids and health since 1956.Dr. Rudin is the author of The Omega-3 Phenomenon: The Nutritional Breakthrough of the 80s (1987) and The Omega-3 Oils (Avery, 1995).

There is the surprise,the pain, the swelling, itching, redness, and then it's gone.But can you imagine voluntarily stinging yourself with the venomof a honey-bee to heal yourself of arthritis, chronic pain, psoriasis,headache, tendonitis, or multiple sclerosis? In fact, patients with multiple sclerosis who use bee therapytake about 4000 stings a year, at the rate of 20-40 live bee stingsper sitting, three times a week. Using bee stings for medicinalpurposes (called apitherapy) is clearly not for the faint-hearted,but then who would rather be sick for life when after a few pinpricksyou could enjoy dramatic improvement? Evidently quite a lot of people think the cure is worth the sting.The American Apitherapy Society in Vermont, which has 1600 members,estimates that some 10,000 Americans, mostly lay practitioners,now practice bee sting therapy. As one bee therapist comments,bee venom is a "gift from God"-it's not patentable andit's available to everyone. While the medicinal uses of bee products are known widely aroundthe world and have been used in China since antiquity, their usein American holistic medicine has started only recently. Besidesbee venom itself, there is also raw honey, bee pollen, propolis,royal jelly, and bees' wax, all of which have proven medicinalvalue. With more than 1500 papers on the healing benefits of beestings published in European and Asian scientific journals, theidea of stinging for health is now gathering momentum in America. The therapeutic use of honeybee stings is still in its early days,in that exciting but uncharted transition from imprecise folkremedy to precision holistic science. Exact dosages, treatmentrange, length of treatment-these matters are still being investigated.Helping this progression along is the pioneering work of the InternationalApitherapy Study (IAS), begun in 1983, which is now gatheringfollow-up data on more than 12,000 bee-stung patients. According to IAS, the anecdotal reports of remarkable successeskeep piling up and the number of licensed physicians willing toexperiment with bee venom therapy is also growing. At last count,it was about 300, including Christopher Kim, M.D., of the MonmouthPain Institute in Red Bank, New Jersey, a leader in the field. In the last 10 years, Dr. Kim has treated over 2000 patients withbee sting therapy in the form of 3 million injections. Bee venomcan be injected into the skin of the patient either by hypodermicneedle or by the direct contact of the honeybee. Here the practitioner holds a live honey-bee in a pair of tweezers,places it in contact with a particular spot on the patient's body,and lets Nature do the rest. Dosage is determined by how longyou let the stinger remain in the skin: for example, you canremove it instantly or let it remain for 5 minutes. A bee sting, strategically placed at the site of a problem, suchas tennis elbow, can bring almost instant relief, according toIAS information. Within 30 seconds of a sting, the elbow paingoes; in another 30 seconds, the pain of the sting itself hasgone, too. For gout, bursitis, and sore throat, usually 1-4 stings do thetrick; PMS symptoms typically require 2 stings twice weekly for8 weeks; osteoarthritis symptoms can be stung away in 2-6 weeks,while rheumatoid arthritis may take up to 3-4 months of regularstings. One case of severe osteoarthritis, a condition enduredby a patient for 16 years, required 24 stings every second dayfor 8 months for full relief. Treating multiple sclerosis (MS) requires the most prolonged treatment,says IAS data, which is tracking 4500 MS individuals. Yet patientsreport an easing up of symptoms, such as less fatigue and reducedcramps, after only 20-40 stings. Bee therapy's success with MS patients is by far its most impressivetherapeutic calling card. The bee therapy field is rich withalmost unbelievable stories of crippled, bedridden MS patientswalking and leading productive lives again within 6-18 monthsof beginning bee sting treatment. Peer-reviewed studies of bee venom published in prestigious scientificjournals have begun to unravel how this natural substance getssuch astonishing results. First, the bee venom works both locally,at the site of injection (such as the tennis elbow), and systemically,through stimulating the immune system. Second, bee venom contains substances whose anti-inflammatoryeffect (the ability to reduce swelling in "inflamed"tissue) is 100 times stronger than the standard drug used fortreating arthritis, hydrocortisone. Not only is it stronger, but less is more. You need 100-10,000times less bee venom to get the same anti-inflammatory resultsfrom conventional drugs. Further, you don't get unpleasant side-effectswith bee venom. Cortisone typically produces side-effects of depression,irritability, fatigue, hypertension, weight gain, or water retention.But with bee venom, you end up feeling more energized, your moodlifts, and your blood pressure stabilizes. All these benefits do come with a slight risk. Scientists estimatethat about 2% of the population is allergic to honeybee stingsand will experience an allergic or even anaphylactic shock reactionto the venom. Bee therapists are quick to point out that the honeybee oftengets bad press on account of the activities of other bees andstinging insects. If you associate bee stings with allergic reactionsor danger, you are probably thinking of stings from yellow-jackets(65%) or wasps (26%) from which nobody is claiming to get healthbenefits. The advantage of bee therapy is that, with the correct information,you can do it at home, thereby cutting expense and increasingconvenience. Yet you must observe certain conditions, explainsBradford S. Weeks., M.D. Dr. Weeks is a physician practicing in Clinton, Washington, whooriginally cofounded the American Apitherapy Association and whonow instructs those of his patients who are interested in thesafe techniques of bee sting therapy. He also is the prime investigatorin the on-going IAS research. Bee therapy is approved by theFDA, Dr. Weeks adds, although technically only to desensitizepeople who are allergic to bee venom. CAUTION First, you must be prepared for the possibility of anadverse allergic reaction to the honeybee sting, Dr. Weeks advises.He recommends that patients have an allergy examination to seeif they might be allergic to bee venom. Then you must always haveallergy-antidoting medicines on hand, such as epinephrine or antihistamine.Without taking this precaution you are "needlessly reckless." Yet it is perfectly natural for your arm to swell up, get red,and itch for a short period after a bee sting, says Dr. Weeks,and this should not be confused with an allergic reaction. Swellingafter a sting is the body's ingenious and appropriate immune response to dilute the toxins, adds Weeks. IMPORTANT Second, you must also prepare your immune system by "nurturing"it ahead of time with megavitamins. Exact dosages vary with theindividual, but a typical intake for vitamin C is at the rateof 3 grams daily. Ideally, you should budget a month for thisimmune-building preparation before taking any bee stings, saysDr. Weeks. It's also useful to take cold-pressed flax seed oil(1 tablespoon daily) and magnesium (200 mg, 3 times a day). You should avoid alcohol, reduce or eliminate your intake of refinedfoods, sugars, and dairy products, and start using bee pollen(1/2 teaspoon daily, minimum) and propolis (1/4 teaspoondaily, minimum). "People get great results initially fromthe bee stings but these results won't be sustained unless theysupport their immune system," Dr. Weeks explains. It's not an exaggeration to say that the honeybee's many productsare a versatile pharmacy when it comes to aiding human health,according to IAS research. Take propolis, a product bees makefrom tree resin to keep their hives sterile. This substance, availablein health foodsstores, has antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungalproperties and is among the highest sources of bioflavonoids,a component of vitamin C. Bee pollen is widely regarded as the world's only perfectly completefood because it contains all the essential nutrients requiredfor a healthy diet. It's an excellent protein source for vegetarians;it's easy for the elderly to assimilate its vitamins. Royal Jelly,a substance fed to the queen bee larva to enable her to developinto a mature fertile insect, is used experimentally in Japanfor cancer. it's an excellent source of organic B-vitamins andbioflavonoids. So the next time you see a honeybee buzzing around the flowerblossoms, remember that one day it might contribute somethingremarkable to your health and well-being. -BY RICHARD LEVITON For more information and referrals contact: American ApitherapySociety, Inc., P.O.

Holder shows why chiropractic, acupuncture, and aminoacids may be the groundbreaking answer to the leading cause ofdeath in America. His bold new multifactorial approach has a highsuccess rate and is cost effective. It could spell the end toaddictions-to alcohol, cocaine, heroin, nicotine, gambling, attentiondeficit disorders in adults and children-in a generation. In the first days of its second century, chiropractic may havea bold, effective, and inexpensive solution to the alarming problemof addictions. An estimated 20% of the U.S. population suffersfrom some form of addiction and over 80% of all crime is traceableto addictions or substance abuse. Even more shocking, evidencesupports the conclusion that addiction, which most physiciansnow regard as a disease, is the leading cause of death in America,accounting for 69% of drownings, 68% of manslaughters, 49% ofmurders, 50% of all traffic fatalities, and 35% of all suicides.Add to this, deaths from drug overdose and related substance abusecomplications, and you have a health problem of staggering proportions. Emerging in the face of these grim statistics is the completelysurprising revelation that the solution to this proliferationof addictions may be in our own therapeutic backyard. Accordingto Jay M. Holder, D.C., M.D., Ph.D., a Miami chiropractor-physicianand one of the prime movers in the 50,000 member-strong chiropracticprofession, this 100-year-old primary health care profession mayhold the answer to addictions literally in its hands. Chiropractic,after all, means "done with the hands," and if the restof the profession grabs hold of Dr. Holder's theories and innovations,chiropractic may start to make a profound difference in turningaround our most serious health problem in ways that nobody everthought it could. Dr. Holder is no ordinary chiropractor. In 1991, he was the firstAmerican physician to receive the Albert Schweitzer Prize in Medicine,the profession's most prestigious award, to the acclaim of doctorsfrom 70 nations. That year he also was named Chiropractor of theYear by the Florida Chiropractic Association. Dr. Holder receivedFlorida's first state grant to study the use of acupuncture totreat chemical dependency. In 1992, the State of Florida Houseof Representatives awarded Dr. Holder an official commendationfor his medical excellence in addiction treatment. In practice for 20 years, Dr. Holder directs two chiropracticclinics, in Miami and Miami Beach, Florida, including the 300-bedExodus Addiction Treatment Center. He directs the Holder ResearchInstitute which invents medical devices, formulas, and educationalprograms; he runs the American College of Addictionology and CompulsiveDisorders which trains and board certifies professionals to workas addictionologists; and he travels, lectures, and teaches constantly. Not only is he phenomenally busy, but Dr. Holder is getting unheard-ofclinical results in treating addictions. In 1993, the U.S. Senate,reviewing Dr. Holder's success rates, said: "In the realmof addictionology, these figures compare with Michael Jordan'sperformance in basketball." So if a physician with this caliber of credentials says chiropractic,as the leading component of a 5 part addiction treatment program,can help addictions, we're well advised to give him an ear-bothears. Here is a typical case that shows how Holder reverses addictions. Johnny, age 26, came to Dr. Holder depressed, very sick, displayingpsychotic behavior, and strung out on alcohol and cocaine. He'dalready seen four psychiatrists who had given him different mood-alteringdrugs, but they only made him worse. He'd started two addictiontreatment programs, but finished neither. Johnny had attendedAlcoholics Anonymous meetings but quit, finding them boring. He'dgo off drugs for a few weeks, maybe several months, then relapse,and slip back into the habit. Johnny's future didn't look promising. His parents refused topay for any more treatment programs, which were running $16,000a month. The insurance companies had written him off as hopeless,and if Johnny had gone to see any other physician besides Dr.Jay Holder, chances are they'd have recommended he attend moreAA meetings and wished him well. The trouble is, this is most often the guarantee of a dead end,which is why an estimated 35 out of 36 addicts never make it totreatment, fair very poorly, and often die. The 1 out of 36 islucky enough to enter an addiction treatment program. A chronicaddict, Johnny was down and out, and likely to stay permanentlydown. Of course, that's not the way Dr. Holder saw things. After taking his case history, Holder began examining Johnny onthe treatment table. Using a unique diagnostic and chiropractictreatment system called Torque Release Technique which Holderco-developed with chiropractor Marvin A. Talsky, D.C., Holderwas able to tell which vertebrae in Johnny's spinal column wereout of alignment. Chiropractors call this condition a subluxation;here any one of your spine's 33 vertebrae is partially dislocated.But the concept has a deeper meaning for Dr. Holder. "Tous, a subluxation means a separation from wholeness that interfereswith your body's ability to function in a whole way." Every addicted person will have a subluxated spine with at leastone or more vertebrae out of alignment, Holder says. Using a handheldspinal adjustment instrument he invented himself, called the Integrator™,Holder makes a few adjustments (never more than 3 in one visit)on Johnny's spine, using a minimum of force and pressure. In addition to correcting Johnny's subluxations, Dr. Holder willstart him on a series of 4 amino acids (precursors to or buildingblocks for proteins, normally found in foods) taken daily as oralsupplements. These include L-phenylalinine (750 mg daily), D-phenylalinine(750 mg daily), l-glutamine (300 mg), and L-tyrosine (900 mg daily). If this were anywhere else than the U.S., Dr. Holder would alsogive Johnny 400 mg of the amino acid L-tryptophan. Unfortunately,although the substance's efficacy has been proven, the FDA forbidsits use in this country. Dr. Holder will keep Johnny on this aminoacid combination for at least a year. The idea is that the chiropractic adjustment will remove the interferenceto the natural flow of brain chemicals but you still need to shoreup the body's supplies of these substances, vital for addictionrecovery, for a fair amount of time. The amino acids will helpJohnny make important changes in his behavior, which are crucialto the success of his treatment program and will help to guaranteethat he stays off drugs for good in the future. Specifically,the amino acids, especially phenylalinine, the "addiction-treatmentking," will help "restore the brain reward cascade"(see below) and its bodywide sense of well-being; it will greatlyreduce stress and lift depression as well. In addition, Johnny is attending Narcotics Anonymous meetingsevery day and receiving expert addiction counselling at leastonce a week, both of which are provided in Dr. Holder's clinic.He may also receive some acupuncture treatment on his ears. "Weintegrate all 5 modalities for the best results," Holderexplains, "but I emphasize that of all the modalities, theone that offers the greatest benefit for the dollar invested ischiropractic." The next day, Dr. Holder adjusts Johnny again, and makes surehe takes his amino acid capsules. On the third day, Johnny comesin with his family. They can't believe the changes in his conditionand want to know what kind of miracle Dr. Holder has performedon their son. "He doesn't yell or mope anymore," says Johnny's mother."He has more attention, smiles frequently, even goes to workon time," says his father. And Johnny says: "I don'tcry at night any more and I no longer dream about my drug. Mydrug appetite is completely gone. I feel no nagging to go backand take some more cocaine." Holder isn't surprised. He's seen results like this often withmany other chronically addicted people. "Under chiropracticcare, they show a remarkable difference compared to any otheraddiction treatment program. They become open, relaxed, and compliantas their anxiety and depression lift. Their heads clear, theirthinking improves, they get in touch with their feelings, andthey open up to group therapy and the treatment program with asurprising intensity." A couple of years later Johnny paysDr. Holder a visit. He's still off drugs and is getting married-andhe's never relapsed. There is, technically, no cure for addictions because, as thesaying goes, "once a pickle, never a cucumber." Addictiontreatment experts, including Dr. Holder, speak in terms of recoveryand the ability to stay off drugs more or less permanently. Sothere is the possibility of successful and long-lasting interventionand recovery and Dr. Holder has put together the 5 elements thatproduce these previously unheard-of results. In case you're wonderingif this is too good to be true, Dr. Holder has the statisticsto prove chiropractic can get results like this. The key factor in addiction studies is how long an addicted personwill stay in the treatment program which typically runs 28 days.Experts call this the retention rate. The national retention averageis 72%, which means out of 100 people in treatment, 28 will quit.Those who finish the program stand an 85% chance of staying drugfree5 years later. So if you can get more people to finish the program,you basically come as close as possible to "curing"them-Dr. Holder calls it "securing an on going recovery"-oftheir addictions. Dr. Holder knew he could improve the odds andhe did, by a great deal. First, using acupuncture to treat six specific points on the ears,Holder got the retention rate up to 96%. But even here, Dr. Holdermade an important contribution to the field of auriculotherapy,or treating acupuncture points on the ear. Classical Chinese medicinedescribes 5 ear points which can produce beneficial results intreating all addictions. Then Dr. Holder, working with new information about the energeticsof the ear, identified 3 completely new treatment points, againfor all addictions. That new information has to do with the factthat there are 4 cranial nerves that have nerve endings throughoutthe ear and these are the points treated with needles. Before Dr. Holder refined his understanding of the contributionsubluxation-based chiropractic could make in addiction treatment,he had been using ear acupuncture 100% of the time; now he usesit with about 20% of his patients, when they need an extra energyboost to lift their depression and cut drug appetite. Ear acupuncture is excellent for helping to relax the patient,which in turn allows addicted persons to be more compliant andopen to the complete therapy program. It also enables them tofeel less apathetic and more motivated to stay off drugs; further,it cuts down on drug craving and reduces their sense of physicaland emotional withdrawal. What's innovative about Holder's use of auriculotherapy is thathe no longer uses the traditional needles. Instead he uses a Stim-Flex400, which is a small handheld probe that delivers between 2.5-160Hz in microcurrent to specific ear points for 8-16 seconds perpoint, maximum. This is in comparison to needle-delivered earacupuncture which can require anywhere from 45-60 minutes. Themicrocurrent probe approach is thus far more efficient and specific,and helps release the pleasure-producing brain chemicals calledendorphins much more quickly and more thoroughly than needle treatment. So Holder was getting highly impressive results with his new developmentsin ear acupuncture, but then he found something even better: chiropractic.In a special trial with 100 addicts, when Holder gave them 20chiropractic adjustments over a 30 day period, he got the retentionrate up to 100% " That is unheard of; it's never happenedbefore in addiction treatment," Holder says. Bear in mindthat at a national average of only $30 per chiropractic adjustment,this astounding success rate cost only about $600 per addictedperson per month. Add to this $30 for a one month's supply ofamino acids and $240-$400 a month for 4 addiction counsellingsessions, and you have a total addiction treatment program costof about $870-$1030. Johnny's unsuccessful treatment, by comparison,had been costing his family $16,000 per month. Johnny's parents saw the results but, naturally, they couldn'tunderstand how chiropractic could have achieved it. The answeris almost as startling as the treatment's success. But you first have to define a few basic terms, says Holder, suchas what is addiction? "Simply put, addiction is compulsiveuse in spite of negative consequences." You keep using asubstance even though you know it's bad for you. There are 5 typesof addictions, including work, food, sex, drugs-chemicals, andgambling, and each one has many factors. "But these 5 categoriesare all symptoms of one disease-addiction." According to research Holder has collected and thought about deeply,there are two key factorsat play in causing addictions. First,according to Holder's colleague, Kenneth Blum, Ph.D. of the Universityof Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, there is a geneticcause. Dr. Blum discovered the same specific genetic flaw (called "theA1 allele of the D2 dopamine receptor") in 69% of severealcoholics compared to only 20% of nonalcoholic people. It was Dr. Blum who developed the unique amino acid treatmentplan for addictions, as the result of 30 years of painstakingresearch. "Because the brain reward cascade is a linear sequenceof brain chemicals, Dr. Blum determined that certain interventionapproaches could help to balance this important function and producebeneficial restorative effects," Dr. Holder explains. Theamino acids, in other words, are necessary precursors, or buildingblocks, for the brain reward cascade chemicals (called neurotransmitters)which are chronically deficient in the addicted person. Second, according to Holder's research, an estimated 90% of babiesborn through forcep or suction-cup assisted deliveries, arrivein this world with a subluxation. If the infant has the geneticdefect associated with addiction and gets its spine dangerouslystretched and misaligned at birth, then the chances of becomingan addicted adult are very high, Holder claims. What's the connection between a subluxated spine and addictions?It has to do with a precise sequence of chemical changes in yourbrain called brain reward cascade. If this cascade goes well withno interferences, you feel good, full of well-being and pleasure;if the sequence is interfered with, you may start looking to mood-alteringsubstances or activities to fill the gap. These brain chemicalsare called neurotransmitters and they must be released in theright sequence (like falling dominoes) for you to feel good. The biochemical bottom line here at the end of this cascade iscalled dopamine, and, for those born with the genetic defect,their dopamine will never work right. If your brain releases it,you feel good. The dopamine reward may be the biochemical secretto understanding addictions. When your spine is out of alignment, or subluxated, says Holder,it interrupts this important biochemical sequence in your brain.You start experiencing disturbing emotions and crave substancesto change, relieve, or suppress your feelings. But how does asubluxation somewhere in your back interfere with the flow ofchemicals in your brain? This is where Holder's theory gets veryinteresting.Your brain is not just in your head, but in your spineas well. Brain scientists explain that your emotions take place in themidbrain (also called the limbic system). Your sense of well-being,biochemically speaking, is seated in the limbic system. The brainreward cascade takes place here. Now, the limbic system has outpoststhroughout the spinal cord in little anatomical features calledthe "dorsal horn," according to ground-breaking researchby the renowned scientist Dr. Candace Pert who discovered thisin 1988. In other words, your limbic system is represented throughoutthe entire spinal cord. This means if your spine is subluxated anywhere along its length,this condition interferes with your limbic system and the flowof feel-good chemicals in your head. If you are a person withthe specific genetic flaw associated with addictions, you willprobably never have that same feeling of self-contentment, pleasure,and total well-being available to the rest of the nonaddictedpopulation. You may take up addictive substances or activitiesto compensate. There is yet another intriguing link. It turns out that childrenwho have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Tourette'sSyndrome, also have this identical genetic defect. In other words,Holder explains, compulsive disorders affecting children is ournations' number one pediatric complaint. They affect 5-8% of boysand 2-4% of girls, and are highly similar in cause to addictions.This also means that what successfully treats adult addictionscan be highly useful with hyperactive children. Holder provedthis by reversing abnormal brain waves in ADHD patients usinghis Torque Release Technique. The good news and the beauty of the approach is that when youremove the addict's subluxation, as Dr. Holder did with Johnny,you allow the brain reward cascade of feel-good biochemicals torun properly again, perhaps for the first time in the person'slife. This in turn enables you to feel good and no longer seekoutside substances to produce a sense of well-being. There are about 50,000 chiropractors practicing in America today.This means that any addicted person or child with hyperactivitywho goes to a chiropractor who treats subluxations can probablyexpect some immediate relief from their addicted or compulsivebehavior, Holder says. You might say that chiropractic gets thedopamine flowing again, balancing the brain reward cascade. Whilea chiropractor who removes subluxations will most likely helpan addicted person to start feeling better, you get even betterresults by far if your chiropractor is trained in all the protocolsof addictionology. If you go to a chiropractor trained in Dr. Holder's Torque ReleaseTechnique (TRT) or to one who has graduated from Dr. Holder'sCertified Addiction Professional (CAP) program, you're likelyto get the best results. "Because addiction is a multifactorialdisease, you need a multifactorial approach to get the best results.We consider TRT the 'faster car' for addiction treatment,"Holder says. Through his American College of Addictionology, Dr.Holder is training health professionals all over the U.S. in a120-hour Certified Addiction Professional program; he's also teachingTRT to as many chiropractors as he can manage. The result is that chiropractic is poised to make a dramatic leapforward in what they can offer the public as the nation's secondlargest primary health care profession. As a leading modalityin alternative medicine, Holder says, chiropractic offers thepublic something that conventional medicine cannot: a drugfreeaddiction treatment program. Johnny never got better with thedrugs his psychiatrists prescribed because they were mood-alteringsubstances; they simply reinforced his addiction, making him dependenton yet other chemical substances to feel better. "This is the big news. We now have a bold new approach totreating addictions that has a very high success rate and is highlycost-effective. It works so well because it removes the interference(the subluxation) to the brain reward cascade and allows you tofeel good about yourself," Holder says. Dr. Holder is getting astonishing results in places where previouslyno one dared to tread. This is the area of pregnant cocaine addicts.Normally, women in this condition find no sympathy in America's8000 addiction treatment programs on account of the staggeringinsurance liabilities. Even worse, the local governments tendto regard them as criminal child abusers and arrest them, severingthem from their children, and thus creating families that areeven more broken and dysfunctional. The statistics are grim, says Dr. Holder, but there are some communitiesin the U.S. today where 15% of all babies born are drug babies,born to mothers who were addicted while carrying the fetuses.In contrast, 15 years ago, this situation was unheard of, whichmeans the incidence of drug babies has been growing by 1% a year.If this continues for another two generations, we could be lookingat a situation in which there are no normal babies born at all,Dr. Holder says. This is why his was one of ten addiction treatmentprograms that made a bold proposal to the federal government afew years ago to take a new approach. A colleague of Dr. Holder, Matthew Gissen, executive directorof Village Treatment Center, came up with an innovative conceptin treatment program design. The solution was what Drs. Holderand Gissen call, affectionately, the "pregnant mommie house."This is a refitted 7-story building in Miami where addicted pregnantwomen come for treatment. They have their babies and continuethe treatment program for up to 2 years-without the fear of arrest,reprisal, or punishment for so-called child abuse. The approachworked so well, says Dr. Holder, that today there are about 50similar programs scattered around the U.S. One day Dr. Holder walked into the pregnant mommie house. A youngwoman grabbed his arm with a happy gleam in her eye. She broughthim into her room where she proudly displayed her healthy newbornbaby, barely a week old. She asked Dr. Holder to cradle her sonand share the moment, as this was truly a special, rare moment,in which all the work of doctor and patient came to a happy resolution. "If you could just see the look in that mother's eyes, herpride and self-esteem that she had experienced the miracle ofrecovery, that she had accomplished something truly importantfor her son," says Dr. Holder. There she was, a drugfreemother with her drugfree newborn. The drug addiction would notbe passed on to the next generation, not with this mother. "Shewas actually realizing in that moment that she had conquered alife-threatening disease and would not pass it on to her child-youcouldn't leave that room with a dry eye," Dr. Holder adds. All of this leaves chiropractic looking pretty good on its 100thanniversary. Acupuncturists get excellent results in treatingaddictions but there are only 7000 of them for a population of256 million. Conventional doctors can't successfully treat addictionsbecause there is no addiction training in medical schools anddoctors prescribe mood-altering drugs that can keep the addictsaddicted to substances and at risk to relapse. "Chiropractors are thus the logical primary interventionresource to deal with the nation's number one cause of death,"says Holder. How this daring claim plays out in the the profession'snext 100 years remains to be seen, but nobody expects recoveredaddicts like Johnny to argue the point. "Our program integrates five modalities-chiropractic, aminoacids, ear acupuncture, counseling, Alcoholics Anonymous-but Iemphasize that of all these, the one that offers the greatestbenefit for the dollar invested is chiropractic." Dr. Holder adjusts a patient with the integrator[TM], a devicehe invented to apply "torque" to remove subluxations. Holder was getting highly impressive results with his new developmentsin ear acupuncture, but then he found something even better-chiropractic.In a special trial with 100 addicts, when Holder gave them 20chiropractic adjustments over a 30 day period, he got the retentionrate up to 100%. -BY RICHARD LEVITON EDITOR'S NOTE: To contact Dr. Holder, for referrals of other chiropractorsusing TRT, or for information about C.A.P. addiction training,and the Integrator, write to: Jay M.

Americans are not that healthy for all themoney spent on their health every year. According to the World HealthOrganization, in the 1930s the U.S. was ranked as the third healthiestpopulation; but by the 1990s, we've dropped down way below that. Cancer isnow affecting nearly 1 out of every 2 Americans. As cases of congestiveheart failure have doubled in the last decade and now cost $40 billion ayear, heart failure has become the number one drain on Medicare. As a lifelong businessman, when I think about that $1 trillion, I have toask: "are we getting our money's worth? Does all this make fiscal sense?" The sad fact is that it doesn't make sense at all. This isn't healthcare-it's sickness care. Conventional medicine keeps coming up with newdrugs and high tech procedures, yet none of this heals or cures disease. Atbest, it deals with symptoms, and, too often, it either suppresses symptomsor makes a person unwell from the "side-effects." Take cancer research. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) spends about $2billion of American taxpayer's money every year to look for "cures," aslong as they don't come from alternative medicine, even though all thebreakthrough discoveries in healing chronic diseases are coming from thissource. Think about it: The NCI has a $2 billion a year expense account;but, after 40 years, mainstream cancer researchers are no closer to acancer cure than NASA is to colonizing the Moon. Or take what we spend our research dollars on. Out of $12 billion allocatedevery year by Congress to the National Institutes of Health, only sparechange-about $5.4 million-goes to the Office of Alternative Medicine tolook into the claims of some 50 therapies. Meanwhile, almost everybodyknows by now that about one-third of Americans visit an alternativephysician at least once a year and spend nearly $12 billion of their ownmoney, not insurance company reimbursements, doing it. As a businessman, I want to see the bottom line before I spend more moneyon a venture. The bottom line on the conventional medicine venture isbankruptcy. If I were Uncle Sam, I'd be tearing my hair out over thisincredible failure of American medicine to be cost efficient and I would becancelling the unlimited expense budget of organized medicine today. Thereare effective alternatives. Get results, or get out! It's about time we ranour national health care as a real business. And how about the insurance companies? By and large, it's the insurancecompanies that shell out most of the $1 trillion dollars. Surely, if theysat down and studied the statistics, the outcome costs, the side-effectscost, the iatrogenic costs (the cost of patients being injured by themedical treatment or hospital itself), they would scratch their heads andask if there weren't a less expensive way to go. How much of conventionalmedicine do you suppose would still have a financial leg to stand on afterthis kind of rigorous financial review? Insurance companies will find that cost-effective way if they look at thecosts and outcomes from alternative medicine. They could actually make moremoney by backing alternative medicine than by putting all their chipsbehind the high tech gamblers of conventional medicine. Why gamble with theunproven and toxic when you can depend on the affordable alternative? The bottom line on the conventional medicine venture isbankruptcy. If I were Uncle Sam, I'd be tearing my hair out over thisincredible failure of American medicine to be cost efficient and I would becancelling the unlimited expense budget of organized medicine today. Thereare effective alternatives. Get results, or get out! Showing people the value of alternatives, as you know, is what my work aspublisher of Future Medicine Publishing is all about. I know I'm not alonein experiencing this daily outrage at the cost of medical care in America.Saving money on medical costs is on the minds of many Americans and, forthat goal, prevention is the way to go. Research shows that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Forevery $1 we spend on prevention today, we'll save $30 on treatmenttomorrow. Heart disease, for example, is one of the most preventablechronic degenerative diseases, yet we're still spending $9 billion for300,000 coronary artery bypass graft surgeries every year. In a previous issue (Digest No. 6), one of our physicians explained thatchelation therapy, if used as a preventive measure for heart disease, could save us an estimated $8 billion a year inhealth care costs. Is anybody taking this advice? No. Instead, theCalifornia medical authorities are doing their best to get chelationtherapy outlawed and to arrest and harass respectable M.D.s merely forpracticing chelation. Also, in the last Digest you read the amazing story of Cheryl Wilkens who used the metabolicnutritional program of Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, M.D., to successfully treather metastasized lymph cancer at a cost of about $4000. She is cancer-freetoday-for $4000. In this Digest, you'll read the equally amazing-and almost tragic-case of Debi Erin, R.N.For 10 years, she was the victim of a mental health establishment thatstill doesn't have a clue how to treat schizophrenia. When Erin finallyfound her "clue," it was from a doctor of alternative medicine whoprescribed a $20 bottle of essential fatty acids and she was cured. Today,Erin is schizophrenia-free, for pennies. In this issue, you'll also readabout Mary, a woman who eliminated 8 years of back pain, intestinaldiscomfort, headaches, and hypoglycemia, with $700 worth of chiropractictreatment. Also, in this Digest you'll read about Jay Holder who is both an M.D. andchiropractor. Dr. Holder's bold new approach to treating addictions is touse chiropractic and amino acids. At a cost of about $870 per client peryear, Holder's chiropractic approach is getting astonishingly high recoveryrates-100% of addicted patients receiving chiropractic finish their 30-daytreatment program. This is a key indicator of whether they'll staydrug-free in the future. Who can argue that this is money well spent-andit's not that much money in the first place! The field of alternative medicine is full of stories like these, ofpatients who suffered the unnecessary pain and extravagant expense ofconventional medicine only to find a lower-cost, safer, and more effectivetreatment from alternative medicine. Don't you think this is where weshould be spending our tax dollars, investigating and supporting theselife-saving alternatives? A new poll of San Francisco Bay area residentsshowed that 41% consulted an alternative medicine doctor last year and that80% said they'd do it again. What's the solution? Let's get fiscal about the cost of health care and support all the safer, cheaper, moreeffective alternatives and pocket the difference. As Dr. Guylaine Lanctôt,M.D., says in The Medical Mafia (reviewed in this issue), the patients-that great, powerful, but too silentmajority of about 256 million Americans-hold the purse-strings on the $1trillion health care budget. "The only one who has the ultimate power tochange the system is the patient," says Dr. Lanctôt. One practical way to exercise your patient-power is to keep informed oflegislative events and to urge your elected officials to allow alternativedoctors to practice openly, without harassment. Meanwhile, the Digest will keep you up-to-date on everything you need to know about the mostcost-effective alternatives in medicine. That way we can all show somefiscal care for our health.

KOFFMAN, D.C., F.I.C.S., on Chiropractic and Back Pain Question: Can chiropractic treat other problems besides back pain? Answer: Most definitely as this patient story shows. These "otherproblems" are frequently connected with the back problemin the first place. Mary, age 45, came to me complaining aboutlower back pain. She was constipated and had been diagnosed withirritable bowel syndrome; she would fluctuate between constipationand diarrhea. She had bad frontal headaches every day. It was not unusual forher to wake up with a headache. She also had low blood sugar,or hypoglycemia, plus knee, neck, and shoulder pain. Mary hadsuffered with some of these conditions for up to 9 years and hadbeen hopping around from doctor to doctor for relief of individualsymptoms. Fortunately, somebody said to her she ought to try a chiropractor.People come in my door for back pain because they think that's what chiropractors are good for. Once they get here, they findout we're able to treat a host of other conditions. They cometo understand chiropractic is about much more than fixing badbacks; it's actually about enhancing the function of the entireorganism. So Mary thought her problem was lower back pain, but actuallyall of her symptoms were compensations resulting from a primarycause: her sacro-iliac joint was separated. Here's what happened. About 15 years earlier, she fell while skiingand started having problems with her sacrum from that point on;this in turn led to a dozen different but related complaints. The sacrum is the body's main weight-bearing structure. The entireupper trunk weight comes to rest on the sacrum, which is anchoredin place and held against the two hip bones through tough elasticweight-bearing ligaments. These ligaments are one of the mostvulnerable parts of the human structure. When the sacro-iliac ligaments stretch, the sacrum may go outof alignment. When the sacrum goes out of alignment, certain vertebraecan also misalign, such as Lumbar-2, which is a secondary stresspoint in the lower back. The L-2 nerves go into the colon, whichis why Mary had bowel problems. During Mary's first treatment, when I adjusted her sacrum, thenerves going to her colon relaxed. Her bowels never bothered heragain from that first single adjustment. She thought it was amiracle but this is actually common in chiropractic. Question: Does a chiropractor use any other techniques besidesadjusting the vertebrae with the hands? Answer: Yes, as in Mary's case another technique was needed.That's because the other cause of her prolonged discomfort wasin her cranium, which reacted as a direct compensation to hersacrum being misaligned. By cranium, I mean the 14 connected bone"plates" that make up the skull. The cranium and sacrum have a special reciprocal relationship.As one expands, the other contracts, or you might say, they rockback and forth. That's part of the cranio-sacral respiratory pump.This is a closed-pumping system in the body for circulating cerebrospinalfluid. Inside the bones of the cranium there are tough, elastic membraneswrapped around the brain, and inside them is the cerebrospinalfluid. It's manufactured in the brain, goes down the spinal canal,and then is pumped back up through the rocking action of the sacrumand the contraction of the cranial membranes. There are many things that can upset this system. In Mary's case,because her sacrum had become dislodged from its correct position,it could no longer rock properly and that destabilized her cranium.Once I set her cranium back in place, it made it easier for thesacral correction to hold. Naturally, her headaches, neck, shoulder,and back pain went away at once. With Mary, I used a lot of blocking and cranial pulse balancing.Both of these reposition the cranial bones so they will be inthe right place at the right phase of her breathing. Let me explainthese ideas. Blocking is an approach discovered by M. B. DeJarnette, D.O.,D.C., in 1929; he was a chiropractor, osteopath, and mechanicalengineer who used special wedge-shaped blocks to make his sacro-iliacadjustments. When you position a block correctly under the pelvis,it will torque accordingly. The torque helps to go against the wrong torque already presentin the pelvis. When you lie on the blocks, your own breathingis the force for the correction. When you stand up, once yourpelvis is recentered, your muscles take stock of the new alignmentand think this is where they're supposed to be and work to keep it in place. DeJarnette also discovered a series of points on the back of thehead that he called the occipital fibers. There are 7 of these on each side of the skull, or 14 in all; each point correspondsto a group of vertebrae in the spine. These points can get quitehard, almost like nodules, if they are left untreated. I oftenrub these points vigorously to help release the locked-up energiesand as a gentle way of readjusting the spine. Your head, then, has a lot to do with your lower back pain. DeJarnetteused to say: "You'll never fix their backs until you fixtheir craniums." Question: Does chiropractic ever "fix" someone forgood, or do you always have to come back for more treatments? Answer: It took 15 sessions over 6 months with Mary to resolveher condition. Now she will come back 1-2 times a year at mostfor maintenance care, unless she has a new trauma that upsetsthe system. Chiropractic "fixed" her for good in 6 monthswhile conventional medicine had failed her for 9 years. Her courseof treatment cost her only about $700, which is a lot less thaneven one MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a high tech computerizedscan) which wouldn't have identified the true problem anyway-ortreated it. If she had gone to a conventional doctor, she could have endedup with a medicine chest full of prescription drugs all to palliatethe symptoms. But she couldn't have been any better because hertreatment would not have addressed the underlying structural problemin her sacro-iliac joint. Instead, through chiropractic, Mary not only lost her back pain,but she gained a whole new feeling of health and robustness. Idare say she'll probably live a lot longer too. Psychologically,she became much more relaxed, content, happier, she slept better,and her blood sugar levels stabilized. She was thrilled to feelso good. Health means you function at 100%. To get this, you need to seea doctor whose objective is to assist you in fully manifestingyour body's energy, not just smoothing over symptoms. That's realhealth care, not sickness care-and that's what chiropractors reallydo. DAVID M. KOFFMAN, D.C., maintains a private practice in Longmeadow,Massachusetts.

This statement has continually influencedmy work. I believe you cannot possibly heal somebody through Chinesemedicine without working through a great deal of their issues.As soon as you start getting the body well, these deeper causesof the physical symptoms will begin to surface. You have to workon them, because otherwise they will come back up into the bodyagain and produce more symptoms. To do this, I use acupuncture, moxabustion, herbs, counseling,even flower essences and color therapy, to give the patient enoughstrength to start looking at the deeper problems with clarity.Let me show you how these factors worked in a recent case. Elaine, age 45, came to me with deep depression and extreme exhaustion.She had low energy, no concentration, bad memory, fevers, sweat,chills, poor sleep, dizziness, cold extremities, high blood pressure,respiratory problems, irregular periods, back, neck, and musclepain. I saw darkness about her; she was very defensive, almostready to cry, even at innocuous remarks. She had been previouslytreated for a chronic bladder and kidney obstruction, and wasstill sporadically unable to urinate. Elaine had suffered these chronic symptoms for 4 years. In ChineseMedicine terms, Elaine had kidney yang deficiency, which means she didn't have enough yang, or active, fiery energy in her kidneys, leaving her sluggish, passive, inactive, fearful, tired, holdingwater, and with no will power. During her first 90 minute session, I inserted need-les on allorgan points on her back, especially her kidney points, then followingthis with moxabustion (burning little pieces of mugwort over herskin) to strengthen her vital energy. I also made suggestionsas the needles remained in place: "Elaine, I'm working onyour kidneys now, so let's release fear and anxiety. It's safeto release fear." This had immediate effects. Elaine knew she had deeply buried emotions but didn't know howto process them. All the time I was treating her physically, Iwas also working with the emotional and psychological energiesassociated with her physical symptoms. Her back went into spasmsand ripples as she started coming in contact with these old painfulfeelings-such as incest with an uncle, grief over the death ofa malformed infant, feelings of guilt taken on from her dead mother,sadness over the fact she had never known her father. She wasalso in a marriage that had been abusive for years, which beforeseeing me, she had resigned herself to living with. After the first session, her spirits lifted and she was able tohave a sense of humor and objectivity about her condition. I gaveher five flower essences to take hourly to help further lift hermood, including Self-Heal, California Pitcher Plant, St. John'sWort, Scotch Broom, and Fuschia. After her second session, I prescribed a mixture of Chinese herbsto improve Elaine's energy, to help her bladder and kidney problem,and tone her digestion. These included Fo-ti, to nourish and detoxify the blood; fructus Lycii, to help liver and kidney energy; fu-shen, for calming the spirit; dong-quai, to build up the blood; aconite, to bring up energy; astragalus, for the night sweats. She tookthese twice a day, in liquid form, for about 3 months, but I modifiedthe mix according to her symptoms. I also gave her color each session, using a German-made Vegaluxcolor generator to project different colors (through little flashlightsat the tips of fiber optic tubes) onto her skin. I find colortherapy to be a soothing, energy-building adjunct to acupuncture.For example, I used orange on her lower abdomen for endocrineinsufficiency, and blue and yellow on her feet to release stressand prenatal feelings. As the needles, moxabustion, flowers, color, and herbs built upher energy, Elaine began to have a lot of emotional releases andpsychological insights, which surprised and encouraged her. Sheis a good patient, willing to do the hard work of healing. For example, during her second session, Elaine said it was asif an animal were trying to eat her up from the inside, devouringall her energy. Another time she said she felt she had a "hole"in her body (or energy field) out of which energy kept leaking.All this time she had been making drawings of volcanoes that couldonly blow steam and lava out their sides, not their tops. After 6 treatments, Elaine had enough energy to realize her marriagewas not satisfactory and to resume doing things she couldn't dofor years. This is what her healing is about: having the energyto face her life issues (and bad marriage) and to make the necessarychanges. It means now, after only 8 sessions spread over 3 months,she's strong enough to move courageously to take control of herlife again. Elaine is about 70% cured and I'm confident the treatmentis working as her energy is steadily improving. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, from my perspective, is about deep-seatedemotions, deeply repressed feelings of anger and self-hatred,that have finally affected the immune and digestive systems, producinga host of symptoms. Elaine's illness was probably brewing for7 years before she came to me, and for about 3 years before allthe symptoms started. Her newborn child's death 7 years earliermight have triggered it all, producing a deep sadness and feelingof futility. The body follows these emotional clues and beginsto weaken; but then as the person starts to get physically well,these old, buried issues start to come up again and must be dealtwith as part of the healing process. It all comes down to what we say in alternative medicine: youhave to treat the whole person of body, mind, and spirit. Youcannot just treat the body or the spirit alone, because they'reone system.

Here's how to get theparasites out of your body... Your body may have unwelcome residents that are harmful to your health. Thepossible presence of parasites in the body, mostly in the intestines, is alittle appreciated but major health problem, according to nutritioneducator Ann Louise Gittleman. You may think you are vulnerable toparasites and any of a long list of "worms" and other parasites only if youtravel in tropical areas, but this is a dangerous misconception, saysGittleman. You can get them (and probably already have) from merely stayingat home. The shocking fact is that undiagnosed parasitic infections (frommicroscopic protozoa and various species of tiny worms) may account for agreat deal of the otherwise unexplained diseases currently besettingAmerica. One estimate contends that 25% of New Yorkers currently have aparasitic infection; by the year 2025, 50% of the estimated 8.3 billionworld population will have them. Most doctors are unaware of the connection between parasites and health anddon't recognize the risk factors or clinical symptoms. These include jointand muscle aches, anemia, allergy, skin conditions, nervousness, diarrhea,bloating, constipation, chronic fatigue, immune dysfunction, and others. Infact, members of the same family can have the same species of parasites yetcompletely different clinical symptoms, such as, no symptoms, emotionalupsets, food allergies, fatigue, or bowel discomfort. That's why Gittleman states forthrightly, "If these symptoms and feelingssound familiar, then you may be an unsuspecting victim of the parasiteepidemic that is affecting millions of Americans." 1. CLEANSE THE INTESTINES Parasites tend to embed themselves in the intestinal wall, but you canflush them out by using one or more of these natural substances, added tothe diet: psyllium husks, agar-agar, flax seeds, comfrey root, beet root,bentonite clay (take this orally only in combination with anothersubstance, such as psyllium), citrus pectin, or papaya extract. There areseveral effective intestinal cleansing products available in natural foodsstores (see below). You might also take extra amounts of vitamin C (minimum2g daily) to help flush out your colon. 2. DO THE ROYAL FLUSH Do a colonic irrigation or high enema using garlic juice, vinegar (2tablespoons per quart of water), blackstrap molasses (1 tablespoon perquart of water), or coffee. Use filtered or distilled water for the enema;further sterilize by boiling it for 10 minutes. 3. PREPARE YOUR SYSTEM It is prudent to give your gall bladder and liver a week to prepare for theparasite program. To flush the gall bladder, take lime juice in warm wateror Swedish Bitters before each meal. Eliminate all refined and naturalsugars during the parasite program; even better, start cutting back on themduring this preparatory week. Take barberry bark capsules, dandelion, or asimilar herbal extract to help cleanse your liver. 4. FOLLOW WITH THE HERBAL CLEANOUT Naturopath Hulda Regehr Clark, N.D., Ph.D., recommends using a blend of 3herbs to flush the parasites out of your system: use black walnut hulltincture, wormwood capsules, and fresh ground cloves (to kill theparasites' eggs). The following protocol is a composite of therecommendations of Dr. Clark and Dr. William Lee Cowden, M.D. Do theprogram for 10-14 days, take 57 days off, then repeat for another 1014day round. CAUTION All protocols are for adult dosage only and are generalized; that is,dosages and conditions will vary with the individual. Listen to your body;build up dosages slowly and carefully; only go at a rate you can tolerate.Before beginning any treatment, consult a qualified health careprofessional. This is especially important in the case of treatingchildren, or if you are pregnant. BLACK WALNUT HULLS If you take liquid extract, make sure the extract is made from fresh wholegreen hulls of black walnut. You may also use Black Walnut capsules. Takewith water 1520 minutes before a meal. For black walnut hull capsules, this is what Dr. Cowden recommends: Day 1: 1 capsule 2X daily Day 2: 2 capsules 2X daily Day 3: 2 capsules 3X daily Day 4: 3 capsules 3X daily Day 5: 4 capsules 3X daily Day 6: 5 capsules 3X daily Day 7: 6 capsules 3X daily Continue at 2 capsules 3X daily through day 14. During the second 10 dayround, take 6 capsules 3X each day. For black walnut hull extract, this iswhat Dr. Clark recommends: Day 1: 1 drop 4X daily, mixed in water. Space the drops 4 hours apart,starting in the morning. Day 2: 2 drops 4X daily Day 3: 3 drops 4X daily Work up to 20 drops taken 4 times daily and continue at this rate until thetreatment program is finished. 6. WORMWOOD Wormwood works best when the full day's dosage is taken at one time, 1520minutes before a meal, says Dr. Cowden. Here is his recommendation: Day 1: 2 capsules Day 2: 4 capsules Day 3: 6 capsules Day 4: 8 capsules Day 5: 10 capsules Day 6: 12 capsules Day 7: 14 capsules Day 8: 14 capsules Day 9: 14 capsules Day 10: 14 capsules On days 11-14, take 14 capsules. Stay off wormwood during the same 5-7 days you're off Black Walnut, Dr.Cowden advises; then resume at 14 capsules of Wormwood daily for another10-14 days. 7. CLOVES For cloves, crush fresh cloves in a coffee grinder and fill gelatin capsules (size "00") with thesubstance. Fill the capsules at once and discard any left-over clove powderas it loses its potency quickly when exposed to the air. You will need 171clove capsules, says Dr. Cowden. According to Dr. Cowden, this is theschedule to follow: Day 1: 1 capsule 3X daily Day 2: 2 capsules 3X daily Day 3: 3 capsules 3X daily Then 3 capsules 3X daily through day 10 or 14 Take capsules 1520 minutes before a meal. Stay off cloves the same daysyou are off Wormwood and Black Walnut, then resume at 3 capsules 3X dailyfor another 1014 days. You might also use Proseed Grapefruit Seed Extractduring the first 3 days of this program for an extra germicidal boost. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide, "Grapefruit Seed Extract, A Multipurpose Natural Antibiotic," Natural Pharmacy, this issue, p.22. 8. TAKE OXYGEN According to Dr. Joseph LaVolpa, N.D., P.M.D., a preventive medicinespecialist practicing in Santa Rosa, California, it's advisable to takeoxygen supplements to help flush the toxins out of your system and tooxygenate the blood during this process of killing parasites. Useful hereare Oxyflex capsules (see below) which consist of super-oxygenatedmagnesium plus ascorbic acid and bioflavonoids. Take 2 capsules at a time,in between meals, or 6 a day, Dr. LaVolpa recommends. 9. DRINK EXTRA WATER It's important to drink much more pure water (not from the tap) during thisprocess to help your body flush the now dead parasites from your system.Adequate, says Dr. Cowden, means at least 64 ounces per day for a 150 poundadult. 10. SANITIZE YOUR ENVIRONMENT When you've almost finished the 10 day round, wash all pajamas, bedclothes, and sheets before using them again. 11. EAT ANTI-PARASITIC FOODS According to Gittleman, these include pineapple and papaya, either as freshjuice or in supplement form in combination with pepsin and hydrochloricacid. You can also use pomegranate juice (four 8-ounce glasses daily),papaya seeds, finely-ground pumpkin seeds (1/4 to 1/2 cup daily), 2 cloves ofraw garlic daily. 12. MODIFY YOUR DIET For bodies ridden with parasites, nutritionist Gittleman recommends a dietcomprising 25% fat, 25% protein, and 50% complex carbohydrates. You alsoneed a regular intake of unprocessed flax seed, safflower, sesame, orcanola oils (2 tablespoons daily), and higher than RDA amounts of vitaminA. Flax seed oil is the most preferable because it has much higher levelsof alpha linolenic acid (commonly deficient in many people) than the otheroils. 13. RECOLONIZE YOUR INTESTINES You need to reintroduce beneficial bacteria into your intestinal system nowthat you have flushed out the parasites, Gittleman advises. The bacterialstrains most helpful here are Lactobacillus acidophilus, bulgaris, andbifidus, and Streptococcus faeceum, which are available as nutritionalsupplements. 14. CHILDREN If you have children, they must be treated at the same time as the adultsin the household, Dr. Cowden advises. Children who can swallow capsules cantake doses of the above-described herbs reduced according to their bodyweight. A 50 pound child would take 1/3 of the adult dose; a 75 pound childwould take 1/3 the adult dose; and a 100 pound child would take 2/3 of theadult dose, says Dr. Cowden. 15. PETS If you have pets, you must treat them at the same time as you treatyourself, otherwise the chance of your getting reinfected from them ishigh. 16. MAINTENANCE After you finish your second 10 day round, Dr. Cowden recommends that youwait 7 days then take, before your largest meal of the day, 2 doses a weekof: 3 capsules Black Walnut, 14 capsules wormwood, 3 capsules cloves. Takethis dose once on Monday, then once on Thursday, and maintain for 23months.Expect to feel uncomfortable for at least 12 days during the first 1014days of the procedure. You may experience achiness, malaise, bloating,intestinal discomfort, gas, even diarrhea for 1 or more days. You mayexperience slight but odd shifts in your psychological state and you mayexperience a variety of temporary sensations, such as, heat in your ears,activity behind your eyes, a momentary sense of dizziness or imbalance, ora transient loss of appetite. If you tend to have low blood sugar, this maytemporarily worsen before it improves. 17. CAUTION Expect to feel uncomfortable for at least 12 days during the first 1014days of the procedure. You may experience achiness, malaise, bloating,intestinal discomfort, gas, even diarrhea for 1 or more days. You mayexperience slight but odd shifts in your psychological state and you mayexperience a variety of temporary sensations, such as, heat in your ears,activity behind your eyes, a momentary sense of dizziness or imbalance, ora transient loss of appetite. If you tend to have low blood sugar, this maytemporarily worsen before it improves. According to Dr. Cowden, these are signs that parasites lodged in variousbody systems (eyes, ears, for example) are being killed off. You may alsohave 1 day, he says, in which you feel completely rotten. This means yourbody is temporarily toxic, filled with dead parasites, as your systemstruggles to flush it all clear. You will feel fine, possibly exceptional,the next day. You must drink extra pure water and take extra vitamin C to flush thetoxins out of your blood, Dr. Cowden says. For adults, take 2000-4000mg ofvitamin C every 12 hours until bowel movements turn to water. This willindicate the toxins are being flushed out of your body. Do this over a 24hour period, then reduce your vitamin C intake to 4000mg daily.

In 1964, Florida physician Jacob Harich, M.D.,discovered that an extract prepared from the ground seeds andmembranous material of the grapefruit had remarkable, quick-actingeffects against infections inside the body and on the skin, ears,and in the mouth. The product was originally marketed as Citricidal and in the yearssince its discovery, grapefruit seed extract has been tested andvalidated by the FDA, USDA, the Pasteur Institute in France, andnumerous physicians. The list of its applications is long and impressive. Grapefruitseed extract works as a multipurpose germ killer, or natural antibiotic,for bacterial and viral problems in the intestines, against yeastinfections (Candida albicans), mild to moderate internal parasiticinfestations, dysentery, as a vaginal douche, for skin cuts andscrapes, gingivitis, strep and sore throat, ear infections, nailfungus, dandruff, sore gums, stomach upsets, wart removal, asa nasal spray, gum cleanser, or foot powder against athlete'sfoot. You can disinfect vegetables and fruits that may have been sprayedwith pesticides or mildly contaminated with microbes by washingthem in a grapefruit seed extract rinse. You can use the product to help rid your body of parasites (See"Parasites-Unwelcome Visitors in Your Body" Prescribing-for Yourself, and in combination with the herbsEchinacea and goldenseal, where it enhances their effects. Grapefruitseed extract is excellent to support the weakened immune systemof people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or AIDS, where it actsas a natural, gentle antibiotic. When the FDA tested grapefruit seed extract in 1990 with 200 patientswho had internal parasitic infections, they found it gave "moresymptomatic relief than any other treatment." Researchersat the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil found the substance tobe "100% effective in skin disinfection when used as a pre-surgicalpreparation compared to a 72% effectiveness rate for alcohol."Physicians in Monterrey, Mexico, found that out of 20 patientswith vaginal yeast infection, 15 had relief of their symptomsin only 3 days after douching with grapefruit seed extract every12 hours. Doctors also report that the citrus extract, when usedtopically, can inactivate the Herpes virus after only 10 minutesof exposure. Grapefruit seed extract is strong and concentrated, so a littlegoes a long way. The product is non-toxic and produces no side-effects.Approximately 3-5% of people will be sensitive to the substanceand may not be able to tolerate its acidity. There are differentstrengths and preparations of Grapefruit seed extract accordingto application. Grapefruit Seed Extract is available as ProSeed™ as LiquidConcentrate, Vegicaps® (vegetarian capsules), Feminine Rinse,Ear Drops, Gum Cleanser, Herbal Cleansing Spray, and Foot Powder.A similar line called Seed-a-Sept[TM], is formulated for physicians.For both, contact: Imhotep, Inc., P.O.

COENZYME Q10 -Life Insurance for Your Heart Although coenzyme Q10 is present in many foods (such as rice andwheat bran) and although the body can make it from the raw materialsin foods, many serious health conditions have now been linkedto a shortage of CoQ10 in the body's nutritional stocks. On thepositive side, taking CoQ10 supplements has been proven to helpin conditions such as heart disease, gum infections, breast cancer,hypertension, diabetes, and a weakened immune system. CoQ10 is a natural chemical substance essential to the generationof energy in the cells. It's called a "coenzyme" becauseit enhances the activity of other enzymes. It was discovered byan American researcher in 1957 and soon after shown to be effectivein treating heart conditions. While CoQ10 is not yet generallyprescribed by physicians in the U.S., in Japan it is among themost widely used of drugs. In one study, 17 patients with mild congestive heart failure took30 mg per day of CoQ10; after 4 weeks, every patient had improvedand 53% had become symptom-free. CoQ10 kept 38% of 641 patientsfrom requiring hospitalization for the same condition; they tookCoQ10 at the rate of 150 mg per day for 1 year. Patients with angina pectoris who took 150 mg per day for 4 weekshad a 53% reduction in chest pain episodes. After 12 weeks onCoQ10, patients with cardiomyopathy (lesions on the heart muscle)enjoyed increased strength in their heart beat and less shortnessof breath. Patients undergoing heart surgery who took CoQ10 14days before and 30 days after surgery recovered faster and withless complications. In other studies, CoQ10 lowered blood pressure significantly in4-12 weeks. Episodes of pulmonary edema, in which fluid buildsup in the lungs, were reduced by 60%, using CoQ10. When diabeticstook CoQ10 at the rate of 120 mg per day, their blood sugars droppedby 20-30%. CoQ10 can actually reverse peridontal or gum disease.As with diabetics, people suffering from gum disease typicallyare deficient in CoQ10. Dosages of 50-75 mg per day can halt thedeterioration of gums, sometimes within days. In studies reported by Dr. Karl Folkers, M.D., formerly of MerckLaboratories and now retired, breast cancer patients who took300-400 mg daily of CoQ10 found their tumors completely regressed. European studies (1994) by K. Lockwood, M.D., S. Moesgaard, M.D.,and Karl Folkers, M.D., indicate that for 32 breast cancer patientstaking 90 mg per day of CoQ10, after 24 months, all were stillalive and 6 had partial remissions; in all cases, the tumor sizehad stabilized. Then one of these patients took 390 mg per dayand within 3 months her tumor had disappeared. When a new breastcancer patient took 300 mg per day, after 3 months, all tracesof her cancer were gone. CoQ10 can also protect your heart against the damaging effectsof certain cancer drugs. Also, if you happen to be taking theseto lower cholesterol, this can dangerously lower body levels ofCoQ10. Animal studies have shown that even at high doses, CoQ10 has notoxic side effects and is safe as a nutritional supplement. Generallyit takes 4-8 weeks for CoQ10 to build up a peak concentrationin the body and to produce noticeable effects. CoQ10 is best absorbedas a supplement when it's prepared dissolved in oil rather thanas a powdered capsule; in fact, one of the leading authoritieson the substance states that the body cannot absorb CoQ10 unlessit is made fat soluble. Chewable wafers of CoQ10, combined withfatty acids, are available and work well. CoQ10 is available as capsules from Prolongevity Ltd., P.O.

SUPER-ANTIOXIDANT FROM GRAPE SEEDS -The "Youth Nutrient" One of our most powerful antioxidants was discovered in 1534 whenCanadian natives showed French explorer Jacques Cartier how tomake a nourishing tea from pine tree bark and needles. Even thoughthese substances had little vitamin C, somehow the brew kept Cartier'screw from dying of scurvy. The mysterious life-saving ingredient in pine tree bark is nowknown as a bioflavonoid, a component of vitamin C. In the 1940s,Dr. Jacques Masquelier gave this compound a special name, pycnogenol(pronounced pick-NAH-gen-all) and began explaining how the pinebark extract could scavenge free radicals in the body even betterthan the "experts," vitamins C and E. A free radical is a chemical compound, usually an unstable formof oxygen, derived from radiation, toxic chemicals, air pollution,overly processed foods, and other contaminants, that damages cellsin the body, degrades collagen, affects DNA, and is implicatedin more than 60 diseases. An antioxidant is a substance that rendersfree radicals inactive. Most alternative medicine physicians recommenda daily intake of antioxidants, usually as vitamins C and E, tomaintain good health. Pycnogenols have been shown to be up to 50 times more effectivethan vitamin E and 20 times stronger than vitamin C in this work.That's why many researchers contend that pycnogenols might bethe most powerful antioxidant yet discovered. European scientistscall it the "youth nutrient" because it helps slow cellmutation and keep collagen (the fibrous part of connective tissue)healthy and flexible. A British scientist calls pycnogenols the"arteriosclerosis antidote" because it helps maintainthe integrity of arteries while enhancing circulation. Then in 1986, Dr. Masquelier found that grape seeds produce aneven better pycnogenol antioxidant than pine tree bark. Grape seed extract is now widely prescribed in France and Italy,which also happen to be abundant in grapes. Doctors prescribegrape seed for improving blood flow to the brain and heart, treatingvaricose veins, skin discoloration at the extremities, such asthe nose, tingling in the extremities, bleeding gums, glaucoma,hemorrhoids, excessive menstrual bleeding, and hardening of thearteries. How much should you take? Consult your physician for a preciseprescription, but researchers suggest a dosage in the range of200-300 mg a day for 5-10 days to saturate the body tissues, thento follow this with a maintenance dose of 60-150 mg. The substanceis absorbed almost immediately by the body (in about 20 minutes)and produces no side effects. Grape Seed extract is available from Carotec, Inc., P.O.

A CANCER MEDICINE FROM THE BARK OF A BRAZILIAN TREE An herbal extract made from the inner bark of the Tabebuia tree,found in Brazil, Argentina, and India, may offer yet another optionin treating cancer. First discovered in 1966, by Argentine botanistDr. Theodor Meyer, the herb now widely known as pau d'arco hasshown promise in helping to regress cancer tumors, especiallywhen used in the disease's earliest stages. Although scientists explain that pau d'arco's main active ingredientis a substance called lapachol, in fact the herb has at least12 aromatic compounds that, acting together, produce its positiveeffects with cancer, leukemia, in addition to colds, flus, syphilis,malaria, infections, gonorrhea, and one kind of lupus. Back in 1970, the National Cancer Institute used pau d'arco ina provisional study with lesions in a breast cancer case. At thetime, NCI concluded that pau d'arco was possibily toxic for humansbecause it could produce nausea and blood-coagulating effects,but later research proved that this herb is no more toxic thancoffee, which is to say, it is essentially nontoxic at moderatedosages. In recent years, isolated studies have suggested that pau d'arcocan help reverse leukemia, restoring dangerously low blood countsof platelets and erythrocytes. Meanwhile, South American physiciansreport dramatic cases of tumors shrinking, pain diminishing, andhopeless cancer cases going into remission, thanks to pau d'arco.A study at the University of Recife in Brazil reported that outof 9 patients taking oral doses of lapachol for 20-60 days, 3had a partial or complete tumor regression. In another case, a man with severe leukemia, after a month ofunsuccessful chemotherapy, took a combination formula of Essiac(a patented multiherb blend) and 10 drops of pau d'arco extracttwice every day. After one week of this program, his blood counthad risen from 4800 to 10,800; after another week, it had furtherclimbed to 14,000 (10,000 is normal). Shortly afterwards, theman left with his family on a 4 month world cruise. CAUTION! Pau d'arco is available as a dried herb or liquid extract.There is some concern in the herb market as to quality and counterfeit(made from other trees) or inferior grades of the herb, so bediscriminating when making your selection.

CANCER A survey of 13,981 elderly residents of an upper-income retirementcommunity in California revealed that those who kept high levelsof beta-carotene and vitamin C in their diets developed less bladdercancer during a 4 year period. Researchers studied what the elderly(average age 74, 75% women) were eating; they all started outcancer-free and relatively healthy. After 4 years, about 10% of the study group developed cancer,but for the other 90% who didn't, researchers found that dietaryvitamin C from fruits and vegetables had a preventive, anticancereffect against all forms of cancer in women. For men, it was effectiveagainst colon cancer alone. -SOURCE: Quarterly Review of Natural Medicine, Spring 1994, pp.69-70; Summer 1994, pp. 101-102. CHRONIC FATIGUE A 1985 Japanese study showed that daily injections of lentinan,a component of shiitake mushrooms, resulted in rapid improvementin many of the conditions associated with chronic fatigue syndrome(CFS). A follow-up study of 23 CFS patients ages 14-77 showedthat lentinan treatment brought one key immune system indicatorback into normal range within 6 months. Physicians had the sameresults using oral lentinan in quantities of 5 mg per dose, whichis about 5 times the intravenous dosage. Fresh and dried shiitake mushrooms are widely available in naturalfoods stores and as supplements. For therapeutic purposes, it'sadvisable to use dried or powdered isolate shiitake as lentinanrepresents only 0.88 to 1.17mg per 6-8 grams of shiitake. -SOURCE: Shiitake-The Healing Mushroom, Kenneth Jones, Healing Arts Press, Rochester, VT, 1995. COLDS AND FLU Studies show that if, the minute you feel a cold or flu comingon, you take the herb Echinacea purpurea extract at the dailyrate of about 900mg for the next 10-14 days, you greatly reduceyour chance of having the full-blown condition. In a study of 180 volunteers, ages 18-60, all of whom had influenza,those taking 900mg of Echinacea extract every day had a reductionin their flu symptoms including weakness, low energy, chills,sweating, sore throat, muscle aches, and headaches. In anotherstudy, with 108 subjects taking Echinacea for 8 weeks had a decreasedfrequency of colds and flu. They had a greater length of timebetween infections (40 days versus 25 days for placebo), and for78% of them, when they did get another cold, their symptoms weremilder. -SOURCE: Townsend Letter for Doctors, January 1995, p. 134.

DIABETIC GANGRENE Mrs. A. was a 90 year old resident of a nursing home who startedto get necrotic ulcers on her toes. Her skin was turning greenfrom gangrene from her toes to her ankle. Some years before she'dhad one leg amputated below the knee for diabetic gangrene andher doctors told her it was happening all over again and she mighthave to have the other leg severed, too. Lucky for her a skilledaromatherapist named Paul Emeny took up her case. Emeny applied tea tree oil directly to the skin ulcers by wayof light dressings soaked in the oil. Almost at once Mrs. A'spain diminished and some of the greenish coloration went away.Then, during 3 week intervals, Emeny applied tea tree oil mixedwith olive oil in reducing percentages (10%, 5%, 3%) to keep herskin moist and to ensure slow absorption. After 9 weeks, the discolorationwent away and life returned to the foot that previously had beencold to the touch. Six months after the start of treatment, Mrs. A's surgeon wasastonished to see that the gangrene had cleared up and no surgerywas needed. -SOURCE: The International Journal of Aromatherapy, Vol. 6, No. 1, 1994, p. 23. HYPERACTIVITY It's estimated that 10% of American children have some form ofbehavioral or learning disability. For these unfortunate childrenthe routine answer is Ritalin or Dexedrine, a kind of biochemicalstraightjacket that is now taken by hundreds of thousands of children. But homeopathy has an alternative treatment for kids who bounceoff the walls and act up in class, says homeopath Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman,N.D., M.S.W, director of the Northwest Center for HomeopathicMedicine in Edmonds, Washington. Ben, age 5, was worse than rambunctious. He was disobedient anddefiant; he often got hysterical and would shout, cry, yell,throw things, hit children, push them around, get suddenly violent,and he always had to be in charge. His bones ached, he had painfulwarts, he often had ear infections and had taken a lot of antiobioticsby the time his homeopath treated him. A single dose of homeopathic Cina, made from the flower wormseed,completely turned Ben around. Almost overnight he became a modelboy: "He is terrific, as perfect as a boy can be," declaredhis mother. Jimmy, age 9, was an abused boy. His parents were alcoholics whoeither beat him or ignored him; most of the time he lived in afoster home. In school, his teachers described him as a disruptivetrouble-maker. He constantly hummed, sang, and twiddled; at night,he tossed and turned; he was always impatient, over-active, andrestless. Yet a single dose of homeopathic Veratrum album, made from theflower white hellebore, changed all this in 2 days. It was asif he were a completely new boy. -SOURCE: Mothering, Spring 1995, pp. 97-101. MENOPAUSE For this life change, the hot flashes of menopause are one ofthe most unpleasant symptoms, but homeopathy has effective remediesas these two cases show. A woman, age 47, started having irregular menstruation and verytroubling hot flashes at night. They woke her up every 2 hourswith a crawling sensation in her nose, hotness in her cheeks,and sticky perspiration all over her chest. Sometimes she feltshe would faint from the nausea that the flashes brought. Belgian homeopath Henny Heudens-Mast gave her one strong doseof homeopathic Kali bichromicum (made from potassium and chromium)that immediately eliminated the symptoms. Six months later theyreturned but were much milder; but after one more dose of thisremedy they went away for good. Another woman, age 46, complained of hormonal imbalance, moodswings, and severe hot flashes. She broke out in drenching sweats,was depressed, exhausted, and prone to crying. Her menstrual cyclefirst became irregular then stopped. After Corinne Rovetti, M.S.N., a nurse-homeopath, prescribed onedose of homeopathic Lachesis 200c which is made from Bushmastersnake venom, her symptoms disappeared and colleagues at work foundher a changed woman. Over the following year, her menstruationgradually returned as she occasionally took more Lachesis, as prescribed. -SOURCE: New England Journal of Homeopathy, Vol. 3, No. 4, Autumn 1994. SINUSITIS German physician Michael Weiser, M.D. tested Euphorbium compositumS. nasal spray (a preparation containing 8 homeopathic remedies)against a placebo on 172 patients. Each patient received 2 dischargesof spray into each nostril 4 times a day for 5 months. Patients with chronic sinusitis experienced considerable improvementin terms of reduced headaches, sinus pressure, and breathing difficulties.Another study conducted by German doctors with 3510 patients withchronic sinusitis found that 75% rated the nasal spray as "excellent"to "good."

STAMMERING Belgian homeopath Guy Kokelenberg treated a young boy with a stammeringproblem with one dose of homeopathic Baryta carbonica 200C (acarbonate of the mineral barium). The next day the boy's motherbrought in a glass jar with a one yard long roundworm that herson had evacuated the previous evening in his bowels. He neverstammered again. -SOURCE: Small Remedies & Interesting Cases VI.

DEPRESSION St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), a lovely plant with yellowflowers that has been used medicinally for 2000 years, now emergesas an effective agent in reducing mild to moderate depression. In one study, 105 patients under care for depression took 900mgof St. John's Wort daily for 4 weeks, then were evaluated accordingto standard psychological tests. The results showed that the herbhad reduced the amount and intensity of depressive symptoms includingsadness, headache, poor sleep, exhaustion, and a sense of worthlessness. -SOURCE: Quarterly Review of Natural Medicine, Spring 1994, pp. 17-18.

Members of Congress and the public start to question the FDA'sstridently antialternative medicine activities. The Life Extension Foundation has engaged an Illinois attorneyto file a class-action suit against the Food and Drug Administration,Chicago branch, on behalf of a growing number of people who havehad "unapproved" drugs, ordered for personal use, illegallydetained by the FDA. The suit is justified on the basis that the FDA's official publicpolicy permits individuals to import small amounts of unapproveddrugs and substances for personal use without fear of reprisal. Spokespeople for this initiative are criticizing FDA's policiesof protecting the pharmaceutical companies against competitionand denying lifesaving medicines as "corrupt, illegal, andimmoral." In 1991, Life Extension Foundation spent $30,000in lawyer's fees in a class-action suit against the FDA for denyingaccess by Alzheimer's patients to an experimental drug. The action against the FDA's Chicago branch is part of a largerpublic outcry against FDA excesses in general, especially withrespect to alternative medicine where it too often takes an armedgestapo approach to regulation. Speaker of the House, Newt Ging-rich, stirred up a firestorm whenhe branded the FDA as "the leading job killer in America,"referring to FDA's chronic delay in approving new medical devicesand thus jobs. Gingrich has also described the current FDA commissioner as "athug." His plan calls for replacing the FDA in 5 years withan agency staffed with "biomedical entrepreneurs, not careerbureaucrats." The Washington Legal Foundation took out afull-page ad in the New York Times this past January with a banner headline: "The problem with health care in America is theFDA." Elsewhere the FDA is being criticized for apparent ethics violationsin the way it handled the approval process for the controversialbovine growth hormone. According to the Government AccountingOffice, FDA employees involved in the approval process also hadties to Monsanto Company, the product's manufacturer. U.S. Rep.Bernard Sanders of Vermont said the FDA stretched its own rulesto the breaking point and "allowed corporate influence torun rampant." In a special "FDA Raid Report," Life Extension Magazinemakes the forceful claim that the FDA is the enforcement arm ofthe medical establishment. Citing a roster of examples of illegaland unconstitutional FDA raids, Life Extension further assertsthat the FDA continually shows a pattern of unlawful behavior."Its role is to search out and destroy threats to the highprofits made on toxic drugs and medical equipment designed tokeep terminal patients in an extended state of pain and suffering." Life Extension's assertions are finding support in Congress. InApril 1995, four prominent Congressmen wrote FDA CommissionerKessler a stern letter regarding his Gestapo-type approach toenforcement. There is now "widespread fear of retaliation"by FDA personnel against witnesses, FDA employees, and otherswho cooperate with FDA investigations and hearings. "Not only could such retaliation be considered a crime, itis something that has never been or will be tolerated by thisCommittee," wrote the Congressmen. They will "act togethervigorously to expose FDA retaliation, punishment, or intimidation,and to take appropriate steps, including criminal prosecution,against any FDA officials involved." -SOURCE: Life Extension: New Health and Medical Findings fromaround the World, December 15, 1994, p. 5.

Vol. 2, No. 1, 1995, pp.100-102 HANDS ON THE BACK MAY BE THE BEST TREATMENT, Says U.S. Government Study It was 100 years ago this September that Daniel David Palmer,the founder of chiropractic, performed his first adjustment ona deaf janitor in Davenport, Iowa. Harvey Lillard had been deaffor 17 years when he came to Palmer for treatment, but he toldPalmer something very interesting. His deafness started when heheard something "pop" in his back. In chiropractic terms, one of his vertebrae had gone out of alignment.This "subluxation" caused the hearing loss. When Palmermade the appropriate adjustment, Lillard's hearing returned. From that moment on, the new medical science of "done byhand" (chiropractic) was born. Today there are 50,000 chiropractorsworking in the U.S., about 11,000 students in the 18 chiropracticcolleges, and an estimated 15-20 million patients. One in 15 Americans sees a chiropractor at least once a year andaccording to a 1991 Gallup poll, 90% of patients regard theirchiropractic care as effective. About 80% find the treatment costsreasonable, and 70% say they would surely make another chiropracticappointment. All told, American patients are spending $2.4 billiona year on chiropractic treatment. Three different studies in the last 6 years revealed that chiropracticcare is considered safer and more effective for low-back painthan most other types of physical therapy. This is highly importantbecause according to a new U.S. government report from the Agencyfor Health Care Policy and Research, 80% of all adults sufferfrom back pain sometime in their lives. Even better, the report advocates seeing a chiropractor over prescriptionpainkillers, lengthy bed rest, and surgery. The studies showedthat patients are 3 times more satisfied with chiropractic treatmentthan are patients who see conventional doctors for low-back problems. -SOURCE: The Chiropractic Journal, Vol. 9, No. 5, February 1995; Today's Chiropractic, Vol. 24, No. 1, Jan/Feb 1995.

DON'TLISTEN TO PROZAC In case you've been tempted to try out the highly popular antidepressantProzac, made even more famous by the best-selling book, Listening to Prozac, think again. Be advised that just because the FDA approvedit, doesn't mean it's safe. In fact, mounting evidence now suggestsit is far from safe. The FDA has received more adverse reactionreports for Prozac than for any other product in the last 24 years. The FDA doesn't want anyone to know (but it is public knowledge,if you know where to look) that as of September 1993, it had received28,623 reports of bad reactions to the drug. This is 10 timesthe number reported for Halcion, another psychiatric drug thatwas eventually banned in Great Britain, but not in the U.S. The adverse reactions to Prozac include convulsions, hallucinations,aggression, delirium, violent hostility, and psychosis. Add tothis reports of 1885 attempted suicides and 1734 deaths (1089by suicides) and Prozac's real story emerges. Evidence now suggests that certain aspects of the drug's originalclinical trials may have been fraudulent. Further, informationis now coming out that shows improper links between FDA personneland Eli Lilly Company, Prozac's manufacturer. This may explainwhy the FDA remains opposed to taking any action against Prozacdespite the considerable negative evidence against it. There's still more to the Prozac cover-up. Recent studies withmice suggest that Prozac may actually accelerate cancer tumorgrowth even on the standard and moderate dosages of 1-4 Prozacpills per day. -SOURCE: Perceptions: Revealing Facts on Government, Health &Metaphysics, Fall 1994, pp. 25-28; Search for Health, Vol. 3,2 & 3, November 1994/February 1995, pp. 67-68. The AMA - Looking After Medicine's Special Interests Only 23% of Americans think the AMA is a reliable source of health information and 70% are losing faith in their conventional doctors, reveals a 1993 poll. You may not realize it, but the American Medical Association (AMA),the nation's largest physician's trade group, representing about41% of American M.D.s, has its hands in every aspect of your everydaylife. Founded in 1847, 3 years after American homeopaths firstorganized their association, the AMA now looms as a monolithiccommunicator of medical information-and biases. Each week their public relations staff sends out news releasesto 4000 medical journalists; they send video news releases to800 TV outlets; and taped medical reports to 5000 radio stations. There is probably no other organization on Earth that distributesmore words about conventional medicine to doctors and the publicthan the AMA. Ever wonder why commercial television and mostmainstream magazines are so sarcastic and skeptical about alternativemedicine? Just follow the paper trail out of the editor's officeback to the AMA. The AMA also works hard to keep certain other words from reachingthe public. Such as denying public access to the National PractitionerData Bank, run by the U.S. government, that lists all M.D.s whohave committed malpractice, crimes, or ethical violations. Foryou, the citizen, this information is off limits. In addition,to the AMA goes a fair amount of credit for blocking health carereform in 1994. Fortunately, the American public is waking up to the AMA's monopolisticcontrol over information and medical practice. M.D.s are no longerthe "Marcus Welby" heroes they once were. Polls showthat the AMA's public approval rating fell from 59% in 1986 to43% in 1993. The number of Americans who thought the AMA was areliable source of information on health declined from a low of31% in 1989 to a trough of only 23% in 1993. That year polls alsoshowed that 70% of Americans are beginning to lose their faithin conventional doctors. It's highly unlikely they'll do it, given their history, but perhapsthe polls are saying it's time the AMA started looking after thepatients' interests for a change. -SOURCE: The Serpent on the Staff.

MASS FLUORIDATION PROPOSED FOR CALIFORNIA- The Wrong Kind of Trend-Setting Despite growing evidence of fluoride's ill effects on health fromresearchers in this country and abroad, legislators in Californiahave introduced Assembly Bill 733 to make it mandatory to addfluoride to all California drinking water by the year 2000. Thebill is supported, no doubt vigorously, by the Centers for DiseaseControl and the American Dental Association, who have retaineda publicist to sell the idea to the California public. Scientific studies have definitively shown that fluoride doesnot produce fewer cavities in children, while evidence mountsthat the negative side-effects of regular fluoride consumption(through drinking water) can produce any of several dozen healthproblems. National Health Federation (NHF) is mounting publicopposition to this proposed bill and can advise readers how bestto proceed in blocking its passage. This could affect more than Californians; all Americans concernedwith freedom of choice in their foods and medicines should supportNHF in this effort. Contact: NHF, P.O.

Meinig, D.D.S., Bion Publishing, 323 E. Matilija Street,#110-151, Ojai, CA 93023; 1994, $19.95, 220 pp., paper. If you're the owner of one of the 24 million infected teeth thatwere not extracted but dredged for a root canal last year, youmay wish you had read this book first. Or if you have undergoneseveral root canals, you may wish you'd never heard of it, orlearned that the true cover-up in root canal therapy is not thesubstance lining your hollowed out tooth canals, but the factthat the whole procedure may be frought with problems, infectingyour body, compromising your health, and probably not worth thediscomfort. The trouble with root canals is that bacteria become trapped withinthe literally 3 miles of microscopic dentin tubules inside a single-roottooth. The bacterial toxins then circulate throughout the body,wreaking biological havoc, including crippling degenerative diseases.Antibiotics can't kill the bacteria once they're trapped insidethe tooth, so their only way out is down-into the body. "Onethird of all disease in this country can be either directly orindirectly traced to dental infections," Dr. Meinig asserts. Meinig bases his upsetting pronouncements on the basis of 25 yearsof research by Dr. Weston Price, first published (and ignored)in 1923, whom he regards as "the world's greatest dentist."Meinig supports his case with photographs, charts, patient studies,the results of Dr. Price's studies with 5000 rabbits, and concisesummaries along the way. Should you cancel your next root canal session or have all yourroot-canalled teeth extracted? Not necessarily. It depends onthe vitality of your immune system and your genetic, constitutionalcondition. Price's research showed that 25% of patients whosefamily histories were free of degenerative diseases and who hadtop-notch immune systems "could expect to have and retainroot canal fillings and live without complications arising therefrom through old age," writes Meinig. But for the other 75%, better think twice before the dentistdigs a canal in your tooth as this important, pioneering bookwarns. Your Mind is the Key to Healing, Says Truth-Telling M.D. Confessions of a Healer: The Truth from an Unconventional Family Doctor O.T. Bonnet, M.D., MacMurray & Beck, P.O. Box 4257, Aspen,CO 81612; tel: 303-925-5284; 1994, $18.95, 244 pp, hardcover. If the good country doctor , O.T. Bonnett, M.D., has a "wordpill" to offer us on the basis of 44 years of practice and69 years of living it's this: change your outlook on life. Start thinking for yourself and accept responsibility for yourself,your medical treatment, and your recovery. Dr. Bonnett fleshesout his charming, personable memoir (which is also equal partslecture and case book) with numerous examples from his long practiceas a family doctor in a small town. Your mind is a key player in any illness and any chance of recovery,Bonnet argues-he uses hypnosis in his practice-and he shows howit all works in heart disease, cancer, asthma, arthritis, andother ills. In fact, Bonnet says that hypnosis should be "highon the list of useful investigational and therapeutic methods"and that every physician should be "as skilled in the useof hypnosis as he is with his stethoscope." In Bonnet's view, "our bodies are constantly being constructedaccording to our thoughts and beliefs," so watch carefullywhat you think and under no conditions, he adds, should you seeyourself as a victim. Bonnet dishes out blunt criticism of both the conventional medicalprofession and professional patients. He tells you what's wrongwith mainstream doctors and what's wrong with you, the conventionalpatient. Yet Bonnet admits at the end of the day, that while hetalked and taught, begged and pleaded, told stories, made jokes,yelled, pounded the desk, and swore at his patients in an attemptto lead them to self-understanding, "the most important thingI did was to love them." Not your typical M.D. (especially in the generation precedingtoday's love-doctors like Bernie Siegel and Deepak Chopra), whichis why Bonnet is an instructive, uncompromising read. A Doctor Questions the Medical System Then Defects to the Alternative The Medical Mafia: How to Get Out of it Alive and Take Back our Health & Wealth Guylaine Lanctôt, M.D. Here's The Key, Inc., 1995, 249 pp., paper, $14.95. P.O. Box 223, Morgan VT 05853; tel: 802-895-4914. Dr. Lanctôt, is clearly a philosopher in doctor's garb.During the 20 years of her conventional medical practice, shenever once stopped asking vital questions of her profession, includingthis one: Why are we so little informed about alternative medicine?When she found the answer, it completely changed her focus asa physician. According to Lanctôt, the problem is that we have a medicineof sickness, not health. Conventional medicine is too expensive,it looks at humans as machines, and leaves nearly everyone dissatisfied.The solution is to develop a medicine of health. This treats thecauses, not the symptoms, of illness, and could reduce the costof medical care by 75%, Lanctôt, argues. The reason thisis not happening yet is because of a major obstacle-the MedicalMafia. In Lanctôt's view, this is the powerful conglomerate ofmainstream doctors, hospitals, insurance and drug companies, allof whom have taken the power away from patients in the name oftheir health "security." In practice, "the systemis at the service of the industry which pulls the strings andmaintains a system of sickness for its own profit." The possible outcome of a profound overhaul of how we do medicalcare in America could be the realization of self-health, saysLanctôt. To make this happen, we need a new partnershipand collaboration between the patient and doctor acting in thesole interests of the patient on behalf of health. But for thisto happen, the silent, seemingly powerless mass of health careusers must rise up and reclaim their rights. "The only one who has the ultimate power to change the systemis the patient," and that is the key to self-health, Lanctôtsays. Her book is bold, forthright, challenging (and effectivelyillustrated), carrying the moral authority of an M.D. who defectedfrom a system that doesn't work to one that does. If you havemixed feelings about mainstream medicine, Lanctôt will stirthings up for you; if you're on the edge of changing your mind,Lanctôt will push you over into a radically new attitudeabout medicine in America.

Other titles in this much-needed and well-executed series include discussionsof menopause, male sexual vitality, chronic fatigue syndrome,stress, anxiety, and insomnia. In the present volume, Murray walksyou through the naturopathic approach to gaining control of yourblood sugar metabolism. The hallmark of the naturopathic approach, expertly presentedhere by Dr. Murray, is to work with the vital energies of thewhole body to bring balance to the system through trusting thehealing power of Nature. After carefully explaining the natureof diabetes and hypoglycemia, Murray delves into dietary, nutritional,and herbal recommendations for regulating blood sugar. He alsoexplains the links between smoking, alcohol, and exercise withblood sugar regulation. Murray rounds off his sound advice with a reflection on the roleof the physician as teacher or health educator. "The physician'srole is to teach the patient about achieving health and avoidingdisease," Murray notes, making some well-earned plugs fornaturopathic medicine, now on the rise in America. "In mostinstances, the natural alternative offers significant benefitover standard medical practices," he adds, perhaps understatingthe situation. The Cancer Solution Robert E.

"The treatment for cancer throughout the modern and industrialworld has been a total disaster and a failure," writes Dr.Wilner, who retired after 35 years of medical practice to researcha huge range of alternative cancer therapies not widely knownin the U.S., thanks largely to "the suppressive efforts ofthe FDA, the AMA, and the pharmaceutical industry." His ardentgoal in The Cancer Solution is to help convert the reader from "victim to victor." The "solution" to cancer lies in any of dozens of non-toxic,safe, and relatively inexpensive natural therapies to which Dr.Wilner devotes most of this excellent book. Here you can readabout herbal formulas from Chinese, Ayurvedic and Western herbaltraditions, the role of medicinal mushrooms, diet and nutritiontherapies, immune stimulants, electromagnetic field therapy, ozone,and many other techniques still on the edge of the cancer solution. Readers of Dr. Wilner's provocative guide to alternative cancertherapies will be reassured that he puts his body where his ideasare in the fact that he is a bladder cancer survivor. Althoughhe had the tumor surgically removed 20 years ago, he creditsthe fact that he's never had a recurrence to the radical changeshe since made in his diet, lifestyle, and attitude. In other words,to following his own good advice presented here. Above all, Wilnercounsels, be heretical: don't believe in the myth of incurablecancer. Wilner's ardent goal is to help convert the reader from "victimto victor." Above all, Wilner counsels, be heretical: don'tbelieve in the myth of incurable cancer. Dr. Wilner, who died this spring, will be missed by the Digestand his many readers.

Dr. Hazel Parcells Shares Her Secrets of Longevity At 105, the Grande Dame of alternative medicine shows you how to be healthy in an unhealthy world and live past 100. If you want living proof that alternative medicine not only can help you regain yourhealth but will help you live a very long time, Dr. Hazel Parcells is your bestexample. If anyone deserves the title, "Grande Dame of Alternative Medicine," at age105 it is the immaculately well-preserved Dr. Parcells. And if anyone is interestedin living longer, better, with greater health and quality of life-and who isn't?-theyshould give Dr. Parcells' prescription for longevity and robust health theirundivided attention. So, perhaps one way to live to be 105 is to almost die when you're 40, and, notdying, to totally redo the way you eat, live, and think. That's what Hazel Parcellsdid back in 1929 when she was diagnosed with incurable tuberculosis with heart andkidney complications. She had spent her life, like so many others of her generation, dependent on andtrusting in the advice of conventional physicians, yet now they had abandoned her asuntreatable. They gave her a bottle of useless tablets, warning her she could dropdead any minute, and waved her good-bye. But something in Parcells-at the time, she was a typical middle-aged housewifemanaging a beauty salon in Walsenburg, Colorado-rebelled and she resolved to find herway out of illness back into health. "This was probably the most fortunate moment inmy life," Parcells explains today, "for I realized that I had to do something and notdepend on accepted forms of healing. I had to seek my own way." Perhaps she overdid it, because here she is at 105 sporting the complexion, energylevel, wit and mental acuity of a woman easily 60 years younger. Add to this themodesty, charm, and wisdom of old age and you have an extraordinary healer whoinspires everyone younger than she that the secret to long life is at hand. With medical degrees in naturopathy and chiropractic (and two Ph.D.s, one in nutrition,the other in religion), Dr. Parcells has been the director, since 1947, of theParcells' System of Scientific Living, based in Sapello and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Through this effort, she has treated, educated, and inspired thousands with thesecrets of long life. "I have been using these methods in my own kitchen and in myresearch and teaching for 30 years and there has never been an unsatisfactoryreaction of any kind, to my knowledge." 1) Preserve the Life Energy in Foods It all begins with correct nutrition, or what Dr. Parcells calls the mastery ofkitchen chemistry. "I was just an ordinary human being with very little informationabout anything, except that I knew our food was important," says Dr. Parcells. Shespent many years researching, studying, and experimenting, using herself as primeguinea pig. Today, her own longevity is her most outstanding result. Her first line of inquiry, when she decided she wasn't going to die, was the life energy in foods; she would use this to rebuild her ill body. Bear in mind that unlike today, back in1930s' America, information on natural healing and alternative medicine was foundonly after diligent research. As she healed her lungs, heart, and kidneys, she came to appreciate how crucial isthe electromagnetic energy in foods. "In fact, I learned that this electromagneticenergy is life itself." She also learned that it is necessary to carefully preservethis life energy through correct methods of food preparation, combination, andcooking. For Dr. Parcells, "correct" means scientific, so she devised unique ways ofactually measuring the energy values of foods, body organs, and states of wellnessand illness. Then she calculated how to match these 3 factors to optimize health. "This system allows us to determine consistently at what energy rate our bodies arefunctioning," says Dr. Parcells. "I have learned that when the body is restored toits normal functional rate of [electromagnetic] energy, there is no illness." In the 1950s, Dr. Parcells worked with about 75 doctors and their patients at SierraStates University in Los Angeles, California, where she was the head of the NutritionDepartment. She studied nutrition intensively, examining how each person'sbiochemistry responds differently to the same food nutrients. She recorded the energyrates of a person before eating specific foods, then the changes in their energy flowevery hour afterwards, to see how well that person's digestive system actuallyhandled the specific food. "If the energy is lowered following intake, the food isnot fulfilling its mission, but if the energy remains unchanged, the food issupporting the life force at its present level," Dr. Parcells explains. Using this approach. she was able to record all the changes in a person'selectromagnetic energy in response to specific foods. This is the key to scientificnutrition, correct eating, and longevity because it tells you directly what to eatand avoid. You no longer burden your body (or make it ill) with the wrong foods andenergies. For Dr. Parcells, one secret to longevity and healing is this: keep theenergy of foods intact so your body can get its full benefit of the health-givingvitality in foods. LONG-LIFE SECRET:Eat and Cook Smart Food combining is crucially important. Don't combine two kinds of flesh foods in asingle meal, such as fish and chicken. Don't mix dairy with flesh proteins. Don'tserve meat, fish, poultry, or other flesh foods with grain starches such as bread,pastries, cereals, dried beans, or pasta. Starch foods such as potatoes, rice, ormillet may be served with proteins if you also include a green leafy salad in themeal. Use virgin olive oil for cooking. Keep up your intake of pure sea salt; this cannormalize both highs and lows in your blood sugar. Avoid all aluminum products incooking and stay with stainless steel, Corning ware, iron, or glass. Don't boil yourfoods; cook them, preferably by steaming, at the lowest possible temperature; avoidpressure cookers as they rob foods of nutrients. 2) Correct the Energy in Your Cells Health and illness take place at the cellular level of your body. Contrary toaccepted medical belief, Dr. Parcells states that all degenerative conditions developwhen the cells are chemically alkaline. She discovered this, literally, in the field,while investigating unproductive farm soils. She studied soil so chemicalized thateven strong pesticides could no longer curb the crop pests. The soil was dead. Whenshe restored it to a normal acid-alkaline balance, the bugs and bacteria disappeared.Dr. Parcells observed the same relationship between alkalinity and disease inanimals. This led her to conclude that "all of our decaying substances and deterioratingconditions take place in a highly alkaline state." In fact, the body of a person whois chronically tired and sleepy is overly alkaline and will age quickly, but whenthe cells in a body are more acid, the person ages less quickly and has "more pep anddrive." This means another key to healing and lasting health is to change your cellularenvironment by restoring its acid-alkaline balance. Introduce more acidity to thecells-in other words, use nutrition to alter the internal environment of theperson-and you can control and eliminate degenerative conditions and illness, saysDr. Parcells. The easiest way to make this change is to become scientific (andpractical) about how and what you, as a biochemically unique person, eat. Betterliving through chemistry, quips Dr. Parcells. LONG-LIFE SECRET:Cleanse Your Cells "Cleanse the body; give it the right building materials and nature will heal andbuild," says Dr. Parcells. She developed the "Formula X Broth Cleansing Program" as away of cleaning pollutants out of cell tissues. In this program, you drink 8 ouncesof one kind of fresh, unsweetened juice (alternating grapefruit, apple, tomato, andsauerkraut) every hour for 12 hours a day for 8 days. In addition, you take Dr.Parcells' special Formula X Broth (made of 6 high-acid dried herbs) and a mild herballaxative. Otherwise you eat or drink nothing else. "If you do this every 6 months,along with a bowel cleanout program, you'll have no health problems," Dr. Parcellstates. LONG-LIFE SECRET: Energize Your Drinking Water According to Dr. Parcells' research, distilled water is energetically dead. Most ofour tap water is not much better, but here is a way to enliven it. Fill a clear glasstumbler with distilled water, set a crystal prism on top of the glass, and placetumbler and prism under a full spectrum light or in direct sunlight. This candramatically raise the water's energy reading, states Dr. Parcells. "We found that bydrinking this water, we raised our energy rate by a like amount." 3) Get the Poisons out of Your Foods and Body Dr. Parcells' line of research and practical results were years ahead of mainstreamso-called science, and they still are. Today she is tutor to several hundred M.D.swho study regularly with her; she likes to watch their skepticism change into truebelief. "They start off scoffing but they end up praying," she says with a giggle. Ifyou catch Dr. Parcells indulging in giggles, she is just as likely to get somberabout the unbelievable decline in the quality of the Western diet and the equallyawesome deterioration and polluting of the environment-all of which she has witnessedfirsthand and documented in the last 60 years. Yet none of this fazed her; rather, she responded to it with the spirit of the truescientist. She simply figured out easy things anyone could do at home to neutralizeall these "deterrents" to good health. Dr. Parcells' system of scientific living and kitchen chemistry begins and ends infood. Almost everyone knows today that the quality of our vegetables is shamefulcompared to what it used to be, and even buying organic vegetables is no guaranteeyou will be getting high- quality nutrients in your diet. That's because our soilsare grossly impoverished and poisoned, worn out from several generations ofagribusiness chemicals. So, to stay healthy, you have to learn clever ways of coping with these substandardconditions. The value of the Parcells' System of Scientific Living is its list ofprocedures to cleanse foods, neutralize their poisons, and enhance their nutritionalvalue. If you or your foods are polluted, master the techniques of cleansing, neutralizing,and detoxification. "What I have learned in my study of energy is that we are allenergy. When that energy changes, it changes the condition." Correct the energyfields of body and food and you generate healing and long life, Dr. Parcellsexplains. LONG-LIFE SECRET: Purify Your Foods This technique will rid the food items of harmful toxins, chemicals, sprays, andpoisons, and it will noticeably improve the flavor and shelf life of the foods. Before cooking with them, soak all your fruits, eggs, meats, and vegetables in a bathof Chlorox and water, at the rate of Þ teaspoon Chlorox to 1 gallon water. Make sureit is the old-fashioned, pure Chlorox; this is hydrochloric acid, not chlorine.Divide your foods into the following categories and soak no longer than the timelisted: leafy vegetables (10-15 minutes); root vegetables (15-30 minutes),thin-skinned berries (10-15 minutes), heavy-skinned fruits (15-30 minutes), eggs(20-30 minutes), thawed meats (5-10 minutes per pound). Prepare a fresh batch of Chlorox water for each category of foods; dispose of bathsafter use. Soak all Chlorox-water treated foods in a fresh water bath for 5-10minutes before using. "This treatment has been used for the last 30 years by manyfamilies, saving them untold expenses for illness with no unfavorable reports," saysDr. Parcells. LONG-LIFE SECRET:Illuminate Your Foods Dr. Parcells developed (and now markets) the Thea-Lite to use light and magneticfield energy to neutralize the effects of spray residues, metallics, pollutants, andadditives from foods, especially grains and liquids, that cannot be easily immersedin the Chlorox-water bath. Place your food item (for example: milk, cream, butter, cereals, grains, beans,canned foods) under the Thea-Light for a variable amount of time (10-30 minutes)depending on the density of the food. Dr. Parcells also developed the NormalizingColor Unit to effectively deactivate Cobalt-60, a harmful radiation increasingly inuse in the preservation of food by irradiation. The unit uses high-quality sheets ofcolored "cathedral" glass (green and blue) to neutralize Cobalt-60. LONG-LIFE SECRET:Take a Therapeutic Bath You need to cleanse your internal environment, too. Here are 2 of Dr. Parcells'personal bathing formulas. Bathing Formula 1: This is recommended after exposure to Xrays, environmentalradiation, and Cobalt-60 for symptoms of headaches, nausea, cramps, or muscle aches.Mix 1 pound of sea or rock salt and 1 pound of baking soda in a tub of very hotwater. Immerse your body in the water for at least 20 minutes or until the watercools to body temperature. Do not shower or rinse the salt off your body for 8 hours. 4) Remember, the Impossible Is Always Possible Although she spends more time these days teaching, making videos, and developing ahome study correspondence course, Dr. Parcells still sees students. True to theessence of naturopathy, she regards each patient as a unique individual with aspecific biochemical pattern and electromagnetic energy. LONG-LIFE SECRET:Heal Yourself with Magnetic Fields. Many years ago Dr. Parcells developed a therapeutic bed called a Relaxing Unit thatuses magnetic field energy to provide relief for numerous conditions. The unitconsists of a table into which electrical coils have been placed, and apositive/negative current switch; the unit itself is plugged into the wall socket.The positive and negative currents generate magnetic fields which stimulate healing. Say you have hyperactivity, hyperthyroidism, hypertension, hyper-anything; spend20-30 minutes on the Relaxing Unit in the positive field. This will reduce the "fieldcharge"(or "hyper" quality) in your body. Then spend the same amount of time lying inthe negative field to rebuild body energy. Or say you're exhausted; spend 20 minutesin the negative electrical field. The unit is already used by both physicians andpatients alike and is available for approximately $1500. Dr. Parcells' casebook is rich with examples of how she produced healing where otherdoctors had failed. The trick is to understand how the body works at the level ofcellular energy and then to adjust the inner environment accordingly. Ridding thebody of intestinal worms and systemic parasites is a cornerstone of Dr. Parcells'approach, but so is shoring up the endocrine glands, especially the four "power"glands: adrenals, thyroid, pituitary, and pineal. "I've studied these glands sincethe 1930s. I know glands. By knowing how to regulate the endocrines, I've had moresuccesses and done more impossible things than you could guess." For the first 105 years of her unusually productive life, Dr. Parcells has been alocal legend in New Mexico, but with the imminent publication of her memoirs, Life inBalance, (cowritten with Joseph Dispenza) by a major New York publisher she is poisedto rapidly (become deservedly) become a national legend. No matter: when you're 60years ahead of your time and you know the secrets of long life, you can afford towait until your twelfth decade for recognition to catch up with you. As Dr. Parcellsquips, "Don't say die; say damn, and keep going. Dying is easy, but it's livingthat's difficult." "I've studied these glands sincethe 1930s. I know glands. By knowing how to regulate the endocrines, I've had moresuccesses and done more impossible things than you could guess."

Dr. Hazel Parcells' Keys to a Long Life Don't believe the doctors if they say your condition is untreatable. Master your kitchen chemistry. Understand that energy is the master key to health. Preserve the life energy in foods through correct preparation and cooking. Match the energy of foods to your body's specific energy and needs. Master the kitchen science of correct food combining to optimize digestion and absorption of nutrients. Restore your body's acid-alkaline balance. Neutralize and eliminate harmful pollutants from your food, air, and water through cleansing them. Add more energy to your body and foods using color and magnetic fields. Detoxify your body, cleanse your colon of possible parasites. Support your endocrine glands with supplements. Know and manage your body's energy fields. The Determination Board Biochemically Correct Answers to Your Health Needs in Seconds The Determination Board is a slender, lightweight rectangular box made of Plexiglas[TM],topped with a 360º measuring device and an open circle and accompanied by a silverpendulum. First you place a "witness" on the open circle of the board; this can be sputum,blood, a photo, or the written name and birthday of the person. Second, you take thesubstance in question (a small amount of, for example, metallic aluminum, or thevitamin herb, vegetable, or medicine) also inside this circle. Then by carefullyusing the pendulum within the space of the 360 degree measuring circle, you get anumerical reading, or answer. Results higher than 120, which is the healthy energybaseline of organs or the entire body, indicate good to high nutritional content andan acidic quality; results lower than 120 are too alkaline and not good for you. For Dr. Parcells, there are very few "impossible" cases. Things come up in her treatments that would astound the conventional doctor... A man with lifelong diabetes was entering a steep decline and all medical attempts toheal him were failing. Dr. Parcells determined he had a severe tapeworm infestationin his intestines. Using a formula she developed herself, she quickly cleaned out hissystem, purging all the parasites and his diabetes soon became manageable again."I've seen this happen over and over, especially with children, that a greater partof your diabetes cases are the result of worms that upset the sugar balance among theorgans." After a 9-year-old boy had a tooth extracted, his jaw shut tight and nobody couldopen it. Doctors kept him in the hospital for 3 days but were unable to open his jaw.By good fortune, the boy's mother heard of Dr. Parcells and asked her for help. Sheanalyzed the boy's condition, then prescribed a special calcium, vitamin B12 and parathyroid glandular supplement. She did this knowing that the parathyroid glandgoverns calcium function which, in turn, affects the jaws. The boy opened his mouthin 2 hours and had no further symptoms. A young boy was brought to her office having cried and had spasms the previous night;he had eaten a large amount of chemically sprayed, unwashed apples. At the same time,a woman in her fifties came in with similar symptoms. She had travelled with herhusband, a mining inspector, deep into the Earth and consumed tainted water. Ananalysis of both patients revealed a common cause: arsenic poisoning. Dr. Parcellsprescribed a Chlorox bath to get the arsenic toxins out of their bodies through theskin. Both recovered quickly.

[Go to the Table of Contents] Take Control of Your Aging! SPECIAL FOCUS ON LONGEVITY How Human Growth Hormone Can Reverse Aging Normally, as you age your body runs low on a crucial brain-secreted hormone, but now injections of Human Growth Hormone can turn the aging process around and put youth back into your life. By Elmer M. Cranton, M.D. and James P. Frackelton, M.D. ©1995 Are aging and physical decline inevitable? No, says alternative medicine, and hereare two examples to prove it. H.T., a 64-year-old businessman, has been giving himself daily injections of HumanGrowth Hormone for the past 4 years. Here are the results in his own words: "Myenergy, stamina and sex drive are like those of a 30 year-old. Muscle tone isfantastically improved. My waist went from 42 inches to 34 and my body fat went from29 to 12% of body weight. The palsy in my hand is gone, I discarded my bifocalglasses, and my skin has changed from tissue-thin to youthful. I look in the mirrorin the morning and can't believe this guy is me. It looks like me when I was 30." J.H., a 40-year-old businesswoman, suffered for many years with chronic fatigue andconstant pain in her jaw and head from degeneration in the temporal mandibular joints(TMJ syndrome). After taking daily growth hormone injections, she states: "I was a40-year-old woman with a 60-year-old body. On growth-hormone therapy, my TMJ pain isgone completely; my energy and stamina are increased, fat is decreased, and I feelmuch more alive, blossoming inside, almost euphoric." This is an indication of what human growth hormone replacement therapy can do toreverse or slow the age-related symptoms of physical and mental decline. To appreciate the merits of human growth hormone, first it's necessary to understandhormones and their role in health. Hormones are tiny chemical messengers continuouslysecreted into the blood stream by the endocrine glands (pituitary, pineal, thyroid,thymus, adrenal) to regulate the activities of vital organs. Hormones stimulate amultitude of life-giving processes throughout the body, which, in turn, maintainhealth, harmony, growth, healing and repair. Probably the best known hormone isinsulin, produced in the pancreas. When insulin production declines or ceases,diabetes results. Growth hormone, naturally secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain, is a smallprotein-like hormone similar to insulin. Commonly referred to as Human GrowthHormone, or HGH, it is secreted in very brief pulses during the early hours of sleepand remains in circulation for only a few minutes. It is quickly taken into the liver and converted into somatomedin-C, another small hormone (also known asinsulin-like growth factor-one, or IGF-I). Somatomedin-C is responsible for most ofthe activity of growth hormone in the body. During adolescence, when growth is most rapid, production of HGH is high. That iswhy it was named "growth hormone"-it seems to contain the secret of growth itself. Even after growth stops, growth hormone must continue to be present (at somewhatlower levels) throughout life to maintain physical and mental health and well-being. Tissue repair, healing, cell replacement, organ integrity, bone strength, brainfunction, enzyme production, and the integrity of hair, nails, and skin also requirethe ongoing availability of adequate growth hormone. Learning, memory andintelligence all depend on adequate growth hormone. As growth hormone levels declinewith age, the functions of all vital organs decrease. After age 20, growth hormone production declines progressively, at an average rate ofabout 14% per decade. By age 60, it is not uncommon to measure a growth hormone lossof 75% or more. Physical decline with age correlates directly with decreasedsecretion of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. This also suggests that if youcan prevent your body's supply of HGH from dropping to as low as 75% of its originalsupply, you can conceivably start to reverse the aging process itself. Like insulin, growth hormone is given by injection. A small syringe with a tinyneedle is used to give self-administered injections just under the skin, usually 4days each week. Benefits occur slowly during the first few months of therapy. IMPORTANT! As tissue repair, healing, and cell replacement are speeded up by growth hormonereplacement, the need for nutrients of all types increases. This means if your bodyis deficient or borderline in essential nutrients, an increase in cell growth,produced by HGH, can at the same time aggravate or create deficiencies. For that reason, it is wise to seek out a physician skilled in clinical nutrition andpreventive medicine when you start growth hormone therapy. You will need to assessand replace other deficient hormones (such as thyroid and DHEA) and free-radicalantioxidants for optimum results. CAUTION! At recommended dosages, HGH appears to be safe. Side effects reported in medicalresearch, such as overgrowth of body parts (called acromegaly) are mostly associatedwith very large doses. Doses of growth hormone given as part of research are as muchas eight times the amount normally produced by the pituitary gland. Such deliberateoverdosage has caused carpal tunnel syndrome, decreased glucose tolerance (increasedtendency to diabetes), breast enlargement (even in males), and fluid retention. However, we can confidently state that low-dose growth hormone therapy (4 to 8 unitsper week) is now known to be clinically effective and free of significant sideeffects. Side effects that do occur, such as mild fluid retention, usually passwithin a few weeks as the body readjusts to a more youthful metabolic rate. The present treatment cost of approximately $13,000 per year per patient remainsexpensive for many, and most medical insurance will reimburse only for HGH treatmentof dwarfism in children. It is helpful that the costs of HGH therapy (FDA approvedfor treating under-active pituitary glands) are tax deductible. We hope the cost willcome down in the future as generic versions of HGH become available and as usageincreases.

Dr. Cranton (the author of Bypassing Bypass: The NewTechnique of Chelation Therapy, 1994, Hampton Roads) encourages readers to sharetheir personal experiences with him to use in his forthcoming book, Reversing theAging Process. The Benefits of Growth Hormone Therapy Benefits from growth hormone replacement as reported in the scientific literatureinclude increased muscle mass, improved physical strength, reduced fatigue, decreasedfat (especially abdominal fat), increased bone strength, and revitalization of liver,kidney, spleen, and brain functions. Skin regains a more youthful appearance withfewer wrinkles and sexual function improves. Cholesterol decreases and cartilage injoints becomes stronger. Osteoporosis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease areimproved. HGH replacement also leads to increased exercise capacity, strong kidney blood flowand efficiency, improved cardiac function and reduced risk from cardiovascularproblems, and a general enhancement in one's sense of well-being. A markedly betterquality of life has also resulted for AIDs patients receiving growth hormone.Another important benefit from growth hormone replacement is that it strengthens theimmune system. The incidence of infections decreases, recovery from illness is aided,allergies improve, and immune-related diseases such as arthritis become lessbothersome. Although it has been speculated that growth hormone might speed thespread of cancer, that has not been seen in clinical practice. In fact, improvedimmunity might logically be expected to reduce the risk of malignancy and speedhealing of a treated cancer. See "Longevity Hormones," this issue, pp. 27-28. A BRIEF HISTORY OF GROWTH HORMONE Originally, growth hormone, which consists of 191 amino acids (proteinbuilding blocks), was synthesized in the early 1980s to correctdisturbances in normal growth. Children who develop a pituitary deficiencyof growth hormone at a young age will never grow normally and are destinedto become dwarfs as adults if untreated. Initially, supplies were verylimited, expensive, and sometimes contaminated-nor was there enough growthhon-none available to treat all the children who needed it. Thanks to themarketing zeal of drug companies, HGH can be overprescribed forshort-stature children as only 50% of the 15,000 American childrencurrently receiving HGH for supposedly stunted growth are deficient ingrowth hormone. IMPORTANT! But with the development of recombinant DNA technology, human growthhormone has, since the late 1980s, become more available and in pure formalthough it is expensive. Still, the increasing availability of growthhormone now provides a new dimension in health care. It was a physician named Daniel Rudman, M.D., of the Medical College ofWisconsin in Milwaukee, who first asked the crucial question. "Dohormone levels control the aging process? If they do, then does replacingthem to the youthful range in humans reverve the effects of aging?" Tofind out, Dr. Rudman conducted a groundbreaking scientific research projectin 1991 giving growth hormone injections to 21 men, between the ages of 61and 8 1. Dr. Rudman stated in an interview, "We reversed 10 to 20years of the aging process ... fat diminished, muscle tissueincreased."

[Go to the Table of Contents] The Future of Aging! SPECIAL FOCUS ON LONGEVITY Why a Single Hormone May Dictate the Future of Aging Physicians like Leonard Haimes, M.D., think Human Growth Hormone might be theFountain of Youth because it appears to reverse or prevent many of the supposedlyinevitable signs and pains of aging. The Human Growth Hormone (HGH) phenomenon is starting to catch on with physiciansnationwide. Leonard Haimes, M.D., medical director of Medicine & Lifestyle-A MedicalClinic in Boca Raton, Florida, recently devoted 6 months to a thorough review of theresearch on HGH before he came on board. Now he's a complete (and enthusiastic)believer in the effectiveness and future of the substance. "Everybody wants to be younger, including myself," says Haimes, who is 67 and haspersonally experienced the rejuvenative effects of HGH. "I've been involved inalternative medicine for 30 years and have seen a lot of new developments, but Ibelieve this one is a winner. It is extremely exciting because you are literallycreating a younger body. Ideally, everyone should take it." For more options in considering hGH therapy, contact: El Dorado, R.L.I., Inc. 7115 W.Tidwell, Suite 100, Houston, TX 77092; tel: 800-460-0001. Although supplies of hGHare somewhat limited and must be imported from Europe, there are now 23 El Doradoclinics in the U.S. providing hGH therapy. You may also contact: E. Y. Chein, M.D.,Palm Springs Life Extension Institute, 2825 Tahquitz Canyon Blvd., Building A, PalmSprings, CA 92262; tel: 619-327-8939. According to Dr. Haimes, who now supervises 21 patients on HGH therapy, recentresearch shows an expanding range of conditions for which HGH appears effective.Adults who have an underactive thyroid gland are deficient in growth hormone. Yetwhen such patients are given adequate HGH, they show gains in energy, muscle strengthand mass, mental abilities, and psychological attitude. According to recent research, HGH has beneficial effects on surgical patients,enhancing nitrogen balance and, thus, wound healing and restorative weight gain. Infact, it is effective in treating "wasting" in HIV patients (severe weight and muscleloss) enabling them to gain vital weight, according to a 2-year study of 178 AIDSpatients at 12 medical centers nationwide. HGH appears to stimulate bone growth in cases of age-related osteoporosis; it ishelpful in cases of severe burns, trauma, and infections; and it relieves menopausaldiscomfort. One of Dr. Haimes' patients, a 33-year-old man, had suffered from ChronicFatigue Syndrome for 3 years, yet after 20 days of HGH therapy (about 10 injections),he was able to return to work, his symptoms alleviated. So impressive are the short-term therapeutic effects of HGH, (foremost among whichis its ability to stabilize the immune system), that these multiple applications mayone day be even more important than its use as an antiaging product, says Dr. Haimes.While HGH therapy can cost $250 a week, there are many who regard this investment inantiaging worth the money. (See directly below) "More energy, fewer aches and pains, and looking 10 years younger," say HGH usersHere is a sampling of testimonials from patients taking HGH at the El Dorado Clinicin Houston, Texas. A woman, age 88: "After I used HGH for one month, I felt better than I had in a longtime. After I used it 2 months, the skin on my arms and legs flaked off and left myskin soft and smooth." A man, age 72, after taking HGH shots for 7 months: "The first change I noticed wasthat I had more energy. I now feel stronger even though I'm not on any exerciseprogram. Another thing is that my joints don't seem as stiff...and I'm no longerconstipated as I used to be." An attorney in his forties: "Immediately I had much more energy and stamina and Ideveloped a decidedly positive mental attitude. As a result of many changes over a6-month period, I easily look 7 to 10 years younger than my actual age." A businesswoman, age 44: "Enhancements to my life include increased energy, betterhealth, fewer aches and pains, loss of body fat, increase in muscle mass, moreoptimistic outlook." A man, age 52, after 30 months on HGH: "I sleep 5 hours a night instead of 7 and havemore energy and feel better than when I was 30 years old. I now know I can livelonger and more, healthily, and, in addition, have increased mental and physicalcapacity." HGH is not an altered product, such as a bioengineered tomato in which the geneticstructure has been changed, Dr. Haimes explains. Rather, it is grown or duplicatedfrom the "genetic blueprint" of the naturally-occurring hormone found in the humanpituitary gland; thus it is identical to the naturally-occurring hormone. "Everybody wants to be younger, including myself. Growth Hormone is extremely exciting because you are literally creating a younger body. Ideally, everyone should take it." HGH seems to be quickly fulfilling the positive prognosis given it by StanfordUniversity medical researchers in 1992, when they wrote: "It is possible thatphysiological growth hormone replacement therapy might reverse or prevent some of the'inevitable' sequelae [related consequences] of aging." On the plus side, growth hormone therapy (and human supplementation with otherage-related hormones such as DHEA, estrogen, and testosterone) can help allay some ofthe burdens and costs of illness among the elderly, of whom more than 7 million nowneed long-term medical care. On the negative side, the hotly debated safety issueregarding estrogen replacement therapy raises a similar unanswered question about thelong-term effects of HGH and other hormone therapy. For those who might hesitate atHGH replacement, studies show that vigorous physical activity releases more growthhormone in people of all ages. HGH is now made by two U.S. drug companies, Eli Lilly and Genentech, technically only for use in cases of dwarfism. Yet in 24-36 months, it is likely that thesecompanies will release HGH for "off-label" (non-dwarfism) use to U.S. physicians,speculates Dr. Haimes. And that should put this Fountain of Youth contender in thereach of many.

The pineal gland is"the biological clock that controls aging" and sets the rhythm for every aspect ofyour body. Like other hormonal substances such as DHEA and Human Growth Hormone (alsodiscussed in this Digest), body supplies of melatonin, central to most bodyfunctions, measurably decline as you age. This decline itself, says Dr. Block, may bea cause of aging. Melatonin is one of the body's most powerful antioxidants, preventing age-relatedcellular damage caused by free radicals. As you age and body production of melatonindeclines, you become more susceptible to all the illnesses associated with aging,including cancer, heart disease, and immune dysfunction. In fact, "many, if not most,of such age-related health problems are caused by declining levels of melatonin," Dr.Block claims. You can use melatonin as a natural sleeping pill; to ease PMS symptoms; to stimulatethe immune system; to prevent memory loss, hardening of the arteries, and stroke; andto treat cancer and Alzheimer's, says Dr. Block. By resetting your body clock, whichruns on melatonin, you can begin to reverse the effects of aging. How melatonin-friendly is your lifestyle? If you suffer from these symptoms, you mayhave melatonin deprivation: chronic illness, difficulty concentrating, frequent coldsand viruses, memory or mood disturbances (depression, mood swings), feeling sleepyduring the day, awake at night, strange changes in sleep and activity cycles. Here's how to get more antiaging melatonin into your life, according to Dr. Block: Take melatonin supplements. Start with a once-daily dosage of 2-3 mg, taken in theevening but before you sleep. Build to higher doses gradually, as they may producedrowsiness. Boost your antioxidants intake. Adequate levels of other antioxidants such asvitamins E, C, beta-carotene, A, and selenium enhance the activity of melatonin. Feed your immune system. A strong immune system supports melatonin's ability todisarm infections. Take extra amounts of vitamin B6, zinc, copper, tryptophan. Adjust your diet and lifestyle. Limit your calorie intake; eat regular meals;don't overeat in the evening; avoid stimulants such as chocolate, coffee, sodas,medications containing caffeine; don't smoke; take iron supplements sparingly; avoidpollutants, radiation, electromagnetic field and chemical exposures; and get moresunlight into your life. -SOURCE: Stay Young the Melatonin Way:The Natural Plan for Better Sex, BetterSleep, Longer Life, and Better Health, Steven J. Block, M.D. and Michael Boyette,Dutton, NY, 1995. DHEA:The Mother of all Hormones DHEA is a natural hormone produced in the adrenal glands. In fact, it is the mostabundant hormone found in the human bloodstream-that is, until the normal courseof aging depletes it dramatically. If you live to be 80, your body will probably have only 10-20% of the DHEA it hadwhen you were 20 years old. This can leave you vulnerable to breast, prostate, andbladder cancer, atherosclerotic plaque, nerve degeneration, and other age-relatedconditions. On the positive side, if you shore up your system's dwindling reserves of DHEA,medical research indicates that this can help prevent these conditions and improvememory, treat lupus and osteoporosis in women, even prevent diabetes, Parkinson's,and Alzheimer's. DHEA is called the "mother of all hormones" because not only does it have manyfunctions in the body pertaining to health and longevity, but it is the substancefrom which other important hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, andtestosterone, are made. The important idea here is that the evidence (4000 medicalpapers, so far) strongly suggests that DHEA hormone replacement therapy can workwonders for your health as you age. A landmark study in 1986 of 242 men, aged 50-79, based on 12 years of research,stated that a small supplementation of DHEA (100 mcg/ml) corresponded to a 48%reduction in death from heart disease and a 36% reduction in death from any cause,other than accidents. A Temple University medical researcher reports that DHEA canhelp you lose weight by blocking an enzyme known to produce fat tissue and promotecancer cell growth. In one 28 day study, DHEA supplementation enabled men to lose 31%of mean body fat with no change in body weight. Another study involving 16 middle-aged to elderly men showed that taking DHEA for 1year led to a 75% increase in their sense of overall well-being. The men said theycoped better with stress, felt more physically mobile, and slept better. Because laboratory studies in animals show that DHEA can increase life span by 50%,scientists believe DHEA replacement therapy can have a life-extending effect onhumans. Other studies suggest that DHEA enhances the activity of the immune system,enabling it to better protect the body from viruses and bacteria, including HIV andEBV (associated with chronic fatigue syndrome). -SOURCE: Smart Drugs & Nutrients, Ward Dean, M.D., John Morgenthaler, B& J Publications, Santa Cruz, CA, 1991; and information from Palm Springs LifeExtension Institute, Palm Springs, CA.

DHEA is naturally available in the Mexican Yam (also called Wild Yam or Dioscoreavillisa L.) Technically, this vegetable contains the nutritional precursors fromwhich the body produces DHEA. You can also find DHEA in a prepared supplement calledEndogen[TM], which costs about $27 for a month's supply of 90 tablets.

Dr. Needham explains his healing program of visualization, magnetic therapy, megavitamins, herbs, andthe belief he could be well again. By Patrick Needham,M.D. Though I knew something was not quite right when I consulted a specialist in July of1994, I was totally unprepared for his working diagnosis, hepatoma liver cancer. Thiswas my first major illness and at 58 years of age I was determined that with theLord's help and guidance I would triumph over this condition. I realized that if Iwas going to make good on my resolution, I would have to forge my own way through thethickets of conventional and alternative treatments. In effect, I had to play bothdoctor and patient as I designed my own cancer healing program. I did precisely that and today would like to pass on some pointers for others makingtheir own way toward a nonconventional cancer cure using many alternative approaches.What pulled me through was a combination of visualization, magnetic therapy,megavitamins, and herbs. As I left the hospital that day, I started on the first phase of my recovery.Recalling the verse in Mark 11: 24 (where it says: "whatever you ask in prayer,believe that you will receive it"), I made this the center of my program. If anythingwill test a person's faith, a diagnosis such as this will. A life-threatening illnesssuch as cancer can cause a person to dramatically alter his life style, thoughtprocesses, and personality. See Alternative Medicine, The Definitive Guide "Magnetic Field Therapy," pp. 330-338; "Cancer," pp. 556-586;"Herbal Medicine," pp. 253-271; "Meditation," pp. 339-345. As part of this first phase of healing, I would retire to my bedroom each day aftercoming home from the hospital where I work as an anesthesiologist. I would lie downand become as comfortable as possible and then focus my mind on just two things.First, I visualized that my body was consuming the cancer cells. I would alternatethis with a mental picture of Jesus Christ standing close to me amidst a blue lightthat seemed to surround him. I felt that if I could stand in that blue light I wouldbe healed. I would lie there for long periods of time, constantly focusing on these two images.For the first month, this was my only therapy since my regular visits to thephysician consisted only in his monitoring my blood profile and performing othertests. No treatment of any kind was given to me. Meanwhile, my physician believed I had a hepatoma, even though a biopsy had not beenperformed. The initial lab results showed elevations of my liver enzymes and anincreased alpha fetal protein; in my case, this was 87.7 while normal is 1-3. Eachand every day, whether at work, at the hospital, driving, or during whatever else Imight be doing, I would concentrate on that number coming down when the next test wasrun. The number I focused on was 67, 67, 67. Day after day, I focused on the testresult being 67. This began phase one of my healing process. QUICK DEFINITION: Alpha fetal protein is made in tiny amounts by the liver of the fetus, yet its levelcan rise as liver tumors develop; hence doctors routinely test for higher levels ofthis protein in suspected liver cancers. High levels can also indicate cirrhosis orhepatitis. When I returned for another blood evaluation in 3 weeks, my alpha fetal protein wasnow 61-that is, 8 points lower than I had visualized. This was the turning point, forI was firmly convinced that I had been heard and that my faith in Mark 11:24 wasbeing answered. The Lord had just "spoken" to me. We were going to triumph. I believe that what occurs in our lives is by design and not by chance orcoincidence. I knew that there were alternative methods for treating cancer, but Idid not know where to find them. While walking through the book section in a storeone day, I saw a book called Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide. To this day, I believe that this was not a chance encounter, but that I was guided in my search for alternative healing methods to find this book. That night I sat down and devoured The Definitive Guide's chapters on cancer, herbs,and magnetic field therapy. The book guided me one step at a time through thetreatments that might work for me. If anythingwill test a person's faith, a diagnosis such as cancer will. Yet one day in a bookstore I found Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide. This book guided me one step at a time through thetreatments that might work for me. In the chapter on magnetic healing, I read how William Philpott, M.D., had eliminatedhis own heart pain with magnets and had gone on to help 3000 patients with magneticfield therapy. I purchased Dr. Philpott's Bio-Magnetic Handbook and read itcover-to-cover the same day. This started phase two of my healing process. I purchased several 3950-gauss ceramic magnets and started sleeping on them at night.I placed one on each side of my back at the level of the kidneys, with the magnets'negative pole facing the body. I placed one magnet over my liver and one over myspleen. Each night I repeated this, keeping the magnets in place for 6-7 hours. As Iused the magnets, I began to notice positive changes. My abdomen became less distended and the swelling in my ankles and feet wasremarkably improved. My energy level, which had been almost nil, started increasing.As my abdominal distention receded, I was able to eat and not feel bloated. See Alternative Medicine, The Definitive Guide "Magnetic Field Practitioners, Products," pp. 158-159; "Herbal Medicine," pp. 144-147. I started taking vitamin C at 6-10 grams daily along with 50,000 units of vitamin Aas well as various herbs and amino acids in large quantities. While using themagnetic field therapy, vitamins, and herbs, I kept a daily log of what I was doingregarding dosages and magnetic exposure time. I continued with my appointments withthe specialists and they continued to monitor my blood volumes. I had moresophisticated tests done in order to pinpoint the liver tumor. These tests, whichincluded a CAT scan, Ultrasound, and arteriogram, all came back negative, which is tosay, no cancer was indicated by them. Meanwhile my blood profile improved. Then I began phase three of my recovery. Up to this point, I had not told anyoneoutside my family of my condition or the diagnosis. I recalled a passage in James 5,14: 15 that stated if any are sick among you, have the elder of the church lay onhands, anoint with oil, and pray for them. I spoke to Buddy McKinnon, the pastor ofour independent Sabbaterian Church, and asked him if he and the elders would anointand pray for my healing. They did this after the services on a Sabbath morning. Aslong as I live, I'll remember these individuals-Pastor McKinnon, Jack Matthews, andJames Acosta-as they prayed for my healing. It was a humbling experience. I felt nothing at that time, but about 2 hours later while at home, I had a suddensense of total well-being and complete peace of mind. It is hard to put into wordsthe intensity of this feeling of serenity. I believe most firmly that the Lord wasreassuring me that we would triumph over the cancer. It seemed that every time I turned around, another door was opening for me. This timeI started reading up on herbs in Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide. I'm onmany different herbs now, taking about 100 capsules a day. Among this long list, I'musing: milk thistle, kyolic garlic, dandelion root, gingko biloba, pau d'arco, pancreatic enzymes, echinacea, goldenseal root, vitamin E, pycnogenols, coenzyme Q10,flaxseed oil, L-carnitine, ginseng, chromium picolinate, saw palmetto, beta carotene,magnesium, ester-C complex, aloe vera juice, glutathione, glutanine, L-cysteine,phenylalinine, desiccated liver, and alfalfa tablets. I've changed my diet considerably, too. I don't touch red meats any more and I eatfish and chicken only occasionally. I eat lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, andgarlic. I figured out the appropriateness of these supplements and dietary changes onmy own from books but without consultation with anybody. I'll probably continue withthese supplements and dietary measures for the rest of my life, but I'll probablytaper down on the dosages. This illness has been both a physical and spiritual experience for me. I thought Iknew how to pray but when I was given the diagnosis of hepatoma, I realized I reallydid not. Today I continue to improve, and the CAT scan, ultrasound, and arteriogramremain negative. My blood profile continues to improve. I find myself more tolerantand compassionate to others and their problems. The role that our emotions have in our health cannot be ignored. I believe that apositive, optimistic attitude will strengthen the immune system while negativefeelings-anger, animosity towards others, jealousy, and envy-all decrease the immunesystem's ability to respond to a disease process. I hope that this brief summary will help someone else with cancer who may have lostall hope and given up. Explore the alternatives, ask the Lord's help, and take chargeof your healing.

So are many of the physicians I work with who are about my age, not tomention many millions of men and women now in their "senior" years. Just because youreach your late 60s or 70s and become a "senior citizen," why should this mean youhave to start living in a body that doesn't work well anymore? That's not my vision of "old age" nor does it have to be yours. Alternativemedicinecan show you how to live a long life. In this issue our special focus on longevitywill fill you in on someeu in on someome of the long-life secrets we've found. One of these secrets is Dr. Hazel Parcells, who graces the cover of thisDigest. At105 years old, Dr. Parcells is the best living proof that if you follow the advice ofalternative medi advice of alternative mediedicine, you stand a very good chance ofextending your life and improving the way each minute of it feels. Dr. Parcells saysthat one key to living better is to rid your body and foods of all toxins andpollutants. Keep the vital energy of foods intactintact so this energy can keep yourbody vital and healthy. Read our cover story, and find out her practical longevitysecrets, and start put them to work in your own life. You'll find another side of the longevity story in our articles on hormones.Modernscience is showing that one of the main physiological events of aging is a markeddecline in many important hormones. Teenagers overflow with hormones, yet in the decades after about age 40, thebody'ssupply of key hormones such as melatonin, DHEA, estrogen, testtA, estrogen, testinthe decades after about age 40, your body's supply of key hormones such as melatonin,DHEA, estrogen, testosterone, and human growth hormone, starts to drop. When it does,body functions start to decline and aging begins. While it seems we can't stop this natural, preprogrammed decline in body hormones,perhaps we can shore up our dwindling supplies later in life. This is the ideabehind hormone replacement therapy. The New York Times recently underscoredthis newdevelopment in a major health story: "Restoring ebbing hormones may slow aging [as]researchers hope supplements may have rejuvenating effects." Find out what hormonereplacement therapy is all about in the incisive article by Elmer Cranton, M.D., andJames Frackelton, M.D., experts in the field. Here is one way to know you're getting low in essential hormones. Are you only 50butfeel as if you're 70? In case things aren't that vivid, there is a simple salivatest you can take to see where your hormone levels are. You spit some saliva into atube and send it back to a lab; they tell you how you're doing with progesterone,testosterone, an and estrogen. If you're a physician, you can assess levels of 7hormones. As Aeron Lifecycles president John M. Kells notes, "This is a convenient,noninvasive, and private way to assess the effectiveness in health choices relativeto hormonal balance. An iindividual can therefore monitor hormonal change atdifferent times of the month or as an assessment associated with age." Here's another long-life self-help tip for you. Let's say your test results comebackshowing a deficit in several hormones. College Pharmacy in Colorado Springs willformulate a hormone supplement designed to meet your exact needs, or supply you withnatural formulations of hormones such as progesterone and DHEA. Under the dire thediremacist Tom Bader, R.ph, they've been doing this foction of pharmacist Tom Bader,R.ph., they've been doing this for a nationwide clientele since 1985. What isdifferent about their approach, however, is that the hormones are delivered throughthe skin with a gel,not by injections, patches, or orally. "Our idea is to get a natural substance intothe bloodstream at a physiologically compatible rate," says Bader. "You apply the gelonce a day to your skin, then with every passing minute, it slowly drips into yourbloodstream from the skin reservoir, helping to balance out your system." These are just two examples of how alternative medicine is coming up withpractical,nontoxic, and affordable answers to the perennial question of aging. If youwanttotake steps to insure that you will live longer, look to alternative medicine. Meanwhile, everything we've been saying for years-that environmental pollutantsproduce degenerative disease-is being dreadfully proven in Russia. There, accordingto a new report published August 1, 1995, the average male life expectancy hasplummeted from 64 to 57 in only four years while infant mortality has soared by 15%in just 2 years. Cases of birth defects are increasing faster than any other healthproblem and 50% of allchildren suffer from chronic illness. Epidemic rates of cancer and heart diseaseaccount for most of the premature deaths of men. Russian scientists are now looking to their country's chronic ecological abuse foranswers. They're finding that decades of unregulated chemical, industrial,agricultural, and nuclear pollution are killing their population. Let's keep thisfrom being our future, too. If we want longevity we must clean up our environment. Don't forget that medicine has a political dimension. We all have to work hard toinsure that we have the rightright to choose what kind of therapy we want.Political initiatives afoot this year are of paramount importance to the future ofalternative medicine in America. Read the up-to-the-minute reports in our department,The Politics of Medicine. Remember, not only do we want a long and healthylife, butwe want a long life for the practice of alternative medicine in this country wherereal freedom of ma long life, but we want a long life for the practice of alternativemedicine in this country where real freedom of medical choice is not a given, notyet. With your help we can change that. Alternative Medicine is coming up with practical,nontoxic, and affordable answers to the perennial question of aging. If youwant to take steps to insure that you will live longer, look to alternative medicine, but don't forget that medicine has a political dimension.

Answer: The most common causes of death and hospitalizations in the U.S. are coronaryocclusions and congestive heart failure. The latter is also called cardiomyopathy,which means failure of the heart muscle. Coronary occlusion (blocking of the heartarteries) is a process in which arteries that course over the surface of andpenetrate into the heart muscle become narrowed so that blood flow through thembecomes restricted. The heart muscle stops receiving adequate amounts of oxygen andnutrients and a person develops angina, which is generally experienced as chest painor pressure. This means the heart muscle's pumping capacity has been exceeded.Coronary occlusion is commonly caused by arteriosclerosis, which is a buildup ofplaque and clogging in the arteries, that can lead to heart attacks. There is also "silent angina," which means a person may have shortness of breath,numbness in the arm, dizzyness, or other vague symptoms that appear when theyoverexert or become emotionally stressed. About one-half of all people with coronaryclogging develop this silent angina form of coronary occlusion. Unfortunately, oftenthe first time they know they have heart disease is when they have a sudden heartattack. That's why coronary disease is such a common killer, because half the peopledie before they ever reach the hospital. With congestive heart failure, the heart becomes literally congested with blood anddangerously weakened, The most common cause of this is coronary occlusion and heartattacks. After you "kill" a large section of your heart muscle by repeated heartattacks, there is not enough heart muscle left to pump blood out of the heart. Thepressure and volume of blood inside the heart's pumping chamber build up, puttingadditional pressure on arteries and veins in the lungs; fluid leaks into the lungs,and the congestive heart failure process begins. A person knows he has this problemwhen he has shortness of breath either with minimal exertion or when lying down atnight. Question: What can alternative medicine recommend to prevent these problems or to improve myheart condition? Answer: All the causes of heart failure are reversible, to some degree, using amultifactorial process. There are many people whose heart problems get steadily worseuntil the only thing conventional medicine can offer is a heart transplant. Yet I'vehad several patients in my practice who were told this and yet never had atransplant. Instead, they used natural techniques to improve their heart musclefunction to the point at which they became active people again. Here's what you needto do. Your diet needs to move away from standard American fare toward one more plentiful inuncooked vegetables, fruits, raw grains, seeds and nuts, but no peanuts. Reduce yourintake of dairy products, most animal meats, and refined white flour and sugar.Increase your intake of fish oil, which is high in an omega-3 fatty acid called EPA(eicosapentanoic acid). EPA prevents the formation of a clot-forming substanceinvolved in heart disease. Completely avoid all fried foods and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils becausetheir trans-fatty acids increase atherosclerosis, probably even more so than butter.Another nutrient important for reversing heart disease is magnesium, to prevent thecoronary arteries going into spasm. Magnesium deficiency is common in the U.S.because it's lost from the kidneys whenever a person is under stress. (You don't knowany stressed people in America, do you?) Selenium deficiency is another common cause for atherosclerotic disease. For hearthealth, you need about 200 mcg of elemental selenium a day. Other heart-healingnutrients include vitamins E, C, beta carotene, bioflavonoids, B6 and B3, andsulfur-containing amino acids such as L-taurine, N-acetyl-cysteine, or glutathione. Other substances helpful in reversing plaque formation in the arteries are the aminoacids L-lysine and L-proline. One of the antioxidants I used recently with excellentsuccess in assisting the reversal of atherosclerosis is pycnogenol from grape seedsor maritime pine bark. Another useful nutrient is the amino acid L-carnitine thathelps to transport other amino acids and fatty acids into the cells. It's common tofind people, who have congestive heart failure, to be deficient in L-carnitine. It'simportant to remember that all these nutrients work in concert with one another. See "Super-Antioxidant from Grape Seeds-The 'Youth Nutrient'," Digest, No. 7, pp. 24-25. Question: What about cholesterol and heart disease? Answer:Most conventional medical doctors don't seem to understand some important pointsabout cholesterol. They see all cholesterol as bad, but this is incorrect. The only cholesterol that's "bad" is oxidized lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This is cholesterol that has been oxidized by oxygen or other free radical generators inside or outside the body. This oxidized cholesterol is the kind that's responsible for the formation of cellsthat lead to plaque formation on the artery walls. Cholesterol that your bodynaturally makes does not do that. You find oxidized cholesterol in homogenized orpowdered milk, in powdered eggs, and in processed foods, for example. Oxidizedcholesterol accumulates in the white blood cells that form plaque in arteries. The other way you get high levels of oxidized cholesterol is when you're deficient inantioxidant nutrients and under a lot of physical, emotional, or electromagneticstress. Then the healthy cholesterol your body makes every day is converted intounhealthy, oxidized cholesterol. You need cholesterol because your body uses it to make bile salts which help absorbthe fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), EPA, or other essential fatty substances fromyour small intestine. Cholesterol is also converted into steroidal hormones, whichare critical for the health of the immune system, the mineral-regulating functions ofthe kidneys, and for making male and female sex hormones. See Eradicating Heart Disease, Matthias Rath, M.D. (To order, see Future Medicine ad,inside back cover.) See "The Cholesterol Myth: Eating to Your Heart's Delight,"Digest, No. 2, pp. 2-10. > Now, the brainwashing that conventional medicine puts out that high cholesterol isalways unhealthy is not true. I have a man in my practice who had a cholesterol countbetween 300-400 for many years, but because he's taking high levels of antioxidantnutrients and avoiding processed foods high in oxidized cholesterol, he's had noplaque formation and has even had plaque regression. Studies suggest that some of the common cholesterol-lowering drugs actually lower thelevels of the antioxidant coenzyme Q10 in the body. If these drugs produce a CoQ10deficiency, this accelerates congestive heart failure. Studies show that most peoplewith congestive heart failure have a deficiency of CoQ10 in their heart muscle; thelower the levels, the worse the congestive heart failure. But studies also show that patients who were supposed to die 15 years ago fromcongestive heart failure are still alive, primarily because of taking coenzyme Q10daily. This is perhaps why almost all of Japan uses coenzyme Q10 to replace cardiacdrugs. See "Coenzyme Q10-Life Insurance for Your Heart," Digest, No. 7, pp. 22-23. Question: Do you recommend chelation therapy as part of a heart-health maintenance program? Answer:What I've been talking about here is a kind of oral, nonchemical chelation. There aremany studies that strongly suggest that intravenous EDTA chelation is effective. Ihave seen patients that have gone through EDTA chelation who have had plaque reversalwithout receiving any other treatment. Yes, chelation is a helpful and effectivetherapy if you receive it from a physician certified in its use. See "Ask the Healer," Digest, No. 6, pp. 27-28. As someone goes through EDTA chelation, it's important that they have adequateamounts of mineral replacement in between each treatment. Another common mistake isto get EDTA daily; this is inappropriate. At most, you should get only 3 treatments per week. See "Bacterial Trouble Inside the 3 Miles of Canals in Your Tooth," Digest, No. 7, p. 36. See "Poisons From Your Mouth," Digest, No. 5, pp. 2-5. See "The More Natural Teeth You Are Missing, the Quicker You Will Age." this issue, pp. 47-48 . Finally, there is also a mouth factor. A large percentage of people who have heart disease have some type of abnormal process (such as a rootcanal tooth or previous tooth extraction site) in the mouth. Most commonly this is aninfection of the jawbone, usually located at the third molar, or wisdom tooth site,in any of the four jaw locations. Typically, the teeth on the left side of the mouth affect the left side of the heart;those on the right side affect the right side of the heart. If doctors wouldrecognize and treat this, and work with biological dentists, many people who haveheart attacks, arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure, could see improvement intheir condition.

Wellness: Why You Need Detoxification and Nutritional Support Illness has many layers, which means you need a multiple therapy approach to healing, as this progressive North Carolina clinic demonstrates. The ideal clinic addresses the whole person, not just one organ or illness at a time. At the Health Regeneration Institute, we look at a person's emotional, physical, electromagnetic, biochemical, and spiritual being, and we do this cohesively, using a team of diverse practitioners. Our group of M.D.s, N.D.s., and qualified health care practitioners has come together because we each have a piece of the puzzle. We use nutritional support and detoxification therapies for almost all health conditions. If you handle these first, then the additional therapies you introduce become immensely more effective. We handle patients with chronic, degenerative illnesses, including most cancers.Here is a quick review of our clinic's multiple therapy approach to getting well. 1 NURTURE YOURSELF Our guest facilities are set in two interconnected lodges with rustic decoroverlooking our bio-dynamic gardens and a spring-fed, solar-heated swimming pool. Thefacilities are surrounded by woods and forests with pure water and fresh air. 2 RESOLVE THE EMOTIONS A person whose beliefs, thoughts, and emotions are chaotic, scattered, orconfused has a difficult time healing. We believe that the physical problem issometimes the end-stage manifestation of a process that might have started out froman unresolved strong emotion. If one has unresolved emotions, he will have tremendousdifficulty in healing. Our staff members help the clients see the issues they need toaddress and, when appropriate, "hold their hands" as they go through this sometimesuncomfortable but necessary step. 3 CLEANSE THE BOWELS Most people with chronic illness have a major problem with toxicity, usuallyfrom the bowels. Many are also chronically constipated. To cleanse their bowels, ourclients take fiber, herbs, enzymes, and nutrients, plus do colonic irrigation. Manyof the toxicities lodged in the liver, gallbladder, and kidneys are cleared onlythrough the bowel cleansing. 4 FLUSH THE ORGANS Next, we flush toxins out of the liver and gallbladder using herbs,nutrients, acupressure, acupuncture, shiatsu, Swedish massage, and by stimulating thelymph system. People who deal with their unresolved anger, for example, often have aspontaneous detoxification of their liver and gallbladder. 5 DETOXIFY THE TISSUES Then we cleanse the body tissues using steam cabinets, Turkish baths, herbsthat cause sweating, ozonated baths to help the toxins come out through the skin, andhomeopathic remedies and herbs to speed up the metabolism and help the detoxificationprocess. 6 FEED THE BODY Once the bowel and organs are detoxified, you need to start giving thebody the right nutrients and to stop putting more toxicity into the tissues, liver,and gallbladder from poor food choices. We educate the patients regarding waterpurity, how to avoid air pollutants, how to find foods low in or free of toxins sothat when they go back home they can continue the detoxification process. 7 MASSAGE THE LYMPH Many people develop clogged lymphatic vessels so the toxins cannot getout of the tissues and they become toxic. Lymphatic therapy helps open up thesechannels and move toxins out of the body. Our lymphatic therapy was developed bystaff member Marika von Viczay, Ph.D., N.D., and uses electromagnetic and soft laserprinciples applied to the lymph glands throughout the body. We follow with a gentlebody massage, that includes the lymph centers. We encourage people to work theirlymphatic systems, by dry skin brushing and bouncing regularly on atrampoline-rebounder. These self-help exercises move toxins out of the body throughthe lymph. 8 END THE INFECTION Care of the teeth is crucial. Most chronically ill people havetoxin-producing infections in their jawbone from root canal teeth or from previoustooth extractions. Also, because individual teeth are energetically associatedthrough acupuncture meridians with internal organs, these organs can become weakenedand diseased over time if there is an untreated tooth or jaw infection. Therefore, itis important to clean up pockets of dental infection and "dead" teeth. 9 FIX THE BITE Many people have developed an uneven bite, or malocclusion, in their teethfrom previous dental work. The biting surfaces stop matching up perfectly. This inturn causes muscles on one side of the jaw to bring stress to the cranium, neck, andback, creating a cranial-sacral misalignment that can further affect the function ofmany internal organs. It is essential to have a dental evaluation early on in thisprocess, because otherwise your healing may be dramatically hindered by youroff-bite. 10 REMOVE THE MERCURY The mercury in your dental fillings can be a major source of toxicity.The Swedish government has made it illegal to put silver mercury fillings in themouth and the U.S. government has made dentists handle mercury amalgams like nuclearradioactive material. Yet the American Dental Association says it's perfectly safe toput this same material in your teeth. No, it isn't. Studies have shown that silver mercury amalgams can leech heavy metals intoyour system and increase the risk of a variety of illnesses, including immunesuppression. This means that most people who have these fillings are probably doing them-selves some damage and they shouldseriously consider having them replaced with nonmetallic materials. 11 SHUT OFF THE ELECTRICITY Unhealthy electromagnetic effects can be generated from dental fillings when you have two different types of metals (mercury and silver) in your mouth. Theresult is like a nickel cadmium battery: electrons flow between the metals, in thiscase through the saliva. This electron flow creates a magnetic field, whichinfluences the release of certain hormones and neurotransmitters, thereby alteringthe person's bodily functions. Thus a metal in your mouth can become an allergen, have an electromagneticbattery effect, and produce chemical toxins. Occasionally, if people have enoughmetal in their mouths, it can act as an antenna, and pick up and amplify the "sea" ofelectromagnetic pollution we live in. 12 CHELATE THE TOXINS Once a person has enough of these heavy metals removed from his mouth, weencourage him to go through a chelation process. In chelation, substances areintroduced into the bloodstream intravenously to bind up (chelate) and remove toxins,heavy metals, and waste products from the internal organs. This can be done intravenously using DMPS, or orally, by consuming chlorella,spirulina, garlic, vitamin C, or L-acetyl-cysteine; and it can be done intravenouslyusing DMPS. We also use the standard chelating agent, called EDTA, to bind up theother heavy metals, but usually after DMPS, because mercury can move from thebloodstream into the brain if EDTA is used first. QUICK DEFINITION: DMPS (chemicalname: di-mercapto-propane sulfonate; trade name: Dimaval) is a synthetic molecule used to bind up, or chelate, then remove heavy metals from the body. It is regarded as the top chelator for mercury, but it alsobinds up lead, copper, arsenic, cobalt, chromium, cadmium, and silver. DMPS, which can be injected or taken orally, is used widely in othercountries but can have unpleasant side effects. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide, "Chelation Therapy," pp. 126-133. 13 HELP YOURSELF All of these approaches work most effectively if done in conjunction withmajor changes in a person's diet, lifestyle, and nutrient supplement program. One ofour prime goals is for people to come to our clinic, learn the techniques, and takethem back home to use and to show others. We want to educate each person in how tobecome his own best health care giver. That means giving him all the self-helpoptions and resources available. 14 BUILD YOUR HEALTH We are not interested in treating diseases; we build health. We don't treatcancer as such; we treat the entire person who has toxicity, nutritionaldeficiencies, or ill health. If the cancer happens to improve while they're here,it's not because of what we've done but what the patient has done for himself. We arecontinually inspired by what Thomas Edison wrote about medicine: "The doctor of thefuture will give no medicine, but will interest his patients in the care of the humanframe, in diet, and in the cause and prevention of disease."

Ravins, D.D.S. The More Natural Teeth You Are Missing, the Quicker You Will Age If you want to live a long, healthy life, then you should try your best to keep asmany of your natural teeth as you can. In the more than 30 years I have been indental practice, I have noticed that the healthiest people are those who have themost natural teeth. Conversely, those people who have the fewest of their originalteeth usually have been those people with the most health problems. I know for a factthat missing your natural teeth is one of the greatest causes of premature aging. Hippocrates, the "father" of Western medicine, once said:"The greater the number of teeth, the longer one's life." He may not have been adentist, but he underscored a principle important to my way of doing dentistry. That's because life flows from the teeth. When any of your 32 original teeth is lost,a small bit of your life is also lost. If there is a "master plan" for the humanbody, surely it includes a life lived with all 32 teeth intact, and not for people tobe wearing full dentures at age 40. My golden rule of dentistry is this: Save a toothat all costs. If more people believed in this rule they would feel a hundred timesbetter than they do right now. Let's take wrinkles. I contend that poor dental structure, which means worn-down,crooked, or missing teeth, or a poor dental bite, can often result in facial linesand wrinkles. The teeth help support your facial structure, especially around thelips. When your teeth are missing or excessively worn down, you will lack whatdentists call sufficient "vertical dimension" to support the facial skin. This meansyour face may develop lines and wrinkles and that "caved-in" look so prevalent inthe elderly. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide, "Bacterial Trouble Inside the 3 Miles of Canals in Your Tooth," Digest No. 7, p. 36. Then there is the matter of dental stress. This can cause rapid aging. The stresscaused to the entire body from missing teeth is often the most severe kind of stressyour body can experience. When your natural teeth are missing, your face mayexperience less than adequate blood circulation. This is why you see so many peoplewith excessive dental problems sporting a pale and pasty look to their facial skin.My advice here is simple: The more natural teeth you have and the more missing teethyou have replaced (so there are no gaps), the better your skin and facial structurewill look-and the better you will feel. In fact, anyone with missing teeth usually should have them replaced if he isconcerned about staying young and healthy. It is far better to have teeth in yourmouth, even if they're false teeth, than to go around with a mouth full of holes.This is surely the road to rapid aging. If you need to replace a tooth that has beenout of your mouth for many years, be sure your dentist first "pretreats" your mouthby repositioning any teeth that may have moved from their original position after aspecific tooth has been pulled. Better think twice before having any teeth extracted. I rarely pull teeth and I amproud of it. I believe in saving the tooth at all costs, even if it's inconvenient.For example, if a person had a tooth pulled instead of trying to save it with a fullcrown, she would lose not only the tooth but the tooth's root. This is importantbecause when a root is extracted from the jaw, the jaw will become that much smallerand narrower as it fills in the area left open from the extracted root. One of thegolden rules to living a long life is to have as wide a jaw as possible. Dentallyspeaking, the big mouths live the longest! Even the crooked or crowded teeth of children should and can be saved fromextraction. Many teeth can be saved in the mouths of children that do not have enoughroom for all their teeth. In my practice I use a "Crozat removable appliance" thatputs mild pressure on the jaw bone to widen it and thereby make room for all theteeth. The Crozat appliance works with adults, too. I treated a patient who had been advisedto have gum surgery and teeth extractions. Instead, I had her wear the Crozatappliance for 2 years, after which there was no need for any teeth to come out or anysurgery. The beauty of this device is that it cannot be seen from outside the mouthwhich is why it's often called the "invisible braces." Your teeth are like the keys on a typewriter operating 24 hours a day as theterminal endings of sensory nerve pathways. When you extract a tooth, you leave apathway with no terminal ending, and this alters nerve reflexes, for the worse. Onthe other hand, when you restore the tooth's enamel surface with a filling or crownyou also alter the way this tooth works as a sensory receptor for the body. Thismeans any change you make to a tooth must be physiologically compatible with thepatient's nervous system. Your teeth are "connected" to the rest of your body, as these examples show. Apatient had chronic back pain for 17 years, cause unknown. Within 5 minutes of givingthis patient's lower jaw bone proper dental support, the pain disappeared. Anotherpatient had stiff or locked knee for 6 years; after his dentures were put intophysiological balance with his body, the stiffness released. Want to stay mentally sharp as you age and not lose any neuronal strength to theyears? Keep your 32 original teeth intact because the fewer natural teeth you have,the less mental acuity you will usually have. There is a very strong possibility thatthe reason many people seem to lose their sense of mental quickness as they age isbecause they have missing teeth. The brain was designed for 32 teeth in the jaw.Since the teeth support the face via the facial muscles and bone, the fewer teeth inthe mouth, the less support. The teeth are connected to the brain and, as a consequence, the teeth are constantlystimulating the brain. This is something false teeth cannot do. The fewer teeth, theless stimulation to the central nervous system; and the less neural stimulation, themore aging. This concept is not observed in today's dentistry yet it is why I contendthe relationship between teeth and the brain is one of the most important areas inall of dentistry. So keep your teeth and live long. Harold E.

Cichoke, D.C. IMPORTANT! An organ flush like this is a good idea for general health maintenance and is highlyrecommended for people suffering from chronic degenerative diseases, such asgallstones, backaches, and nausea, says Dr. Cichoke. This flush is for adults only,not for children. For the first 6 days, drink as much apple cider, juice, or vinegar (made fromorganically grown apples) as your appetite can handle. Take a megavitamin supplementthat has more than the RDAs for vitamins and minerals. Have a normal lunch at noon on day 7, then 3, hours later,take 2 teaspoons of disodium phosphate (available over-the-counter as Fleet'sPhospho-Soda; follow package directions). Follow this immediately with a small amount(2-4 ounces) of freshly squeezed citrus juice. If you're on a sodium-free diet, useEpsom salts or castoria instead of disodium phosphate. Take a second dose of disodiumphosphate 3 hours later, followed by citrus juice. For dinner, have only grapefruitjuice (or other citrus juices, if you prefer). Step One: When you're ready for sleep: take 1/2 cup of warm, unrefined olive oil mixed with cup of freshly squeezed lemonjuice. or, take 1/2 cup of unrefined olive oil, then follow with 2-4 ounces of grapefruitjuice. Dr. Cichoke says you may experience slight nausea from this but it will pass. Inbed, lie on your right side and pull your right knee up close to your chest. Holdthis position, without straining, for 30 minutes. Step Two: The next morning, on day 8, about 1 hour before you eat breakfast: take 2 teaspoons of disodium phosphate mixed in 2 ounces of hot water. After breakfast, return to your normal diet. You may begin noticing small gallstones or oddly-shaped gelatinous substances in yourfeces. If so, repeat all the steps again (described above in the liver andgallbladder flush) in 2 weeks' time Dr. Cichoke advises that you have on hand homeopathic Magnesium Phosphate (instrengths of 6x or 12x) in case you experience sharp pain as your liver and gallbladder detoxify. Take 3 pills every 3 hours until the pain g 3 hours until thepain goes away; then take no more pills. While pain during the gall bladderflush is rare, it's prudent to be prepared. -SOURCE: Enzymes & Enzyme Therapy. How to Jump Start Your Way to Lifelong GoodHealth, Anthony J.

Lower Your High Blood Pressure Naturally Here are easy alternatives to blood-pressure-lowering drugs for treating mildto moderate hypertension (high blood pressure), according to naturo-path Michael T.Murray, N.D.If you have mild hypertension (140-160/90-104): Reduce your weight. Eliminate your salt intake and avoid alcohol, caffeine, and smoking. Exercise more and practice stress-reduction techniques (such as biofeedback,self-hypnosis, yoga, meditation, muscle relaxation). Change your diet to include more potassium-rich foods (such as pppps ps ps potato,avocado, cooked lima beans, bananas, flounder), fiber, and complex carbohydrates. Eat more celery, garlic, onions, and vegetable oils (high in omega-3 fatty acids),but eat less animal fats. Take supplements including calcium (1000-1500 mg/day), magnesium (500mg/day), vitamin C (1-3 g/day), zinc (in picolinate form, 15-30 mg/day), and flaxseedoil (1 tablespoon/day). Maintain this program for at least 3 months, and preferably for 6; see a doctor ifyour blood pressure isn't normal after this 3-6 month program.If you have moderate hypertension, (140-180/105-114): Do all of the above. Take hawthorn herbal extract (100-250 mg, 3 times daily, provided the extractcontains 10% procyanidins). Take coenzyme Q-10 (20 mg, 3 times daily). Follow this program for 3 months; if there is no change in your blood pressure,see a physician. -SOURCE: Natural Alternatives to Over-the-Counter and Prescription Drugs, Michael T.Murray, N.D., William Morrow and Commompany, New York, 1994.

Enlarged Prostate-How to Use Natural Remedies for Relief For men under 45, difficulties with urination are often due to prostatitis, which isan infection of the prostate gland. Men over 45 with urinary problems tend to have acondition called "benign prostatic hyperplasia," which means too many cells havegrown inside the prostate gland, thereby swelling it. In either case, herbalism has apractical remedy, acd, thereby swelling it. In either case, herbalism has a practialremedy, according to Varro E. Tyler, Ph.D., Sc.D., and James F. Balch, M.D., ininformation drawn from two separate books. SAW PALMETTO. This herb consists of the dried ripe fruit of a small scrubby palmtree. Saw palmetto increases urinary flow, reduces urine ne retention, and generallyeases symptoms of prostate enlargement by reducing inflammation. Recommended dosage:1-2 g daily of dried herb or 320 mg of saw palmetto liquid extract (prepared with 90%alcohol). NETTLE ROOT. The root of stinging nettle is aas also effective for prostate problems. Recommended dosage: 4-5 teaspoons (4-6 g daily), preferably in the form of a tea, asthe active ingredients are water-soluble. NETTLE LEAVES. You can also use nettle leaves to increase urine flow. Recommendeddosagege: 3-4 teaspoons of dry herb boiled in 5 ounces of water. Drink nettle leavesas a tea, 3-4 times daily until symptoms improve. NUTRIENTS. Take these nutrients daily: Zinc (80 mg); bee pollen (6 tablets or 2teaspoons); essential fatty acids (2 cap(2 cappapsules, 3 times); Kyolic garliccapsules (2 capsules, 3 times); raw glandular prostate tablets (per labeldirections); vitamin A (25,000 I.U., of which at least 15,000 I.U are beta-carotene);vitamin E (600 I.U.). Also helpful: brewer's yeast or pumpkin seeeds; kelp (6 tabletsdaily); lecithin (before meals); magnesium with calcium (per label directions);vitamin B6 (50 mg, 2 times daily); vitamin C (1-5 g daily). -SOURCE: Herbs of Choice: The Therapeutic Use of Phytomedicinals.

A Nutritional & Herbal Answer to Fatigue A Nutritional & Herbal Answer to Fatiritional & Herbal Answer to FatigueIf you find yourself unaccountably tired too much of the time, take another look atyour diet, says Melvyn Werbach, M.D. High carbohydrate meals and a high use ofcaffeine and sugar may be draining your energy at the source. Coffee in smallamounttunts may temporarily energize you, but if you're consuming it in the range of25.35 oz a day or more, you may get more fatigue than energy for your cups. If you are deficient in certain B-vitamins, such as folic acid, pantothenic acid, orB12, this this is may account for your low energy. Consider supplementing your dietwith 10 mg daily of folic acid, 250 mg daily of pantothenic acid, and 1000 mcg of B12once weekly for a month, and see if you don't feel perkier. While you're at it, ifyou're low in vitamin C, iron, magnesium, potassium, or zinc, you're likely to be alittle too fatigued for comfort. And don't overlook the possibility that you are sensitive, if not allergic, tocertain foods in your diet, which can produce "allergic-tension fatiguesynnsyndrome." Typical culprits here can include dairy products, chocolate, and colabeverages. On the positive side of fatigue, here is a quick and easy herbal step youcan take to shore up your energy. Take Panax ginseng or Siberian ginseng as an herbaltincture at the rate of 100 mg twice daily for a few days. Ginseng, one of theoldest general tonics from Traditional Chinese medicine, sharpens mental abilities,concentration, alertness, and improves stamina, and delays the onset of fatigue afterphysical exercise. -SOURCES: Botanical Influences on Illness: A Sourcebook of Clinical Research, MelvynR.

Write Your Own Prescription for Common Problems MEMORY LOSS. You can strengthen your memory using herbs and nutrition according tothis formula, says nutrition expert Robert M. Giller, M.D. Here's what to take: Gingko biloba (40 mg, 3-4x daily) choline (650 mg, 3x daily) vitamin C (1000 mg, once daily) beta carotene (10,000 I.U., once daily) selenium (50 mcg, once daily) vitamin B12 (1000 mcg, once daily) zinc (50 mg, once daily) Take this formula for at least 2 months and enjoy the improvements in your memory. INSOMNIA. Here is a natural approach for falling asleep within minutes after yourhead hits the pillow, according to Dr. Giller. If you are on conventionalmedications for health problems, find out if any of these are known to interruptsleep cycles. Then: Don't eat big dinners within 3 hours of going to bed. Don't have caffeinated coffee or other stimulants with dessert. Try eliminating all caffeine-based products for a couple of weeks untilyour sleep improves. Give up smoking or at least don't smoke within 2 hours of sleeping. Don't think about your job or any personal worries before going to bed. Don't read or watch anything overly stimulating before bed. If you're tired or sluggish during the day, don't take a nap; try exercisinginstead. Get at least 20 minutes of regular exercise during the day. Try to go to bed at night and get up in the morning at a fixed timeregularly. Eat foods that are rich in L-tryptophan, an amino acid that helps your brain slowdown; these include tuna, turkey, and dairy milk. Take 2 capsules of the herb valerian 1 hour before bedtime. Wash it down with a cup of warm passionflower tea. Take calcium (1200 mg) before bedtime. Try melatonin supplements (2 mg nightly for 2 weeks). SINUSITIS. A patient once described a sinus infection as "like being under hundredsof feet of water without a diving helmet," says Dr. Giller. If this is how you feel,then: Drink 6-8 glasses of pure water daily, or the same amount of herbalteas, broths, and soups. Take hot showers and baths. Fill a sink or large pot with hot water, lean over thepot, put a towel over your head and pot, then slowly, deeply, inhale the steamy warm air. Apply warm compresses to your eyes and nose for pain relief. Place your thumb andindex finger at the top of your nose on either side and press gently for a fewmoments. Repeat this several times a day. Take vitamin C (1-2 g daily), vitamin A (10,000 I.U. daily), and N-acetyl-cysteine,derived from an amino acid (200 mg, 3 times daily for adults, 200 mg 2 times dailyfor children). -SOURCE: Natural Prescriptions.

How to Survive Your Next Cold or Flu The next time you feel a cold or the flu coming on (or if it's too late and youalready have either), try some of these recommendations from nutritional therapistPenny Davenport: FAST FOR 24 HOURS. Stay away from solid foods for a day. Drink a tall glass of purewater with freshly squeezed lemon in the morning. Then 3-4 glasses of diluted fruitor vegetable juice (one kind only), drinking each glass 3 hours apart. Drink at least2 pints of pure water (filtered or bottints of pure water (filtered or bottled)during the day. FOODS TO AVOID. Avoid all dairy products, refined, starchy foods (white bread,pasta, cookies), and high-sugar foods. DRINK HERBAL TEAS AND BEVERAGES. Have a steeped tea, made of equal amounts ofyarrow, elderflower, and pepperminnt, 3-4 times daily. Also take fennel or fenugreek(1 teaspoon dry herb per 6 ounces hot water) made as tea to break up mucus. Mixlemon juice (1 teaspoon) and freshly grated ginger in hot water (6 ounces); add 1/4teaspoon vitamin C powder and honey to ssweeten. MASSAGE YOUR BODY.

Moss monitored 14 middle-aged people with symptoms ofarthritis, low back pain, frozen shoulder, rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, as theytook 400-500 µg daily (in 4-5 doses of 100 µg) of molybdenum amino acidchelate. Molybdenum, an essential micronutrient found in whole grains and red cabbage, isnecessary for making key enzymes needed for detoxification. After 28 days, everyoneon the trial felt better: toe and foot pain decreased, cramps and rheumatic paindeclined, and the sense of well-being increased. -SOURCE: Journal of Nutritional & Environmental Medicine, Vol. 5, No. 1,1995, pp. 55-61.

Given the high cost to social security, the health service, to employers and to thesufferers alike, such an inexpensive treatment might be very cost-effective,researcher Margaret Moss concluded. ASTHMA A 14 year old girl came to William Douglass Campbell, M.D., of Atlanta, Georgia,with severe asthma. She couldn't speak, she was sweating profusely, she looked paleand terrified, and she was straining to breathe-she was having alife-threatening asthma attack. Five years of taking a conventional drug had broughtno improvement and left her chronically sleepy. Dr. Campbell immediately put the girl on an intravenous hydrogen peroxide drip. Then,drawing 100 milliliters of her blood, he exposed it to ultraviolet light, thenreinfused it into her blood stream. Within 2 hours, the girl was 50% better and bythe next morning her parents told Dr. Campbell she was perfectly recovered. Two yearslater she remained asthma-free. "The combination of hydrogen peroxide and treatingthe drawn blood with ultraviolet light is called Photox (or photophoresis) treatmentand has been available as a safe, proven, and effective medical treatment since1920," says Dr. Campbell. -SOURCE: Case record of William Douglass Campbell, M.D., Second Opinion [newsletter] P.O.

BACK PAIN, CHRONIC A 41-year-old man suffered a back injury 4 years prior, then developed a chronicsacroiliac strain marked by sharp, digging pain in his lower back and occasionallameness every day. His homeopath, Tori Hudson, N.D., of the Portland (Oregon)Naturopathic Clinic, prescribed homeopathic horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocampus 6c)for 1 month. After 3 days, all his back pain was gone, the medicine was discontinued,and he reported to Dr. Hudson that he "feels great." -SOURCE: Simillimum: The Journal of the Homeopathic Academy of NaturopathicPhysicians.

CANCER The spice turmeric demonstrates anticancer activity when taken in daily dosages of500 mg for a 110-pound person, according to human studies from India. There, atypical daily intake for turmeric is 200-600 mg, used as a dietary spice. In ratstudies, turmeric reduced tumor formation within 24 hours of ingestion. -SOURCE: Quarterly Review of Natural Medicine, Spring 1994, p. 25. According to Hiroaki Nanba, Ph.D., of Kobe Pharmaceutical University in Japan, of allthe mushrooms he has studied, maitake mushroom has the strongest activity in tumorgrowth inhibition. In mice studies, maitake mushroom, given orally, produced a totalremission in tumors in 40% of the animals, and a 90% suppression rate in the others.Not only can maitake stop tumors from growing further, but it can halt cancerformation and metastasis, Dr. Nanba reported. Preliminary studies also indicatemaitake is effective against Kaposi's sarcoma, which affects about 40% of people withAIDS. The active ingredients in maitake apparently do not directly destroy cancercells; rather, they activate the immune system and its self-healing powers. -SOURCE: Explore More!

CANDIDA Charles H. Farr, M.D., Ph.D., has treated hundreds of patients with chronicsystemic candida, or yeast infection, using intravenous hydrogen peroxide, at hisclinic in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. A woman, age 34, had been suffering with systemic yeast infection for 5 years andhad taken a barrage of antibiotics and practiced rotation and elimination diets, tono effect. She had vaginal yeast infection, intermittent diarrhea, headaches, acne,lethargy, joint pain, mental confusion, menstrual irregularities, and had been unableto work for 2 years. Dr. Farr started her on once weekly intravenous infusions of hydrogen peroxide; afteronly 2 treatments, she reported feeling more alert and able to concentrate better andthat she was feeling much better. After the third treatment, her complexion startedto improve, all signs of her vaginitis disappeared, and her bowel function becamenormal. After 8 treatments, she was free of all the symptoms that had plagued herfor 5 years; and after 2 more months, she went job-hunting. -SOURCE: Oxygen Healing Therapies for Optimum Health & Vitality, NathanielAltman, Healing Arts Press, Rochester, VT, 1995. CATARACTS Numerous recent studies show that taking multivitamins significantly reduces thechance of developing cataracts. A study involving 17,744 U.S. doctors showed a 27%reduced risk in developing cataracts while on multivitamins. More specifically, a study among 121,700 nurses proved that taking vitamins andeating antioxidant-rich foods makes a big difference. Women who took 14,588 I.U. ofbeta-carotene daily (a precursor of vitamin A) showed a 30% reduced risk of gettingcataracts; nurses who took more than 700 mg daily of vitamin C for an extended period(up to 10 years), had a 45% reduction in cataract risk. When they consumed highlevels of beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, plus riboflavin from dietary sources (notsupplements), their cataract risk was reduced by 40%. Similarly, nurses who ate spinach or other leafy greens at least 5 times a weekregistered a 47-65% lower risk of cataracts. Recent 5-year Chinese studies showedthat adults aged 65-74 who took multivitamins regularly had a 36% reduced risk;taking riboflavin and niacin supplements gave them a 44% lower risk. A Canadian studywith 300 subjects demonstrated that people who took 400 I.U. of vitamin E and 300-600mg of vitamin C reduced their cataract risk by 50%. The key vitamins with which tokeep your body well stocked as a preventive measure against cataracts are vitaminsC, E, and A (beta carotene). In addition, dietary fortification with N-acetyl-cysteine of at least 30 mg per 2.2pounds of body weight per day is recommended. This is an amino acid that enhancesbody levels of glutathione, a protein-substance essential to preventing cataracts;low bodily amounts are linked with cataracts. -SOURCE: Townsend Letter for Doctors, "Eradicating Cataracts," June 1995, pp.50-59.

CERVICAL DYSPLASIA Dysplasia is a gynecological condition, sometimes a precursor to cancer, inwhich cells in the cervix become abnormal or displaced. A 43-year-old woman consultedFarida Sharan, M.D., N.D., after receiving a clinical diagnosis of cervicaldysplasia. Six weeks before her scheduled laser surgery, she wanted to use naturalmedicines to avert the operation. Dr. Sharan prescribed a series of herbal formulas. These included a mixture for thelymphatics: equal amounts of Echinacea, lobelia, mullein, poke root, burdock,cayenne, chaparral. These were taken in dry powder form at a total dosage of 8 ouncesover 1 month. Dr. Sharan also prescribed a formula to rejuvenate the intestines,comprising: Cascara sagrada, ginger root, goldenseal, slippery elm, turkey rhubarb,wahoo, parsley root. These were also taken in dry powder form at a total dosage of 8ounces over 1 month. In addition, Dr. Sharan prescribed saw palmetto (for the patient's breast fibroids),plus additional herbal formulas for inflammation of the reproductive area. Thepatient started douching with the herb, yellow dock. After 6 weeks on the program,her condition turned around entirely and she no longer needed surgery. -SOURCE: Alternative & Complementary Therapies, April/May 1995, pp. 147-153. CONJUNCTIVITIS One woman, age 33, who worked with computers complained of "pink eye." She had pusin one eye plus redness and tenderness in the eyeball. In the morning she couldbarely open this eye, which burned and pulsated; her vision was blurred and she wasin the fifth day of a head cold.

Pizzorno, N.D.,who is also president of Bastyr College of Natural Medicine in Seattle, Washington,treats this condition with the following approach. What to do: Drink at least 32 ounces of pure water or non-sweetened liquid daily(which can include 16 ounces of cranberry or blueberry juice). Eat generous amountsof garlic and onion. Take these supplements: vitamin C (500 mg every 2 hours);vitamin A (50,000 I.U. daily); zinc (30 mg daily); Uvaursi, also known as bearberryor upland cranberry (1/2 teaspoon fluid extract or 1.5 teaspoons tincture);goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis; 1/2 teaspoon fluid extract or 1.5 teaspoonstincture).What not to do: Restrict your calorie intake, avoid all simple sugars, refinedcarbohydrates (white breads and pasta), and full-strength fruit juices. -SOURCE: Alternative & Complementary Therapies, October 1994, pp. 32-34. EBOLA VIRUS In case you've been worried or even terrified after watching the movie Outbreak orreading the bestseller, The Hot Zone, in which there is no apparent cure for thelethal Ebola virus that causes fatal body-wide hemorrhaging, the Digest is happy toinform you that this is not the case. Some 4000 peer-reviewed articles suggest thatusing oxidative therapy would be the best, fastest, and most reliable way to handlethe Ebola problem. According to William Lee Cowden, M.D., oxidative therapy (using hydrogen peroxide orozone) is one way to eradicate viruses, fungi, bacteria, even certain kinds ofparasites, from the body. A patient with influenza, for example, who receives anintravenous drip of hydrogen peroxide (at a very weak dilution) will in a few hourshave no flu symptoms at all. The same should work with Ebola (and any infectiousmicroorganism) because the oxygen kills all organisms that lack the ability toconcentrate their own free radical scavengers, an ability that every human cell has.Most physicians who use oxidative therapy recommend taking vitamin C, beta carotene,and other antioxidants before and after treatment to prevent damage to human cellsfrom the oxidative therapy. -SOURCE: Medical information provided by William Lee Cowden, M.D., Dallas,Texas. ENCEPHALITIS The fact that homeopathy can capably handle acute medical problems, in addition toits specialty, which is long-term chronic conditions, is demonstrated in this case. A woman, age 31, was rushed to the hospital with severe headaches, neck pain andstiffness, high fever, extreme weakness, and altered consciousness. The diagnosis:acute viral encephalitis, which is an inflammation of the brain. After 3 days, the hospital released her with 2 prescription medicines but when sheshowed up at her homeopath's office, she wasn't feeling much better. In fact, she wasso exhausted they nearly had to carry her into the examining room. Her head feltseverely swollen, she had constant pain, nausea, chills and hot flashes; she had little appetite and was generally miserable. Larry Herdener, N.D., her naturopathic homeopath, gave her herbs to support herimmune function, including echinacea, hydrastis, garlic, and thymus glandulars; heprescribed an electrolyte replacement sports drink, a balanced meal supplement, plusone dose of homeopathic deadly nightshade (belladonna 200c). In just 2 days she felt 70% better, and in 4 days, after more rest and good food, shewas 90% recovered and back in the mainstream of her life as a mother. -SOURCE: Simillimum: The Journal of the Homeopathic Academy of NaturopathicPhysicians.

INFECTION Clinical aromatherapist Peter Holmes, L.Ac., M.H., practicing in Boulder,Colorado, was brought a 23-month-old infant with a fever, enlarged tonsils, nasaldischarges, pain, inflammation, and infection on her left side where she had beenbitten by another infant. An M.D. had diagnosed cellulitis (tissue inflammationmarked by redness, pain, and swelling) with an upper respiratory infection and hadrecommended antibiotics, but the mother had declined them. Dr. Holmes prescribed a series of essential oils for both systemic and topicaltreatment. First, he gave the infant a mixture of tea tree, lavender, and calendulaoils (mixed as 1 drop of each oil in a feeding bottle of fruit juice) 3 times dailyto reduce the infection and fever and stimulate immune response. Then he prepared aliniment from the same oils (using a 10% dilution in jojoba oil) which the mothermassaged onto the infant's chest twice daily. Second, Dr. Holmes mixed together lavender, Moroccan blue chamomile, and calendulaoils (in a 20% dilution in jojoba oil) to be applied on the infected skin 6 times aday. Third, he instructed the mother in how to make a lemon oil calf wrap to keep thechild's fever down. The lemon oil wrap is made by immersing a washcloth in lemon oil(1% dilution) in cold water, then wrapping it around the knees and calves forabsorption through the skin. By the next morning, the fever was gone, and in 2 days, the pain, redness, andswelling were reduced; after 2 more days, the tonsil symptoms were gone, and thechild was completely recovered. -SOURCE: Alternative & Complementary Therapies, Vol. 1, No. 3, April/May1995, p. 179.

OBESITY An overweight woman, age 70, came to enzyme therapist Dr. Lita Lee, Ph.D., ofEugene, Oregon, with a goiter, gastritis, hiatal hernia, ulcers, and a chronicinability to lose weight. She had been taking a conventional antacid for 35 yearswith little benefit. Dr. Lee prescribed a remedy rich in digestive enzymes includingcomfrey, papaya leaf, and a thyroid glandular extract. One year later, even thoughthe woman did not change her diet, her weight had dropped from 240 to 165 pounds. Herappetite had decreased because the enzymes enabled her system to digest her food morethoroughly. -SOURCE: Earthletter, Vol. 4, No. 1, Spring 1994.

PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME Taking magnesium supplements the next time you experience the various symptoms ofPMS may be the solution, advises Melvyn R. Werbach, M.D. Recent studies showed thatof 192 women taking 400 mg of magnesium daily during PMS, 95% experienced less breastpain and had less weight gain; 89% suffered less nervous tension; and 43% had fewerheadaches. Dr. Werbach further advises that women should take 50 mg daily of vitaminB6 with the magnesium, as this helps with magnesium absorption. -SOURCE: Townsend Letter for Doctors, June 1995, p. 26.

SENILE DEMENTIA Physicians at the Salvador Allende Hospital in Havana, Cuba, treated 30 patients,diagnosed as having senile dementia (a severe mental decline similar to Alzheimer's),with ozone and oxygen therapy for 21 days. Of the patients, 75% showed "marked"improvement in medical status; 83% demonstrated an improved mental condition; 83% were better able to take their own medications; and 80% had greater ease in social interaction and managing dailyactivities, and had more energy. While the physicians, led by M. Rodriguez, M.D., and Jose Garcia, M.D., did notregard ozone therapy as a "cure" for patients with senile dementia, they wereconfident in saying that it noticeably improves their quality of life. As of 1994,over 500 elderly patients at this hospital had received ozone therapy for dementia. -SOURCE: Oxygen Healing Therapies for Optimum Health & Vitality, NathanielAltman, Healing Arts Press, Rochester, VT, 1995.

SPASTIC COLON A man, age 57, reported symptoms of chronic diarrhea and spastic colon (also knownas irritable bowel syndrome). He said that 2 hours after eating, he gets headaches,weakness, gas, and abdominal pain. He had been taking up to 5 doses daily of aconventional drug to control his digestive problems, but it wasn't working. A urineanalysis showed he was severely deficient in vitamin C and quite low in magnesium andcalcium. Enzyme therapist Lita Lee, Ph.D., put him on a high lipase enzyme formula; she gave him vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, and a remedy to drain his kidneys and lymph glands: this included rose hips, alfalfa, mullein, and Echinacea.

In a clinical study with 210 cancer patients, for whom conventional treatments hadfailed, each received 50-60 drops of Carnivora® orally 5 times a day plus oneinjection. The results were excellent: 16% of patients showed tumor remission and 40%had no further tumor progression; in the remaining 43% no improvement was noted,although about one-quarter of these patients experienced a palliative effect. Thismeans they felt a decrease in subjective complaints and pain and an increase inappetite, vitality, and positive attitude. The study showed that more than half, or56%, experienced either a tumor remission or that their cancer development becamestable and did not worsen. In a second study, after previous conventional therapies failed, 57 patients (averageage 51, with malignancies or chronic immune disorders) took 2 ml of Carnivora® dailyfor 116 days. At the end of this trial period, 57% reported an improvement in theircondition, 25% showed no change, and 18% worsened. Put differently, 45.5% of patientsexperienced tumor remission; for 34.5%, the tumors became stationary; and 20% had nochange. Carnivora® is an immunomodulator, which means it stimulates the activity of T-helpercells which, in turn, enable the body to wage a more vigorous defense against theillness, explains Helmut Keller, M.D., medical director of the Chronic DiseaseControl and Treatment Center in Bad Steben, Germany, where he uses the Venus Flytrapproduct on cancer patients. Carnivora® is available as drops or injectable ampules from Carnivora-Forschungs-Gmbh, Postfach 6, Lobensteiner Strasse 3, D-96365 Nordhalben, Germany; tel: 09267-166; fax: 09267-1040. According to Dr. Keller, the substance is also effective in treating ulcerativecolitis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, neurodermitis,chronic fatigue syndrome, HIV infection, and certain kinds of herpes. It is alsorecommended as an adjunct to strengthen the effects of antibiotics. CAUTION: Side effects are minimal: taken orally without dilution, Carnivora® can sometimesproduce nausea or vomiting; when injected, it can produce a temporary increase inbody temperature. Ninety-day studies with rats in which the rodents received doses30-60 times higher than the recommended human dose reported no toxic reactions. HEAL SPORTS INJURIES AND REGROW DAMAGED TISSUE - Light Beams Tone Your Lymph System Although lymphatic therapy, or the manipulation and draining of the body's 600 lymphnodes, is the fourth most commonly prescribed medical treatment in Europe, in theU.S. it is almost unknown. Yet an unimpeded lymph system, which carries immune cells,is essential not only for health, but in enabling the body to heal from seriousillnesses, soft tissue damage, breast cancer, and prostatitis, among others. European physicians often use a manipulation technique called Manual Lymph Drainageto unclog the lymph system, yet a new device called the Light Beam Generator canaccomplish in one session what would otherwise require 8 treatments of hands-on lymphmassage and drainage. Developed by ELF Laboratories of Evansville, Indiana, the Light Beam Generator is aportable device, the size of a small suitcase. Based on the principles of energymedicine, the Generator contains a radio transmitter, a fiber-optics-mountedflashlight attachment, and small amounts of inert gases such as neon, argon, xenon,and helium. An electronic pulse (728Hz) from the radio transmitter excites the inert gases; theyradiate subtle energy as light which is then pulsed into living human tissue throughcontact with the handheld light beam generator "flashlight." The Generator gets excellent results in soft tissue regeneration work with patientswho have torn cartilage, sports injuries, or need post-operative rehabilitation,reports Sky David, R.P.T., a physical therapist working in Santa Fe, New Mexico, whohas used this FDA-approved device for 4 years. "It literally provides a light touch,and helps get the inflammatory response to tissue injury out of the way so healingand regeneration can start," says David. "I often use it on a patient for 5-8 minutesbefore doing manual lymph therapy." See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide, "Energy Medicine," pp. 192-204. In two published cases (among many), David used the Light Beam Generator (LBG) toheal and regenerate torn knee cartilage in a 37-year-old mountain climber. During90-minute sessions, David used the LBG and manual lymph drainage. In a second case,David eliminated longstanding pain and restricted hip joint movement. David is alsousing this approach to work on breast tissue regeneration in cases of mastectomy. Thefuture of physical therapy lies not in postoperative rehabilitation, David says, "butin post-injury tissue regeneration." The LBG (which costs $3200) and support literature are available from ELF Laboratories, Courtland Reeves, Director, 1314 Burch Drive, Evansville, IN 47711; tel: 812-867-7942 THE ANTIBIOTIC WITH A SILVER LINING -Why Colloidal Silver is Making a Comeback as a Broad Spectrum Antibiotic If you're any of at least 650 different germs, contact with colloidal silver is yourworst nightmare, for this ultrafine liquid suspension of tiny particles of silver iscompletely toxic to microorganisms that don't belong in the human system, whetherit's the eyes or intestines, the gums or the skin. But if you are the host, that is,a human being, scientific studies indicate that there are no harmful side effects atall from taking silver in this way. In other words, in a time when disease organisms are mutating to become increasinglyimmune to standard antibiotics, here is a new nontoxic substance in the presence ofwhich they cannot survive. The irony here is that, prior to the advent of biochemical antibiotics in the 1930s,the use of colloidal metallic silver as a broad- spectrum agent against bacteria,viruses, and disease-producing "germs" was actually widespread in Western medicine.Colloidal silver is making a comeback in the 1990s with a surprising range of uses,which include use as a disinfectant for municipal and home water purification; as atopical ointment for burns (both mild and severe); as an aid for conjunctivitis; andas a help for skin infections and ulcers. Atomized, then inhaled through a mister, colloidal silver can be sprayed into thenose or throat as a disinfecting throat gargle against staph infections or septictonsillitis. It works as a pain reliever for dental abscesses or as a catalyst forbone growth and regeneration following injury. Taken orally, silver is a digestiveaid against fermentation of food in the stomach; it also works as a germicidal agentin the treatment of herpes, intestinal parasites, even cancer. In 1978, Science Digest reviewed the medicinal properties of colloidal silver,especially in treating severe burns and diabetic skin ulcers, and concluded:"Perhaps it soon will be recognized as our mightiest germ fighter." According toresearch drawn from 37 countries, the number of medical uses for colloidal silver nowtotal 87, including that of general immune system enhancer. CAUTION: There is some concern among physicians that colloidal silver may leave trace depositsof silver (which is, technically, a heavy metal) in the body. According tocardiologist-internist William Lee Cowden, M.D., of Dallas, Texas, it's advisable toproceed with caution when using colloidal silver for internal use. Dr. Cowdenrecommends that after using colloidal silver for an extended internal treatmentperiod you should take steps to remove the silver from your system. Approachesinclude taking homeopathic silver (Argentum nitrate), EDTA chelation, orhomeopathically prepared DMPS (dimercapto-propane sulfonate) which is a chelatorthat will bind up silver and remove it).

ENDING THE MONOPOLY-Major Congressional Support for Alternative Medicine on the DocketAlternative medicine is poised for major Congressional support this year as SenatorTom Daschle and U.S. Representative Peter deFazio (with 18 Congressional co-sponsors)introduce their Access to Medical Treatment Act in both Houses of Congress."Conventional medical treatments have monopolized the market and shut outcomplementary and alternative treatments," state Barton and deFazio. The intent of the bill is "to expand the selection of medical treatments availablefor illness and to give many patients another option when conventional methods fail."The bill would guarantee the right of every person to receive any medical treatmentdesired, including those not approved, certified, or licensed by the FDA, providingthis treatment is administered by a state-licensed health care professional. Ifpassed, this bill could profoundly open up the medical marketplace for the legal andunharassed use of alternative medicine. "I want to get the thousand-pound gorillaknown as the FDA off the backs of people who want access to beneficial healthtreatments without compromising the public's safety," states DeFazio. VOTE!

ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAKES DRAMATIC GAINS AT THE STATE LEVEL One key to making alternative medicine universally available in the U.S. (andreimbursable by insurance companies) is a change in the licensing laws at the statelevel. This year New Hampshire became the tenth state to license naturopathy, thanksto unflagging grassroots work. The news from Oregon is similarly encouraging for anationwide shift in licensing. There, on May 30 this year, the Oregon House ofRepresentatives passed the "Alternative Medicine Bill" which will make this state thesixth in the U.S. to provide legal protection for patients seeking or doctorsproviding "unconventional" treatments or drugless therapies. According to lobbyistswho worked for this bill, it was "the energy and the power from the many citizens,physicians, patients, and their families" that guaranteed the passage of the bill. OnJuly 28, an extraordinary grassroots campaign managed to persuade legislators tooverturn the Governor's veto of this bill, thus ending 20 years of consistentpersecution and prosecution of licensed physicians who practiced alternativemedicine. This is an exceptionally important development, with favorable import forthe future of alternative medicine in the U.S. The Massachusetts legislature is now looking over a Medical Freedom of Choice Actthat would prevent government authorities from interfering with "duly qualifiedpractitioners" simply because they are using unconventional practices or products. -SOURCE: APMA Director's Report, April 28 & May 17, 1995. VOTE!There are already 6 states (NY, OK, NC, AK, WA, OR) with similar laws, which at least indirectly support naturopathic practice. Even better, new initiatives are planned for California, Florida, Colorado, Utah, Indiana, and Minnesota to pass bills that protect consumer access to alternative medicine.Contact Chapter Relations of Citizens for Health (206-922-2457) for information on how to help at the state level. INSURANCE MONEY TALKS-The Nation's First Alternative Health Plan Citizens for Health, a national health advocacy group based in Tacoma, Washington,has teamed up with the Alternative Health Group of Thousand Oaks, California, toprovide a progressive health coverage plan for alternative treatments. The plancovers conventional and alternative therapies, including, for example, acupuncture,ayurvedic, chelation, homeopathy, naturopathy, herbs, nutrition, and others, in all50 states. Not only is this plan a welcome relief to highly restrictive conventionalinsurance plans, but it may exert financial leverage to mobilize legislative changeat the state and national levels. That's because alternative medicine is probablymore cost-effective than conventional and can save insurance companies a great dealof money. They in turn can help change the structure of American health care to favoralternative medicine. Contact: Alliance for Alternatives in Healthcare, tel: 800-966-8467, ext. 17. "QUACKBUSTERS" BUSTED All 190 charges against Lawrence Taylor, M.D., a California physician practicingchelation therapy, have been dropped. Dr. Taylor had been the subject of a concerted$750,000 harassment campaign by conventional medical authorities that included theOffice of the City Attorney (San Diego), the California Medical Board, and thepseudo-science sham "quackbuster" front called the National Council Against HealthFraud. All this despite the lack of formal patient complaints against Dr. Taylor. Too bad they wasted all that money on a futile cause. How much more a benefit tosociety the money would have been if these misguided medical "authorities" hadinstead financed further research into the health advantages of chelation therapy. Aneffort by the California Medical Board to outlaw chelation therapy in that state(despite prodigious scientific research validating its claims) also nosedived intononresults, no doubt further exasperating the ill-advised opponents of alternativemedicine. -SOURCE: APMA Director's Report, June 12, 1995. U.S. CONGRESS BARKING AT THE HEELS OF AN OUT-OF-CONTROL FDA-Threatens to Defund& Micromanage the Agency Congressional investigation of inappropriate or unlawful activities by the FDA,called the "Foot-Dragging and Alibi Administration" by Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), whois leading the charge, are intensifying as the year proceeds. At issue are the FDA'srampant intimidation of practitioners, their Gestapo-style clinic raids, theirtardiness in approving new medical devices, and their heavy-handed tactics againstunconventional physicians, all of which eliminate patient access and medical freedom. In Barton's view, the FDA is "uncooperative" in answering Congressional inquiries; atleast seven of their regulatory programs are now "targets for defunding;" and if theykeep on "subverting the intention of Congress" that will leave "no alternative but tobe micro-managed to ensure that they live up to their legal requirements." Onepowerful way to snap the FDA back into line is to simply, and literally, cut offtheir tax-payer-supplied money. The fact that FDA is trying to railroad new rules to keep the names of people whomake unfavorable reports on devices, products, and doctors confidential is not likelyto win Congressional favor. That's because this rule would enable FDA to use bogus,unreliable, or unsubstantiated adverse reports as the basis of regulatory actionswithout having to disclose these for public inspection or challenge. It could givethe "quackbusters" yet another unfair edge against alternative medicine. VOTE! Support Congressional efforts to restructurethe FDA by contacting: Rep.

Admits Prestigious Scientific Journal A landmark study in the British medical journal, Lancet, convincingly shows thathomeopathy is indeed credible, dispelling the lame criticism by skeptics ofhomeopathy that its healing effects are more imaginary than substantial. Researchers worked with a group of 28 patients who suffered from allergic asthma.They gave 14 patients a placebo while the other 14 received a homeopathic remedyspecific for allergies. None of the 28 people (or the researchers) knew whether theyhad the real remedy or the placebo. One month later, when homeopaths andconventional doctors examined all 28 patients, they found that those who had thehomeopathic remedy showed a marked improvement in their symptoms compared to theplacebo group. the World Health Organization states thathomeopathy is the second most widely used form of medicine in the world, second toChinese medicine; herbalism is third and conventional medicine is fourth. This study came on the heels of two earlier, highly favorable studies involving theuse of homeopathic remedies for hay fever sufferers. Taking the results of all 3studies together, researchers concluded that patients using homeopathic remedies hada 33% reduction in symptoms compared to only 10% with placebo. A 1991 study in theBritish Medical Journal showed that out of 107 clinical trials for homeopathy, 77%showed positive outcomes for illnesses such as influenza, migraines, and rheumatoidarthritis. Meanwhile, it's encouraging to learn that about 20% of pharmacists nationwide are nowregularly directing their patients to over-the-counter homeopathic remedies on theaverage of 6 times a month. Further, the World Health Organization states thathomeopathy is the second most widely used form of medicine in the world, second toChinese medicine; herbalism is third and conventional medicine is fourth. -SOURCES: Vegetarian Times, Issue 212, April 1995, p. 22.

DOUBT IS THEIR PRODUCT-When Science Becomes Public Relations One of the prime reasons that our protracted war on cancer has turned into anunwinnable "medical Vietnam," says Robert N. Proctor, History of Science professor atPennsylvania State University, is that cancer research and the reporting of itsresults has become a predominantly political issue. And when you link politics withmedicine, you suddenly enter a perilously gray territory in which truth recedes andspecial interests rush to the forefront. As an estimated 538,000 Americans now die of cancer every year, a "cure" grows evermore remote and even clarity about prevention gets increasingly obscured by thefinancial interests of the conventional medical establishment. You have "islands ofagreement separated by deep seas of controversy," writes Proctor. Cancer research isbig business and unless you are a discriminating, resourceful reader, most likely youhave been subjected to the clever, often deceitful, promotional efforts of corporatetrade association "science." In 1986, at least 1700 associations spent $2 billion on"issues management, advocacy, communication, and image advertising"-onsmokescreens, in other words, but not the bare truth. Trade associations (notably tobacco, petrochemical, and asbestos) adeptly combineresearch and advocacy-sometimes as only "a mixture of scientific fact andfiction," says Proctor-to produce a culture of doubt and uncertainty in whichthey are carefully insulated from charges of bias or legal liability. In thisambiguous new world of propaganda, manipulation, and public opinion shaping,"rhetorical strategies of avoidance" reign supreme. In Proctor's view, "all [associations] share a desire to absolve their constituentclient substances...of blame for an alleged nuisance"-especially if it's acancer cause. If suspected cancer causes are in doubt, from conflicting studies orinconclusive results, this becomes the perfect excuse, if you're a regulatory body,for doing nothing to change it. -SOURCE: Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know AboutCancer, Robert N. Proctor, Basic Books, NY, 1995. Another Patients Speak! Special Report BAY AREA BIG ON ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE, Says New Poll Of people living in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, 41% tried alternativemedicine at least once last year, according to a new poll of 600 adults conducted inApril 1995. This is far above the national average of 34%, which surprised many whenfirst cited in 1993 (based on 1990 figures). Most popular among the disciplinesconsulted are herbs and vitamins, relaxation techniques, massage, chiropractic, andmacrobiotics. Interest in acupuncture is soaring in California, with 4500 licensedpractitioners, or one half of the nation's total, at work in this state. Of those who tried alternative medicine, 54% said they were "very satisfied" and 80%said they would do it again; 51% said they were "likely to try" alternativetreatments soon. More women than men made those office visits, yet 51% of both sexessaid they were favorably considering making an appointment. Why is alternativemedicine's popularity growing so rapidly? Because it works, is affordable, anddoesn't fill your life with side effects. -SOURCES: "Alternative Medicine Thrives in Bay Area," San Francisco Chronicle, May17, 1995.

The Drug Industry- America's Nonstop Profit Center Why The Club, or organized conventional (allopathic) medicine, wants to maximize profits and minimize information, regardless of what patients want. In case you're wondering what is driving U.S. annual health care costs over theunbelievable $1 trillion mark, take a look at recent drug industry statistics to seea major contributing factor. According to information reported in 1993, drug prices outside the U.S. were 10%-70%lower than those charged in America; prescription drug prices rose about three times higher than inflation between 1980-1990 as drug makers boasted annual profits 3 timeshigher than the national average for Fortune 500 companies. Further, drug companiesspend about $13,000 per U.S. physician in marketing, about 22% of their total sales(about $75.2 billion worldwide) on promotion, and $231 million to develop and patenta single drug. It's not as if the exceptionally high drug profits are making life any easier for thesick. Patients pay exorbitantly for these "modern medical miracles." For example: adiabetic woman's monthly drug cost is $150; a heart transplant patient shells out $50a day for antirejection pills; a Gaucher's disease patient needs $270,000 a year topay for his drugs. Herbs are mostly unpatentable and thus unprofitable, so it'seasier for drug companies to suppress rather than support them. That's what keeps"The Club," or the organized conventional medicine establishment, highly profitable,says medical researcher and activist Michael L. Culbert, D.Sc. "While the American expression of the Drug Trust is the focus...the internationalnature of the pharmaceutical octopus cannot be overlooked," writes Culbert, "for it has played a role, both openly and behind thescenes, not only in endlessly producing toxic synthetic compounds for humanconsumption, but in helping bar the development, use and distribution of naturaltherapies at every turn." -SOURCE: Medical Armageddon: Behind the Healthcare Calamity of the Western World and How to Fix It, Michael L.

Excitotoxins-The Taste That KillsRussell L. Blaylock, M.D. Health Press, P.O. Box 1388, Santa Fe, NM 87504 (tel: 505-982-9373), 1994, hardcover, $27, 264 pp. An excitotoxin, states Dr. Blaylock, is a substance added to prepared foods andbeverages that stimulates one's neurons literally to death. This can lead toneurological disease, even brain tumors. In case you believe an excitotoxin is arare, exotic substance hardly ever encountered, you will be chastened to learn thatyou probably eat some every day. They're found in such FDA-approved ingredients asmonosodium glutamate (MSG-the universal flavoring in Chinese restaurants),aspartame (found in the nonsugar sweetener, Nutrasweet[TM]), and hydrolized vegetableprotein (a high-tech protein extract). What began in 1908 in a Japanese laboratory as an effort to isolate theflavor-enhancing factor in kombu seaweed led to a multibillion dollar taste-enhancingindustry by the 1960s. The only trouble here, declares Dr. Blaylock, is that when thebody gets too much of a taste-enhancer, it turns it into an excitotoxin, orpotential brain cell killer. It's the MSG controversy all over again, but this timewith solid medical data to support the case against glutamates. Dr. Blaylock is not so much an alarmist as a realist. As a practicing neurosurgeon,he regularly sees the damage produced by excitotoxins-he calls them"neurological time bombs"-on the human brain. This damage includes Alzheimer's,Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's disease, Huntington's chorea, strokes, headaches,hypoglycemia, and other conditions. A common denominator in these conditions is too much glutamate (an amino acid) in thebrain. Although glutamate is normally found in large concentrations in the brain,when unnatural amounts enter the system, the natural balance of brain chemicals thatexcite and inhibit activity is upset. When this balance is upset, Dr. Blaylockexplains, a "cascade of destruction" ensues, and "serious disorders of the nervoussystem can result" throughout all of an individual's developmental stages, fromembryo to adult. In case you think the FDA is on the case, regulating the MSG supply in our foods,Dr. Blaylock reveals how the Glutamate Association, a powerful MSG-industry tradegroup, virtually wrote the original FDA "facts" and "safety" guidelines for their MSGpamphlet. Blaylock will alarm you, but this is useful. His book is upsetting, yet itis responsibly researched and well argued. It opens a fresh view on the hazardousrelationship of food (in this case, the wrong food) and brain health. Video Ozone and the Politics of Medicine Geoffrey Rogers, producer/director Threshold Film, #301-356 E. 6th Avenue, Vancouver, V5T 1K1, Canada (tel:800-216-4403); 1994, 30 minutes, VHS-color, $39. This is a quietly inflammatory documentary about oxygen and its role in healing andthe political aspect of product licensing by the FDA that is keeping ozone out ofAmerican doctors' offices. Ozone, which is an energized form of oxygen, is now used in 2000 cities worldwide todisinfect public water supplies. For the last 30 years, physicians in Germany haveused ozone therapy (oxygen is mixed with a patient's drawn blood then reinfused intothe body) to successfully treat cancer, stroke, gangrene, eczema, burns wounds, pain,herpes, hepatitis, and now AIDS-40 medical conditions in all. In fact, a 1980 study revealed that, of 1000 German therapists who gave ozonetreatment to 5 million patients, 90% said the approach was effective and that itproduced the lowest level of side effects of any existing medical treatment. So how come the FDA condemns ozone therapy as untested, undocumented, and unsafe, andwants somebody to shell out $231 million to prove them wrong? That's the politics ofozone. Meanwhile, Americans are flying to Germany or Mexico to get the healingbenefits of oxygen. "Ozone is inexpensive, very potent, and if it works even one-halfas well as the Germans claim, everyone in the world should be using it," says oneprominent American physician who endorses it. "Ozone is the most important drug inthe world," says another. Find out why in this excellent, clearly argued, andpersuasive triple award-winning video. These claims are valid assuming one consults a qualified, practitioner experienced inozone therapy and that the techniques are properly used. Take YourRingside Seat at the Medical Revolution The term "Armageddon" is a Biblical one indicating the place where a final battlebetween the forces of good and evil will be fought and determined. Some may thinkCulbert, a journalist, health freedom activist, and former chairman of the Committeefor Freedom of Choice in Medicine, is stretching the idea a little to put theintensifying struggle between alternative and conventional medicine in these terms;yet anyone who reads any part of his exhaustive 1000-page analysis cannot fail to beimpressed with the stakes of this conflict. These stakes are medical freedom,democracy, and genuine, affordable human health. Culbert's tone at times is shrill and alarmist; but, frankly, you need to shout thesedays to get the attention of many Americans who are otherwise enthralled with thepropaganda of The Club. This is Culbert's name for the "Allopathic Industrial Complex," an intricate andpowerful matrix of drug and insurance companies, conventional physicians, andgovernmental regulatory agencies that do their best to keep the alternatives out ofthe medical marketplace. If you ever doubted that the issue of medicine in America is less about therapeuticefficacy and more about politics and marketplace control, Culbert's detailed accountmay provoke you into a different notion. It may-and Culbert certainly hopesso-put the zeal of politics back into your life. Culbert documents the faults, excesses, and deceits of the conventional medicalestablishment, including their so-called holy war against "quackery" and alternativesin cancer, AIDS, and heart disease treatment, but he also sets the stage for thealternative. "The evolution of the New Medicine for the 21st century is increasingly therediscovery of the holistic paradigm in healing and its coupling with modern-eraadvances in diagnostics and therapeutic application-integrative medicine." Takeyour ringside seat at the coming medical revolution, urges Culbert, but then get upand help make it happen.

He's older than you think. Using the best ofalternative medicine, here's how Burton Goldberg, a pioneer of alternative medicine,shaved over 10 years off his appearance. The secret, more than anything else, is that Burton Goldberg started his rejuvenationprogram while he was still healthy. Prevention-stopping illness before it everdevelops-is the key. Start rejuvenating while you're well; you'll be surprised howmuch healthier you can become. By the way, Goldberg is 69. Here's a review of what hedoes to stay looking young: Dietary Change. Animal proteins are polluted withhormones and pesticides. Cut down on red meats and eat more fish, range-grownpoultry, lamb, and buffalo, and fresh, clean vegetables. Supplements. Today'sfoods, even when organically grown, no longer deliver the nutrients you need. Take acomplete multivitamin and mineral supplement daily. Hormones. Your body willeventually run low on these, so test yourself for supplementation with melatonin,DHEA, human growth hormone, testosterone, (for men) and natural progest-erone andnatural estrogen (for women). Detoxify. Think of it as an annual springhousecleaning to remove the toxins in your body and support the immune system. Lowpotency homeopathic remedies can help drain toxins out of your body's tissues andorgans, especially the liver and kidneys. Cleanse the Colon. Stagnant intestinesloaded down with un-processed material is a source of many illnesses. Do a bowelcleansing program with fiber supplements at least once a year. Consider your coloncleansed when you go 2-3 times daily. See "Move Your Lymph," this issue, pp. 22; "Parasites-Unwelcome Visitors in YourBody," Digest, No. 7, pp. 5-9; "Ask the Healer," Digest, No. 6, pp. 27-28; "TakeControl of Your Aging!" pp. 23-24, "Why a Single Hormone May Dictate the Future of Aging," pp. 25-26,"Longevity Hormones," pp. 27-28, all in Digest, No. 8; "The Ideal Clinic," Digest, No. 8, pp. 32-34; "Poisons From Your Mouth," Digest, No. 5, pp. 2-9. Parasites. Your body may be carryingunwanted parasites in its tissues and intestines. Purge these microbial invaders withan herbal parasite detoxification program. Rolfing. Your tissues, muscles, andbones may be out of alignment, hindering the functioning of all your organs. Get aRolfing starter session (10 treatments), then get Rolfed at least once a year torestructure your body. Get Regular Exercise. Everybody says this because it'strue. Try skiing, walking, bicycling, and horseback riding. Move the Lymph. Asluggish lymph circulation can slow down immune response and make the body toxic.Have a lymphatic massage, bounce on a trampoline, or, after training, use a LightBeam Generator to move the lymph at least once month. Take More Oxygen. All yourcells need more oxygen to stay healthy. A once-monthly intravenous infusion ofhydrogen peroxide, administered by a trained physician, can do the trick. Fix theTeeth. Bad dentistry may leave you with poisons in your mouth. You may have to removeall mercury amalgam fillings, gold caps, and teeth with root canals; you need toeliminate gum infections and correct the bite. See the Future. Live blood celltests using dark field microscopy can show you the subtlest traces of disease orbiochemical imbalances-long before they develop into illness; so you can takepreventive measures. Chelation Therapy. This is another insurance policy againstfuture illness. Intravenous chelation therapy draws toxins and metabolic wastes outof the bloodstream, cleans out clogged arteries, reoxygenates the blood, improvesvitality, memory, eyesight, reduces impotence, and strengthens blood flow and hearthealth.

[Go to the Table of Contents] Paraplegics Walk! SPECIAL FOCUS ON REJUVENATION Surgeons Regrow Broken Spines Their spinal cords were shattered, but after surgeons at a Mexican clinic used microsurgery and shark embryo cells to literally regrow their spines, these paraplegics were able to walk again-a world's first. The Baja Shark Embryo Team: (left) Miguel Chillon walks with the aid of legbraces; Isreal Romero (center) walks so well that he changes roles with his perfectlyhealthy wife; (top) Dr. Ramirez; (right) Jesse Marquez gets about with awalker. When Isreal Romero's pickup truck flipped over, breaking severalvertebrae in his spine, he lost all sensation from his chest to his feet. He was only30 years old, a Mexican fisherman who made his living diving for abalone and lobsteroff the Baja California coast, but now it looked like he'd be spending the rest ofhis life in a wheelchair. That has been the almost guaranteed fate for most peoplewho damage their spinal cord. In America, an estimated 200,000 people suffer partialor complete paralysis from spinal cord injuries and about 10,000 new accidents happenevery year, leaving the victims close to totally disabled. Yet thanks to acombination of highly skilled surgery and a brilliant medical breakthrough, fiveyears after his seemingly life-ruining accident, Israel is not only walking again,but back at work scuba-diving. First Isreal was shunted from doctor to clinic torehabilitation center, but nobody held out much hope for him. Then he got lucky.Isreal's grandfather had received treatment himself for a brain injury at theInternational Head and Spinal Injury Center in Tijuana, Mexico, under the directionof orthopedic surgeon Fernando C. Ramírez del Río, M.D., and German physician WolframKühnau, M.D. Dr. Ramirez and his surgical team (which included 2 neurosurgeon and 2anesthesiologists) undertook a series of delicate operations (including an initial10-hour surgery) to release, decompress, and remodel the dura sac (the membranecontaining the spinal nerves). This allowed Dr. Ramirez to transplant the the embryocells at the place of injury and degeneration, to regrow the damaged nerves in thespinal cord. Using live cell therapy in a procedure developed by Dr. Kühnau, Dr.Ramirez injected living cells (not cartilage) from shark embryos into Israel's durasac. With the live embryonic shark cells now growing inside his spine, Israel beganto regain sensation within a week. Isreal stayed at Dr. Ramirez' clinic for 2 months,receiving more injections and some physical rehabilitation training. Two years later,he was able to move about with a walker. Five years after his accident, Isreal is80-90% recovered, says Dr. Ramirez, and is diving for abalone once more. Theremaining 10-20% recovery will happen after a few more live cell injections have beencompleted. "There is a direct relationship between the frequency of the applicationsof shark embryo cells and the speed of recovery of the spinal cord," says Dr. Ramirez"The more frequent the treatments, the faster the mobility is restored." The factthat Isreal is walking again, or even feeling sensation in his limbs 5 years afterhis accident, is highly remarkable. What is even more surprising is Dr. Ramirez' calmstatement that had Isreal been able to remain for longer stays at the clinic, hisrecovery time could have been dramatically reduced. Since Isreal, Dr. Ramirez hastreated 7 more patients with disastrous spinal cord injuries, and their recovery timehas been charted in months, not years. "We call them the 'Baja Shark Team' because ofthe shark embryo cells we use in their treatment and because they are part of aunique group here in Baja," says Dr. Ramirez. Miguel Chillon, 25 years old, damaged avertebra in his upper back and lost all ability to use his legs. But after 20injections of shark embryo cells he started regaining sensation all the way down tothe tips of his toes. After 10 months of treatment (Miguel temporarily moved into Dr.Ramirez' clinic), Miguel was mobile again, with a walker, and went back to work as acar mechanic. Another man, named Raul Morales, came to Dr. Ramirez' clinic paralyzedby a gunshot wound that shattered several vertebrae at sternum level. After only 2months of treatment, with both reconstructive surgery and live cell injections, Raulwas able to flex his abdominal muscles. Results of this caliber are, strictlyspeaking, unheard of in the annals of neurosurgery and physical rehabilitation.According to conventional medicine, Dr. Ramirez' successes should not be possible."We are the first clinic I know of to do this anywhere," he comments. "Most doctorswill not touch the spinal cord, with surgery or any direct treatment. They saynothing can be done. We say something can be done, and we do it." The prices include follow-up (paraplegics, 1 year; quadraplegics, 2 years) with newlive cell injections every 2 weeks, once monthly physical rehabilitation sessionsincluding training family members in the procedures. Once every 3 months Dr. Ramirez'staff performs a nerve conduction recovery; once every 6-12 months, they do aMagnetic Resonance Imaging Scan to assess spinal cord damage. Recently, Dr.Ramirez has added two new materials to his spine-regrowing injections: nerve growthfactor and live cells from the brains of sharks. He's found this to be especiallyeffective in his work with quadriplegics, patients who have lost movement in all fourlimbs. Embryonic shark brain cells seem to speed up the recovery process by regrowingspinal tissue faster. Today four of Dr. Ramirez' patients are walking again, 2 with awalker, 2 on their own. Miracles of this sort are not inexpensive, however. Thetreatment for paraplegic Miguel cost about $60,000 (quadraplegic treatment costs$90,000), including his room and board, all surgeries and medicines. Yet that's stilla great deal less than the $25,000 to $50,000 paraplegics normally pay for long-termcare every year, sometimes for decades, and the nearly $200,000 a year people who arefully paralyzed have to pay. And anyway, you won't find Isreal, Miguel, or Raulcomplaining about the cost, underwritten by family and friends, for being able towalk again.

Kühnau, M.D., didn't invent live cell therapy,but he is rightly regarded as one of its subsequent pioneers. Cell therapy, as a means of promoting physical regeneration through injectinghealthy cells into the body, was developed in the 1930s by the Swiss physician, PaulNiehans, M.D. Dr. Niehans made his important discovery during a medical crisis. As part of hissurgery on a woman whose parathyroid glands (in the throat) had been damaged, Dr.Niehans prepared a minced portion of a thyroid gland (from a steer calf) with a saltsolution and injected it into the woman. Her acute symptoms eased up at once and sherecovered completely; in fact, she lived for another 24 years. Since Dr. Niehan's work, cell therapy has come to mean the injection of cellularmaterial from endocrine glands, organs, fetuses, or embryos of various animals (and,sometimes humans) to stimulate healing and to treat numerous degenerative diseases,including cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis, chronic fatigue, eczema, andretardation. Although today it's widely used throughout Europe (and Mexico), livecell therapy is not allowed in the U.S. Dr. Kühnau worked with Dr. Niehans until the latter's death in 1982. "In 41years of personal experience with over 35,000 patients, the author has never seen asevere side effect," Dr. Kühnau wrote in 1982 in his Live-Cell Therapy: My Lifewith a Medical Breakthrough. Then in 1987, Dr. Kühnau learned that a 10-year study showed it wasimpossible to induce cancer in healthy adult sharks, although, very rarely, cancercould be induced in sharks living in highly polluted water. So he began injectinghimself with solutions of shark embryo cells (not to be confused with cartilage fromfull-grown sharks). As he experienced no side effects after 3 months of self-testing(he didn't have cancer), Dr. Kühnau felt confident about trying it out on cancerpatients. Beginning in 1990, he injected shark embryo cells into the actual site oftumors and observed dramatic remissions in cancer. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide: "Cell Therapy," pp. 119-125. In effect, with 10 thymus glands, the blue shark has a perfect immune system, Dr.Kühnau says. The shark embryo cells, before they have differentiated intospecific immune or organ-building cells, represent "the highest quality cellsavailable." Once inside the human body, they act as pure raw material for regrowingtissue-for Dr. Ramirez' paraplegics, that's in the spinal cord, probably thelast place conventional doctors would expect to see rejuvenation.

When Dr. Marika von Viczay gets the lymph moving, breast cancer, back pain, prostatitis, fibromyalgia, and hormonal imbalances start to clear up. Aging is a slow poisoning, a lifetime accumulation of toxinsin the body, states Marika von Viczay, N.D., Ph.D., medical director of theIsis Health and Rejuvenation Center in Asheville, North Carolina. A primaryreason for this toxic buildup is a lymphatic system that does not do itsproper work of drainage, Dr. von Viczay says. She spent 12 yearsresearching the most effective way to restore lymph circulation before shewas ready to announce, in 1990, that Electro-Lymph-atic Therapy® (hercreation) and the use of Lymphtech (a unique device she invented), is theanswer. Dr. von Viczay uses light emissions from her Electro-Lymphatic device to move cloggedlymph in a cancer patient. Not only is lymphatic drainage a key to disease prevention andrejuvenation, Dr. von Viczay says it is the means to reverse and contributeto the natural healing processes of the human system for a host ofillnesses, including breast cancer, breast congestion, prostatitis,fibromylagia, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and lupus."You will always see a lymph system that is sluggish in its circulation inthese conditions," Dr. von Viczay says. People do not die so much fromcancer as from an excess of toxins and sludge-like lymph. Lack of exerciseand aging contribute to this clogging of the lymph nodes with toxins andproteins, says Dr. von Viczay. When the lymph fails to function properly,it becomes stagnant. The clear lymph fluid becomes cloudy and thick,changing from a condition like water to milk to yogurt then cottage cheese.Thickened, stagnant lymph overloaded with toxic wastes is the idealcondition for the onset of numerous illnesses, including cancer. "When thecollecting terminals become blocked, it's like a bottleneck: lymph startsbacking up in the system creating a toxic, oxygen-deprived environmentconducive to degeneration. It can develop into a tumorous condition." Toxiclymph can be stored for a long time in the system, just the way theintestines "store" fecal matter, often for years. This is not a healthycondition. "I have not seen a person who could not benefit from lymphtherapy." Moving the stagnant lymph flow is a key to rejuvenation. Theequipment used for Electro-Lymphatic Therapy resembles a flashlight with along, extensible housing. Noble gases such as argon and neon are stimulatedby an electrical current to emit a diffuse orange light through thetreatment "flashlight" head. Dr. von Viczay projects the light upon theskin, first concentrating on opening up the two drainage sites in the upperchest and neck where lymph dumps into the bloodstream. Lymph therapy is awhole-body approach. After these sites are opened, the natural flow of thelymph throughout the body is stimulated. The light breaks up the proteincongestion in the lymph, turning it from "cottage cheese" back to "milk;"then precise hand-delivered massage gets the lymph moving again, draininginto the bloodstream with its toxic wastes. Thus the treatment detoxifiesthe tissues by freeing up the lymph circulation. "Detoxification in thisway, by reestablishing free lymphatic circulation throughout the body, is avital part of any healing process," Dr. von Viczay explains. Once you clearup the lymph flow, which is an essential component of the immune system,you enhance the body's natural healing ability to help clear up nearly anyillness, as these cases show. "My entire health has improved dramaticallysince receiving the treatment and observing the follow-up therapy," says apatient named Alice. She had been a "candidate" for chemotherapy,radiation, and maybe mastectomy for breast cancer, but after light emissiontreatment her mammograms showed no trace of the cancer. Two holes in herright retina disappeared. Long-standing bowel problems, includinghemorrhoids, diverticulitis, and a post-surgical intestinal swelling, alldisappeared and her bowel movements became regular. After enduring backpain for 40 years and after having tried numerous treatments, includingsurgery, she found herself, finally, symptom-free. In addition, Alice wasable to abandon all allergy and hypertension medicines that she had neededfor years. See "Heal Sports Injuries and Regrow Damaged Tissue," Digest, No. 8, p. 36; "NaturalRelief From Fibromyalgia," this issue, pp 9-11 . Another woman had fibromyalgia, a condition of muscular andnerve pain throughout the body. After one 60-minute treatment, she wasvisibly better (her double chin started to recede) and her pain was greatlyreduced. Typically, patients with fibromyalgia get relief in one treatment.A nurse came to Dr. von Viczay with a mammogram showing a breast lump. Theday after her first Electro-Lymphatic Therapy treatment, there was no traceof the lump on a follow-up mammogram. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide, "Energy Medicine," pp. 192-204; "Detoxification Therapy," pp. 156-166. Dr. von Viczay regularly clears upbasal congested breast (breasts swollen and painful, with fibroid tissues,worse during menstruation) in only 2-3 treatments. Benign prostatitis maytake 6-10 treatments because a great deal of drainage throughout the bodyis required. In nearly every case of breast cancer Dr. von Viczay hastreated, there has been a lymph circulation blockage in the chest andunderarms and an excess of toxic fluid. "If you catch cancer in its earlystages, I believe lymphatic treatment can restore the body's metabolism andclear up the cancer," states Dr. von Viczay. Even though Dr. von Viczayfocuses on freeing up lymph circulation, her approach involves the entirebody. She assesses the patient's overall condition with a preliminary bloodtest. Then she gets them on a nutrient supplementation program and Chineseherbal medicines to strengthen the immune system, liver, and kidneys,central to the detoxification process. She also advises them to bounce on atrampoline for 10-15 minutes a day to stimulate lymph movement. There aremany interlinked conditions that contribute to sluggish lymph circulationand are improved by lymphatic treatment. These include hormonal imbalances;chronic constipation and intestinal blockages; muscle and tissue tensionand structural misalignment in the neck and shoulders; and mental confusionand emotional disorder. Wearing a bra can seriously hinder lymph drainagethrough the chest, adds Dr. von Viczay. The lymph system is the beginningand end of all disease, she states. "Once you get the lymph circulatingfreely again, this enhances recovery from any illness by reversing theslow, possibly lifetime, poisoning your body has endured."

Your Lymph System at a Glance The human body has 4 circulatory systems-blood, nerve impulses, lymph, andenergy (Qi). The lymphatic system includes a vast network of capillaries thattransport the lymph; a series of nodes throughout the body (primarily in the neck,groin, and armpits) that collect the lymph; and 3 organs, namely, the tonsils,spleen, and thymus gland, which produce white blood cells (called lymphocytes), vitalto the immune system. The space between cells occupies about 18% of the body. Fluid containing plasmaproteins, foreign particles, and bacteria that accumulate in these spaces betweencells, is called lymph. Thus the purpose of the lymphatic system is to collect thelymph and to return its contents to the bloodstream. More specifically, the lymphsystem collects waste products and cellular debris from the tissues. The lymph flows slowly upward through the body up to the chest (at the rate of 3quarts per 24 hours) where it drains into the bloodstream through two large ducts.Lymph also flows down from the head and neck into this drainage site. Unlike theheart, the lymphatic system does not have a pump to move it along; rather, itsmovement depends on such factors as muscle contraction or manual manipulation. Thelymph circulation is also a one-way circulation: it only returns fluid to thebloodsteam. The lymph system becomes particularly active during times of illness(such as the flu), when the nodes (particularly at the throat) visibly swell withcollected waste products.

Drink pure water and avoid fluorides at all costs-here's how and why. DRINK PURE WATER. Ever since the 1960s, Japanese scientists have been redefining whatgood water means. Today, if you ask any of an estimated 300,000 Japanesehow they spell good water, they'll tell you it's Microwater because theyuse it in their homes every day. Microwater is a new technology forfiltering and enhancing the quality of water by making the size of watermolecules smaller. It's already a $700 million a year industry in Japanand it is now being introduced to the U.S. under the "Ange" label with animpressive roster of health claims. Here's how it works. The Microwaterunit, hooked up to a faucet, uses a carbon-activated filter to removeimpurities from the water (including chlorine, fluoride, andtrihalomethanines). Then it injects a small electrical charge into thewater which separates the water into two kinds. Flowing out of one tubethere is an acidic water (with positive ions) useful for topical, externaluses; out of another tube comes alkaline water (with negative ions) perfectfor drinking. The unit makes this separation at the rate of one gallon perminute. The applications of the acidic portion of Microwater are numerousand quite surprising. According to the research and based on early reportsfrom African and South American users, acidic Microwater acts as a"super-oxidant" to disinfect and sterilize surfaces, skin, wounds, evensurgical instruments. It can kill bacteria and viruses; it can promote thehealing of acne, eczema, wounds, sore throats, and blisters and it canimprove skin quality. When used on foods, it can retard spoilage or act asa bacterial cleanser for meats; it can be used by dentists to sterilize themouth during dental procedures. You can even use it as a mouthwash when youbrush your teeth. Regarding the alkaline Microwater, here the smaller sizeof the water molecules shows its advantage. According to Hidemistu Hayashi,M.D., one of Japan's foremost Microwater researchers, alkaline Microwatercan act as a powerful antioxidant in the body, destroying harmful freeradicals, just as do vitamins A, C, and E, which are also antioxidants. Although the reports are still, strictly speaking, anecdotal, Dr. Hayashireports that he and his colleagues have seen improvements in diabetes,constipation, ulcers, blood pressure, allergies, circulation, migraines,obesity, osteoporosis, and menstrual irregularities after drinkingMicrowater every day for several months. The use of Microwater as apreventive medicine technology is reportedly expanding in Japanese clinicsand hospitals. Once Microwater gets absorbed by the body's cells, says Dr.Hayashi, it helps to dissolve acidic wastes that have accumulated thereover many years and reduces the chronic dehydration common in many people.In effect, thanks to the smaller molecular size, more water is absorbed bythe body and more water actually penetrates all the cells and tissues. Whenthe body has more water to work with (and, in this case, a more refinedform of it), it is able to better deliver nutrients to all the cells,tissues, and organs. The water tastes unusually smooth and soft, and due toits high concentration of negative ions (typical of pure mountain springs),it can be refreshing. "We are advancing the theory that the most effectiveand economical source for an antioxidant is ordinary tap water after it isfiltered and treated with a Microwater unit," says Dr. Hayashi. IfMicrowater's claims are true, one key to rejuvenation may be as simple asdrinking a glass of good water every day. A kitchen-model Ange Microwater unit costs about $995 and can be easily installed in 10 minutes.

Fluoride, a poison second in toxicity only to arsenic,has routinely been added to public drinking water and toothpaste since the1950s, despite mounting evidence of its multiple health hazards. Thefluoride compounds most commonly added to water are actually unrefinedtoxic waste products of phosphate fertilizer production. As early as 1953,scientists proved that fluoridated water did not reduce cavities inchildren, which had been the rationale for adding it to water and consumerproducts. Here's what is wrong with fluoride, according to the scientificresearch: Women who have had extensive exposure to fluoridated waterfracture their hips from osteoporosis 2.6 times more than the norm. Astudy of 500,000 cases proved a definite correlation between consumption offluoridated water and the incidence of hip fractures, specifically, 41%more among men, 27% more among women. Fluoride can produce cancer,transforming normal human cells into cancerous ones, even at concentrationsof only one part per million (ppm). Fluoridated water has produced 6times more bone cancer in males under age 20 than the norm. Fluoridecan increase the cancer-producing potential of other cancer-causingchemicals. Low levels of fluoride can increase the incidence of skincancers from 12-100%, sometimes in only days. As little as one ppm offluoride in water increased the tumor growth rate in mice by 25%. ANational Cancer Institute study with 14 years of data showed that theincidence of oral and throat (pharyngeal) cancer rises with increasedexposure to fluoride by as much as 50%, accounting for 8000 new cases peryear. Fluoride can decrease thyroid gland function by 30-40%. Prolonged fluoride intake of more than 3 ppm can produceosteosclerosis, a spinal column disease. A study of dog fetuses showedthat fluoride consumed by the mother gets deposited in the bones of thefetus, making them brittle. High fluoride levels are directly linkedto higher rates of mongoloid births; links are suspected with fetal heartabnormalities and stillbirths. Sustained intake of fluoridated wateris linked with serious dental problems, such as malocclusion, gingivitis,dental arch deformation, discolored and brittle teeth. Many childrenand adults experience allergic reactions to fluorides. Over-ingestionof fluoride produces dental fluorosis in children, a preventable butpermanent condition affecting at least 30% of children in which the dentalenamel fails to develop properly. Fluoride contributes to thebreakdown of collagen in bones, muscle, skin, cartilage, and lungs. Fluoride blocks blood antibody formation, causes premature aging,depletes the energy reserves of white blood cells, and promotes bone cancerdevelopment.

In a now classic study, John Yiamouyiannis, Ph.D., comparedthe cancer death rates over 30 years in 10 cities with fluoridated wateragainst 10 cities that were nonfluoridated. After 17 years of fluoridation,the cancer rate in those cities had climbed by 10%, primarily in peopleolder than 45. Despite the weight of scientific evidence, the AmericanDental Association will not endorse any dental product unless it containsfluoride. Meanwhile, even though fluoridated water has been outlawed in 14European countries plus Egypt and India as being too toxic for publichealth, the U.S. still regards up to 4 ppm as a "safe" level. California,often a trend setter for the nation, has made fluoridation of public watersupplies in that state mandatory, an ill-advised effort opposed by many.

American farmers have higher rates of several malignant forms of cancer, includingHodgkin's, leukemia, and prostate, presumably due to their steady exposure toagricultural pesticides, states the National Cancer Institute. Other causes includedrinking water contaminated with fertilizer runoff and inhalation of fumigants.

Thesecret to both longevity and rejuvenation, says Lim, is through tapping aprecious supply of "original energy, or Qi" in your body, and one way toreplenish this is through practicing a new set of Qigong exercises (calledXing Ming Gong) recently revealed to the world by Chinese masters and nowtaught, worldwide, by Lim. Original Qi is like a bank balance; it's fullwhen you're born, but a penny drops out every day, so that by the timeyou're 64, it's all used up. Jack Lim has produced an invigorating series of Qi Energy Music (including "Qi lifeforce energy" music for weight loss and relaxation) plus instructional tapes andvideos.

With these exercises, which take about 40minutes a day, done before sleeping, you can undo menopause, restorefertility, regrow hair, make the skin youthful again, and, if the claimsare to be believed, pretty much start reversing a great deal of chronic,degenerative disease. Lim says, "As soon as your body gets its original Qienergy back, it can start shedding sickness and rejuvenate. Every cellstarts moving into the vibrancy of youth again." Angina pain goes away,chronic fatigue starts to lift, eyesight improves, skin cancers fall off,and energy returns "tenfold," report its practitioners.

The thriving practice of Michael B. Schachter, M.D., is housed in a spaciousoffice building in Suffern, about 30 miles north of New York City.Schachter's practice is versatile and diverse, incorporating a range ofdisciplines including botanicals, chelation therapy, and Chinese medicine.His medical staff includes 4 physicians, a classical homeopath, anacupuncturist, 5 registered nurses, 5 lab technicans, 5 stress managementcounselors, and 3 lifestyle counselors, and the office of a biologicaldentist is next door. "My goal is to help my cancer patients choose atreatment path that makes sense to them, that they can follow withconviction and enthusiasm," says Dr. Schachter. "However, I believe that inmany cases patients who select only the alternative program and leave outthe more destructive elements of conventional treatment will do better." Here is a summary of Dr. Schachter's cancer protocols: SUBSTANCES TO AVOID.This includes tobacco smoke, alcohol, white sugar, white flour, caffeine,artificial sweeteners, preservatives, food additives, pesticides,fluoridated or chlorinated water, hydrogenated fats (margarine), aluminumas cookware and/or as a food ingredient. All doses are general guidelines. Cancer patients need an individually tailored prescription from their physician. FOODS TO EAT. Practice a low-fat,high-fiber, high complex carbohydrate diet based on whole grains, fruitsand vegetables, with modest amounts of nuts, seeds, fish, and range-grownchicken. If possible, consume 50% of the diet as raw foods, such as freshvegetable juices; use fertilized eggs sparingly, low-fat dairy products(free from bovine growth hormone) infrequently. VITAMIN A. In the form offish oil or oil-based capsules, take between 10,000 and 25,000 I.U. daily,or more under careful supervision. Also take 50,000 I.U. of beta carotenedaily. VITAMIN C. Patients take up to 10-12 grams daily or until boweltolerance is reached (producing diarrhea). VITAMIN E. A suitable dosage is800 I.U.s or more per day. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide, "Cancer," pp. 556-586; "Ortho-molecular Medicine," p. 402. B VITAMINS. Moderate amounts of the full Bcomplex-about 25-50 mg daily of each, plus folic acid in doses of 1000 mcgdaily. AMYGDALIN. Also called laetrile, a dosage between 500-1500 mg dailyin divided amounts is appropriate. MINERALS. These include calcium(800-2000 mg daily) and magnesium (400-1200 mg daily). Iron is used onlywhen the level of an iron-carrying protein (serum ferritin) is below 40 mcgper liter of blood. TRACE ELEMENTS. These include selenium (200-600 mcgdaily); zinc (15-30 mg, daily); copper (2-4 mg daily); manganese (5-20 mgdaily); molybdenum (100-1000 mcg daily); germanium sesquioxide (200-1000 mgdaily). COLONICS. Help detoxify the intestines with a cleansing enema orcolonics (in selected patients), followed by reintroducing friendly(probiotics) bacteria into the intestines, such as L. acidophilus. DETOXIFY THE LIVER. Use silymarin (an herb), choline, inositol, thioctic acid,barley grass, and a coffee-retention enema. HEAVY METALS. If there aresigns of heavy metal toxicity, use a chelating agent such as EDTA or DMPS,administered intravenously. The patient may need to have all mercury dentalamalgams removed. SWEAT MORE. The intense perspiring produced by sitting ina sauna or by exercising aerobically helps detoxify the body through theskin. FLAX SEED OIL. The omega-3 fatty acids have strong anti-cancereffects. Take 1-3 tablespoons daily of flax seed oil which contains 50%omega-3 fatty acid. EVENING PRIMROSE OIL. This contains gamma-linolenicacid, an omega-6 fatty acid effective against cancer (6-9 capsules daily,500 mg each). ENZYMES. These include pancreatic enzymes plus bromelain andpapaya for a powerful enzyme mix. The amounts for individuals vary too muchto give specific recommendations. BOTANICALS. These include Pau d'Arco,Flor-Essence (a type of Essiac containing burdock root, turkey rhubarbroot, sheep sorrel, and slippery elm bark), and Vitae Elixxir (herbaldrops; maximum dosage 6 drops, 3 times daily). SPECIAL FOODS. These itemsinclude "accessory food factors" that stimulate the immune system: choline,inositol, bioflavonoids, dimethyl-glycine (vitamin B15) and pycnogenol.Therapeutic foods are also useful, including: garlic, chlorella, spirulina,barley greens, wheat grass, green kamut, and maitake mushrooms. CARTILAGE.Take shark cartilage orally at the rate of about 1-2 g per 2.2 pounds ofbody weight for advanced cancers and as an enema (1-3 teaspoons for 6ounces of water). Bovine cartilage (from cows) may also be used at a dosagelevel of 3000 mg 3 times daily. ANTIOXIDANTS. These include coenzyme Q10(taken at the rate of 300-400 mg daily) and N-acetyl cysteine (500 mg, 2-3times daily). INTRAVENOUS INFUSIONS. Given at the rate of 1-3 times weeklyfor the first 1-2 months and including vitamin C (25 g), calcium,magnesium, potassium, zinc, selenium, manganese, chromium, glutathione, andheparin. After the vitamin C drip, we give amygdalin (3-9 g per dose). Onoccasion, we add vitamin B6 (pantothenic acid); hydrogen peroxide may beinjected separately; the vitamin B complex plus folic acid may be injectedintramuscularly to build energy. The immune system may be stimulated byinjections of Staphage Lysate ( a common bacterium called Staphylococcusaureus plus viruses or phages that attack the bacterium). EXERCISE.Activities such as walking, bike riding, or swimming are ideal, for atleast 25 minutes a session, repeated 3-4 times weekly. HORMONAL BALANCING.A series of hormones may be needed, including thyroid, DHEA, thymusextract, natural progesterone and estriol, a form of estrogen. DRUGS.Low-toxicity drugs may be used, such as hydrazine sulfate (for loss of bodymass) and Pamidronate (Aredia for bone metastasis). OTHER THERAPIES.Homeopathic remedies, acupressure, acupuncture, and magnet therapy, areall effective in strengthening the immune system. Viewing inspirationalvideos, studying mind-body books, practicing meditation, yoga, and guidedimagery help to "reframe the cancer experience" and to stabilize thepatient's thoughts and emotions.

However, I believe that inmany cases patients who select only the alternative program and leave out the moredestructive elements of conventional treatment will do better." - MichaelSchachter, M.D. A PATIENT'S VIEW- "Feeling Great!" Says Breast Cancer Patient After Dr.Schachter's Treatment When 42-year-old Louise Prager came to Dr. Schachter in February 1994, she hadbeen diagnosed with breast cancer which had spread to her lungs, liver, and bones.The previous June, her doctors had found first a huge liver tumor, then bone cancerin her ribs and spine. Louise underwent extensive chemotherapy and radiation, but hercondition only worsened. When Dr. Schachter started treating her, he put Louise on his multifaceted cancerrecovery program (described opposite), beginning with a mostly vegetarian diet,ample fresh, raw vegetable juices and moderate amounts of fish and range-grownchicken. Louise began taking a long list of supplements, including high doses ofvitamin C, amygdalin, coenzyme Q10, pycnogenol, bovine cartilage, and many others.Two months after her first visit, Dr. Schachter put her on a vitamin C and amygdalinintravenous drip. Two days after this, feeling improved, she decided to cancel anyfurther chemotherapy. By August, she was off all her pain medications and was regaining weight steadily.The blood tests proved she was making a major improvement and by September 1995, whenLouise's metastasized cancer was in remission, she told Dr. Schachter that she was"feeling great" thanks to his program.

What's the writing? That conventionalmedicine is failing to abide by its prime directive: first, do no harm. Youneed only read a national newspaper every day for a week to see theevidence. The once formidable conventional medicine estab-lishment isstarting to cave in on itself from the weight of its own ignorance, greed,and medical mistakes. It is, regrettably, also doing a lot of harm to itspatients and to the American economy. I've been studying the newspapersevery day and here are some of my gleanings: 50,000 American women areretaining lawyers for a probable class action suit against Wyeth-Ayerst,makers of the Norplant contraceptive patch. The women are complaining ofheadaches, weight gain, joint pains, strokes, paralysis, and other ills. Complications and side effects from prescription drugs and prescribingerrors cost the nation $76 billion annually; of this, $47.4 billion a yeargoes for 8.7 million hospital admissions to treat prescription drug-relatedproblems. Last year 6 million people received 87.3 millionprescriptions for Procardia and Adalat (calcium channel blockers) to treathigh blood pressure and angina; now experts believe these FDA-approveddrugs might cause heart attacks. Even though 2 million people aredying from tuberculosis every year and 1.75 billion people, worldwide, arepresumed infected, big drug companies are unwilling to develop any newdrugs because there isn't enough profit in it for them. After aFlorida surgeon mistakenly amputated the wrong leg of a patient, acolleague said 90% of the surgeons in Florida would have made the samemistake. A New York surgeon consulted the wrong x-rays of a patientthen mistakenly operated on the healthy lobe of a cancer patient's brain. California medical authorities seized a 6-year-old California boy(whose mother had been treating his leukemia with herbs) and forced him toundergo chemotherapy. A California woman received a $24 millionsettlement after she was left blind, paralyzed, and mute after a routinediagnostic test. A Nashville neurologist tried to murder hisneurosurgeon boss by lethal injection for failing to advance his career. The U. S. Justice Department filed charges against doctors andhospitals in Danbury, Connecticut, for conspiring to fix prices to keep outlower-priced managed-care companies. The list grows every day. Do you getthe picture? The FDA is supposed to look after our health, but it's clearthey abandoned that charter a long time ago. They have everythingbackwards. They approve Norplant, calcium channel blockers, and siliconebreast implants (which, within only a few years of approval, become gravelydangerous to health), and they harass consumers, suppress information, andconfiscate herbs, amino acids, and vitamins, which have never been shown tobe bad for health. And according to a new study released by the CompetitiveEnter-prise Institute (CEI) in Washington, D.C., the FDA may be thecancer patient's worst enemy. According to an article in The WashingtonTimes, ever since David Kessler, M.D., became FDA commissioner in 1990, theFDA has "severely suppressed" new information about cancer treatments. TheCEI polled 160 oncologists and found that 76% declare the FDA should notrestrict information about unconventional, or "off-label," uses of approveddrugs and devices. Yet in Kessler's "reign of censorship," the FDA hasstrenuously suppressed the free flow of information about new cancertreatments, about 70% of which involve off-label uses. The CEI poll alsoshowed that 47% agree that the FDA's 5-year lag time in drug approval costslives; 66% said that FDA policy has directly obstructed their ability toprovide top care to at least one cancer patient.

We don't need an FDA that acts so contrarily to the healthinterests of both patients and doctors. Its attitude towards alternativemedicine is atrocious and unacceptable. Talk about a cancer cure and you'llsee the FDA police at your clinic doorstep. But it's true: there are cancercures and we're going to talk about them. I've seen them. I've met thedoctors who produce them. Be sure to read the first installment of"Cancer-How Leading Physicians Successfully Treat It," in this issue. It'san advance excerpt from our groundbreaking new book on cancer cures, dueout in early 1996. The free flow of information about new techniques,substances, and treatments is not only the key to health, it is the onlyway we will rejuvenate the American medical system. "First, do no harm"means let's have informed doctors and patients, and to get that we need tourge Congress to rein in the FDA and to pass the Access to MedicalTreatment Acts in the Senate (S-1035) and House (HR-2019). This isimperative. We need to get out the message first and foremost thatalternative medicine does no harm. It costs less, has no costly sideeffects, in most cases gets better results, and can put the tools forrejuvenation, longevity, and robust good health in your hands. It can alsohelp keep the U.S. from going bankrupt over a $1 trillion-plus annualmedical bill. So I urge you to get with this powerful new grassroots,consumer-based movement to rejuvenate American medicine. And while you'reat it, consider taking a few prudent steps to look after your ownrejuvenation. You'll find plenty of how-to tips in this issue. You must getthe toxins out of your body if you want to stay healthy. Please, if youdon't pay attention to this, you'll become a statistic- another Americanwhose health was lost to some degenerative disease. So arm yourself withthe life-saving information in this Digest and start rejuvenating today. Itwon't harm you a bit. Alternative medicine does no harm, first and foremost. It costs less, has no costly side effects, in most cases gets better results, and can put the tools for rejuvenation, longevity, and robust good health in your hands. It can also help keep the U.S. from going bankrupt over a $1 trillion-plus annual medical bill. It is imperative this year that all Americans who believe in alternative medicine write their U.S. senators and representatives expressing supportof the Access to Medical Treatment Act, HR-2019 (House bill) and S-1035 (Senatebill).Both bills would allow licensed physicians to provide any form of alternativemedicine, even if not FDA approved, provided it does not injure the patient.Download your copy of these bills on the Internet at http://Thomas@loc.gov Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing WT01-B17-114IA043-000786-B041-165http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue09/i09-a08.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305114523 text/html 13189HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 11:42:53 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html Columns: Ask the Physician   [Go to the Table of Contents] Columns: Ask the Physician Your Questions Answered by Leading Alternative Medicine Physicians This Issue: ROGER JAHNKE, O.M.D., on Healing Cancer with Qigong Question: What's the relationship between Qi and cancer? There is a profound medicinewithin you. You can turn on and actually feel it. This is Qi, or subtlelife energy. I define Qi (pronounced chee) as a natural internalself-healing resource. The presence of healthy Qi is obvious: it is whatproduces radiance and vitality. Its absence is also obvious: fatigue, pain,and disease. Qigong means to work with or cultivate this Qi using a set ofexercises, postures, and movements. Qigong practice includes the 3Regulations-posture, breath, and mind. These have a positive effect on thestatus or quality of your Qi. If it is deficient, Qigong will help yougather more Qi from the environment and to circulate this energy in yourbody. If the Qi is stuck or blocked, Qigong will mobilize it, get it movingagain. Chinese medicine says these two conditions (Qi that is deficient ornot moving) are the two primary causes for most diseases. Further, Qigonghelps you to store the Qi in the bone marrow, which, in Western physiology,is where immune cells are produced. Obviously, anybody with a cancerdiagnosis needs to enhance the bone marrow's ability to produce more immunecells. Question: How does Chinese medicine define cancer? In cancer, there is either apervasive "toxic state," such as metastasized cancer, or "toxicaccumulations," which are tumors. The cancer patient's Qi has becomeseverely disordered; it can no longer optimally maintain and support thebody's functioning. In my 20 years of experience as a practitioner ofTraditional Chinese Medicine, I have seen Qigong both palliate and reversecancer. There is a great body of Qigong practice that is brought directlyto bear on cancer, especially a form called Guo Lin Qigong, named after anow famous Qigong teacher. Madame Guo Lin had cancer, used Westernmedicine, and was near death. Then she found that by adapting Qigong formsshe had learned from her grandparents, she was able to resolve her cancerin a dramatic way. Question: What happens, physiologically, when you practice Qigong? In thepractice of Qigong, there are many physiological mechanisms at work. First,Qigong accelerates oxygen distribution in the body at a time when yourmuscles are not rapidly using it as they would be in aerobics or running.This enables cells to begin their repair work. Second, there is atremendous benefit to the immune system. Qigong shifts the body into astate where the autonomic nervous system moves towardparasympathetic-sympathetic balance, which then supports and enhances theactivities of the immune system. Third, Qigong helps to turn on the body's"garbage disposal system" known as the lymph, thereby eliminating toxins,metabolites, and pathogenic factors from the tissues. You can see inWestern physiological terms that there is a profound medicinal effectcreated in the human body by doing these practices. A 50-year-old womanwith breast cancer told me that when she did Qigong, the tumor would gethot, then it would cool off when she stopped practicing. She feelsemphatically that these practices helped to sustain her health. Anotherwoman with cervical cancer said when she did Qigong, her metabolism seemedto change for the better and immediately bring her inner peace. These areliterally physiological responses. When you modify the movement, breath,and mind in Qigong, you mobilize an array of internal physiologicalresources. Both women were saying, in effect: I can actually feel thismedicine inside me turning on when I do Qigong. See "Move Your Lymph," this issue, pp. 22-24; "Jack Lim's Fountain of Youth," thisissue, p. 26. Question: Is there evidencethat Qigong has a positive effect on cancer? There is now considerablescientific research in China proving the effectiveness of Qigong as acancer treatment. In one study, 122 cancer patients (51 of whom hadmalignancies) practiced Qigong in a training class for 22 days. Theresearchers found that there were "curative effects" with both benign andmalignant cancers and that the longer the patients practiced the exercises,the stronger the benefits. They also noted that Qigong helped the survivorslive better and it enabled the 17 patients who eventually died, to do sowithout suffering. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide, "Qigong," p. 209. In a study involving 32 patients who practiced Qigongand underwent chemotherapy, physicians noted no deterioration in theirhealth; some showed better health than previously, including a stable whiteblood cell count. After a man with advanced throat cancer practiced Qigongin conjunction with chemotherapy, his symptoms cleared up; no cancer cellscould be found through biopsy and he remained cancer-free for the next 8years, when his case was published. A study of 65 cancer patients at theShanghai Qigong Institute showed that Qigong practice improved their rateof new immune cell production. For cancer patients at the start of thestudy, their rate was 27 compared to 76 for healthy, noncancerous patients;but after 3 months of Qigong, the cancer patients' rate had climbed to 42. Finally, scientists at the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine College,who have run a cancer rehabilitation clinic since 1987, stated that after 6months' treatment with Qigong, sometimes chemotherapy or radiation, andusually with Chinese herbs and psychological counseling, "most of thecancer patients have a relatively good curative effect." The rate of cancerrecurrence diminished, the immune activity of "natural killer cells"increased, appetite and confidence were enhanced, and the negative effectsof chemotherapy and radiation were reduced. Question: How long must I practice Qigong to get good results? I find thatif I teach a patient a specific practice and it's hard for her to do or shedoesn't bond with it in her imagination, the results will be disappointing.But if you help a person to find general practices she likes and will doregularly, that's the winner. Every person is unique, so the Qigongpractices must be tailored to each case. If you're able, do Qigong for atleast one 30-60 minute daily session, or even several times, if possible.If you're too ill or weak, then build up to this gradually. Generally, youneed to apply yourself in a vigilant and persevering manner until youexperience the benefits. I had a patient who had constant heartburn for 22years. She did Qigong once a week for a month, cured it, then hardlypracticed anymore. Some cases need lifelong practice. My multiple sclerosispatients will probably do Qigong for the rest of their lives because theyknow that when they do it they are multiplying and accelerating thepotential to keep their symptoms in remission. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide "Qigong," pp. 422-433; "Traditional Chinese Medicine," pp. 450-459; "Acupuncture," pp. 37-46; "Cancer," pp. 556-586. In China there is amarvelous organization called the Cancer Recovery Association with millionsof members. They get together every day in small groups in thousands oflocations to practice Qigong and encourage each other. They sing "HappyBirthday" on the anniversary of each person's cancer diagnosis. On my mostrecent trip to China, I met a man celebrating the 30th anniversary of hiscancer diagnosis-he was about 80, looked very healthy, and obviously hadsurvived his cancer. Question: Is there a simple exercise I can do to feel the Qi? The Chinesecall this "spontaneous Qigong." Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart,your knees slightly bent, your spine upright, shoulders relaxed. Start toflex or bounce at the knees; then, still bouncing, shift your weight backand forth from your right to left legs. Keep your breath deep, full, andrelaxed. Begin to snap all of your fingers, flipping each one past yourthumbs. Then, still bouncing and finger-snapping, twist at your waist, tothe right, then to the left. Keep doing all this, plus as you exhale, makeit a sigh of relief. Do 5 of these sighs in a slow and relaxed manner. Nowclose your eyes, turn your attention inward, and feel that buzzing,humming, or tingling sensation that's in your hands, legs, and body. Thisis Qi. You are literally feeling the activity of the profound medicine youhave produced within yourself.

Kellas, Ph.D., and Andrea S. Dworkin, M.S. on Surviving the Toxic Immune Syndrome Most of the causes of disease are actually within your control, saysthis bold California clinic. So when you rid your body of toxins, avoidmedical interventions, and change how you live and eat, you could findyourself healthier than ever. At Comprehensive Health Centers, our focus is to help ourpatients get their lives back on track by getting to the root causes oftheir illness. The idea for this approach evolved out of the medicalproblems I (William Kellas) faced in my twenties when I developed acrippling autoimmune disease called ankylosing spondylitis. At the time, mydoctors told me I would probably remain in a wheelchair the rest of mylife. I refused to accept this verdict and immediately started to searchfor answers. I had all my mercury amalgam fillings removed; I flushed allthe parasites out of my intestines; I did chelation therapy to remove themercury from my system; I had my dental bite balanced; I had whiplash andnose injury problems corrected. It took me about 10 years to regain myhealth, but that's because I had to piece it all together on my own. Nowthat we know what's required, we can produce the same results in ourpatients in less than a year. My study of healing methods for myself led meto the philosophy of our clinic: always look for the root, underlying causeof any illness. Along the way, I met other practitioners with healthproblems who were similarly searching for alternative methods of healing. "We fit in where our patients want to be, because all of our doctors ortheir families were also once patients," says Gary Shima, M.D., our medicaldirector. We estimate that 82% of the causes of disease are within your control: improving your environment, avoiding medical interventions, and changing how you live. A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF ILLNESS Our principle is this: What you don't seemay be sinking your ship. This ship, of course, is your body and health.Disease occurs after your immune system breaks down; this happens as theresult of an onslaught of toxic suppressors and the accumulation ofbiochemical deficiencies, all of which allow unwanted microorganisms toinvade and flourish in the body. The result is chronic illness, which wedefine as a health problem you've had for 120 days or more. Have youalready been to doctors and heard them say, "You're not really sick," yetyou know you're not well? Most chronic patients we see have consulted atleast 10 physicians and still haven't received lasting help. Getting to theroot causes rather than just aiming for relief is the main characteristicof comprehensive health care and the only way to get real help. There aremany steps on a patient's road to bad health. We call these cumulativesteps "primary toxic suppressors." They include such factors as mercurydental amalgams, chemical toxins, surgeries, electromagnetic radiation,poor nutrition, and structural problems. These in turn adversely affect theimmune system, the key to your body's optimal functioning, and produce whatwe call the Toxic Immune Syndrome. This is an overall multifacetedcondition of weakness and susceptibility that sets up a domino effect ofpoor health. Here's how it works. See "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome," pp. 616-624; "Biological Dentistry," pp. 80-96 THE ILL-HEALTH DOMINO EFFECT Let's say you have a structural problem withyour back, spine, neck, or overall posture. This restricts the nerve supplyto your organs and digestive system; as a result, poor digestion can leadto putrefaction of food materials in your intestines. From this, you cannext develop food sensitivities as healthy food becomes toxic. Add to thisthe negative influence of antibiotics, from dental work, surgery, ormedications, and you begin knocking out the beneficial bacteria in yoursystem that should be screening out harmful influences. You may experiencesymptoms such as pain, stiffness, fatigue, infection, weight gain,allergies, or headaches. These symptoms may vary according to your weakestgenetic link or vulnerability. Now you are open to microbial invasion andlong-term internal infections. This can then throw your hormonal system outof balance, blocking the smooth action of your digestive and lymph systems.As a result, toxins overload your body's natural filters and you are unableto detoxify. In effect, your body becomes poisoned from within and beginsto develop illnesses in the various organs, such as jaundice, urinaryinfection, and constipation. Your body is now more vulnerable topetrochemicals in your food and environment, leading to, for example,chronic fatigue, reduced sperm count, or infertility. Following this, yourtissues become inflamed and more deeply-set illnesses develop, such ascancer, fibromyalgia, and edema. All of this then feeds back to your brain,producing contractions in the membranes covering your brain and spinalcord, which then misalign the vertebrae and skull. Dental problems,produced by mercury amalgam fillings, electrical charges from metallicdental work, and misalignments in the jaw, are major players in asurprising number of health conditions. Other dental-related problems thatcontribute to this negative domino effect include whiplash, which canimbalance the bite; cranial sutures out of alignment; patient sensitivityto dental materials; bite imbalance; and infected, toxic root canals. Herethe medical and dental branches should work together on diagnosis andtreatment of these problems. See "Dentistry-Biological & Neural," pp. 107-110; "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome," p. 87. The good news about this circle of ill effectsis that it also shows us how to regain health by way of reversing thestages in the toxic loop, although you'll need to take several steps atonce to see improvement. When you clear up one problem, this enables theother parts of the interrelated system to function better, which in turnhelps to clear up further problems all the way around the circle. To beeffective, a clinic must help stop the influx of toxins and to remove themfrom all the body systems, and to support the body nutritionally andbiochemically in healing disease. The Centers for Disease Control dividethe causes of illness into these categories: heredity, 18%; environment,19%; medical intervention, 10%; and lifestyle, 53%. This means that 82% ofthe causes of disease are within your control: improving your environment,avoiding medical interventions, and changing how you live. This 82% is thefocus of our clinic treatments. HEALTH RETURNS IN BABY STEPS Our philosophy is that chronic degenerativedisease, which takes years to develop and show its effects, is bestprevented and treated by comprehensive health care, along the linesoutlined above. Our patient care is coordinated with all our differentpractitioners, who share a similar philosophy of healing and who have equalaccess to the patient charts and test results. Comprehensive health careremoves the obstacles to the body's natural healing processes, but it'simportant to remember that healing usually occurs as a series of "babysteps." As it took a long time to reach your present state of ill health,it will probably take some months, possibly years, to restore itcompletely. Even so, we are getting dramatic improvements in people withfibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and multiple sclerosis in less than a year. William R.

THE 6 STEPS TO HEALING 1 Eliminate the intake of toxins and cleanse all toxic suppressors from the body. First, you must stop bombing your body with more toxins. Toxic suppressors caninclude heavy metals (mercury, aluminum, cadmium, copper, lead, arsenic, nickel);chemicals (carcinogens, fluoride, chlorine, food additives); and radiation(electromagnetic, microwave, nuclear, solar, x-rays, computer screens). They can alsoinclude ingested hormones, steroids, drugs, alcohol, toxic water, caffeine, processedfoods, inhaled or absorbed pesticides, perfume, smog, nicotine from cigarettes,noise, and stress. See "Heavy Metal Toxicity," pp. 927-928; "Cadmium Toxicity," pp. 896-897; "Chemical Poisoning," pp. 901-902. You have to rearrange your lifestyle to stop the flow of toxins into your bodythrough faulty diet and environmental exposure. The toxic suppressors must beeliminated before medications and other natural approaches will have much permanenteffect. 2 Detoxify the body and unblock detoxification pathways. Even though you have reduced the entry of new toxins into your body, old toxinsare still in your bloodstream, lymph nodes, and organs. See "Ask the Physician," Digest, No. 7, pp. 27-28. See "Move Your Lymph," this issue,pp. 22-24. Our treatments involve chelation therapy (to remove metals from the blood);intravenous vitamin C (to detoxify the blood); sauna (to remove chemicals); anddetoxification diets (to remove allergens and yeast-supporting conditions). We alsoprescribe fasting, organ flushes, enzymes, amino acids, physical therapy, lymphdrainage, constitutional water therapy (to cleanse the lymph system), exercise, andcolonics, and provide counseling for patient's emotional and spiritual issues. See "Detoxification Therapy," pp. 110-112. See "Chelation Therapy," pp. 126-133; "Fasting," pp. 224-231; "Enzyme Therapy," pp. 215-223; "Hydrotherapy," pp. 281-298; "Colon Therapy," pp. 143-148; "Detoxification Therapy," pp. 156-166. 3 Provide the body with biochemical and nutritional support. Now that the cleansing is completed, it's time to support your body's naturalrestoration and defense. To support the body's biochemistry, we prescribe minerals,enzymes, vitamins, pure water, oxygen therapy, amino acids, herbs, and essentialfatty acids. See "Diet," pp.167-191; "Nutritional Supplements," pp. 385-397; "Orthomolecular Medicine," pp. 398-404; "Oxygen Therapy," pp. 412-421, 412-421. 4 Align and rebalance all body structures. We use chiropractic, osteopathy, and dental work to rebalance the nervous system; trigger points to realign the electrical system; gamma globulin, cyclic AMP, transferfactor, allergy antigens, and low dosage immunotherapy to support the immune system;Feldenkrais, soft tissue and lymph manipulation, and craniosacral work to rebalancethe muscles and their movements. We emphasize how important dental work is to thisprocess. When you rebalance the bite and remove the toxins from the mouth, you havealready won 60% of the detoxification "battle." See "Bodywork," pp. 97-118. See "Feldenkrais," pp. 126-130; "Rolfing," pp. 211-214. 5 Eliminate harmful microorganisms and disease-producing parasites from the body. Once the primary suppressors and toxins are removed from your environment and yourbody, it's time to go after the secondary suppressors, or opportunisticmicroorganisms. Harmful microbial organisms within your system, such as bacteria,worms, protozoans, fungi, parasites, and viruses must be flushed out. We've foundthat certain conventional drugs (Flagdyl and Fasigyn) work best, in conjunction withtetracycline, acidophilus, and sometimes an herbal formula and/or bismuth gel, givenover a 21-day intensive program. In addition, you must kill the parasites outside thebody, in the skin, under the nails, and in the hair; for this we use iodine bathstaken every 5 days.

Ever since she watched her own 4-year-old daughter get over ulcerative colitis 40 years ago, Gottschall has been restoring intestinal health for hundreds of sufferers. She calls her approach the Specific Carbohydrate Diet and it's based on the pioneering work of the late Sidney V. Haas, M.D. According to Gottschall, the diet's success rate is excellent, achieving an 80% recovery rate for Crohn's disease and 95% for diverticulitis. Patients following this diet for as little time as 3 weeks will see marked improvement, says Gottschall. In brief, the cause of the various intestinal illnesses listed above is animbalanced relationship between carbohydrates and intestinal microbes. Whenthe system gets unbalanced, bacteria multiply and food absorption declines,producing a "vicious cycle" that can last for years and produce ill health.The body becomes unable to digest carbohydrates because of microbialovergrowth and toxins; then, numerous illnesses develop out of this alteredintestinal milieu as the system grows unable to digest most of the standardWestern diet. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide: "Gastrointestinal Disorders," pp. 680-690; "Diet," pp. 167-191. Here are the highlights of Gottschall's Specific CarbohydrateDiet. "It is unwise to undertake this regimen unless you are willing tofollow it with fanatical adherence," Gottschall advises. Proteins to Avoid:Processed meats, breaded or canned fish, processed cheeses, smoked orcanned meats. Proteins Allowed: Fresh or frozen meats, poultry,fish, eggs, natural cheeses, homemade yogurt, dry curd cottage cheese. Foods to Avoid: All cereal grains in any form, including flour;potatoes, yams, parsnips, chick peas, bean sprouts, soybeans, mungbeans,faba and garbanzo beans, seaweeds. Vegetables Allowed: Most fresh orfrozen (but not canned) vegetables and legumes. Fruits Allowed: Fresh,raw, dried, or cooked, but not canned (except in their own juices). Not Permitted: Fluid milk of any kind or dried milk solids; buttermilk oracidophilus milk; commercially prepared yogurt and sour cream; soymilk;instant tea or coffee, coffee substitutes; beer; cornstarch, arrowroot, orother starches; chocolate or carob; bouillon cubes or instant soup bases;any products made with refined sugar; agar-agar, carageenan, or pectin;ketchup; ice cream, molasses, corn or maple syrup; flours made fromlegumes; baking powder; medications containing sugar; all seeds. By rigidlyfollowing this diet for 3 months, "many cases of celiac disease, spasticcolon, and diverticulitis appear to be cured at the end of a year,"Gottschall says.

A special CNN poll of 1000 American men aged 18 and older, published in August 1995,revealed that 8 out of 10 men rank heart disease as their biggest health worry. Closebehind, 76% ranked stress, 74% prostate cancer, and 67% colon cancer and AIDS. How to Be Up When You Need to Be Male erectile dysfunction, or theinability to achieve a full erection during sexual arousal, affects anestimated 10-20 million men, including 25% of men older than 50. For menaged 50 and older, in 85% of cases, organic factors such as vasculardisease and atherosclerosis of the penile artery are the cause of erectileproblems, states naturopathic physician Michael T. Murray, N.D. Here's whatDr. Murray recommends: Yohimbe Bark. This herb contains yohimbine, asubstance that increases blood flow to erectile tissue. Studies indicateyohimbe produces results in 34-43% of cases, although it has occasionalunpleasant to moderately serious side effects. Specific dosage depends onthe yohimbine content of the supplement. Yohimbe is available in two products: For Men Only II (containing damiana, ginseng, andyohimbe), from Only Natural; tel: 800-866-2887; and as Yohimbe Tonic[TM] from LifeEnhancement Products, P.O.

A French study involving 262 men witherectile problems showed that at a daily dose of 1-1.5 g of Muira paumaextract, it took only 2 weeks for 62% of the patients to see improvementsin erections. Gingko Biloba. In Europe, over 5 million prescriptionsfor Ginkgo are written annually for many health problems. In a study, 60male patients with "erection failures" took 60 mg daily for 12-18 months;improvement was noted in 6-8 weeks and after 6 months of this treatment,50% of the men had regained their erectile potency. Dr. Murray recommends120 mg daily, in 3 doses of 40 mg each. Avoid: Prescriptionmedications that lower blood pressure such as beta-blockers and calciumchannel blockers and long-term alcohol and tobacco consumption areassociated with erectile problems. Embrace: Optimal nutrition througha whole-foods, low-fat diet, with adequate high-quality fish, chicken, andturkey protein is preferable. Niacin (1500-3000 mg daily) will help tolower cholesterol. "Virility foods" high in zinc, such as liver, oysters,yams, wheat germ, spinach, oranges, brown rice, nuts, seeds, legumes, andgarlic, are a good idea, says Dr. Murray, as is vigorous exercise for 60minutes, 3-4 days a week.

A new Healthy Eating Index study of 4000 Americans, conducted by the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, reveals that 88% of the population does not get good grades forproper nutrition. More than 80% eat too much saturated fat and too little fruits,vegetables, and fiber-rich grains. The worst eaters are aged 15-39. In all, theAmerican diet of the 1990s achieves only 63% of what the USDA considers goodnutrition. Canceling Your Next Cold or Flu The next time your throat, nose, or lungstell you they're about to launch a cold, fever, sore throat, or fluinfection in you, here is a proven way to cancel them in the first fewdays, according to Rob Krakovitz, M.D. Have the Soup That Saves YourLife. To 1 quart of water, add garlic (7-10 cloves, peeled, cut in half),ground cayenne pepper (1/8 teaspoon), 1 bay leaf, olive oil (1 teaspoon).Boil the broth, then simmer with lid on for 10 minutes, then remove fromheat; add fresh ginger root (7 slices), re-lid and let simmer another 5-10minutes. Strain the broth, then drink 1-2 quarts daily in 1-2 sittings. Take Vitamins. Take the following once every hour for 10 doses in asingle day: Hypoallergenic vitamin C (1000 mg per hour; discontinue forthe day if you get diarrhea.) Mycellized vitamin A (30 drops, 2 timesdaily mixed in juice; do this for 4 days, then use 3 drops, 2 times dailyuntil you're feeling well.) For children, use 1/2 these doses. A mycellized vitamin (from mycel, which means "fat") means it is formulated toresemble a small, highly absorbable fat droplet, ready to be absorbed by the mucosaunder the tongue. The result is that you need less; for vitamin A, you need only 1drop a day; for vitamin E, about 10-15 drops. For a source of mycellized vitamin A, contact: Ethical Nutrients, 971 Calle Negocio, San Clemente, CA 92673; tel: 714-366-0818; fax: 714-366-0853. Avoid: Alcohol, dairy products, cold medications. Embrace: Rest and sleep-getas much of these as possible. Drink extra amounts of orange and grapefruitjuice and herbal teas. Gargle: For a sore throat, gargle every 2 hoursusing warm salt water (10 ounces of pure water plus one teaspoon salt).

Natural Relief from Fibromyalgia Fibromalygia Syndrome is a poorlyunderstood disorder that primarily affects women between the ages of 30 and50. Typical symptoms include widespread muscle pain, debilitating fatigue,sleeping disorders, reduced coordination, mental confusion, diarrhea orconstipation. Physicians, who have known of fibromyalgia since 1904, tendto classify it as a painful arthritic condition and prescribe variouspainkillers but they see no cure in sight. Leaner men live longer, says a Harvard School of Public Health poll of 19,000 men. Those men with the lowest mortality rate weighed 20% below the average for their age while men whose weights were 20% above the ideal body weight had a 2.5 times higher risk for cardiovascular disease. However, that's not the wayalternative medicine practitioner Christiane Northrup, M.D., sees it. InDr. Northrup's view, fibromyalgia has an emotional element such thatnegative feelings of despair and resentment, from job stress, familyproblems, or even childhood memories, get "trapped" in the muscles andconstrict them. To release these trapped emotions from the muscles, Dr.Northrup recommends: Gladly Exercise. Even though it seems you can'tmove your muscles, you must keep moving every day; your pain will actuallydiminish as you build a consistent exercise program. Rest and Relax.Sleep 8-10 hours nightly, go to bed before 10 pm and get up at the sametime every morning. Meditate. Even 15 minutes a day will help balanceyour brain chemicals, or neurotransmitters. Balance the Prostaglandins. Keep your prostaglandin hormone levels in balance by eatingno more than 500 calories per meal; keep your diet low in refinedcarbohydrates and fats, and moderate in protein. QUICK DEFINITION: Prostaglandin is a hormone-like fatty acid, produced in the uterus, brain, kidneys,and semen, that produces a wide range of effects including smooth muscle function. Increase Your Serotonin. Use blue-green algae in a progressive, 4-week supple-mentationprogram to enhance levels of this important neurotransmitter. First week:Take 2 Cell-Tech digestive enzymes with Alpha Sun or Omega Sun blue-greenalgae capsules before breakfast and lunch. Also take 2 capsules ofacidophilus with algae 30 minutes before breakfast. Second week: Add tothis one capsule of Alpha Sun and Omega Sun before breakfast. Third week:Continue this while increasing the algae intake to 2-4 capsules 3 timesdaily with meals. Fourth week: Continue with this regime, increasing thealgae if necessary. This will increase your serotonin levels and have anantidepressant effect. A study of the records of 4000 patients in Boston hospitals revealed that 70 sufferedmedical complications from receiving the wrong drug or dose. With 200 patients,prescription mistakes were barely caught in time. One-half of the errors inprescriptions are made by doctors and a single drug complication can cost the patientanother $2000 in fees, says the Journal of the American Medical Association. Use Supplements. Take magnesium (300-600 mgdaily); malic acid (1200 mg daily, divided into 3 doses, building to 2400mg if pain persists after 2 weeks); all the B vitamins (100 mg each,daily); manganese (10-20 mg). For Cell-Tech brand(Alpha Sun and Omega Sun) blue-green algae, call Grain & Salt Society, P.O. Box DD,Magalia, CA 95954; tel: 800-867-7258; fax: 916-872-5524. For Cell-Tech, tel: 800-927-2527. For malic acid, contact: Emerson Ecologics, 18 Lomar Park Drive, Pepperell, MA01463; tel: 800-654-4432; fax: 800-718-7238. You should notice a difference and goodresults in 3-6 weeks, advises Dr. Northrup. A study by Guy D. Abraham,M.D., and Jorge D. Flechas, M.D., showed that 15 patients withfibromyalgia who took magnesium (300-600 mg daily) and malic acid(1200-2400 mg daily) experienced subjective improvement in their symptomswithin the first 48 hours. Over an 8-week period of supplementation, theirdegree of muscle tenderness and pain dropped from 19.6 to 6.5, according tomedical scores. British naturopath Harald Gaier notes that 21 of 26fibromyalgia patients experienced reduced pain and general improvementafter receiving massage, and that 24 patients taking one of threehomeopathic remedies (Arnica, Bryonia, or Rhus tox) also had improvement,as did 35 patients receiving electro-acupuncture.

European studies indicate that semen quality in men has declined by 50% since 1945,possibly reflecting an overall decrease in male fertility. A French study of 1351 menshowed that both the concentration of sperm and its quality declined in the last 20years and may be related to environmental pollution. A Belgian study of 360 menrevealed that the amount of "grade A" quality sperm likely to fertilize eggs hasdropped from 53% to 33% since the 1970s. -SOURCE: Medical and Legal Briefs: A Referenced Compendium of Chemical Injury, Vol. 1, No. 1, July/August 1995.

ANXIETY. Sometimes the underlying factor in a complicated caseof severe low blood sugar, depression, chronic allergies, grand malseizures, and heart palpitations is a mental symptom such as anxiety,according to naturopaths Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman, N.D., and RobertUllman, N.D. They treated a man, aged 40, who had these symptoms and whohad been on Dilantin for 2 years to control his seizures. They prescribedhomeopathic Argentum nitricum (silver nitrate, 6C, three times daily). Onemonth later he was feeling much improved, with an easing-up of manysymptoms. After 6 months, having taken a stronger potency of Argentumnitricum (30C) but less frequently, he cut back his Dilantin regimen from300 mg daily to 100 mg every 4 days. Two years after beginning treatment,"he feels really well," states Dr. Reichenberg-Ullman. "He can no longerremember most of what bothered him before."

Enzyme therapistLita Lee, Ph.D. successfully worked with a man, aged 75, who, in effect,had been unable to breathe easily for six decades, since he first came downwith asthma at age 14. He had to use an inhaler 4-6 times daily; inaddition, he had arthritis, herpes on his legs, arms, and neck, and sugarintolerance. For his asthma, Dr. Lee suggested an herbal formula includingOregon grape root, safflower petals, red clover tops, coleus forskohlii,and digestive enzymes. For his arthritis, she gave him a formulacontaining yucca, alfalfa juice concentrate, safflower petals, oat straw,and glucosamine sulfate; for the herpes, Dr. Lee gave him the food enzymeslipase and amylase plus fatty acids; and for the sugar intolerance, Dr. Leegave him a digestive formula containing the enzymes protease, amylase,lipase, cellulase, sucrase, lactase, and maltase. "Reach for these formulasinstead of your inhaler the next time you feel an asthma attack coming on,"Dr. Lee advised him. She expected it would take many weeks before he hadgood results. However, two days after starting this enzyme program, he toldDr. Lee he was no longer using the inhaler. After 3 weeks, his arthritisand herpes symptoms were much improved and his need even for the enzymeswas minimal.

Philpott, M.D., reports excellent results fromusing magnet therapy for atherosclerosis resulting from diabetes. A man,aged 70, with atherosclerotic heart disease, underwent a multiple bypassoperation. Two years later his heart pain returned, leaving him unsteady onhis feet and subject to disorientation in familiar surroundings; his speechgrew thick and he became chronically depressed. Dr. Philpott had him sleepwith the negative pole of several magnets (ferrous ceramic, 2000-4000 gaussin strength) placed at the crown of his head. The man also wore a magnetstrapped to his skin over his heart during the day. Within a week, hissymptoms improved and after one month of this treatment, he had no heartpain, his balance returned, his speech became distinct, and his depressionwas gone. Through this method, "the mental confusion, disorientation, anddepression of cerebral atherosclerosis is remarkably reduced or evencompletely relieved," reports Dr. Philpott.

CANCER. Magnet therapy can produce dramatic turnarounds in certain kinds ofcancer, states William H. Philpott, M.D. Dr. Philpott treated a woman, aged71, who had a basal cell carcinoma on her forehead as a result of intensesunburn. Every night, Dr. Philpott had the woman sleep with a 12,300-gaussmagnet placed, negative side down, directly on the cancerous area. In 6weeks, this pathological spot had dried up and peeled off without a scar,reports Dr. Philpott. Five years later there was still no reappearance ofthe cancer. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide: "Cancer," pp. 556-586; "Magnetic Field Therapy," pp. 330-338; "Oxygen Therapy," pp. 412-421. Dr. Philpott treated another woman, aged 75, who had a melanomatumor on her forehead. Dr. Philpott had the woman wear a 3950-gauss magnetover the cancerous growth for 24 hours a day for 3 months. After one monthof this treatment, the tumor stopped growing and its soreness eased up;then the tumor started to recede and dry up; after 10 weeks, it literallyfell off her forehead. According to Dr. Philpott, magnet therapy achievesthese results because it applies a negative pole magnetic field to thecancer. This changes the pH of the cells, which are too acidic, making themmore alkaline, which is favorable to healing. In addition, the negativemagnetic field releases oxygen bound up in the acids of the unhealthycells. The oxygen then diffuses throughout the cells, restoring health andvitality.

Danish reflexologist Leila Eriksen assembled 20 women betweenthe ages of 30 and 60 who had endured chronic constipation for an averageof 24 years. These patients had bowel movements no more frequently thanonce every 4 days. Over a 7-week period, each woman received 15 reflexologytreatments lasting 30 minutes each. No other dietary, life-style, ortreatment programs were used. At the end of the program, the averagefrequency of bowel motion was 1.8 days, or more than twice as frequently asbefore. Previously, 40% of the patients had experienced pain duringdefecation; now none of them had pain. In addition, 50% of the women hadnormal stool consistency whereas none had this before; 85% reportedimproved digestion; 55% were able to reduce their use of laxatives; and 80%reported that other health conditions had also changed for the better.

A woman, aged 39, with Type II diabetes and exceedingly highblood sugar, was taken off insulin only two days after being on a specialdiet and supplement program, reports Robert C. Atkins, M.D. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide: "Diabetes," pp. 647-656; "Nutritional Supplements," pp. 385-397; "Ortho-molecular Nutrition," pp. 398-404. She wasconstantly hungry, always exhausted, craved sweets, and weighed 335 pounds.A previous doctor had put her on 100 units of daily insulin and a low-fat,high-carbohydrate diet, but this worsened her condition. Then Dr. Atkinsput her on a special low-sugar, low-carbohydrate diet, emphasizing animalprotein and green salads. He prescribed the following daily supplements tohelp stabilize her metabolism: vitamin B6 (150-300 mg); another vitamin B6compound called pyridoxine alpha-ketoglutarate (1500-3000 mg); niacinamide(750 mg); vitamin C (2000-4000 mg); vitamin E (400-800 IU); vitamin B12(500-1000 mcg); cozenzyme Q10 (90-150 mg); borage oil (900-1500 mg);chromium picolinate (400-800 mcg); magnesium (taurate or aspartate, 400-600mg); vanadyl sulfate (15-30 mg); zinc (orotate or chelate, 100-150 mg);manganese (20-30 mg); copper (3 mg); selenium (200 mcg); plus dosages ofaloe vera, fenugreek, bitter melon, and Gymnema sylvestre herbs. Dr. Atkinsoften adds biotin (9 mg) to the nutrient list for lowering blood sugar. See "Control Your Diabetes Naturally with Diet," Digest, No. 8, p. 9. After one day on this treatment, the woman no longer required insulin shotsand her blood sugar level dropped from 700 to 110. Her energy picked up,her sugar cravings went away, and she lost 22 pounds in the next 7 weeks.In effect, she no longer had diabetes.

Worldwide, acute childhood diarrhea is the leading cause ofillness and death in children. According to a clinical study of 92 childrenin Nicaragua, the use of three homeopathic remedies produced a 15% decreasein the duration of diarrhea, reports Jennifer Jacobs, M.D., of theUniversity of Washington at Seattle. This decrease was equivalent to almosta full day of sickness. Although 18 different homeopathic remedies weretested, Podophyllum, Chamomilla, and Arsenicum album were given in 60% ofthe cases. -SOURCE: "Treatment of Acute Childhood Diarrhea with HomeopathicMedicine," Jennifer Jacobs, M.D., Pediatrics, Vol. 93, No. 5, May 1994, pp.719-725.

Schmidt, M.D., ofCologne, Germany, 40 patients, average age 60 years, with high bloodpressure and "stable coronary insufficiency," took doses of hawthorn(Crataegus) extract at the rate of 200 mg, 3 times daily for 8 weeks. Meditation, hypnosis, and biofeedback can be effective treatments for people withinsomnia, tension headaches, arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, or persistent lowerback or cancer-related pain, said a 12-member panel of the National Institutes ofHealth in October 1995. The panel urged a wider use and acceptance of theseapproaches because so many patients have little success with conventional drug andsurgery treatments. The panel further encouraged insurance companies to reimburse providers for these services. Before taking the hawthorn, they tired easily and had diminished physicalability, but after 8 weeks on hawthorn, these symptoms occurred 42% fewertimes. Blood pressure dropped from 171/115 to 164/110 and the patients'ability to tolerate the heart stress of physical work increased. In arelated study by German physicians K. Bödigheimer, M.D., and D. Chase,M.D., 36 patients (average age 61) who had angina, a history of heartattacks and arrhythmia, and who were 20% overweight, took 300 mg daily ofhawthorn extract for 28 days. As a result, their cardiovascular health andperformance improved, both during the stress of exercise and the restperiod.

According to Patricia Meyer, B.F.A., and Andrea Schor,M.Ed., flower remedy therapy is effective in treating Attention DeficitHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in teenagers. Meyer and Schor, who arecertified flower essence practitioners, worked with 2 male twins, aged 14.Both boys had severe behavioral problems: they fought constantly, actedaggressively, violently, and impulsively; and they were on Dexedrine, theconventional drug for ADHD. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide: "Children's Health," pp. 610-615; "Flower Remedies," pp. 232-243. Each boy started taking a set of floweressences including Five-Flower Formula, Self-Heal, and Holly, plus 5-8additional remedies specific to their individual personalities. They tookthe essences daily for several months; soon, parents and practitionersnoted dramatic changes for the better in their temperament. Both boys weremore relaxed, less combative, and did better in school. Ten months afterbeginning treatment, they were taken off Dexedrine and were judged to befree of ADHD symptoms.

Daily supplementation with L-carnitine cansignificantly increase fertility in men, according to a study conducted byM. Costa, M.D. Dr. Costa assembled 100 men whose infertility was presumablycaused by sperm cells with reduced movement (motility); these men tookL-carnitine at the rate of 3 g daily for 4 months. Men whose sperm cellspretreatment showed normal speed of movement had a marked increase; butmen who had especially low sperm movement before treatment experienced thegreatest improvement.

If you can't fall asleep at night, Ray Sahelian, M.D., recommendstaking melatonin supplement (1 mg) 2 hours before your normal bedtime. If,after 3 nights, your insomnia has not improved, take one stronger dose of2-3 mg. For example, one patient took 3 mg of melatonin for 2 months whileundergoing a difficult divorce. Another patient used 3-6 mg once nightly toreduce the time it took her to fall asleep-from 2 hours to 30 minutes.Police officers working 7 successive night shifts took a once-daily dose of5 mg and reported improved sleep, elevated mood, and enhanced alertnessduring their working hours, states Dr. Sahelian. When normal sleep patternsare established again, gradually taper off from 3 mg to 2 mg, then after afew more nights, drop down to 1 mg, then after a few more nights, stop themelatonin, advises Dr. Sahelian. See Alternative Medicine, the Definitive Guide: "Sleep Disorders," p. 838.

Here is how Christiane Northrup, M.D., treats spasticcolon: Take 1-2 enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules (containing 0.2ml/capsule) 3 times daily in between meals; consume more fiber; takepsyllium (Plantago avata) powder at the rate of 1 teaspoon per 8 ounces ofwater once daily, then build to 3 times daily. Alternatively, take 8-10teaspoons of unprocessed wheat bran daily. "Enteric-coated" means the capsule is specially prepared so that only intestinal enzymes will digest it. This product is available tolicensed health care practitioners only from Phytopharmica, P.O. Box 1745, Green Bay, WI 54305; tel: 800-553-2370. Dr. Northrup recommends thatpatients keep a symptom journal, noting the emotional stresses and issuesthat accompany the attacks of spastic colon. "Once you get a handle on thelink between your intestines and your emotions, you can break yourunconscious 'gut reaction' by choosing an alternative behavior," such astaking 5 deep breaths and "telling your intestines" not to overreact,states Dr. Northrup.

A migraine headache is not caused by an Imitrex® deficiency(remedied at $36 a shot), state Jonathan Wright, M.D. and Alan Gaby, M.D.For migraine sufferers, Drs. Wright and Gaby recommend an initial foodallergy and sensitivity screening to eliminate allergic, headache-provokingfoods from the diet. These typically include wheat, oranges, tea, coffee,eggs, chocolate, milk, beef, corn, cane sugar, yeast, peas, and mushrooms.In a study of 60 patients who regularly consumed at least 10headache-provoking foods, when these were eliminated, the number of monthlymigraines plummeted from 402 to 6 and 85% of the patients becameheadache-free. See "A Thumbnail Guide to Living Headache-free," Digest, No. 6, pp. 17-18. Drs. Wright and Gaby further advise that patients havescreening tests for hypoglycemia and hormone allergies and that they takeallergy densensitization drops daily. They also suggest that patients complement this with a program of supplements including: magnesium (200 mg,twice daily); vitamin B6 (200 mg, twice daily); vitamin B2 (200 mg, twicedaily); feverfew capsules (6 daily); and a nonallergenic multiplevitamin-mineral. Regarding vitamin B2, when 49 people with chronicmigraines took 400 mg daily of vitamin B2 for 3 months, their averagenumber of headaches dropped by 67% while the severity lessened by 68%.

A woman named Elizabeth, aged 40, had suffered withmultiple sclerosis (MS) for 19 years, reports Effie Poy Yew Chow, Ph.D.,R.N., a certified acupuncturist practicing at East West Academy of HealingArts in San Francisco, California. Elizabeth was legally blind, had nosensation or movement in her legs and only little in her arms, and had nomuscle tone at all. She was restricted to a wheelchair and couldn't turnherself in bed or feed herself; her speech was slurred and stuttering andshe was deeply depressed. Dr. Chow treated her one hour a day for 2 days amonth for 6 months using Qigong, acupuncture, acupressure, physicalexercise, herbs, and visualization. After the first day's treatment,Elizabeth was able to turn over in bed 6 times by herself and in laterweeks she was able to turn herself 100 times as an exercise. Her armtremors decreased substantially as did her muscle spasms; she gainedsensation in her legs, became able to feed herself and to speak moreclearly without stuttering; and she felt positive and happy. Four yearsafter treatment began, Elizabeth continues to progress without setback,says Dr. Chow.

An elderly man with diabetes-related nerve pain (neuropathy)had constant severe burning pain in his feet for which he had found norelief. William H. Philpott, M.D., placed a magnet, negative, south-poledown (3950 gauss strength) on the soles of the patient's feet. Withinminutes, the nerve pain vanished and he remained pain-free for severalhours. When the pain returned, a second treatment with magnets eliminatedit. After several days of magnet therapy, the man's nerve pain waspermanently gone, says Dr. Philpott.

POST-OPERATIVE NAUSEA.According to data reported by S. Philips, M.D., 120 women undergoinggynecologic surgery who took 1 gram of powdered ginger root one hour beforereceiving anesthesia had a markedly lower incidence of nausea and vomitingafter surgery. Specifically, for those taking ginger root only 21% hadnausea, while for those taking metoclopramide (a conventional antinauseadrug), it was 27%, and for those on placebo, it was 41%. Further, twice asmany patients in these last 2 groups required medication to controlvomiting while none of the patients who took ginger root needed anymedicine. SOURCE: Dr. Jonathan V.

OXYGEN FOR LIFE - The Fast Way to Deliver Oxygen to Your Cells A new line of products from Oxygen for Life addresses two crucial problems regardingnutritional supplementation and good health. First, according to the Physicians' DeskReference, if you take a multivitamin pill or tablet, your body will probably absorb no morethan 15-25% of the nutrients; but if you introduce these same nutrients in a colloidal,suspended form, your absorption rate climbs to 80-95%. See "Super-Antioxidant from Grape Seeds," Digest, No. 7, pp. 24-25; "Coenzyme Q10," Digest, No. 7, pp. 22-24. Second, nobody is getting enough oxygen into their body these days because thereliterally is less of it around, as atmospheric oxygen has declined from 35% to 19% in thelast century, not to mention the pollution factor which also blocks oxygen availability.Oxygen for Life, under the direction of its founder, Richard Breitbarth, Ph.D., developed away to deliver more oxygen to all the body's cells both faster and in a much more absorbableway. See "Oxygen Therapy," pp. 412-421. The system is called Micro-Activation and it's based on the principal of colloidalsuspension, which is the natural state of your blood. "Colloidal" means this: instead ofdropping a marble into a tumbler of water, pulverize it into a thousand pieces and stir itup-this is a colloidal suspension of marble with many tiny particles of the substance adriftin the liquid. The same can be done with nutrients. Dr. Breitbarth devised a way to optimizethe electrical properties of water and minerals so that the human body could absorb themaximum number of nutrients at the fastest rate. The nutrients, in effect, bypass the normalstages of digestion and enter the bloodstream more directly, enabling "penetration andutilization at levels never before possible," states Dr. Breitbarth. The basis of the Oxygen for Life system comprises 5 products in a daily health program inwhich you mix small amounts with pure or distilled water, then take orally. Oxygen Solution[TM]provides high amounts of stabilized oxygen to aid all cellular processes, including toxinremoval. A typical dose is one teaspoon with 6 ounces of water, taken twice daily; an8-ounce bottle, containing 48 teaspoons, will last about 24 days. Aqua-Charge[TM] is an electrolyte concentrate that gives your red blood cells amuch-needed electrical boost. Aqua-Antioxidant[TM] is a colloidal suspension of pine bark andgrape seed antioxidants (also known as pycnogenols) to remove free radicals from your body.Aqua Colloidal C-Q-10[TM] comprises coenzyme Q10, a substance that helps your red blood cellscarry oxygen and your body to absorb it.

The retail price for the set of 5 is $130 plus shipping andtax, but a $30 membership fee entitles you to the wholesale price of $96. Finally, System Support[TM] combines 4 herbal extracts (astragalus, Siberian ginseng,nettle, hyssop) with 4 homeopathic remedies to provide temporary relief from cold and flusymptoms. The reports from users are favorable. Oxygen for Life products. According to massagetherapist Jennifer Cohen of Encinitas, California, a patient who has suffered with chronicarthritis for many years experienced a dramatic end to her pain after 8 days of taking thebasic 5 products twice daily. Then Cohen added Oxygen for Life's colloidal Mexican Wild Yamand Shark Cartilage to the patient's daily mix (once daily, before bedtime) after which herskin tone softened and she was able to walk on her own again, free from the motorized chairshe had depended on. Eventually, she was able to take a 3 week hiking trip, walking up to 3miles every day, says Cohen. ARTHRITIS RELIEF- Why Glucosamine May Be Your Joints' Best Nutritional Support Osteoarthritis, or stiffness, pain, and degeneration in the joints, affects an estimatedone-half of the adult population and about 85% of those over age 70. The most commontreatments, analgesics and antiinflammatory agents, do not work on the underlyingdegenerative process and often make the condition worse by interfering with cartilagemetabolism. However, since the 1980s, numerous studies have proven that a naturally-occuringsubstance called glucosamine can effectively manage, even improve, the symptoms ofosteoarthritis, without any side effects. Glucosamine is a substance normally present in the cartilage of the body's joints whereit is essential for physiological processes. Clinical studies, comparing glucosamine (insulfate or hydro-chloride form) with both placebo (a nonactive substance) and standardarthritis drugs (including Ibuprofen), showed that glucosamine outperformed both in reducinglong-term pain, joint tenderness and swelling, and accelerating recovery, reversingcartilage damage, and helping to restore joint function, range of motion, and walking speed. Glucosamine hydrochloride is available in consumer product form as a component in "Joint Support," a multivitamin, mineral, andherbal capsule, from Now Natural Foods, 550 Mitchell Road, Glendale Heights, IL60139; tel: 708-545-9098; fax: 708-545-9075. Another source is Nutri-West'sGlucosamine Plus; call 800-443-3333. Physicians may order Glucosamine Sulfatecapsules (500 mg) or Gluco-Flex Forte capsules (with N-acetyl-glucosamine, glucosamine sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate) from DouglasLaboratories, 600 Boyce Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15206; tel: 800-245-4440; fax:412-494-0155. Glucosamine was rated "good" or "sufficient" by 95% of 1208 patients who used thesubstance for arthritic pain control. In fact, it is "fully tolerated" by 85% of users, withno irritation to the gastrointestinal tract. Further, glucosamine nearly doubled the speedand magnitude of the improvement in the ease of movement and flexibility in joints. In nostudy were any side effects or adverse reactions noted to the use of this food supplement indaily amounts of 500 mg, divided into 3 doses. A year's supply (at 750 mg daily dosage)costs about $175-$240, making it highly affordable. That's why European physicians felt no hesitancy in classifying glucosamine sulfate as a"potential disease-modifying drug for long-term treatments of osteoarthritis and otherrheumatic disorders." In several countries, glucosamine is a first-line treatment forosteoarthritis. Although most U.S. physicians have, strangely, ignored glucosamine, Americannutritionist M.F. McCarty contends that the substance "may offer a practical means ofpreventing or postponing the onset of osteoarthritis in older people or athletes."

ACCURATE LAB TEST FOR DETECTING EARLY CANCER - Boston's Oncolab Claims 95% Accuracy Over the past 21 years, Massachusetts neurochemist Samuel Bogoch, M.D., Ph.D, has beendeveloping a new blood test to accurately detect early signs of cancer cells of all types inthe body. Although it was approved by the FDA in 1977, it was not until late 1994 that theclinical trials with 4278 patients were completed, validating the test's effectiveness. Nowthis patented, FDA-approved, Anti-Malignin Antibody Screen (AMAS) is available for doctors,worldwide, through Dr. Bogoch's Oncolab. According to Dr. Bogoch, AMAS is 95% accurate onthe first test, and 99% when repeated; the test can detect cancer up to 19 months beforeconventional medical tests can find it. Contact: Oncolab, 36 The Fenway, Boston, MA 02215; tel: 800-922-8378; fax:617-536-0657. The test costs $135 (followup, $85) and can be ordered by any physicianwho is licensed to order clinical lab tests. AMAS screens for the earliest signs of all types of cancer and it can also monitor theresults of any treatment or assess the degree of remission. This means it can objectivelymeasure the effect of alternative cancer treatments in removing cancer from the body. Italso means lives can be saved because approximately 35% of people who die from cancer couldbe saved with an earlier diagnosis followed by prompt treatment. The test is called an immunoassay, which means it measures the amount present of aspecific antibody, in this case, antimaligni. This is an antibody that acts against theinner protein layer of a cancer cell, called malignin. According to Dr. Bogoch, 99% ofpatients with cancer have AMAS readings above 135. The advantage of the new blood test,states Dr. Bogoch, is that it "gives a much more accurate answer at a fraction of the costand inconvenience" of standard cancer tests. When the last malignant cancer cells are destroyed in the body, the antimalignin antibodylevels return to normal, proving the cancer is cured. In fact, a new study by Bogochinvolving 1175 breast cancer patients proved that clinical remission, whether it's after oneor 30 months, is directly correlated with normal AMAS levels. German researchers found that pregnant women's mercury dental amalgams are directly associated with high levels of mercury in their fetuses.The more mercury-based fillings, the higher the levels in the livers of the unborn.The women in the study did not have a history of high mercury exposure from their jobor fish eating. German doctors urged reconsideration of the use of mercury amalgamsfor women during their child-bearing years.

THE PROOF IS IN THE MARKET Herb Sales Top $12 Billion Mass market sales of medicinal herbs in U.S. drugstores and supermarkets grew by 35% in1994, worth $106.7 million in sales. Topping the list were garlic, whose drugstore salesgrew by 40% to $12.9 million, and ginseng, whose sales climbed by 28% to $31.1 million.Their sales in food stores were even higher: garlic sales in retail food outlets grew by 40%to $12.9 million and ginseng leaped by 63% to $11.8 million. Even more impressive wasacidophilus (taken as a beneficial intestinal bacteria) whose drugstore sales soared by 140%and whose food store sales expanded by 57%. See "Herbal Medicine," pp. 253-271; "Nutritional Supplements," pp. 385-397; "Orthomolecular Medicine," pp. 398-404. Worldwide sales of herbal medicines (called phytomedicines outside the U.S.) are equallybooming, estimated at $12.4 billion for Europe, Japan, Asia, and North America. In Europe,sales of herbal medicines are allocated according to these categories: cardiovascular,27.2%; digestive, 14.4%; respiratory, 15.3%, tonics, 14.4%; sedative, 9.3%; and others. InGermany, for example, one-third of all nonprescription drugs are herbal and Gingko biloba(as a circulatory agent) leads the pack with annual sales of $280 million, followed by horsechestnut (for the blood) with $103 million. Herbal sales worldwide are expect-ed to continuegrowing by 8-15% during the next 5 years, depending on the region.

In Germany, more than 80% of physicians use herbal medicines, medical students aretaught herbs in college, and there is no strong antagonism between conventional andalternative medicines. In the U.S., medical school education ignores herbs andconventional doctors hardly ever use them. FDA regulations and state medicallicensing laws further obstruct their practice.

ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE CAN SAVE BILLIONS Let's Try ItIf, as a taxpayer, you're wondering if there isn't some way to reduce the $1trillion-plus annual price tag for American health care, here are some startling figures onhow cost-effective alternative medicine could be if we gave it a free run in the medicalmarketplace. ASTHMA. The cost of medications, doctors' visits, and hospitalizations for asthma isabout $10 billion a year, but with alternative medicine, using allergy elimination dietsplus nutritional supplements, the savings would be about $3 billion. ATHEROSCLEROSIS. Conventional medicine offers various kinds of surgery and drugs,costing $30 billion annually. Alternative approaches, including nutrition and chelationtherapy, would save taxpayers about $9 billion. CHRONIC EAR INFECTIONS. The combined cost of office visits, antibiotics, and ear tubesfor about 100,000 children is $650 million. Using allergy elimination diets, estimatedsavings would be $487.5 million with a 75% reduction in the recurrence of ear infections. HEART ATTACK. Conventional treatment includes administering clot-dispersing drugs thatcost between $500 million to $1 billion a year, or about $2600 a dose. The recommendedalternative therapy involves a $5 dose of intravenous magnesium, producing cost savings ofclose to $1 billion. OSTEOARTHRITIS. The annual cost for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is about $2-4billion. Alternative therapies, involving nutrition and dietary modification, would shaveabout $1 billion off this cost. PEPTIC ULCER. Conventional treatments cost $2 billion a year, while alternativetherapies produce healing at one-third the cost, saving $1.33 billion. PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT. Conven-tional therapy, involving surgery ($5000/operation) andProscar ($540/year) costs $2 billion a year to treat 2 million men. Alternative therapycosts about $150 a person, saving $2.78 billion annually. SOURCE: "NIH and Alternative Medicine," Alan R. Gaby, M.D., Townsend Letter for Doctors,February/March 1993, pp. 208-209.

UNSAFE WATER MANDATED BY U.S. CONGRESS An estimated 20% of Americans (53 million people) unknowingly drink contaminated waterpolluted with lead, radiation, feces, or other poisons, according to EnvironmentalProtection Agency data collected in 1993-94. That number was 7.6 million higher than 1992.At least 1000 deaths each year and about 400,000 cases of waterborne illness can be blamedon contaminated tap water, stated the Environmental Working Group (EWG). They further reported that herbicides were found in the drinking water of almost all 29Midwestern cities and towns tested for their study. In one Illinois city the level of theweedkiller cyanazine in public water was 34 times above the federal standard. The EWGestimated that 20-25 million Americans are now drinking herbicide-polluted water. Laboratorystudies have proven that animals fed herbicides in their feed have higher rates of cancerand birth defects. Experts for the EWG noted that polluted drinking water could pose serioushealth problems for infants and children. Write your Congressional representative to express your support for greater EPAfunding to protect water quality and public health. The new data is shocking, but evidently not enough to prod Congress into support ofstricter regulations. Instead, the House of Representatives voted to cancel all federalmoney slated for monitoring public drinking water and to abolish a $1 billion program tohelp towns purify contaminated water.

ANTIBIOTICS: The High Price of Excess When it comes to supposed medical "realities," when its trusted drugs fail to work,conventional medicine acts as if it's standing on the edge of the world, facing the darkchasm of disease, powerless and without any treatments. New studies from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) indicate that there is a sharprise in drug-resistant bacteria. Bacteria are mutating and no longer are susceptible tostandard antibiotics, including penicillin. Each year an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 U.S.patients die from infections acquired in hospitals and more than 50% of these deaths areattributed to antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. These infections cost U.S. patientsmore than $1.2 billion a year in extra hospital costs. The point here is that the world is not flat, as the conventional doctors believe, butround. There are treatments beyond the seeming chasm of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.First, CDC researchers admitted that the shocking rise of drug-resistant bacteria is due to"excessive and inappropriate" use of antibiotics. So use fewer antibiotics. Second, there are many natural "antibiotics" and anti-infection agents in alternativemedicine, including colloidal silver, hydrogen peroxide, and numerous herbs, to which thebacterial world is not resistant. By using less antibiotics and more alternative medicines,we can save money, produce fewer toxic side effects, restore the bacterial world to balance,and help patients heal faster.

Dr. Whitaker on the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., denounces the FDAas America's chief obstacle to good health and affordable medical care. Julian Whitaker, M.D., a prominent alternative medicine physician, educator,author, and editor of the monthly newsletter, Health & Healing, in mid Augustthis year put his voice (and career) where his beliefs are in publicly decrying FDAregulatory abuses. He challenged FDA commissioner David Kessler, M.D., to meet him onthe steps of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., for a public showdown overunfair FDA labeling rules for nutritional supplements. In a letter to Kessler, Dr. Whitaker declared: "I will publicly violate FDAregulations regarding labeling of nutritional supplements. I will sell nutritionalsupplements with truthful, nonmisleading labels and claims that have not beenapproved by the FDA, and I have no intention of seeking such approval."

Though clearly against FDA regulations, this activity cannot be illegal, Dr.Whitaker reasoned, because it is protected by the U.S. Constitution's FirstAmendment guaranteeing freedom of speech. The FDA currently prohibits supplementmakers from advertising health claims on their packages, a regulation many considerunfair and detrimental to public health and consumer freedom. See "U.S. Congress Barking at the Heels of an Out-of-Control FDA," Digest, No. 8, pp.39-40. "If you have me arrested and charge me with violation of law, I will sue you fordefamation of character," Dr. Whitaker warned the FDA. Kessler never showed up and Dr. Whitaker sold his "First Amend-ment Vitamins" without being arrested. He sharedwith the 100 people who gathered for his rally all the health claims for thesupplements. The Digest applauds Dr. Whitaker for his conviction, courage, andbravura street politics. His is an example worthy for many alternative medicinephysicians to copy. In the last 2 years, the FDA has sought to prevent supplement manufacturers frommaking truthful health claims for their products.

Special Report Government Data Proves It: ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE IS GROWING According to U.S. government data, between 1987 and 1992, the second fastestgrowing field in U.S. health care was alternative medicine. Listed as "Offices andClinics of Health Practitioners-Not Listed Elsewhere," this category includesacupuncturists, dieticians, midwives, naturopaths, nutritionists, nurses, ChristianScience practitioners, and 12 other specialties. This category, representing 22,260offices, grew by 163.1% (from 12,044 offices) compared to the number of new officesof conventional doctors, which grew by only 56.3%, dentists, which grew by 47.9%, andosteopaths, which grew by 71.7%. The number of chiropractic offices expanded by80.7%-from 20,065 to 27,329. The category with the greatest growth was in homehealth care, which grew by 244%; this category, incidentally, is often provided bynurses, who tend to be more open to alternative medicine approaches. -SOURCE: US-12 United States, Service Industries-Geographic Area Series andStandard Industrial Classification.

Crook, M.D. Professional Books, Inc., Box 3246, Jackson, TN 38303 (tel: 901-423-5400), 1995, paper, $17.95, 732pp. If you suffer from fatigue, muscle aches, food sensitivities, psoriasis,asthma, and many other common complaints, your health problems may be yeast-related, saysWilliam G. Crook, M.D. Dr. Crook is not only a practicing physician, but a well-regardedlecturer and author of 11 books and numerous articles. Too much yeast (specifically, Candidaalbicans) in the body is a problem that applies equally to men and women (despite Crook'sgender-specific title), which means this book should interest all those with a chronicillness or health condition-and their physicians. Candida albicans, a common yeast, normally lives in the human body where it causes noproblems provided the biochemistry is balanced and the immune system is strong. Butprescription drugs, hormonal changes, infections, improper diet, and other factors can causea yeast overgrowth in the intestinal tract, thereby producing a dismaying list of symptoms.Yeast infections then weaken the immune system and "like a stream cascading down a mountain,set off disturbances that can make you feel sick all over," explains Dr. Crook. These "disturbances" include irritable bowel syndrome, vaginal yeast infections,endometriosis, headaches, depression, multiple sclerosis, and others. The list ofyeast-related diseases itself may come to many readers as a revelation of holistic medicalinvestigation. Dr. Crook argues that the primary contributing factor in yeast overgrowth is too manybroad-spectrum antibiotics in the system. While Dr. Crook does not state that yeast is thesole cause of chronic health problems, he suggests that too much Candida albicans in thebody may be one of the prime causes of many health problems. Crook supplies the reader with numerous questionnaires to help determine whether or not ahealth problem may be yeast-related and he offers a step-by-step practical program to helpyou overcome it. Along the way, he discusses hormones, parasites, specific nutritionalsupplements, free radicals, diet, the mind-body connection, nonprescription antiyeastmedications, and a great deal more. The result is an uncommonly useful and meticulouslydetailed book by one of alternative medicine's leading doctors. DESIGNER POISONS:HOW TO PROTECT YOUR HEALTH AND HOME FROM TOXIC PESTICIDES Marion Moses, M.D. Pesticide Education Center, P.O.

She and the volunteers at her Pesticide Education Center collaborated in producingthis book so the informed reader can choose other, less toxic methods to ultimately "tamethe toxic beast." Too often people give no thought to what is in those containers of "designer poisons"they buy to bomb their homes, spray their pets, and shampoo their children. But Dr. Mosessays we had better start giving it a lot of thought. Bug sprays may have been designed tokill insects, but they're proving to be poisons to humans as well. Did you know there is an over-the-counter pesticide (Lindane) that has been linked tobrain cancer and leukemia? Or that there are pesticides you can buy that act like (orinterfere with) female hormones, lodge in fatty tissue, and cause cancer? Or that there is a lice shampoo that contains a pesticide linked to brain cancer in children? There iseven a pesticide used to kill termites that depletes the earth's ozone layer. Designer Poisons is a virtual encyclopedia of tables, charts, quantities, brand names,ingredients-everything you need to know to make informed decisions. With Dr. Moses' capableand thoroughly documented guidance, "you can choose pest control methods that are safer foryou, your family, your pets, your neighbors, and the environment." VIDEO: MENOPAUSE- DISPELLING THE MYTHS, TELLING THE TRUTHS, EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITIES Jill E. Holden, Producer/ Director, featuring Jesse Hanley, M.D. Moondancer Productions, 1767 Goodyear Avenue,(800-760-7775), 1994, 66 minutes, VHS-color, $39.95. An estimated 575 million women, worldwide, are in menopause, but what does it mean to awoman? Women become old, dried up, and useless after menopause-that's still the prevailingmyth in our society about life after menopause, but to counter this erroneous view, JillHolden and Jesse Hanley, M.D., emphasize that menopause is a time for a woman to be honored,not ashamed. Dr. Hanley, Medical Director of the Malibu Health and Rehabilitation Center, providesexpert advice about alternative health options and the dangers of standardized hormonereplacement therapy. She also reviews what happens in a woman's body at menopause. One boldnew fact that emerges here is that the symptom picture of menopause is individualized,based on each woman's lifestyle, her use of chemicals (prescription drugs and birth controlpills), and personal medical history. Dr. Hanley also shows pre-menopausal women howdetoxification, herbs, and natural diet can prevent future health problems when menopausebegins. "Life is not over after forty," Dr. Hanley discovered for herself. "There are positivechanges in a woman's sense of freedom, power, and wisdom." ROBERT CRAYHON'S NUTRITION MADE SIMPLE Robert Crayhon, M.S. M. Evans and Company, Inc., 216 East 49th Street, New York, NY 10017 (212-688-2810), 1994, hardcover, $19.95, 314 pp. "This is a book on optimal nutrition, not adequate nutrition," says Robert Crayhon, M.S. "Abook on adequate nutrition is as interesting as a financial guide for staying above the povertylevel," he quips. Crayhon should know: he is a practicing nutritionist, host of the syndicated"Voice of Wellness" radio show and the cable television show, "Alternative Medicine." His book is stocked with how-tos, lists of helpful nutrients to take, and ways to improveyour health using alternative medicine. With his quick wit and quirky sense of humor, Crayhonmakes nutrition education enjoyable as he walks you through all the latest information aboutexactly what you need to stay healthy. His lists are unique, fun to read, and informative. For example, here are the "Top 10 Things to Put on Your Shopping List:" fresh fruits andvegetables; fermented dairy products; organic flaxseed, canola, or olive oil; fresh, purewater; dried beans, lentils, and peas; whole grains; salsa; unfermented green tea; raw nuts;and herbs. Along the way, he gives you the "Top 10 Reasons Why Most Doctors Do Not KnowAnything about Nutrition." Reason No. 6: "Nutrition promotes the self-empowerment of thepatient, which some physicians find threatening." No Scientific Proof That "Bottled Death" Prolongs Life Questioning Chemotherapy: Ralph W. Moss, Ph.D. Equinox Press, 144 St. John Place, Brooklyn, NY 11217, (718-636-1679), 1995, paper, $19.95, 209 pp. "It amazes me how much of what passes for knowledge in cancer therapy turns out to beincomplete, inadequate, and anecdotal," states Ralph Moss, Ph.D., author of The Cancer Industryand Cancer Therapy. In Questioning Chemotherapy, Moss intends to spark an international debateon whether the toxic drug, chemotherapy, has any value in the treatment of cancer, whetherit's any better than sugar pills. The evidence that chemotherapy, or "bottled death," as some critics call it, prolongs acancer patient's life or improves its quality is nearly nonexistent, says Moss. "Oncologistshave been derelict in not doing reproducible studies to investigate this question." That's whyMoss is questioning the chemotherapy establishment. Modern chemotherapy derives from experiments with poisonous mustard gas in the 1940s; itsclaims are based on the temporary improvement in a mouse and one patient in a singleexperiment. Definitive clinical trials have rarely been carried out and fail to support theclaims of the advocates of chemotherapy. Cancer patient hospital bills are almost $90 billionper year, almost 10 percent of the total U.S. health bill. Linguistic dodges, biases, andexclusion, or fraudulent presentation of data make chemo-therapy appear far more effective thanit really is. We need to be informed medical consumers, to question doctors, and be aware there is a partyline in the medical system, Moss advises. Chemotherapy is pushed as an ideological fixture inmedicine, keeping patients oriented toward "proper" (allopathic) medical therapy-but thatdoesn't mean it's the best cancer treatment. When you get chemotherapy, it reduces thelikelihood of your benefiting from other promising nontoxic, nutritional, or immunologicaltreatments, Moss adds. "If you are a sane and sentient adult you have an absolute right totake or refuse any treatment," says Moss. A new critical attitude about chemo-therapy could beyour turning point towards health wisdom and survival.

By JEESE HANLEY, M.D. Premenstrual syndrome and menopause are generally viewed as �curses,� but in my practice, I help women discover their �gifts.� PMS is a valuable opportunity to become more attuned to what�s going on inside yourself. When women can transform their relationship to their cycle, the hardship melts into increased sensitivity and clarity of direction and purpose. Similarly, I encourage women to regard menopause as the life change for which they have endured PMS and spent their lives preparing, to see it as an entrance, or initiation perhaps, into a new time of wisdom. In my consultations with women who have PMS symptoms, I suggest they honor their feelings and appreciate that there is a purpose to these symptoms. PMS includes the symptoms that begin with or after ovulation and finish by the end of the menstrual flow. It�s known, perhaps misleadingly, as premenstrual syndrome because the majority of the symptoms and the longest period of these symptoms for most women come before menstruation. PMS is actually valuable because it opens a window of increased sensitivity to pain and helps women to remember their wisdom. Technically, PMS is a sign that something is not working right, whether nutritionally, hormonally, or psychologically. By taking us to the brink each month, PMS becomes a wake-up call to correct these imbalances. When we attend to them, the result is a healthier life and deeper self-respect, as well as a preparation for a smooth transition through menopause. RESPECT YOUR PMS. I strive to empower women to develop self-respect for their normal biological processes and womanhood. I encourage women to ask questions, to evaluate the possible effects of trading a little comfort now for a long-term risk. Regrettably, we�re a culture that doesn�t deal with things until they�re an emergency, especially the health of a woman's body. Too often we wait until it�s a dreadful problem, such as fibroids, endometriosis, or cancer that might require surgery. Many women work in mainstream jobs where it is uncomfortable and unsafe for them to be fully, biologically, a woman. Birth control pills keep their hormones so even they barely have a noticeable monthly cycle except for minimal bleeding. Many women become almost addicted to not being a woman, to not understanding the natural cycling of hormones and the feelings, increased sensitivity, intuition, and creativity this evokes. It�s a kind of medical self-destruction that will surely create health problems. There is an old concept that the uterus, the hyster, is the cause of �hysteria� in a woman, and that by removing it through a hysterectomy a woman will become less emotional, more like a man and thus easier to control. Approximately 33% of American women will have a hysterectomy by age 60; about 600,000 are performed every year, but many of these are medically unnecessary. Chinese medicine describes the uterus as the place where a woman's energy and essence reside, so we need to rethink our approach to uterine health. PMS is a clustering of symptoms magnified by a hormonal imbalance. If you are truly healthy, the experience of menstruation will not be so upsetting, biochemically or psychologically. But to get to this kind of health, you need to undo the effects of a series of obstacles. There are many human-made environmental chemicals, pesticides, and herbicides that masquerade as estrogen once they�re inside your body and thereby upset the delicate hormonal balance. The message is this: heed what your premenstrual symptoms are telling you before you get sick from them. HOLD THE ESTROGEN. Many of the reproductive problems women experience, including heavy bleeding, fibroids, fibrocystic breast disease, PMS, and many menopausal symptoms, are not a deficiency of estrogen, but instead an excess of estrogen relative to a deficiency of progesterone. There is a dramatic lack of understanding in mainstream medicine of this progesterone/estrogen imbalance and its significance and dangerous effect on female tissues. Consequently, women are not getting the help they need. A perfect example is the way so many physicians immediately put women on estrogen replacement therapy the minute they start complaining about perimenopausal (on the verge of menopause) symptoms. It�s the wrong thing to do. Physicians do this with no hormonal monitoring. I've only met one patient in my years of practice whose physician actually measured her hormone level after giving female hormones to her. There are natural, safe, and healthy alternatives to birth control pills, hysterectomies, and estrogen replacement therapy as a way of making a healthy transition from PMS to menopause. Estrogen rarely declines until the onset of menopause and hot flashes and declines much less than progesterone. Taking Premarin, Estraderm or Estrase (the 3 estrogens most commonly prescribed) further upsets your estrogen/progesterone imbalance and only invites more problems. The idea that if a woman takes estrogen she�ll look young forever is a dangerous illusion. Estrogen causes her to retain fluids which plump up her skin and produce weight gain. Excess water can be retained in the brain, causing irritability; or it can be retained in the breasts, making them swollen, lumpy, tender, and crampy; or it can stimulate excessive, potentially dangerous glandular growth in the colon, breast, and uterus. RESTORING PROGESTERONE NATURALLY. We�re seeing declining levels of progesterone starting at age 30 all through the Western world. Main-stream medicine doesn�t understand the importance of progesterone. It focuses on progestin in the form of products such as Provera, Agest, and DepoProvera. These progesterone-like synthetic chemicals don�t have all the good effects and benefits, such as stimulating bone growth and preempting osteoporosis, that you get from natural progesterone. Instead, they have many negative side effects including water retention, depression, and the increased risk of blood clots. Unless a woman has already stopped having periods and is having hot flashes, I will try her on natural progesterone first. Often the period restarts and gets more regular and the hot flashes begin to diminish over the course of 1 to 3 months for as long as several years. Progesterone cream delivered through the skin (transdermally) is the best form of delivery. When you take female hormones orally, 90% are destroyed by the liver and only 10% get into your blood. The burden on the liver and gallbladder is known to increase the risk of gallstones, gallbladder disease, and liver cancer. The doses and periods of application vary according to what it�s being used for (PMS, fibroids, or menopause) and the strength of the product. Generally, women should apply a half a teaspoon twice a day from ovulation to the day before bleeding. I recommend that you rub it on your abdomen below the navel, over your uterus, on your breasts, and perhaps a tiny amount on your arms and face. For about 80% of the women I�ve treated with progesterone cream, the hormones are efficiently absorbed and reduce symptoms. If the woman continues to be uncomfortable, I add natural, transdermal estrogens to the progesterone cream treatment. ENHANCE THE ESTRIOL. Of the three estrogens a woman�s body makes (E1, estrone; E2, estradiol; and E3, estriol), estradiol and estrone are consistently associated with cancer risks. These are the estrogens found in the pharmaceutical hormones given to women. Estriol is safer and healthier and can help shrink fibroids and lower cancer risks. That is why I prescribe 8-10 times more estriol than the other two estrogens which, if I must use them, I prescribe in low doses to reduce the risk. And again, I make sure that progesterone is included to constantly buffer estrogen�s over-stimulating effect on the glands. AVOID PREMARIN�IT�S FOR HORSES. It�s ridiculous to give women horse hormones. But that�s what Premarin is, literally and phonetically: it is pregnant mare's urine, out of which estrogenic hormonal chemicals are distilled for use by women. Of the approximately 12 estrogens in horse urine, only 2 exactly match a woman�s. In the 40 years we've been prescribing Premarin, there has not been adequate testing to discover what these 10 other horse estrogens do to a woman. There is evidence to suggest, however, that they produce an increased risk for female cancers. If that isn�t enough, not all women who take Premarin actually get rid of their hot flashes, which is supposedly the most common symptom for which Premarin is prescribed. I would avoid Provera and if possible, stay clear of Premarin, Estrase, and Estratest. The testosterone that�s given to women in pharmaceutical preparations like Estratest is methyl-testosterone which has been known to cause liver and cardiac damage. Products such as Provera, medroxy-progesterone, and Agestin, are chemically altered (for patenting purposes) with the result that they do not match human progesterone. They will upset your natural balance of hormones and produce damaging side effects, plus fail miserably to do the real progesterone�s most important job, which is to stimulate bone density. USE HERBS WITH PROGESTERONE. I�m concerned that in a woman's desire to treat herself (since so many women are not getting the help they need from mainstream physicians) she will take only estrogenic herbs. Examples of these are dong quai, alfalfa, licorice root, ginseng, anise seed, garlic, fennel, papaya, red clover, and sage. Although these may make your symptoms go away, they could also increase the risk of fibroids, tumors, and cancers. Make sure that your formulas contain progesterone-precursor herbs, such as wild yam, sarsaparilla, and chaste berry (Vitex agnus cassus). AVOID THE PILL. In general, I�m conservative about birth control pills because they are synthetic hormones and suppress the natural activity of the ovaries. They are preferable only to repeated abortions. I am willing to give younger women birth control pills for a limited time, reminding them that this is not the best method. I am not saying that 5 years of taking birth control pills is dreadfully dangerous, but any excessive use of the Pill, when there are intelligent alternatives, is an unnecessary risk. I have a woman in my practice who took the birth control pill for 17 years. When she quit, she went into menopause 10 years early because her ovaries could not �wake up� and �remember� their proper function. For women on birth control pills, it is essential to take supplements high in the vitamin B complex and antioxidants (A, C, E). Over time, the Pill can dramatically deplete your reserve of B and C vitamins which, in turn, can lead to conditions such as cervical dysplasia (a change in the shape or size of cells in the cervix) that may result in cervical cancer. Traditionally, birth control pills are only prescribed for women up to age 35, but some physicians are prescribing them for relief from menopausal symptoms. There is no research demonstrating the safety of these pills when given to women over 35. Not only are they made of synthetic hormones, they contain higher levels of estrogen than are needed during menopause and are implicated in a higher risk of ovarian and breast cancer. Further, they suppress the activity of the brain�s pituitary gland. RUN FROM NORPLANT. I�ve observed that the Norplant contraceptive tends to upset women. It contains a synthetic progesterone that interferes with the monthly hormonal cycle and makes women more miserable. This product, like all synthetic progesterones, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and blood clots, can produce water retention, weight gain, irregular bleeding, and depression, and interfere with thyroid function. Some patients tell me that using this form of contraception makes them feel as if a black cloud has settled over them. HAVE A HORMONE FAST. I recommend that a woman �cycle� her hormones in a way that resembles how her body has always done this. Constant hormonal stimulation may be convenient; unfortunately, it is also probably dangerous. Previous to this generation, women have always �cycled,� meaning they�ve had 4-7 days off every month (during menstruation when estrogen and progesterone levels are at their lowest) so their body gets a break. Discontinue all hormone treatments during this �fast.� Let your tissues and organs have 4-7 days off monthly to detoxify from the hormonal effects. CHANGE YOUR DIET. Choose foods that are low in fat, high in fiber, unprocessed, and unrefined. Sugar, fats, alcohol, and white flour are notorious for increasing the symptoms of hormonal imbalances, from the mood swings and irritability of PMS to uterine fibroids and fibrocystic breasts. The greater your discomfort, the cleaner your diet must be. Milk products, however, should be completely eliminated, regardless of your symptom status. According to research from Frank Oski, M.D., of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, milk products can help cause osteoporosis, heart disease, and allergies. Milk is probably one of the most concentrated sources of harmful pesticides and environmental estrogen-like chemicals. These mimic and exaggerate the activity of natural estrogen in your body. TAKE MULTIVITAMINS. Taking a vitamin supplement is as important as changing your diet. That�s because we get fewer nutrients in our depleted standard American diet; the soil our food is grown in is gravely deficient in nutrients, so even healthy foods have fewer nutrients than they used to; and our absorption and digestion become less efficient as we age. I recommend multiple vitamin formulas that are taken with meals. A good supplement for women should contain, specifically, 600 mg of calcium and 500-600 mg of magnesium. DETOXIFY YOUR LIVER. Many of the problems women experience can be alleviated by cleansing the liver. The liver is the largest filter in the body, responsible for processing all hormones and toxins; it must also deal with thousands of toxic substances that routinely enter the human body. First, take the pressure off your liver by lowering the amounts of oils (excepting olive oil) and fats in your diet, especially fried fats because these do more damage to the liver than any other single food. Second, start a liver-cleansing program using a preformulated blend, such as Eclectic Institute�s Opti-Lipotropic and Prevail�s Metabolic Liver Formula. The purpose of Opti-Lipotropic (containing, in part, B6, choline, inositol, dandelion, celandine, beet leaf, Oregon grape, and milk thistle) is to remove fats and other poisons from the liver. Metabolic Liver Formula also contains herbs and natural plant enzymes that help detoxify and strengthen the liver. These ingredients work best when used together, so do not take them singly. I recommend doing a 2-month (even better, 3-month) course of this at least once a year. For women with severe PMS, the course can be for longer periods of time and more often. All women should start doing this by age 35-40, and it wouldn�t hurt to begin this preventively in your 20s. Detox-ification with these herbal formulas assists your liver in undoing its part in the body's imbalance. I recommend that you do this in consultation with a health practitioner who will tailor it to your unique needs. MENOPAUSE ENJOY THE CHANGE OF A LIFETIME. If you follow the steps I�ve outlined, by the time menopause arrives, the transition will not be traumatic. I encourage women to look at what this transition means to them. Do you think it's the end of the world, that you�re used and dried up? If you do, this view has dangerous negative repercussions on your physical experience of menopause. In nearly every other culture around the planet, at menopause a woman becomes more valued than at any other time in her life. It may be a shocking view to many women in our culture, but menopause is actually the moment you�ve spent your life preparing for, when you step into your wisdom and power. It�s time to change your outlook from just trying to make it through menopause to resolving to make the most of this healthy and natural life transition.

By MARI FLORENCE Over the last several months, Lee Cowden, M.D., a cardiologist from Dallas, Texas, has formulated a unique detoxification protocol for women who have had silicone breast implants. In conjunction with doctors at the Health Regeneration Institute, a residential clinic in Waynesville, North Carolina, Dr. Cowden applies his understanding of the toxicity of breast implants and his belief that women can heal from their poisonous effects. While many health practitioners argue that silicone cannot be removed from the body, Dr. Cowden contends otherwise. To date, Health Regeneration Institute has supervised 36 women through this program, co-developed by Dr. Cowden, and all have experienced improvement. According to Dr. Cowden, �Women going through this detoxification program see white powdery flakes coming out in their urine and stools, usually in a matter of days to weeks, after which their symptoms start to lift and dramatically improve. Then their autoimmune disease, (lupus, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis-like symptoms) starts to resolve. Many women, once dependent on wheelchairs, crutches, or canes, find they can walk and run again.� WHAT IS SILICONE IMPLANT DISEASE? Most women, regardless of the type of breast implant they have in place, may eventually develop health problems as a result, states Dr. Cowden. Disputing many doctors who attribute adverse symptoms solely to the effects of silicone implant rupture in the body, Dr. Cowden says that the health problems can stem from a chemical release of the implant material when the white blood cells break down the implant coating. In the case of saline implants, the body�s white blood cells �chew off� little pieces of silicone coating on the saline implant, then carry them into a distant tissue; here the white blood cells die, releasing the foreign material into the tissues, whether it is in the joints, muscles, or brain. The same sequence happens with silicone-filled implants, but to a larger degree, says Dr. Cowden. The important point is that all silicone implants leak silicone into the tissues even if the capsule has not ruptured, and the degree of leakage is estimated to be about 5-10 grams per year. Silicone is a sensitizing agent, which means it initiates an autoimmune or hyperimmune process which, in turn, can attack the nervous system and other tissues. Then it manifests as symptoms typical of chronic fatigue, multiple sclerosis, or lupus. But it can also produce symptoms such as memory loss, poor concentration, arthritic pain, and joint problems. It�s possible that a person may have a tendency towards developing these illnesses, then the presence of silicone in the body accelerates that process through an �adjuvant� phenomenon,� explains Dr. Cowden. �If you�re trying to get reimbursed from an insurance company for this problem, that�s what you�d better say. Other doctors suggest that actually the silicone brings on the disease to start with in a person who does not otherwise have a tendency towards that illness.� REMOVE THE IMPLANTS. Once a woman starts developing the symptoms of silicone implant disease, she cannot start to detoxify unless the implants are removed, says Dr. Cowden. �In order to get well, you first have to get the implant completely out of the body.� In many cases, Dr. Cowden has found that the implant is already ruptured or broken down, causing microscopic flecks to diffuse throughout the body. DEAL WITH THE ANGER. In most cases, women are feeling angry, sad, and often guilty. Sometimes a woman had the implants because a male partner said she needed them, but not because she wanted them. Often a woman doesn�t realize how angry she is, but because anger can block the healing function, it is essential that a woman deal with this anger so that the treatment can be most effective, says Dr. Cowden. REMOVE THE MERCURY. Once the implants are removed, one of the most insidious toxins ever found in the body still remains�mercury. First the mercury fillings must be removed from the mouth; second, the mercury must also be removed from the tissues and blood. Mercury, having gradually leeched out of silver-mercury dental amalgams into the body blocks the tissues� ability to detoxify themselves of silicone and other toxins. Studies have shown that for many implant survivors once the mercury-based amalgams and other metals are removed, their symptoms improve. Dr. Cowden generally encourages women to practice the detoxification program for 7 days, then to take at least 7 days off, followed by another 7 days on. Women who have had implants for many years will need at least 3-5 week-long detox treatments. MODIFIED FASTING. Patients detoxify with a combination of psyllium fiber and bentonite clay in conjunction with a partial, supervised fast, usually using organic apple juice and vegetable broth. Certain enzymes are taken to start breaking down the toxins stored in the bowel lining. NUTRITIONAL THERAPIES. A variety of nutrients are given orally to support the woman�s liver and kidneys which will be stressed by the rapid detoxification. Each patient is evaluated individually and supplied with plenty of antioxidants such as grapeseed extract, vitamins E and C, and beta carotene, in addition to spirulina, minerals, B vitamins, and other supplements. COLON CLEANSING. Twice a day, women receive 5 gallons of ozonated colemic water, which is a form of enema. The patient lies on a 4-foot plastic board while receiving the ozonated water rectally. One end of the board is placed on a chair to slant slightly downwards to a toilet bowl; the board has a hole in it on one end for drainage into the toilet. The person lies down on the board with their buttocks over the toilet; then ozonated water (water to which ozone, or 03, has been added) is run into the intestines by gravity from a bucket 3 feet higher than the board. The ozonated water helps to flush a toxic false lining out of the intestines and helps to oxidize silicone and other toxins in the tissues. ENZYMES. The treatment program emphasizing cellulase enzymes is given to aid in the silicone detoxification; this is needed only during select days of the bowel cleansing. BATHS WITH OZONATED WATER. Combining ozonated water with a product called Body Soak Gold helps to mobilize toxins out through the skin. Many women who take Body Soak Gold-ozonated baths once daily will notice little white flecks floating in the bath water; these appear to be related to the implants. ENERGY MEDICINE. The use of a handheld lymphatic device such as the Light Beam Generator helps to stimulate the flow of lymph through the lymph nodes. A physician trained in the use of this device, which projects soft laser light and electromagnetic frequencies onto the skin to stimulate the movement of lymph, must be on hand for supervision. Once trained, you can use it by yourself. LYMPH MASSAGE. Each woman learns how to gently massage her lymph nodes and lymph circulation system, using her hands, a dry skin brush, and a mini-trampoline or rebounder. The massage helps the lymph system to dump toxins. INTRAVENOUS NUTRIENT THERAPY. Delivering nutrients through intravenous infusion can fortify and stimulate the immune system, making it more tolerant of and resistant to the systemic damage of silicone. COUNSELING. Dr. Cowden finds it is best to go through the first week of the program in a supervised setting under the care of professional counselors who know about the emotional issues likely to arise during detoxification. OTHER THERAPIES. Some patients benefit from light/sound therapy to help in the release of subconsciously stored emotions. Swedish massage therapy or other hands-on approaches similarly yield a strong release of toxins and blocked emotions. For other women, the use of electroacupressure or acupuncture treatments help discharge blocked emotions and balance a variety of symptoms that tend to arise during the first week of treatment.

Edelson, M.D. By NATHIEL MEAD AS medical director of the Environmental and Pre-ventive Health Center of Atlanta, Georgia, Stephen B. Edelson, M.D., uses many alternative cancer therapies because he believes they hold long-range promise for his patients. Preventive nutrition and various nontoxic strategies are the main focus of an approach he calls �Oncological Environmental Medicine.� We�re seeing more cancer today than ever before because of the effect of our toxic environment on our cells and genes, says Dr. Edelson, who is board certified in three specialties�Environmental Medicine, Family Practice, and Chelation Therapy. �We look at how the individual�s biochemistry responds to the environment, how well it can detoxify, and how well the organs and body systems work together to maintain overall health. In 1985, Dr. Edelson became disillusioned with conventional cancer approaches when his wife, aged 40, died of breast cancer. This experience drove home for Dr. Edelson the destructive, immune-suppressive nature of radiation and chemotherapy, and the urgent need for better alternatives. By 1991, he had some of the answers. An effective cancer therapy, Dr. Edelson now believes, employs two basic strategies. First, remove all potential stress factors that contribute to disease or block the ability to heal. These include toxic chemicals, heavy metals, infections, nutritional insufficiency, emotional problems, excess weight, postural misalignments, and unresolved physical trauma. Second, improve the body�s internal resistance to disease by preventive nutrition, bolstering the immune system, and enhancing the vitality of all the body�s cells through various nontoxic strategies. Anyone who comes to Dr. Edelson�s clinic receives a range of diagnostic tests to see which treatment will work best. These can include conventional �baseline scanning procedures,� such as X-rays, CAT scans, ultrasound, and blood workups, but it can also involve new diagnostic innovations, such as the AMAS early cancer antibody screening test which is 94% accurate. Dr. Edelson carries out thyroid hormone and endocrine system evaluations for early-stage but not advanced cancers. Further, Dr. Edelson conducts nutritional status evaluations and immune response studies. These tests provide him a detailed baseline picture of the relative strength or �competence� of the cancer patient�s immune system and its specific cells. They also enable Dr. Edelson to objectively assess cancer regression and the body�s response to treatments in the months to follow, and to alter them if needed. Dr. Edelson�s alternative cancer approach has three principal parts: major dietary changes, the use of unconventional therapies, and the administration of his unique ChemoPrev� program. ANTI-CANCER DIET PLAN. Once he determines the patient�s vitamin and mineral levels, antioxidant status, and degree of nutrient imbalance, Dr. Edelson recommends major dietary changes to treat the existing cancer and to prevent future recurrences. EMPHASIZE THESE FOODS. Recom-mended are steamed and raw vegetables, raw fruit and fresh juices, organic whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, miso, seaweed, and shiitake mushrooms. All fruits and most vegetables should be eaten raw to preserve their vital enzymes. AVOID ANIMAL PRODUCTS. Specifically, it�s best to eliminate red meats, poultry, most fish, fatty, smoked, and cured meats, butter, cream, cheese, and commercial whole milk. Animal products are discouraged because these foods tend to concentrate a large number of environmental pollutants. REJECT PROCESSED FOODS. Items to eliminate include margarine and commercial oils, vegetable shortening, coconut and palm oils, deep-fat fried foods, rich desserts (high in sugar, fats, white flour), white flour bakery goods including pasta, and all highly processed foods. Further, use a water filter for all drinking water to remove chemical impurities. ALTERNATIVE CANCER THERAPIES. Dr. Edelson�s approach blends immune-enhancing and detoxification methods that have demonstrated anticancer effectiveness in both the scientific literature and the clinical setting (see chart for details). Dr. Edelson is a firm believer in using aggressive detoxification measures every day of the treatment. All drugs, chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, and other pollutants must first be �biotransformed� or made less toxic in the body before they can be excreted. Here you must be careful, Dr. Edelson advises, because if you don�t find a way to strengthen this transformation of toxins, �you�re going to make things much worse.� That�s because �the liver accumulates rather than eliminates toxins and the cancer patient, under conventional care, often eventually dies from the excessive buildup of liver toxins compounded by severe malnutrition and lean tissue loss.� Thus, the liver must be supported with nutritional and herbal products, enzyme therapy, and caffeine enemas, which aid detoxification. Most of Dr. Edelson�s patients are encouraged to completely redo their lifestyle to achieve the least toxic burden for the body fighting cancer. This means reducing their exposure to polluted air and water, chemicalized products, and mercury, found in both dental amalgams and the environment. Dr. Edelson also advises his patients to minimize any vigorous aerobic exercise; walking is okay, but anything more strenuous churns up more free radicals in the body, which can actually �feed� the cancer. In general, Dr. Edelson says, the more you can reduce the total burden on the immune system and detoxification pathways away from the �normal� levels we�re forced to handle every day, the more power you put into your ability to fight the cancer.� ChemoPrev PROGRAM. ChemoPrev� is the trade name Dr. Edelson uses for his line of nutritional, herbal, and antioxidant products specifically targeted at cancer (see chart for details). �I put my patients on this basic antioxidant, amino acid, mineral, vitamin preparation, then I add a number of my ChemoPrev� products, such as selenium and vitamin E, in much larger doses, specifically for the cancer treatment,� Dr. Edelson explains. ChemoPrev is designed differently for men and women and dosage levels are based on optimum daily allowances. These are calculated to give the patient the nutrient levels necessary to make sure all biochemical systems work at top efficiency in dealing with the toxic internal and external environments. Treating cancer is a multifaceted process. �I always advise patients to get opinions from oncologists and at times to mix conventional and complementary therapies for a better overall outcome.� For advanced cancers, Dr. Edelson sometimes advocates the use of conventional cancer therapies, in which case he recommends that a patient also work with an oncologist. �The treatment is far more effective when you use the poisons, such as chemotherapy, together with the substances that are going to improve the immune system and detoxify the body.� The problem with today�s oncologists, says Dr. Edelson, is that they rarely consider the adverse effects of all the toxins produced by the therapies they use. �They wonder why their patients are getting sick and not getting well. It�s because they�re not dealing with the most critical aspect of therapy�detoxification. They rarely use methods to stimulate immune function or to protect the body from the free radicals released from chemotherapy.� Among the clearest benefits of an alternative medicine approach, Dr. Edelson states, is its capacity to improve the quality of life and to extend the survival rate of people with cancer. �We cannot yet predict who is going to beat cancer and who is not. It takes a considerable amount of commitment to see your healing process through, but we know you can lengthen your life-span on our program.� Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing WT01-B17-124IA043-000786-B041-472http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue10/i10-a04.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305120225 text/html 10092HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 11:59:54 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html Feature Article (issue #10) [Go to the Table of Contents] You Don't Have To Be Sick By BURTON GOLDBERG Like many American taxpayers, until recently I believed that the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), within the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., was there to provide citizens with information about alternatives in disease treatment. When I recently inquired what OAM had on alternative cancer treatments, I was shocked to discover that all they offer is party-line conventional methods courtesy of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) which seems to exist solely to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on unproductive research and the suppression of effective alternatives. Until earlier this year, OAM sent out a free copy of the �Cancer� chapter from our Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide to those who needed information on alternative cancer treatments. This has stopped abruptly. Now OAM sends out a 3-page statement that dismisses �unconventional� treatments as being essentially worthless and unproven. Here�s what their �Cancer Facts� sheet says: First, �Many proponents of unconventional methods of cancer treatment make claims that are not or cannot be scientifically confirmed.� The proof is in the clinic. Ask the patients who have been healed; study the medical reports of the doctors who have produced these healings. Science is based on real observation, not abstract theory. Alternative physicians observe their patients and adjust accordingly. I ask the NCI: where is the scientific proof for the claims that chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery are effective in treating cancer? The proof does not exist. Second, �Practition-ers of unconventional treatments are held to the same research standards as those of any scientist.� This means they must be evaluated in controlled double-blind clinical trials. This is impossible and inappropriate given the way alternative therapies work. They are based on a multifaceted treatment; very often an �unconventional� cancer doctor uses several dozen substances and therapies at the same time to get the best combined effect. There is no single magic bullet in the alternative approach; conventional research standards are worthless with respect to proving what works in our kind of medicine. Further, each patient is different and needs a different dosage and combination of remedies. There is no single boilerplate recipe for treating cancer. Third, the OAM paper advises readers that �because treatments for cancer must be very powerful, they frequently have unpleasant side effects.� This is shameful. Of course chemotherapy and radiation are powerful: like a nuclear bomb, they kill everything in sight. The side effects are not �unpleasant;� they are always toxic and sometimes fatal. There are almost always no �side effects� in alternative cancer approaches; there are only healing effects because the remedies and therapies actually work with the body, not against. Fourth, OAM states that if you use unconventional methods this �may result in the loss of valuable time and the opportunity to receive potentially effective therapy.� This �consequently reduces a patient�s chances for cure or control of cancer.� Since when does conventional oncology ever talk in terms of �cure�? The alarming fact is that the reverse is true: If you rely on conventional methods, you are much more likely to lose time and possibly your life than if you gave the alternatives a chance. Many people with cancer die because of their misplaced trust in chemotherapy and radiation. Fifth, �No one genuinely committed to finding better ways to treat a disease would knowingly keep an effective treatment a secret or try to suppress such a treatment.� This is an amazing piece of contortionist propaganda. OAM offers this in defense of the claim by alternative doctors that the mainstream medical community tries to keep their alternative treatments from the public. The fact is that medical alternatives are suppressed, so we must conclude that the OAM, NIH, and NCI, by their own statement, are not genuinely committed to finding better ways to treat disease because they actively suppress information about these treatments. These are the cancer facts. The betrayals come next. The OAM was set up a few years ago at the instigation of a few well-intentioned members of Congress. Granted, they gave OAM only a few million dollars to work with to investigate the claims and successes of a burgeoning medical field, but the project was launched with a good measure of enthusiasm, integrity, and promise. However, the fatal mistake was placing OAM within the NIH. This is like asking the fox to guard the chicken coop. How can NIH, dedicated to conventional methods, objectively oversee the investigation of alternatives? What NIH can oversee quite skillfully is the adulteration, perversion, and ruin of a publicly-funded office that was supposed to fairly inform the taxpayer about new and alternative treatments for disease. From what I�ve heard through the Washington grapevine, the OAM has been sanitized and made submissive by NIH, so that it is now an obedient and unproductive bureaucracy. People who know about alternative medicine are being forced out while people who are indifferent to it or lack any working knowledge of it are pushed to the forefront. Projects are being derailed, funds are wasted, and public information activities are staffed by people unsympathetic to alternative medicine. Now, information available to the public is restricted to only those alternative treatments with the NIH seal of approval. We might as well have the FDA running the show for all the legitimate attention alternative therapies will receive in this climate of lying and betrayal of the public trust. But as NIH, NCI, and OAM are financed by our tax dollars�my money and yours�I am not willing to settle for this betrayal. I hope you�re not either. We�re paying for it. We must demand better because they�re supposed to be working for us. The life you save may be your own. The cancer fact is this: cancer is treatable and reversible using alternative therapies. The betrayal is in OAM�s refusal to tell the public and in their NIH-inspired lie that unconventional methods are medically suspect. I challenge OAM Director Wayne Jonas, M.D., to talk with our alternative cancer doctors and examine their results. We have seen cancer reversed; we have talked with the patients and taken their testimonials. The public has a right to learn this, especially when it is funding a government office supposedly chartered for precisely that purpose. OAM must be allowed to operate independently of NIH�s party line. The lies and betrayals of the conventional medicine establishment are coming to light. We must all use our citizen�s right to call, fax, complain, demand, and vote until we have a medical system able to serve our health needs.

DAVIS & CORAZON IBARRA-ILARINA, M.D. Vision is something that everyone takes for granted until you wake up one morning and find yourself suddenly going blind. When I looked in the mirror and saw a small spot in front of my eyes, I quickly convinced myself it was nothing to worry about. I went to work as usual but by the afternoon the spot had grown larger and I went to an eye doctor. My left eye tested normal, but my right eye showed a vision loss of 25%. A follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist revealed that the retina was not detached or torn. By the next day, my visual loss was about 30% and continuing to degenerate and I was beginning to panic. A month went by and my visual loss was now 60%. I had seen several M.D.s, two neural ophthalmologists, a rheumatology specialist, and a retina surgeon, yet all I had was a mountain of medical bills and a battery of negative test results. Except for the antinuclear antibody blood test that checks the condition of the immune system: this came back abnormal. Meanwhile, I was on large doses of solumedrol, a steroid that the doctors hoped would activate my immune system. There was no improvement, however, and at 6 weeks my right eye was 96% blind and its vision split and blurred. The doctors still had no answers when the vision in my left eye began to deteriorate much more quickly than the right. Two weeks later, I had lost almost 75% of the vision in that eye. With both eyes almost blind, I was no longer able to care for myself. I could not drive, cook, clean the house, or do everyday things. My medical bills were in excess of $50,000 and I had given up hope of ever knowing what was wrong. Then I heard about a homeopathic medical doctor in Reno, Nevada, who might be able to help me. Corazon Ibarra-Ilarina, M.D, was the only person I talked to who said she had seen something like this before and had actually achieved some success in treating it. My other doctors did not see how a homeopathic doctor could help me when conventional medicine had not made any progress. They were at the point of believing that my blindness was purely psychosomatic. I went to Dr. Ibarra-Ilarina�s clinic expecting some type of �voodoo� to fix what was in my mind. Dr. Ibarra-Ilarina tested my �circulation efficiency� and toxicity. She did this by measuring the electrical tension of the skin on my fingers and toes, a process called electro-dermal screening. I thought this was crazy at first, but then Dr. Ibarra-Ilarina told me something that proved to me this was not a hoax. She said that my body was registering radioactivity and wanted to know if I had been around anything that would cause this. �No,� I replied, but then I remembered the test the doctors had given me in the hospital which required me to take a pill that was radioactive. So there was something to this screening test after all. My toxicity levels topped the scales. I had a severe �circulation efficiency� problem on account of the toxins in my body. This was strange to us both because I had no history of toxic exposure and had never been sick except for a pseudo-stroke I had when I was 18. But I fully recovered from that in 6 weeks. Dr. Ibarra-Ilarina said that if she could correct these problems, I might have a chance of regaining some of my vision. So I began a daily supplementation program of vitamins, herbs, homeopathic remedies, hydrogen peroxide, and chelation therapy. In 10 days the vision in my left eye began to return and the blurriness disappeared. My vision continued to improve. In all, I spent a month at the clinic receiving treatments daily, after which time the vision in my left eye was at almost 100% and the vision in my right eye was 60%. Now, four months later, my vision has stayed the same. I am back at work and leading a normal life. I have adjusted to having only 60% vision in one eye because it is 60% more than I had six months ago.

TAYLOR, M.D. I expect many readers understand the problems produced by the restrictive nature of medical orthodoxy. I am unsure of the existence of a true conspiracy but I believe that conventional medicine is bound by research money and a 100-year old tradition of reliance on the pseudoscience of synthetic drugs. This pseudoscience started off innocently enough as the germ theory proposed by Pasteur in the early 19th century, but it slipped into the search for magic bullets and the use of patented drugs. Since then, money and politics have retarded true progress in medicine and cost the lives of patients, as this story shows. Sharon came to our clinic with metastatic breast cancer. Standard oncology treatments had failed, yet after two series of treatments by our methods, Sharon�s X-rays revealed that her cancer had stopped spreading to the bones. She gained weight, her appetite improved, and her pain was gone. We had treated her with our alternative, multifactorial program and intravenous �Immunostim.� This is a nontoxic combination of ammonium compounds, phosphorus, and salts of silicate, all of which have been used in medicine for years. None are on the FDA�s restricted drugs list. In our studies, 80% of patients showed tumor shrinkage after taking Immunostim. MEDICAL POLITICS KILLS PATIENTS. Yet the medical board and city police of San Diego raided and closed our offices. Meanwhile, Sharon�s oncologist called us for more Immunostim, but none was available. Despite petitions by Sharon�s attorney and oncologist to obtain more Immunostim, all requests were ignored. Six months after our clinic was closed, Sharon died. Obviously, no one can tell whether more Immunostim would have saved Sharon�s life. It is a crime that police action, illegal search-and-seizure methods, and political pressures halted the safe and legal use of compounds which have been used in mainstream medicine for years. FAILURES OF CONVENTIONAL THERAPY. Conventional medicine�s so-called treatments are failures, except in the case of a few rare cancers. Chemotherapy is effective against only 7% of cancers. There has been no improvement in treatments, based upon longevity statistics, for over 30 years; millions of dollars and decades of experimentation have not produced a reliable system that cures cancer. The promotion of chemotherapy constitutes medicine's most heinous fraud. Further, the science of medicine and especially cancer treatment has omitted or forgotten the human spirit as a fact of life and health, which is probably why it rigorously avoids the word �cure.� SCIENCE AT ODDS WITH PHYSIOLOGY. Human physiology and the experimental methods currently in use are at serious odds. Trying to kill or destroy the cancer is the misguided basis of allopathic methods. Cancer research has been on the wrong trail in its search for a magic bullet. Using poisons as medicines is not the answer. There is overwhelming evidence that cancer is multifactorial. Therefore, no one single substance, poison, or �magic bullet� can cure it. INDIVIDUAL RESPONSE TO TREATMENT. The medicine of the future will be concerned with maintaining and restoring good health. That is the goal of our treatment team. In my estimation, 60-80% of cancers are preventable. We are concerned with a patient�s individual response to treatment and we are opposed to double-blind studies and tightly controlled research groupings where all patients are given the identical treatment. This approach ignores the facts of individual differences and how multiple treatments work together physiologically. MALIGNANCIES CAN BE REVERSED. Malignancies are diseases that are multifactorial and involve multiple body systems. Local treatments to destroy cancers can be effective only if the factors known to cause cancer are removed and if the body systems are working at their optimum level. For example, cancer of the breast is not limited to the breast. Even before it spreads, other organs and body systems are involved in its creation. KEYS TO SUCCESSFUL TREATMENTS. Almost all alternative cancer treatments are based upon nutrition, detoxification, and immune system support. Successful treatment should consider individual differences because persons with the same cell type may require different treatments, and vice versa. Identification of pathophysiological conditions and their causes is a fundamental aspect of successful cancer treatment. If this step is omitted, the factors that encouraged malignant change in the first place may continue to cause its recurrence. NUTRITION FOR BODY SYSTEMS. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and fibers constitute the macronutrients. The most important medical fact concerning macronutrients is that by controlling the ratio of these foods in the diet the physician can control the most important hormone system in the body, the prostaglandins, which regulate inflammatory responses and pain control. There are about 50 essential nutrients that must be provided in optimum doses and in forms easily absorbed by the body. These are the vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids, and fibers. Chemotherapy destroys the ability of the intestines to absorb and assimilate these nutrients and also tends to destroy enzyme-producing cilia of the small intestine. Therefore, we check all our patients for bowel function. ELIMINATE ALL TOXINS. Identifying and eliminating toxins is a standard procedure in our treatment. Free radicals are not often listed as toxins, but their presence in the body encourages cell damage and gene mutation. Heavy metal toxicity may be a factor inciting the development of cancerous growths. Testing hair, urine, blood, and teeth can help identify this problem. The main organs of detoxification are the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and the intestines. Our treatments monitor and improve the function of these �waste management systems� through antioxidants, high doses of ascorbic acid, and often EDTA chelation. Chronic infections, especially those of the gums and teeth, interfere with healing cancer. Another proven source of internal toxins is the overgrowth of Candida, a common bowel fungus. Bowel and systemic candidiasis are common after the excessive use of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and chemotherapy. STRENGTHEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. Our research shows that nearly all types of cancer patients have abnormalities in several immune cells (specifically, T4, T8, and IL-2 leukocytes). The use of the drugs interferon and interleukins by oncologists is based upon the theory that strengthening the immune system will help the body fight the cancer. Clinical reports on those drugs have been disappointing, so we use nutritional and hormonal manipulations to support the immune system. THE IMPORTANCE OF HOPE FOR HEALING. Fear and depression often follow the standard diagnosis of cancer. The continued presence of these emotions stimulates the production of destructive hormones such as cortisone which, in turn, cause the cancer to spread. Unless the hope of healing is present, a downward destructive cycle is likely to take place. False hope is the result of misinforming the patient. It occurs most frequently in the use of radiation and chemotherapy. First, the treatment does no good; second, it causes unnecessary side effects; and third, it is an expense which could be avoided. False hope can be prevented by giving the patient and family comprehensive information concerning treatment options, statistics regarding benefits and possible complications. RESTORING THE ART OF MEDICINE. Restoring the art of medicine to the treatment of cancer means restoring compassion, faith, and healing. These powers may not be measurable by scientific methods, but they are real. Alternative medicine doctors use nontoxic multimodal therapies. These treatments cannot be �proven� successful using current scientific methods, but they do improve the quality of life. The treatment program I�ve outlined here is one that supports good health. It may not be a �miracle� cure, but it is surely good medicine.

Prostate problems account for an estimated 5.5 million doctor visits, 950,000 hospitalizations, 43,500 deaths, and about $7 billion in medical bills every year, states Michael B. Schachter, M.D., a physician practicing in Suffern, New York. According to Dr. Schachter, there are a number of dietary and nutritional steps any man can take today to either prevent or treat a swollen prostate (called benign prostatic hyperplasia) or an inflamed prostate (called prostatitis). General Diet. A diet high in fiber, high in complex carbohydrates, low in fat, and moderate in protein is advisable. Substances to Avoid. Avoid sugar, alcohol, caffeine, tobacco, white flour products, hydrogenated fats, food additives and chemicals, fluoride, chlorine, aluminum and Teflon cookware, nonprescription recreational drugs, mercury amalgam fillings, electric blankets, and hair dyes. Zinc Picolinate. Take 15-60 mg daily. As the prostate contains 10 times more zinc than any other body organ, this is the single most important prostate nutrient, states Dr. Schachter. Vitamin B6. Also called pyridoxine, B6 enhances the absorption of zinc; take 50-300 mg daily. Magnesium. Take 200-600 mg daily of elemental magnesium in glycinate or taurate form. Magnesium aids muscle function and boosts the immune system as it deals with infections. Saw Palmetto. Taken at the rate of 2 capsules, 80 mg each, 2 times daily, saw palmetto berry is effective in treating many male urogenital conditions without suppressing sexual interest. Pygeum Africanum. This substance, derived from an African evergreen tree, taken at the dosage of 25-50 mg daily (in a 200:1 concentrate), contains substances that act against inflammations and bacteria. It has been used in Europe to treat prostate problems since the early 1980s. Stinging Nettle. Used in combination with Pygeum, at the rate of 150-300 mg daily (at a 5:1 concentration), stinging nettle leaves enhance its effects, strengthening urinary flow. Cernilton Flower Pollen. This substance (6-12 capsules at 500 mg each daily) removes obstructions to urine flow; bee pollen works well, too. Flaxseed Oil. This oil contains alpha linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid necessary for making hormones that work against inflammation and cancer. Take 1-2 tablespoons or 12 capsules daily. Evening Primrose Oil. This contains gamma linolenic acid, an omega-6 essential fatty acid, with the same action as flaxseed oil. Take 6-12 capsules at 500 mg each daily. Vitamin E. Take 1 capsule (400 I.U.) 2 times daily. Other. Dr. Schachter recommends taking sodium selenite (elemental selenium) at the rate of 200-400 mcg daily; copper sebacate (elemental copper) at 4 mg daily; amino acids (glycine, alanine, glutamic acid) 6 capsules daily; and a multivitamin/ mineral pill.

Your Hands Can Stop a Heart Attack. And Energize Your Body There are particular locations on your body, called Energy Sphere Points, which you can lightly touch with your fingertips, to stop a heart attack, seizure, or asthma attack, or to revitalize your whole body with energy, says Glenn King, director of the Glenn King Institute for Better Health in Dallas, Texas. King is the foremost U.S. practitioner of a little known Japanese art called Ki-Iki-Jutsu (pronounced key-ee-key-joot-soo), which means, literally, �breath-of-life art.� In practical terms, it�s a finger-delivered form of therapy that �allows the body by its own tremendous power to heal itself by unconstricting any stagnation or blockage of the natural energy circulatory patterns,� King explains. Subtle body energy (known in Chinese medicine as Qi, presented by King as Ki, pronounced chee) flows along regular pathways throughout the body. Press gently on the right points and you can treat seizures, chronic pain, insomnia, depression, migraines, memory loss, lymph disorders, and other more serious health conditions. Heart Attack. A partner is required to perform this. Place your right fingertips (fingerpads) on the heart attack victim�s 5th thoracic vertebra (the 12th vertebra down from the top of the neck; see illustration) while your left hand holds the little finger of the patient�s left hand. �This prompt action has consistently stopped heart attacks in progress,� states King. It can shift a person from being on the verge of entering cardiac arrest into a state of no sign of heart arrhythmia, pain, or discoloration within 2 minutes, on average, King says, adding that these results have been confirmed by cardiologists. William Lee Cowden, M.D., for one, has used Ki-Iki-Jutsu successfully on 12 patients. Seizures. Firmly hold both big toes of the person or firmly grasp both thumbs to stop the seizure. Asthma Attack. Place the fingertips of your right hand on the patient�s 3rd thoracic vertebra (10th vertebrae down from the top of the neck; see illustration). With your left hand, hold the middle finger of the patient�s left hand for 3-4 minutes, then hold the middle finger of the patient�s right hand for 3-4 minutes, then the left again, until the attack subsides. Anaphylactic Shock. Place one hand on the patient�s first thoracic vertebra (the 8th vertebra down from the top of the neck; see illustration) while placing the other on top edge of the sternum, just below the trachea, until the symptoms subside. Whole-Body Energizing. �Use this simple technique to revitalize the circulation of energy throughout your body, relax tension, promote mental alertness, and improve sleep,� King advises. The sequence of 8 steps should take about 24 minutes. Use the fingertips of your index, middle, and ring fingers. Only light finger contact, not pressure, is required. Lie down on a comfortable surface. Step 1: Place your right hand fingertips on the top center of your head; place your left hand fingertips between the eyebrows. Hold for 3 minutes. Keep your right hand fingertips in this location until you reach step 8: Step 2: Place your left hand fingertips at the tip of your nose; hold for 3 minutes. Step 3: Place your left hand fingertips at the center of the top edge of the sternum; hold for 3 minutes. Step 4: Place your left hand fingertips at the center of your sternum; hold for 3 minutes. Step 5: Place your left hand fingertips at the bottom end of your sternum; hold for 3 minutes. Step 6: Place your left hand fingertips at your navel; hold for 3 minutes. Step 7: Place your left hand fingertips at the top center of your pubic bone; hold for 3 minutes. Step 8: Place your right hand fingertips at the tip of your tailbone or coccyx; keep the left hand fingertips on the top center of your pubic bone for 3 minutes.

Nutritional Relief for Arthritis Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly prescribed for arthritis, they can produce irritation and inflammation, even ulcers, in the gastrointestinal tract. There are effective nutritional alternatives for treating arthritis, says Seattle, Washington, physician Ralph Golan, M.D. Medications. If you must stay on conventional arthritis medications, take licorice root extract (deglycyrrhizinated, up to 1000 mg daily) to protect your intestinal mucosa. Diet. Eat whole foods to minimize your consumption of free radicals and trans-fatty acids. Eat liberal amounts of cherries and bilberries; stay away from the nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, tobacco) for 3 months. Detoxify. Do a bowel cleansing followed by a liver flush; do a one-day fast; brush your skin every day with a hairbrush. Vitamins. Take beta carotene (15,000-25,000 I.U. daily); vitamin E (400-800 I.U. daily); vitamin C (2000-3000 mg daily); vitamin B6 (50-100 mg daily). Minerals. Take zinc (30 mg daily); selenium (200 mcg daily); copper (2-3 mg daily); manganese (up to 100 mg daily for 6-12 months, then reduce to 20 mg daily). Supplements. These include methionine (250 mg daily, in 3 doses); glucosamine sulfate (500-1000 mg, 3 times daily); shark cartilage capsules (up to 2200 mg, 3 times daily); EPA fish oil (up to 1000 mg, 3 times daily) with borage oil capsules (2-3 times daily, for a total of 500 mg daily of gamma linolenic acid); niacinamide (up to 1000 mg, 3 times daily); high doses can temporarily irritate the liver, so check with your doctor). Herbs. Recommended here are hawthorn berry (1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of solid extract, 2-3 times daily); bilberry (up to 80 mg in capsule form, 3 times daily); Boswellia serrata, an Ayurvedic herb (150 mg, 3 times daily); turmeric, yucca, and devil�s claw; (as a combination formula, take 3-4 capsules, 3 times daily); cayenne ointment rubbed into the skin at the arthritic areas; sea cucumber extract (follow product instructions). Herbal bromelain contains the traditional arthritis herbs mentioned above, plus black cohosh, ginger, celery, onion, and feverfew. Other Therapies. The following supportive therapies may also bring relief: DHEA hormone supplementation; alternating hot and cold packs on the affected area; bee venom injections; exercise, such as swimming and isometrics; and chiropractic adjustments to correct structural abnormalities (legs that are different lengths, postural problems).

STAY SEXUALLY FIT DURING MALE MENOPAUSE It�s well known that in most men over 50, the body�s levels of testosterone, the prime male sex hormone, start to decline. Symptoms of testosterone deficiency can typically include fatigue, lowered sex drive, slower hair growth, less virility, sometimes impotence, and a weakening of the muscles and testicles. Other men, of course, remain robustly healthy and virile into their eighties. Is there a male menopause? Sandra Cabot, M.D., suggests there might be more fact than myth to this idea. While male hormone replacement therapy is an option, there is also a nutritional strategy men can apply that can start improving the functioning of their endocrine system (the source of all hormones) and their testicles. Here are Dr. Cabot�s daily male menopause recommendations: Vitamin E: 500 I.U. Magnesium: 500 mg Zinc: 50 mg Selenium: 50 mcg Manganese: 5 mg Ginseng: 2000-4000 mg Royal Jelly: 2000-4000 mg Balanced B vitamin complex: 1 tablet Evening primrose oil: 3000 mg Dr. Cabot�s male meno-pause kit, taken daily, is designed to help the male body cope with the natural decline of testosterone. Ginseng, for example, acts as a glandular tonic, helping to improve the function of the testicles. Royal Jelly, rich in choline, indirectly helps improve sexual performance and response. Evening primrose oil supplies fatty acids that aid the production and release of hormones. Zinc can boost male virility and reduce prostate problems such as swelling. Vitamin E and magnesium strengthen the heart and blood circulation, including blood supply to the pelvic region.

Toxic chemicals stored in the blood and body tissues pose a serious threat to mental and physical health and underlie many otherwise baffling medical problems, including addictions, states Zane Gard, M.D. Dr. Gard treated a male teenager, aged 14, who exhibited long-term emotional and behavioral problems including uncontrollable anger and belligerence. This condition was the result of the teenager�s chronic exposure to chemicals used by his mother in her painting business. The youth resorted to marijuana and cocaine as a means of coping with the disturbing changes he was experiencing in himself, says Dr. Gard. Conventional interventions, including a school rehabilitation program, failed to improve the teenager�s condition. Dr. Gard put him on his BioToxic Reduction Program� which emphasized detoxification through heat (called hyperthermia) to stimulate the body�s excretion of toxins. Dr. Gard�s program includes dry sauna (ventilated thermal chamber), nutritional supplementation, massage, electroacuscope therapy (an energy medicine device that reduces pain by stimulating tissue repair), and enzyme therapy. The idea is to get the patient to perspire more, to increase the blood circulation, and to move toxic residues from the fatty tissues into the bloodstream for elimination from the body. The detoxification flushing program continues for 3-4 weeks, accompanied by exercise, prolonged perspiration, and substance abuse counseling. Following the detoxification program, Dr. Gard found the teenager notably improved in attitude and mental clarity, and free of drugs; in addition, he returned to being �a loving, thoughtful person.� SOURCE: �Why Is Irritability, Anger and Viciousness Increasing?� Zane R.

Hugh Fudenberg, M.D., conclude that treatment with ozone and a multimodal program can produce a 95% success rate in terms of normalizing laboratory test results and the physical and mental well-being of patients. They call their AIDS treatment approach Life Science Universal (LSU) and it includes a 12-day ozone program (30-35 mg daily of ozone per 154 pounds of body weight, delivered intravenously), supplementation with vitamins, minerals, and herbs, psychological counseling, �reconditioning� (which involves a 12-step goal-setting program), internal energy exercises, and a mostly vegetarian diet with no dairy products. In an addition, they use 8 adjunctive therapies, such as homeopathy, Chinese herbs, acupuncture, coffee enemas, heat therapy, thymus extracts, and feedback control electrical stimulation (including ear acupuncture using electric currents), when needed. Of 119 patients for whom post-treatment laboratory results were available, 53 (45%) had their T4 immune cells return to normal; other key blood factors also became normal again. For another 46 patients (39%), their T-cell count increased by at least 200. Of 91 patients graded HIV-positive, 75% saw their conditions change to HIV-negative after completing the program. Most of the patients receiving this treatment �showed a significant improvement of their general well-being and of most of their clinical symptoms,� state Drs. Sartori and Fudenberg.

Dr. J�rg Birkmayer, M.D., of Vienna, Austria, conducted a clinical trial with 17 Alzheimer�s patients, treating them for 8-12 weeks with NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). First identified in 1934, this is a coenzyme chemical, naturally found in human cells which is necessary for energy production. In Alzheimer�s patients, NADH cellular activity is 25%-50% lower than in healthy individuals of comparable age. Therefore, boosting NADH levels of Alzheimer�s patients should reduce the symptoms and halt the development of Alzheimer�s, states Dr. Birkmayer. Dr. Birkmayer gave NADH at a dosage of 10 mg once a day, 30 minutes before breakfast. After only 2 weeks of NADH treatment, Dr. Birkmayer observed a 240% increase in NADH activity at the cellular level in his patients; there were also noticeable improvements in their mental functions. Various clinical tests of mental ability further revealed dramatic improvements, even in those patients who had the most severe form of dementia. In over 3000 individuals who have taken NADH, not a single side effect has been reported; NADH appears to be safe even at levels 7000 times higher than the recommended dose, says Dr. Birkmayer.

New clinical studies (1995) from Sun Yet Sen University of Medical Sciences in China have shown that devil�s claw root extract can bring relief for osteoarthritis. A total of 40 patients (aged 38-52) received daily dosages of Pagosid�, a standardized water-based extract of devil�s claw root, for 4 weeks at the dosage rate of 500 mg daily. Drs. Yin Peida and Yang Xiuyan reported that it had a positive effect in 5 major areas, such as relieving inflammation, reducing swelling, and improving joint mobility. The doctors rated the effectiveness of the herbal therapy at 85%, while the patients rated it 90%. In a parallel study (1995) of 38 patients, doctors at the First Military Medical University, also in China, gave arthritis patients one gram of Pagosid every day for 4 weeks. The doctors rated Pagosid 79% effective as patients reported relief from their arthritic conditions, including joint swelling, morning stiffness, and lowered grip strength. The effectiveness rating for osteoarthritis was 85%; for rheumatoid arthritis, 75%; and for ankylosing spondylitis, 67%. The patients rated Pagosid�s general effectiveness slightly higher, at 81.5%, and for arthritis specifically at 85%. A third study (1995) conducted by Drs. Cui Jinfang and Shi Puzhen at the People�s Hospital of Guandong Province in China, involved 58 osteoarthritis patients who took one gram of Pagosid every day for 2-4 weeks. Pagosid produced an 86.7% improvement in their osteoarthritis symptoms. The only side effect noted was a mild, generalized, scattered skin rash in one patient out of 58.

ASTHMA. Childhood asthma may be an allergic reaction to impaired digestion and lack of proper enzymes, reports Jonathan V. Wright, M.D., of Tahoma Clinic in Kent, Washington. He bases this on his treatment of Bobby, aged 7, who had suffered with asthma for most of his life. In the past 2 years, Bobby had been rushed to the hospital 5 times for asthma attacks and he used his inhaler frequently. Previous doctors had him eliminate dairy products, sugars, food chemicals, and refined carbohydrates, and to rotate specific foods. In addition, Bobby�s parents give him daily dosages of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg in 3 doses), magnesium (125 mg, 3 times), vitamin B6 (50 mg, 3 times), vitamin C (1000 mg, 3 times), a high-potency multiple vitamin-mineral (1/3 adult dosage, 3 times), and cod liver oil (1 tablespoon). This regimen had improved his condition by only about 50% when they brought him to Dr. Wright. Dr. Wright pointed out that research published in 1931 showed that of 200 asthmatic children, 80% had digestive problems, specifically, low amounts of pepsin and hydrochloric acid in the stomach. This deficiency slows down digestion and nutrient absorption and turns foods into allergy-producing substances in the body; the allergies then generate the asthma. Also, when the stomach functions poorly, vitamin B12 absorption is limited when taken orally. Dr. Wright gave Bobby vitamin B12 through injections, knowing that for 50% of his patients, this approach eliminates wheezing, and for 30%, it produces major improvements. Six months later when Bobby�s wheezing was gone, Dr. Wright had him take pepsin and hydro-chloric acid tablets, keeping the vitamin B12 injections at maintenance level and continuing with the oral supplements described above. �All of this was several years ago, and he remains free of asthma,� states Dr. Wright.

Childhood autism may be successfully treated in some cases by applying antifungal drugs, according to the results of a research team at The Children�s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, headed by William Shaw, Ph.D., and Enrique Chaves, M.D. Urine analysis of autistic children suggests there may be a metabolic factor involved in the onset of autism, state the doctors. In other words, autistic patients may be infected and even colonized with fungi and yeast that may be adversely affecting their behavior. Chief among the metabolic by-products discovered in the urine are tartaric and citramlic acids, which come from yeasts. In addition, the doctors found traces of 4 substances derived from fungi. On this basis, Drs. Shaw, Chaves, and colleagues treated a small number of autistic children for yeast infection, giving them Mycostatin, a conventional drug used for yeast and fungus infections (also called Nystatin�), at the rate of 100,000 units, 4 times daily for 10 days, given orally. If a follow-up urine sample still indicates traces of yeast and fungus, then a second course of Mycostatin for 2 months is recommended, state Drs. Shaw and Chaves. If traces of yeast and fungus persist, then the child receives treatment with fluconazole (called Diflucan�) at the rate of 2 mg per 2.2 pounds body weight, given as a single daily dose for 2 weeks. A recent study of 19 autistic children conducted by Drs. Shaw, Chaves, and colleagues has produced �favorable responses from the antifungal drug therapy, sometimes within a few days of beginning therapy.� Improvements noted include reduced hyperactivity, better sleep and concentration, and more eye contact and speaking ability. At the same time, for the children with the highest levels originally, the urine concentrations of fungal and yeast declined by 80-95% within the first 10 days of treatment.

BACK PAIN. John Parks Trowbridge, M.D., developed low back pain while training as a track runner at the age of 14. Weekly chiropractic sessions for 5 years failed to eliminate the constant ache and pain. Conventional doctors told him he had inflammation and degeneration in his discs and prescribed painkillers; these fogged his brain but did not stop the pain. When he was 23, he developed severe sciatica down his left leg and spent 2 weeks in the hospital taking strong medications. The painful sciatica periodically returned in the following years. A further series of accidents and spontaneous injuries made Dr. Trowbridge�s back pain far worse. Neck and low back surgery failed to produce lasting improvement. He became so debilitated that all movement was painful. Dr. William Faber, D.O., of the Milwaukee Pain Clinic, began treating Dr. Trowbridge, using reconstructive and neural-fascial therapy. Dr. Faber slowly injected a solution of sodium morrhuate and the anesthetic procaine (up to 100 different solutions are available) into the area of discomfort in the patient�s body, typically at the site where the bone meets the joint. The solution stimulates the body to begin reconstructing the connective tissue. As soon as the injections were complete, Dr. Trowbridge began feeling relief from the deep, aching pain in his back and leg. Over the next weeks, after 3 treatments his neck and back muscles began to strengthen, his need for chiropractic adjustments and conventional medications was reduced, and he felt confident he would not relapse, as he had so often in the previous 25 years. �My back and neck are truly better in every single way as a direct result of these wonderful, tiny but powerful injection treatments,� stated Dr. Trowbridge.

A diagnosis of colon cancer does not have to mean surgery and the discomfort of colostomy, states Edward Leyton, M.D., of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Dr. Leyton treated William, aged 62, who came to him with a diagnosis of colon cancer. He had gnawing abdominal pains, severe coughing spasms, mucus, pus, and bleeding from the bowel. However, William did not want surgery and was willing to try alternatives. First Dr. Leyton put William on a special diet, excluding meats, dairy products, wheat, alcohol, caffeine, tobacco, drugs, processed foods, and sugars, and emphasizing fresh vegetables, fruits, grains, and legumes. Then Dr. Leyton prescribed a series of nutritional supplements, including Ultrabalance� Protein Formula (2 tablespoons, 3 times daily); Herbulk� (3 tablespoons, 3 times daily); Viokase� (lipase enzymes, 2 tablespoons, 2 times daily, with meals); selenium (200 �g daily); zinc gluconate ( 50 mg daily); vitamin E (400 I.U. daily); vitamin C (4000 mg daily); bovine adrenal and thymus extract; and beta carotene (50,000 I.U. daily). In addition, William gave himself 5 water enemas and one coffee enema every day to stimulate the excretion of toxins from his intestines and liver. The treatment succeeded. Technically, this means William�s cancer has been controlled, not cured, but not only is William still alive and healthy 8 years after his diagnosis, he is able to work 12-hour days as a farmer. His bowel symptoms return in much reduced form only when he deviates from his diet. William has already lived more than 5 years beyond the �expected� survival time for this type of cancer, states Dr. Leyton. �He has had no conventional medical intervention, which means that his survival can only be due to nutritional or attitudinal changes.� SOURCE: �Nutritional Intervention in Carcinoma of the Colon,� Edward Leyton, M.D., C.C.F.P., Alternative & Complementary Therapies, September/October 1995, pp. 322-327.

The next time you hear a doctor say there is nothing physically wrong with somebody who has deep, prolonged depression, the clinical results of enzyme therapist Lita Lee, Ph.D., of Eugene, Oregon, should give you grounds for reconsideration. According to Dr. Lee, a lack of suitable enzymes can produce depression. Dr. Lee recently helped a woman, aged 50, who had been diagnosed with manic depression bipolar disorder and obsessive personality and through a series of 12 psychiatric drugs, including Prozac and Lithium. She had gained 100 pounds, developed breast cancer, and become increasingly confused and depressed. Her condition was made worse by the drugs� strong side effects, including nausea and bowel incontinence. On the basis of a urine analysis, Dr. Lee quickly saw that nutritional causes lay at the root of the woman�s depression. Specifically, these were a lack of protease enzymes (necessary to digest proteins), intolerance for sugar, an underactive thyroid, and a �junk-food� diet replete with sugar. Biochemically, undigested protein can produce anxiety, inability to digest sugars (sucrase), panic attacks and depression, while an underactive thyroid can reduce bodily energy, states Dr. Lee. She put her client on 2 digestive formulas for sugar intolerance (containing lactase, sucrase, and maltase enzymes, brewer�s yeast, gota kola, and borage); a protease enzyme formula (plus magnesium and calcium); a formula to drain the lymphatic system (rose hips, alfalfa, Echinacea); and a thyroid glandular supplement. What happened was amazing, especially because this client was not particularly compliant,� notes Dr. Lee. Within 2-3 weeks of beginning the enzyme program, the woman became articulate once more, her humor returned, and all conditions began easing up. As long as she remains on the enzymes, her emotional condition remains stable, reports Dr. Lee.

John Diamond, M.D., at Triad Medical Clinic in Reno, Nevada, having had severe abdominal, lower back, and groin pain for 3 years. Conventional physicians had diagnosed her condition as gastritis and prescribed a standard drug which helped very little; she discontinued it after 6 months. Dr. Diamond used Electro-dermal screening (an energy medicine diagnostic device) to determine the full extent of Ellen�s condition, the energy picture for her body, and which remedies at which strengths would be best for her. Dr. Diamond�s examination also revealed that Ellen had previously had Herpes Zoster (shingles) which developed immediately after the death of her mother; the stomach pain followed. She also had chronic sinusitis and constipation. Dr. Diamond, skilled in homeopathy and acupuncture, injected Ellen at 7 different acupuncture meridian points with a homeopathic vaccination (called a nosode) made from Herpes Zoster itself. He also gave her 10 ampules of homeopathic Herpes Zoster nosode (in ascending strengths, from 6X to 200X) to take orally over several weeks. To provide direct relief of her symptoms, Dr. Diamond prescribed 2 additional homeopathic preparations, including Gastricumeel� (a commercial blend of 6 homeopathic remedies, 2 tablets 3 times daily) and Natrum Muriaticum (1 dose at 1M) for grief and stress triggered by the death of her mother. The pain in her stomach went away first, followed by the groin discomfort. It is well known, though curious, that suppressed grief is associated with the onset of herpes which in this case infected the abdominal nerves, thereby producing the pain. �Follow-up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 1 year revealed complete cessation of gastric pain,� states Dr. Diamond.

Based on his clinical experience of working with 150 patients over a 4-year period, Brent W. Davis, D.C., is confident that cat�s claw (a Peruvian herb called Uncaria tomentosa or u�a de gato) produces beneficial effects on the intestine. �I have seen cat�s claw break through severe intestinal derangements that no other available product can touch,� including diverticulitis, recurring ulcers, Crohn�s disease, irritable and leaky bowel syndrome, and depressed intestinal action, states Dr. Davis. In addition, cat�s claw can clear up long-term parasitic infestations in the intestines involving Blastocystis hominis, entamoebas, and giardia, as if it were breaking up �metabolic log jams� thereby enhancing the effects of other therapies and medicines. Typically, cat�s claw can be administered in the range of 3-25 g daily, in tea or tablet form, states Dr. Davis. As a liquid extract, he usually gives it at the rate of 3 g daily, or 25 drops 3 times daily. Usually Dr. Davis does not exceed 5 g daily during an initial 10-14 day period. The only undesirable action of cat�s claw is that it can produce a loosening of the stools and even transient diarrhea; if this happens, the dosage is reduced.

MENOPAUSE. Sonya, aged 44, complained of anxiety, body sweats, burning hot flashes, broken sleep, and an overactive, constantly �chewing� mind. In addition, she was bloated, her bowels were sluggish, she had missed her last 5 periods, her arms and wrists ached, sometimes feeling as if they were burning, her fingers and arms were numb on waking, sunlight irritated her, she felt hurried and disconnected all the time, and her appetite was voracious. Homeopaths Robert Ullman, N.D., and Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman, N.D., M.S.W., gave Sonya homeopathic Iodum (from iodine), which is indicated for people with an overactive metabolism. Within 24 hours of the first dose, the rushed feeling and mental restlessness were gone, and within 2 weeks, Sonya reported that she was �back on track.� Her hot flashes disappeared and the wrist achiness and finger numbness went away. Two years later, none of the symptoms had returned.

MENSTRUATION. Betty, aged 42, had suffered from painful menstruation since she was 14. She experienced gas, bloating, and irritability for at least a week before her period began. After a death in the family, her symptoms got worse. In fact, on the second day of menstruation, the pain was so strong and sudden (�like a labor pain,� she said), it made her cry out. She also had a drawing pain down her thighs, occasionally accompanied by prickly skin, which was the worse for scratching. Betty was 10 pounds overweight and unable to keep to a weight-reducing diet. Her emotions went up and down like a roller coaster and she was often teary. Homeopath Judith A. Lewis, R.N., N.D., gave Betty one dose of homeopathic Pulsatilla (10M). She cried for 3 hours, releasing emotional tension; her next period came without any of the usual discomfort, then lasted only 3 days instead of 5. Her next two periods were normal and pain-free for the first time in her life. Betty also lost 7 pounds, was more focused at work, and more emotionally calm, says Dr. Lewis.

Jane, aged 18, had considerable premenstrual difficulties including abdominal pain, bloating, cold sweats, disturbed sleep, headaches, lethargy, nausea, skin blemishes, and tension�a total of 22 major symptoms, according to British aromatherapy practitioner J. Noel Hulmston. He developed a 6-month program of using aromatherapy oils for body massage to improve Jane�s condition. For rubbing all across her back, Hulmston selected a 2% mix of equal amounts of chamomile and marjoram essential oils, prepared in a base of sweet almond oil. For massage on the front of her body, Hulmston had Jane use a 2% blend of lavender and clary sage, also in sweet almond oil. On her arms and shoulders, Jane used a 2% blend of rose (in a 10% reduction) mixed with lemongrass, in a sweet almond oil base; for her legs, a 2% mix of lavender and Ylang-ylang; and for her face, a 2% mix of neroli oil. For the treatment Jane applied these oils on the appropriate body areas on days 10 and 5 before the onset of menstruation each month. After 2 months of this, Hulmston changed it to days 7 and 3 before menstruation. After 6 months of aromatherapy treatment, the most serious of Jane�s conditions were �markedly improved,� while her problem with skin blemishes had improved by 50%. In all, 89% of her original symptoms had ceased. SOURCE: �Case Studies�PMS,� J. Noel Hulmston, The International Journal of Aromatherapy, Vol. 6, No. 4, 1995, pp. 24-25.

William, aged 65, had suffered from psoriasis for 15 years. When chiropractor John O. A. Pagano, D.C., examined William, who also had a spinal problem, he was shocked to note the severity of the psoriasis. There were red splotches all over William�s back and thighs; these lesions bled, itched, and produced scales. Over the previous 15 years, Williams had visited a long list of specialists but had seen no improvement in his condition. According to Dr. Pagano, who has successfully treated many hundreds of psoriasis cases, the problem is not in itself a skin disease. The intestinal walls, which have become thin and porous, leech toxins outwards towards the skin, passing first through the lymphatic system, bloodstream, and liver, eventually generating the psoriatic lesions. When the liver, the major filtering gland of the body, is overloaded, the skin comes to the rescue and helps to eliminate toxins,� states Dr. Pagano. A combination of factors�which include poor elimination, faulty diet, misaligned vertebrae, inadequate water intake, negative, unresolved emotions, and hereditary tendencies�produce psoriasis, he explains. Dr. Pagano�s treatment plan includes internal cleansing (colonic irrigation of the intestines through regular enemas, a 3-day apple diet, liberal use of pure water, natural laxatives, and steam cabinets); a shift to a cleansing, nutritious diet, and the use of specific herb teas (such as saffron, slippery elm bark, chamomile, mullein, and watermelon seed); spinal adjustments; external applications (e.g., an olive-peanut oil mixture to apply to the skin, along with castor oil, Epsom salts baths, and ultraviolet light); and positive thinking. William put Dr. Pagano�s treatment into action then returned in one week for an examination. His lesions were 50% improved; after 3 months, all his lesions had disappeared �as completely as if someone had used an eraser on his back,� states Dr. Pagano. William reported one year after ending his treatment, �I can honestly state that there has been no recurrence whatsoever.� SOURCE: Healing Psoriasis: The Natural Alternative, Dr. John O. A.

Increasingly, a toxic body is identified as the predisposing factor in a long list of acute and chronic degenerative illnesses. Signs and symptoms of the toxic body can include constipation, excess weight, bloating, intestinal gas, insomnia, nausea, bad breath, asthma, tension, headaches, depression, stress, allergies, and menstrual problems. When was the last time you cleaned your liver, your heart, your lungs, or your body�s sewage system?� asks nutritionist Lindsey Duncan, C.N., founder of Home Nutrition Clinic in Santa Monica, California, and Nature�s Secret, a specialty health products company in Boulder, Colorado. In case you�ve never �cleaned� your organs, Duncan has a practical solution in a series of inner detoxification products�Super Cleanse�, Ultimate Fiber�, and A.M./P.M. Ultimate Cleanse. The latter is a 2-part vegetarian detoxification formula, containing 29 cleansing herbs, amino acids, antioxidants, digestive enzymes, vitamins, and minerals, and 5 kinds of fiber. Signs that the program is working can include a flu-like feeling, a cold, runny nose, transient pimples, headaches, brain-fog, or fatigue. These symptoms will pass in 1-2 days, says Duncan. The goal is to stimulate, feed, and detoxify the complete internal body, not just the bowel,� states Duncan. �My objective is to address all 5 channels of elimination, as well as the vital organs and tissues.� At the end of the program, a person should be having 2-3 bowel movements every day. Once the internal system is cleaned out, nutrient absorption is more efficient. One user who had endured chronic constipation and bloating for 25 years and only 2-3 bowel movements per week, lost 16 pounds on the program and started moving her bowels up to 3 times daily after being on the formula for 3 weeks. Another user reported that persistent acne (38 years duration), fatigue, and depression cleared up by the time he completed the internal cleansing program. Another client with lifelong migraine headaches learned that her chronic constipation was a major factor; both were resolved as a result of A.M./P.M. Ultimate Cleanse. Better Memory and More Brain Power Smarten Up with a Lecithin-Derived Nutrient Studies indicate that more than 50% of elderly Americans over the age of 65 experience a measurable decline in their mental abilities, particularly in the area of short-term memory and speed of mental processing. A prime reason for this decline in elderly brain function is a distinct drop in the brain levels of certain key chemicals (called neurotransmitters); but this same reason also suggests a practical remedy. Numerous studies have shown that nutritional supplementation with the nutrients known to be essential to efficient brain function improves that functioning. One of these brain chemicals is phosphatidyl-serine (PS), a large lipid molecule also found in trace amounts in lecithin derived from soybeans. Studies show that PS, when given as a supplement, can support brain functions that otherwise decline with age. PS appears to support membrane functions in nerve cells and cell-to-cell communications. Since the 1970s, 34 clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of PS in improving mental abilities. A Belgian study (1986) of 35 hospitalized patients, aged 65-91, all of whom had mild to moderate loss of memory and mental ability, showed that taking PS at the rate of 300 mg per day for 6 weeks produced improvement in 3 different brain function rating scales. An Italian study (1987) involving 87 patients aged 55-80 with moderate brain function loss linked PS to a strong improvement in attention, concentration, and short-term memory, and a reduction in apathy and withdrawal. The clinical studies further show that PS has a good safety record with only minimal side effects. Lucas Meyer, Inc. has developed a means to produce the PS found in soy lecithin in commercially practical quantities, which they market as a dietary supplement, LECI-PS�. Lucas Meyer, Inc., recommends an initial LECI-PS dose of 100-300 mg daily for one month followed by a maintenance dose of 100-200 mg daily, noting that the brain function benefits will fade away when patients stop taking the substance.

Your Heart Rate Can Tell you How Well a Medicine Works Biofeedback Gets Answers from the Nervous System Physicians at The Nevada Clinic in Las Vegas report that a test called Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which has been in development for several decades, is now available as a dependable means of showing how the nervous system responds to any medical therapy, including homeopathic remedies. According to Daniel F. Royal, D.O., of the Nevada Clinic and Medi-Tec Systems, Inc., which distributes HRV technology, HRV testing has the capacity to objectively demonstrate and thus prove the effectiveness of a given remedy. �HRV could supply the alternative medical community with a common testing procedure by which different approaches could be uniformly evaluated and compared,� states Dr. Royal. The advantages of HRV are its speed and specificity. Homeopathic remedies produce changes in several aspects of the nervous system and the heart rate. HRV can measure these subtle but important changes immediately after ingestion of the homeopathic remedy. HRV also has a treatment function. Frequency information, originally obtained by HRV from the patient�s nervous system, is returned (a biofeedback function) to the patient through light and sound waves generated in accordance with the specific rhythm of the heart. Over a 24-minute period, the time between human heart beats varies somewhat. When measured, this variability in heart rate provides useful information about the state of the autonomic nervous system which regulates about 87% of the body�s functions. HRV is a computerized graph of the shape of the pulse wave of the left versus right carotid artery. The approach is called �noncognitive� biofeedback because it works without the conscious participation or awareness (cognition) of the patient; the HRV device �talks� directly with the subject�s nervous system. When the heart rate shifts, this change is routed by computer into audio-visual signals (light flashes and intermittent sounds); the patient becomes aware of these through headphones and a TV screen, and this helps to rebalance the autonomic nervous system. HRV testing can indicate an imbalance even when the patient reports feeling well. This is valuable because an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system will eventually produce physical symptoms. If caught early, steps can be taken to prevent the onset of symptoms. A statistical analysis of 12 years of Israeli clinical experience (30,000 HRV sessions) indicates that about 66% of the positive improvements from HRV sessions take place suddenly and dramatically, as if through major nervous system shifts, explains Dr. Royal. The Israeli study also suggests that over 50 common health problems (including autism, hyperactivity, insomnia, chronic digestive complaints, psoriasis, stress, and poor circulation) are traceable to an inefficient nervous and regulatory system. The minimum course of treatment is one weekly HRV session for 12 weeks. Each session is recorded on videocassette, which the patient watches privately at home twice weekly. In effect, rewatching the video of the lights, sounds, and graph images helps the patient�s autonomic nervous system reset itself in accordance with the more healthy pattern, says Dr. Royal. One of his patients had suffered with goiter for 30 years. After one dose of homeopathic Iodum 200C, the HRV registered an immediate, positive effect; then, 24 hours later, Dr. Royal gave her a follow-up single dose of homeopathic Nux vomica 30C. Three months later, she reported she was feeling better; 6 months later, her improvement continued. �HRV testing provides objective information which, in turn, enables the physician to choose the most effective therapeutic regimen for each patient as well as monitor the response to treatment,� states Dr. Royal. In addition to homeopathic remedies, this can include the patient�s response to nutritional supplements, dental amalgam removals, chiropractic adjustments, and acupuncture treatments.

Skip the Flu Shot? Elderberry Extract Can Stop the Flu in Hours It�s been known for centuries as �the medicine chest of the country people,� but research in the last decade has provided solid scientific evidence regarding the healing properties of black elderberry. Herbal lore tells us that the juice of the black elderberry (Sambucus nigra: a small central European tree that grows 15 feet tall) has been used for as long as 2500 years as an effective remedy for flu, coughs, and colds. In the mid-1980s, Madeleine Mumcuoglu, Ph.D., of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Ein Karem, Israel, began isolating, then testing the active ingredients of black elderberry and found they combatted the flu quite effectively. The key to halting the progress of flu is to prevent the formation of tiny spikes (called hemagglutinin) that cover the surface of the virus. Unchecked, these spikes (laced with a special enzyme called neuraminidase) penetrate the cell wall of the healthy organism, allowing the virus to produce what we know as flu. The two active ingredients in black elderberry disarm neuraminidase within 24-48 hours, states Dr. Mumcuoglu. In one study, patients with early signs of the flu took 4 tablespoons of black elderberry extract per day. Within 24 hours, fever, cough, and muscle pain were significantly reduced in 20% of the patients. After the second day, 70% reported feeling better, and after 3 days, 90% claimed a complete cure from all flu symptoms. Subsequent clinical studies have proven that black elderberry is effective against 8 different influenza strains. Blood tests show that patients taking black elderberry have higher levels of influenza antibodies, indicating that the herbal extract stimulates the immune system. Taking black elderberry extract has advantages over flu shots, states Dr. Mumcuoglu. Vaccinations offer protection against only a few established strains of influenza, but not new varieties; and 50% of people who get flu shots suffer side effects which, for some, can be life-threatening. In 1992, Dr. Mumcuoglu patented her black elderberry extract and released it as Sambucol, a health food product, not a drug. It sold 30,000 bottles in its first year. Testimonies from users confirm its ability to halt and cure all flu symptoms, in most cases, within 2 days, provided you take it at the first sign of flu.

MINERAL DROPS HELP CANCER AND AIDS Trace Elements and Minerals Strengthen Your Immune System If your body lacks sufficient levels of a variety of trace elements and minerals, clinical evidence suggests you may be vulnerable to numerous health problems, including depression, cardiovascular disease, reproductive imbalances, increased risk of infection, anemia, cancer, and general immune system weakness. Even if you believe you are eating a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, you may still be lacking the trace elements and minerals crucial to good health. Hungarian physician Dr. J�zsef B�res put together 20 trace elements in a single dietary supplement called B�res Drops Plus to be taken orally every day. Dr. B�res� idea was to formulate the minerals and trace elements in their �lowest reduced state to limit the production of free radicals� and as a low-level supplement to ensure better absorption. The product contains the trace elements in physiologically necessary amounts and proportions so that it maintains the optimal trace element level even if dietary supply is insufficient,� states Dr. B�res. The elements include EDTA, L-tartaric acid, succinic acid, molybdenum, manganese, and vanadium. Europeans evidently thought Dr. B�res was on to something because an estimated 3 million bottles of his drops were sold in their first 3 months on the market. For general, everyday supplementation, the product is easy to use: simply dribble 18 drops into a glass of water and drink once daily. The product comes in 1.1-fluid-ounce bottles which provide about thirty 18-drop servings. The company recommends that users supplement their daily dose of drops with at least 100 mg of vitamin C. Numerous European clinical studies (at least 30 technical papers) indicate that B�res Drops Plus can aid the immune system in its efforts to deal with a variety of diseases. The drops can also work as an adjunct to other treatments and help reduce the negative impact of certain treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. Specifically, B�res Drops Plus have been used with impressive results in improving life quality and immune system vitality in patients with numerous conditions including breast cancer, malignant gynecological tumors, Hodgkin�s, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, headaches, and childhood infections. A Hungarian study (1991) evaluated the effect of the drops on the physical and psychological status of patients with gynecological and breast cancers. After 3 weeks, 60% of cancer patients reported an improvement in their condition and 63% said their appetite was stronger. After 6 months on the program, 54% of the patients had gained body weight. BDP America, Inc., the company�s American branch, is directing two clinical studies, involving physicians from the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., to see how the product performs in cases of cancer and HIV. The 12-month cancer study will be conducted at the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center in Charlottesville, and will use 2 ml (40 drops) given 3 times daily and 100 mg of vitamin C given 3 times daily, for 12 months.

Thanks to the FDA, conventional medicine trade groups, state medical boards, and the big drug companies, America has its own �Gulag� for doctors who deviate from the enforced norms and who practice alternative medicine. What the Soviet Union accomplished through state-imposed tyranny, American medicine accomplishes through licensing, regulations, and the FDA: the suppression of your freedom of choice in medical care. Our American Gulag ruins alternative doctors through suppression, harassment, indictments, licensure revocation, and bankruptcy. To be a hero in this climate of medical nonfreedom and political intimidation, you need a lot of money, fortitude, and courage. A few physicians, such as Dr. Jonathan Wright, Dr. Warren Levin, and Dr. Lawrence Taylor, have survived the allopathic Gulag, but many more are now under its repressive thumbs. They urgently need the immediate moral and financial support of patients and concerned citizens. DAVID STEENBLOCK, M.D. This California doctor was forced into bankruptcy in September 1995 when state medical authorities confiscated 6 FDA-approved hyperbaric oxygen machines, worth $600,000, which he uses to treat patients who have had strokes and heart attacks. No patient complaints were registered, but 30 very ill patients were forced to wait 2 months for treatment and one patient died the day after being grilled by state medical authorities in Dr. Steenblock�s office. The embargo was lifted in November and the clinic struggles on. JOHN E. GAMBEE, M.D. For 16 years, the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners has sought, through 25 investigations, to revoke Dr. Gambee�s medical license. They have ruined his practice and have literally bankrupted him. Yet there have been no patient complaints or malpractice claims against him. Dr. Gambee, who advocates vitamins and minerals as adjuncts in his treatments, was instrumental in the drafting and passage of Oregon HB 3340, which guarantees access to alternative treatments as of November 1995. Unfortunately, nothing has been done to reform the medical licensing board which specializes in a �slick combination of terrorism and phony public relations campaigns,� states Dr. Gambee. STANISLAW BURZYNSKI, M.D. This Texas physician specializes in cancer and AIDS treatment using antineoplaston therapy which he developed. Dr. Burzynski, who has been the target of a 12-year campaign by the FDA to run him out of business, including 4 unsuccessful attempts to indict him, was served a new 75-count indictment by a Houston grand jury in November 1995 for allegedly shipping an unapproved drug across state lines and falsifying insurance claims with respect to the legality of the drug. There were no patient complaints registered; in fact, patients stepped forward to testify that Dr. Burzynski�s approach had saved lives. Prior to the indictment, a Congressional committee began investigations into the FDA persecution of Dr. Burzynski. If convicted, he faces up to 8 years in prison and $1.9 million in fines and the lives of up to 300 patients are directly at stake. �Every week I see people responding to treatment,� states Dr. Burzynski. If doctors such as he are stopped, �You will see documented human genocide in America. HAL A. HUGGINS, D.D.S. Colorado dentist Hal Huggins has already spent $250,000 in legal fees fending off attacks by the Colorado State Medical Board and Attorney General�s office over the last 3 years. In August 1995, Dr. Huggins closed his dental practice to devote himself full time to educating the public about the dangers of mercury toxicity and the advisability of removing mercury-based dental amalgams. Seeking to revoke his license, medical authorities concocted at least 8 bogus patient claims against Dr. Huggins, based on his advocacy of removing mercury fillings and his use of unconventional therapies. �What they are saying is a dentist has a legal right to place mercury, one of the world�s heaviest toxins, in someone�s mouth and then assume no legal responsibility for the results,� states Dr. Huggins. According to Dr. Huggins, 13 other dentists around the U.S. were similarly �hit� by medical authorities within a 10-day period of his most recent harassment.

MEDICAL TERRORISM AMERICAN-STYLE How to Vote It Out of Office Americans do not enjoy freedom of medical choice nor are physicians allowed to practice unconventional but effective therapies without being subjected to harassment. However, 3 bills are before the U.S. Congress that, if passed, will radically transform the American medical scene in favor of alternative medicine, freedom of choice, and open marketplace competition. Their passage absolutely requires the grassroots support and politicking of millions of concerned Americans. ACCESS TO MEDICAL TREATMENT ACT (HR 2019, S. 1035). This bill will allow an individual to be treated by any licensed or legally authorized health care practitioner with any method of treatment desired (including non FDA-approved ones) provided the treatment does no serious harm and the patient is fully informed, in writing by the doctor, about anticipated benefits, results of past treatments, and possible side effects. The bill will remove federal government interference in the patient-physician relationship. PHARMACY COMPOUNDING PRESERVATION ACT (HR 598). This bill will guarantee the ability of licensed pharmacists to make (compound) medicines and their right to obtain bulk drug products under applicable state and federal laws. This means a physician will continue to be able to prescribe any medical substance, even if it�s not made by a pharmaceutical company and is only available through a compounding pharmacist. Currently, the FDA seeks to make it illegal for pharmacists to compound medicines for doctors� prescriptions, which could make it impossible to obtain DHEA and certain progesterone and natural estrogen formulas. FOOD AND DIETARY CONSUMER INFORMATION ACT (HR 1951). This bill will allow food and dietary supplement companies to make truthful and nonmisleading statements about their product, a practice the FDA currently obstructs. Even better, it will prevent the FDA from classifying foods and dietary supplements (such as vitamins and herbs) as drugs, which effectively outlaws their use except when prescribed by physicians. PATIENT RIGHTS REGULATORY REFORM ACT OF 1995. This bill (S.1477), introduced December 13, 1995, could be bad news and should be opposed. It could undermine all the gains of the Access to Medical Treatment Act described above. While it is meant as an FDA-reform measure, one part (Title 2) of the bill would give the FDA the authority to determine what forms of unapproved health care are best and therefore legal, and it would allow the use of unapproved drugs and medical devices only if the company first files a complicated FDA testing protocols application, thereby subjecting them to intense federal scrutiny, delay, and cost. The bill would regulate dietary supplements as drugs and restrict patient access to new, effective, but unapproved therapies. GET INDIGNANT! You Can Change Medicine In 1989, when Warren Levin, M.D., came to New York attorney Robert H. Harris seeking legal defense against state medical authorities who had filed a 570-count complaint, Harris was the 32nd lawyer Levin had approached. Levin was (and remains) one of New York State�s leading holistic physicians, but Harris was the first lawyer willing to take on his case. After 60 days of hearings, all charges against Dr. Levin were dismissed; none related to harm against a patient. �This was not a professional disciplinary trial but a political one,� stated Harris at the 2nd International Congress of Electro-Dermal Screening Health Practitioners in Salt Lake City, Utah, in November 1995. �The U.S. thinks of itself as a place where smart things happen, but we couldn�t be more wrong in the world of medicine.� Since Levin�s hearing, the New York State legislature has revamped its laws, permitting patients greater access to unconventional medical treatment and guaranteeing doctors a less restrictive climate for practice. But there is still far more reform that needs to happen. Harris now specializes in defending alternative medicine physicians against state, FDA, and medical board harassment. Skillful, emboldened lawyers are now as vital to the cause of alternative medicine as courageous doctors, and Harris is setting a fine example. According to him, �If you develop a sense of healthy indignation and outrage that your freedoms are being taken away, and commit yourself to being outspoken, you do make a difference.� There are other �Warren Levins� who are losing their licenses right now, Harris reported. The only way to stop this is to vote, write letters, and speak out. Congress received more mail in 1994 regarding vitamin labeling than for any subject, other than abortion, in its recorded history. This volume of letters persuaded Congress to protect supplements from the FDA. More letters are needed now. �This is our country; these are our rights,� Harris said. �You do not have the right to bellyache about anything if you do not bellyache about anything. If you feel impotent as a single person, your voice can inspire others, who may also feel impotent; then as a group, you become potent.� Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing `WT01-B17-131IA043-000786-B042-18http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue11/i11-a34.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305121223 text/html 13842HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 12:09:54 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html Feature Article (Issue #11) [Go to the Table of Contents] Dr. Quinn, Alternative Medicine Woman Jane Seymour's frontier drama of holistic healing puts alternative medicine in a doctor friendly light. by Richard Leviton When actress Jane Seymour won the prestigious Golden Globe award this year as best actress for her hugely popular television series about a frontier doctor, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, a little bit of the trophy�s glory shone on the field of alternative medicine. In this 60-minute series�viewed by 22 million people in 82 countries and now in its fourth successful season on CBS�the British actress plays a Boston-bred physician named Michaela Quinn who practices medicine in the wild west of Colorado Springs in the early 1870s. It�s not that �Dr. Mike,� as she�s known among the townspeople, practices alternative medicine instead of conventional. In 1870s America, what we know today as �alternative� was far more conventional, even mainstream. Boston was the heart of homeopathy in America; herbalists known as Eclectics were flourishing throughout the land; physicians of all kinds worked openly in the medical marketplace, without FDA suppression. In fact, Dr. Quinn is a fair-minded showpiece for how both kinds of medicine�alternative and conventional allopathic�can prosper in the world together. In a quaint but focused way, Dr. Quinn, with her ankle-length calico skirts and black medicine bag, is an inspiring image that would not be out of place today were she to walk off the set and into a consulting room. Dr. Quinn is self-sufficient, open-minded, and compassionate. The doctor�s healing presence counts for something with her and she�s open to new empirical research, based on experience. Medicine is not a rigid orthodoxy, but fluid, changing, and growing. Today�s distressing world of impersonal HMOs, malpractice suits, side effects, toxic drugs, clinical indifference, and huge doctor�s fees is not yet even a rumor from the future in her world. In one episode, everybody comes down with influenza. Dr. Mike dispenses quinine, exhausts her supply, and gets sick herself. The native American healers restore her to health with purple cone flowers, or Echinacea. �She�s a real doctor, all the way from Boston,� says a Lakota woman. �She knows the fancy medicine of the whites.� Yes, but those �white doctors� also knew about homeopathy and herbs. And Dr. Mike wants to learn the medicines of her Lakota Sioux neighbors. It�s family entertainment, yet Jane Seymour�s �Dr. Mike� is also quietly, steadily political. Every week the show sends out the message that different medicines can coexist in the public health arena, that doctors can care, that women doctors may be able to care even more, and that all alternatives that work will be considered. It is not whimsical to call Jane Seymour�s character an �alternative� medicine woman. Both on and off the set at the Paramount Ranch in the Santa Monica hills in California, Jane practices what Dr. Quinn embodies. While not a doctor herself, Jane Seymour grew up in England surrounded by medicine. Her mother, Mieke, was a Red Cross nurse, while her father, John Frankenberg, was an obstetrician. Dr. Frankenberg, a surgeon and Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, was strait-laced about what constitutes proper medicine until he came down with bone and lung cancer late in his life. �He had always been against anything alternative and pooh-poohed the whole idea,� says Seymour. �He didn�t even take vitamins.� But Jane persuaded her father, whose cancer was inoperable, to try something daring. In 1990, when he was �gray, very frail, and skeletal,� she took him to the Livingston Foundation Medical Center in San Diego�an alternative cancer clinic based on the pioneering work of Virginia Livingston, M.D.�where he began intravenous vitamin C therapy. Dr. Frankenberg �did extremely well� and was �like a different man.� When he eventually died, it was from heart complications, not cancer. �He actually said to me before he died that he wished he had known more about alternative medicine earlier in his life so he could have used it in conjunction with regular medicine,� says Jane. �He felt the combination of the two would have been ideal.� Her father�s lesson was not lost on Jane, who is an alternative medicine proponent. On the set of Dr. Quinn, she administers homeopathic Arnica Montana to actors who bruise themselves; she keeps a supply of Oscillococcinum, the popular homeopathic flu remedy; she has vitamin C tablets and zinc lozenges nearby to keep up her vitality and stop colds; and she admits to having a well-thumbed copy of Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide close at hand for quick information on other health problems. �I keep Burton Goldberg�s book handy. Our medic on the set has the book as well, so whenever anything goes wrong, people look up the problem in the Definitive Guide to see if there�s something else to try instead of the conventional approach.� Jane sees herself as a �steerer to doctors.� That�s because �quite often I actually steer people to the right kind of doctor.� It makes sense: she is a doctor�s daughter, after all. �I practically grew up in hospitals since I was 3,� says Jane. �I watched surgeries when I was 10. I worked as an auxiliary nurse, then a Red Cross nurse. Seymour recently did something quite unusual for a woman who is 44 years old: she gave birth to twins. Jane attributes this impressive feat to the following: avoiding antibiotics and conventional drugs whenever possible; regularly taking nutritional supplements; eating sensibly; keeping her energy and vitality in topnotch condition; maintaining an upbeat, confident attitude that is not afraid of illness; and receiving chiropractic, reflexology, massage, and acupressure treatments routinely. During her pregnancy�she has birthed 2 other children�Jane had as many as four treatments a week of these alternative health care practices. Ever since she had a life-threatening reaction (called anaphylactic shock) to antibiotics in 1988, Jane has avoided them. �I barely take any medication, even Tylenol or aspirin. If I can knock the problem on the head with alternative therapies first, then that�s what I do. The antibiotic experience compounded and reinforced this feeling. I use some of the alternative therapies that I�m familiar with, and I�m open-minded to more.� If she gets sick, she can always call on her younger sister Ann who is studying homeopathy back in England. Ann�s children had chronic allergies, eczema, and asthma for which conventional medicine had no answers, says Jane. �Then Ann found that through using homeopathy, she was able to help her children substantially. She believes in it so much it�s becoming her life�s work. Now she�s the family member who usually prescribes for us when we need a remedy.� When Jane�s pregnancy required an emergency Cesarean section, she prepared herself with Arnica to reduce the bruising and to speed up her post surgical healing. When her other sister, Sally, developed a brain aneurysm (a blood vessel bulge that can rupture) and underwent a risky surgery, she took steady doses of Arnica. �The results were incredible with Sally when we gave her Arnica right after her surgery,� says Jane. �She had substantially less swelling than anyone else on the ward who had received the same surgery. In fact, it was so minimal that the doctors and nurses could not believe the difference.� Her sister�s deep interest in homeopathy has inspired Jane with a greater trust in this specific approach and with alternative medicine generally. �I saw the good effects on friends of mine. A lot of my friends use homeopathy all the time, even exclusively. I am a great believer in preventive medicine. If we all learned how to keep ourselves healthy, then we wouldn�t have to go to doctors quite so much.� So firm is her belief in the efficacy of alternative medicine, that Jane hosted a 6-hour Turner Broadcasting special called The Heart of Healing in 1993. This show dealt with progressive themes such as hypnosis for severe burn control, visualizations for tumor regression, and biofeedback for cerebral palsy. Bear in mind, this aired around the same time as Bill Moyer�s celebrated PBS documentary Healing and the Mind, so Jane should be ranked equally with Moyers as a prime early popularizer of alternative medicine. Dr. Michaela Quinn is a composite character based on what a woman doctor with gumption would have been like in 1870s America, but the role might have been tailored to fit Jane Seymour the doctor�s daughter. When she first read the script for Dr. Quinn, Jane found it a remarkable coincidence. �I couldn�t believe they had written this character who in many ways resembled my own background. My father brought me up to believe I could do anything and that I should be very independent, just like Dr. Quinn.� Dr. Quinn�s spirit of independence also extends to medicine. As Lear�s magazine commented in a 1993 cover story on Jane Seymour, �Michaela Quinn often looks to Native American cures and acknowledges that there may be more to healing than what she learned in medical school.� The point of the series is that Dr. Quinn is always open-minded to other theories and medicines. After all, a lot of medications prescribed today are pharmaceutical versions of medicines that once came from herbs. Even better, Dr. Quinn shows her 22 million viewers that the power of mind, positive attitude, compassion, and a doctor�s willingness�and ability�to listen to patients are paramount in the practice of true medicine. �I think that�s the main quality in good medicine: being there and listening, really hearing what the person�s problems are,� Jane says. The experience of her sister Sally�s brain aneurysm convinced her of the power of the mind to console and heal when Jane stood in a circle of family and friends and sent Sally healing thoughts. �Very few people survive that kind of aneurysm, but from the moment we were there in a circle, the doctor said Sally started taking a turn for the better. In fact, she came out completely recovered, as if nothing had ever happened to her. So I absolutely believe there is a power of healing that works through this kind of positive thinking.� That�s the kind of frontier open-mindedness to new approaches in medicine that makes Dr. Michaela Quinn, alternative medicine woman, a doctor worth emulating today. �RICHARD LEVITON Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing WT01-B17-132IA043-000786-B042-52http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue11/i11-a38.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305121347 text/html 12947HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 12:11:16 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html Feature Article (issue #11) [Go to the Table of Contents] Aniety and Depression, skip the Valium, hold the Prozac. Anxiety and depression may be the result of shortages of key brain chemicals that can be restored naturally. Give the brain the amino acids it needs and feel your mind start to glow again. If you're one of the millions who suffer from anxiety or depression, the next time you reach for the Valium or Prozac, consider amino acids as an alternative instead. These protein building blocks may be the key to reversing long-standing anxiety and depression, according to Harold Whitcomb, M.D., and biochemical nutritionist Phyllis Bronson. They regularly prescribe amino acids for their clients at the Aspen (Colorado) Clinic for Preventive and Environmental Medicine. Mood, behavior, and brain biochemistry are intricately linked. Depression and anxiety may be the result of flawed message-sending in the biochemical brain, flawed because key brain chemicals called neurotransmitters are in short supply. They're short because the body's amino acid pool (from which they're made) is itself low. For example, deficiencies in the amino acid GABA are strongly correlated with states of anxiety. Add to this the negative effect of high levels of heavy metals commonly found in the body. Aluminum, mercury, lead, and copper can make the body toxic, interfere with brain function, and contribute to depression and anxiety, say Whitcomb and Bronson. Shore up the amino acid pool with the deficient or missing elements and flush the toxic metals out of the body and you start seeing dramatic improvements in both depression and anxiety, report Whitcomb and Bronson. "By using supplements of the amino acids that make up specific neurotransmitters, you can actually change the nature and intensity of the brain messages they carry and thus the emotions they affect." Even better, you don't get the roster of serious side effects commonly associated with standard medications. These can typically include blurred vision, increased heart rate, low blood pressure, nausea, headaches, constipation, memory loss, impaired concentration, and fogginess. In contrast, the clinical use of amino acids produces no side effects or health risks and generates better, more lasting healing results, says Bronson. Bronson's field�she's been practicing it for 20 years�is called orthomolecular medicine and was first established in the 1950s. THE SCIENCE OF BRAIN CHEMICALS. Patients generally have positive results in 3 to 4 weeks, Bronson reports, but in acute cases, there is often a significant improvement in a matter of days. Many patients who come to the clinic are on powerful drugs (called psychotropics, which include Valium and Prozac) to control their anxiety or depression. The goal is to bolster the patient's amino acid reserves so they can eventually discontinue these drugs. However, this is not possible or advisable in all cases, so then the goal is to reduce the potential toxicity of the psychotropics which will often reduce the side effects. It all comes down to brain chemicals. "When people take Prozac for depression, they're actually trying to biochemically elevate their serotonin levels." Bronson notes. "When people take Valium and the other benzodiazepene drugs for anxiety, they're trying to elevate their GABA levels." People with deficiencies in serotonin tend to be depressed while people without enough GABA suffer anxiety, says Bronson. "What we do is substitute the natural neurotransmitters or their amino acid precursors for the psychotropic drugs." The result is more thorough healing with no side effects. IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM. The first step in reversing anxiety and depression is to do a complete patient workup to see which factors are at play, Bronson explains. For example, there may be a genetic factor involved in which a person is somewhat predisposed at birth to be lacking in a specific neurotransmitter. Faulty, inadequate diet and nutrition is another factor that can leave one's system deficient in key minerals. The stress of today's fast-paced lifestyle may also deplete the body's reserves of amino acids and vital nutrients. After conducting a thorough interview with the patient, Bronson and Whitcomb use electro-dermal screening to find out more detailed biochemical information about the patient's health, nutrient needs, possible heavy metal toxicity, and the presence of food allergies that affect the brain. One of Bronson's clients had a previously undiagnosed toxic response to baked potatoes, which she ate every day thinking they were good for her. "Some people have brain allergies to foods they eat regularly, and these can show up like depression when it's actually a chronic food allergy response instead." Bronson often uses hair analysis and blood profiles to gain further information about amino acid levels. The treatment goal is to correct the biochemical pathways associated with anxiety and depression. "Our approach uses biophysics, through the electro-dermal screening, and biochemistry, through supplementing the amino acid pathways. We come up with a precise prescription that has 'molecular compatibility' with the patient's individual needs," Bronson says. In other words, through electro-dermal screening, Bronson and Whitcomb are able to pinpoint precisely how much of a nutrient the body needs and can tolerate. Generally, Bronson and Whitcomb elevate levels of key nutrients with natural amino acid precursors (chemical building blocks) to the neurotransmitters. Then the body does the rest naturally. In most cases, about 50% of their patients require a continued maintenance level of amino acids to keep their anxiety or depression under control, while other patients are able to eventually discontinue them. MORE GABA, LESS ANXIETY. Consider the case of Roberta, aged 48. A designer and intellectually highly active, Roberta was subject to frequent panic attacks which occasionally sent her to the emergency room thinking she was having a heart attack, relates Bronson. She never understood what brought on these panics but suddenly everything would start to feel "as if it were happening too fast," she told Bronson. Roberta had suffered from "random, free-floating anxiety with intermittent panic" since puberty. Biochemically, anxiety is a state in which the brain is overfiring�sending too many messages at once, Bronson explains. The levels of nerve-signal-blocking chemicals in the brain, such as GABA, are not sufficient to offset the onslaught of information that gets randomly triggered. Electro-dermal screening indicated that GABA and magnesium were principally involved in Roberta's anxiety and that supplementation with both would be compatible with her system. Bronson and Whitcomb prescribed GABA at 500 mg, 3 times daily (taken with food) and magnesium oxide at 400 mg, taken once in the morning and evening. Roberta felt the good results of GABA supplementation within an hour. Her bouts of panic lessened over the next 3 months and when they did start, Roberta would take an extra 500 mg of GABA (at least 3 hours after her earlier dose). As her anxiety attacks seemed to have their own cycle, Bronson discovered they were related to Roberta's low levels of the female hormone progesterone and with a variety of PMS symptoms. She had Roberta apply 1/2 teaspoon of natural progesterone cream (5% progesterone) to her skin twice daily for the 2 weeks preceding menstruation. This resolved Roberta's PMS problems while the GABA and magnesium oxide eliminated anxiety attacks from her life. MORE SEROTONIN, LESS DEPRESSION. Depression is a different biochemical pathway in the brain, which is why, in most instances, a depressed person does not suffer from anxiety, says Bronson. In general, deficiencies of serotonin or other neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine, are linked with depression. Through the strategic use of amino acids and other nutrients, the drug pathways in the brain can be stimulated naturally, thereby dissolving anxiety and lifting depression Bronson relates the case of Elizabeth, who was deeply depressed. Electro-dermal screening and other tests indicated that she was deficient in the amino acid taurine, which is needed to produce serotonin, and in sulfur, a key component in amino acids. As a result, Elizabeth did not have enough sulfur-bearing amino acids in her system, and this deficiency helped to generate her depression, says Bronson. In addition to supplementing her with taurine, Bronson and Whitcomb instructed Elizabeth to eat more fertile eggs and Brazil nuts, both high in sulfur, to lift her depression. THE PERSON BEHIND THE BIOCHEMISTRY. Somehow, the use of amino acids rather than conventional medications seems to empower, even inspire, the patient to get well. "People who take nutrients under proper guidance seem to have a sense of dominion over what's happening to them whereas many people taking strong medications, especially for depression, often feel that they're surrendering to some mystery that is quite frightening." It's important to keep in focus the fact that there is a person behind the biochemistry, Bronson stresses. Mind and body coincide in a complex biochemistry of mood and neurotransmitter pathways. Psychotherapy, such as that in the depth style of C.G. Jung, is helpful in bringing forth the buried or forgotten psychological components of a patient's depression and anxiety. "A person needs to heal the biochemical aspect and to get underneath it and see what drove them to have that pattern," Bronson says. "Shifting the biochemistry puts people in the position to deal effectively with the psychological issues connected to anxiety or depression."

New research shows that when you speed up your brain waves, your depression may go away. by Len Ochs, Ph.D. The idea of curing depression strikes many people as inconceivable. However, the cures we have witnessed on a reliable basis using a new form of biofeedback with light stimulation may alter that view. The positive results achieved include: the disappearance of the feeling of depression; increased energy during the day and improved sleeping at night; an ability to initiate and sustain activities; improved short-term memory and attention; and re-engagement with life�completion of tasks such as moving out of problematic relationships, leaving a job, finding another, buying a house, or taking on new challenges. BIOFEEDBACK WITH LIGHT CAN CURE DEPRESSION. We call our experimental tool for treating depression Interactive Light Therapy, or ILT; the technical name is EEG-Driven Photic Stimulation (EDS). ILT is an advanced form of biofeedback that I invented in 1990. At this point in our research, we have worked with 84 depressed patients, all of whom have shown significant relief from the varying aspects of depression. ILT has reliably improved depression, manic-depression, lifelong serious depression, suicidal ideas, attention problems, daytime low energy, sleeping disorders, and learning difficulties. Most of the people seeking ILT treatment who were depressed have been cured relatively easily. Their positive changes appear to last for years after treatment ends. Bear in mind, this treatment will not make long-used psychological defenses go away easily. People will often feel confused as old defenses crumble and before their brains are able to naturally formulate new and more flexible ways to be in the world. YOUR BRAIN IS IN CHARGE OF YOUR HEALING. ILT is a noninvasive, painless, and passive form of biofeedback. You sit comfortably in a chair wearing dark glasses that have a set of tiny lights mounted on the lenses. The system monitors and analyzes your brain waves and uses these ever-changing wave patterns to continuously make the flashing lights relevant to you. The name Interactive Light Therapy refers to the fact that it is your brain that controls the gently-twinkling, dim light that is fed back (hence, biofeedback) to you. Unlike traditional biofeedback, where the patient must actively learn and discriminate between different conscious states, with ILT there is no conscious learning task or need for attention. The person does nothing in particular while the brain is being fed the biofeedback. ILT works because central nervous system symptoms and very strong, low-frequency brain waves are related. When people are overly stressed, injured, or traumatized, their brain waves may get fixed or stuck in a pattern of predominantly very strong, low frequency activity. This is called EEG-slowing, and is associated with symptoms such as anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue, hyperactivity, distractibility, mood swings, confusion, disorganization, sleep disorders, concentration, reading comprehension, memory, and attention. The increase in low-frequency brain wave activity is a typical pattern we have observed in many chronic health problems. We believe that EEG-slowing occurs when the integrating function of the brain�s cerebral cortex is blocked. All of the aspects of depression mentioned above are associated with slower brain waves, or what we call EEG-slowing. FLEXING YOUR BRAIN. Somewhat akin to an orchestra conductor, ILT helps to restore the integrating function of the cortex and thereby directly affects, and often resolves, the symptoms. More specifically, the patient�s strongest brain wave controls the rate at which a set of tiny lights flash dimly before the eyes. We record the person�s brain waves then use these same frequencies to control the speed of lights that flash in front of their eyes. Then we work on changing the rigid ways the patient�s brain wave frequencies respond by alternately speeding up and slowing down these waves. This creates a new flexibility in the brain. The brightness of the lights is carefully adjusted for comfort as the interaction of the lights and the patient�s brain gently reduces the size (amplitude) of the low-frequency brain waves. These changes are the equivalent of greater brain and behavioral flexibility. When the slow-wave activity is integrated as higher and more varying brain waves, the presenting symptoms start to decrease and even disappear. At the end of therapy, the brain adopts this new flexibility and, like a thermostat that has been reset, it no longer needs the help of ILT. It seems that the best results occur when you have a �critical mass� of treatments, relatively close together. This helps overcome the rigidity of the body and brain that are maintaining the symptoms. The major implication of this work is that both the physically and psychologically injured brain has a greater capacity for recovery than has previously been appreciated by medicine. 97% OF PATIENTS IMPROVED. Only those with EEG-slowing can benefit from ILT. However, you can have this condition as a result of head injury, extreme stress, emotional trauma, attention deficit disorder, chronic fatigue or chemical dependence. ILT has been studied clinically since 1990 when I received a patent for the invention of linking brain EEGs with sound and light in a biofeedback format. According to data we have collected, of 500 people treated with ILT, 97% have experienced significant improvements in their central nervous system symptoms and the benefits gained seem only to sustain or increase unless new trauma occurs. At this time, there are 10 practitioners around the country who are conducting clinical trials with ILT. The work reported here shows that people who may have given up hope of relief through traditional medicine may now have another chance at recovery.

Atkins, M.D., who shows doctors how to do it. by Nathaniel Mead Among the more outspoken proponents of alternative cancer therapies is Robert C. Atkins, M.D., nationally famous for his bestselling health books, Dr. Atkins� New Diet Revolution and Dr. Atkins� Health Revolution. Early on, Dr. Atkins realized that many cancer patients were malnourished and that conventional oncologists were entirely ignoring nutritional support. He reasoned that the highly toxic approach of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery weakened cancer patients and compromised their self-healing resources. In the late 1970s, Dr. Atkins began devising his own cancer treatment approach. There is no better example of the weaknesses of our dominant medicine than its clearly ineffective war on cancer,� says Dr. Atkins. �By the same token, there is no better example of the superiority of complementary, alternative medicine than in the management of cancer.� Cancer, says Atkins, is a controllable chronic illness, but you have to support the body fully, making it stronger so it can fight the cancer. Atkins has supervised scores of cases in which cancer patients were getting worse, as indicated by blood tests, but then improved dramatically when he gave them nontoxic medicines now standard to his regimen. Using nutrition and botanicals, Dr. Atkins helps to create the ideal environment for the body to overcome cancer. In addition, he emphasizes substances that selectively make the tumor die while allowing normal, healthy cells and tissues to live, something chemotherapy is completely unable to do. If cancer is a tug of war between a patient and the disease, says Dr. Atkins, then you need �power pullers� on your side, natural substances that help the body destroy the cancer, usually by strengthening the immune system. �The exciting concept that mainstream oncologists do not grasp is that these are nontoxic approaches and that the benefit-to-risk ratio is nearly �infinity,�� says Dr. Atkins. �Therefore, there is no reason not to combine dozens of them into a single patient program. Dr. Atkins� protocols contain both a vigorous injectable program and day-long oral administration of nutritional and herbal therapies. THE INJECTABLE PROGRAM UKRAIN. This substance, derived from celandine (Chelidonium majus) and thiophosphoric acid, is a potent anticancer agent and a safe, supportive alternative to chemotherapy. It kills tumor cells while fortifying the immune system. Given by injection, optimal dosages are 5-20 mg per daily injection, for about 20 days. Of the first 52 people to whom Dr. Atkins administered one course of Ukrain, 40 experienced benefit. The greatest success in using Ukrain was a 93% remission rate with patients who started treatment when the cancer was in its earliest stage. Dr. Atkins regards Ukrain as the single best anticancer agent he has used to date. 714X. This substance, developed by Canadian biologist Gaston Naessens, is made from nitrogen-rich camphor and appears to neutralize a factor produced by tumor cells that ordinarily paralyzes the immune system. Naessens has documented the successful use of 714X against a variety of difficult cancers. �The 714X compound doesn�t kill the cancer cells directly, but blocks their feeding mechanism,� explains Dr. Atkins. Typically, Dr. Atkins injects 714X once daily into the groin lymph nodes for at least 21 consecutive days. In serious cases, he may use it without interruption until improvement is seen. ISCADOR/HELIXOR. These are the European trade names for a preparation made from fermented mistletoe (Viscum album). It has been used effectively by doctors in Germany for cancer treatment since 1920. Originally conceived by Austrian scientist Rudolf Steiner, who worked closely with doctors, the therapeutic success of mistletoe as an anticancer agent has been reported in 5000 case studies. Dr. Atkins administers mistletoe through a series of 14 injections in increasing concentrations every other month, during the time in which Ukrain is not given. CARNIVORA®. This patented remedy, derived from Venus flytrap and developed by Helmut Keller, M.D., is used in German cancer clinics. Like Ukrain, Carnivora�, delivered by injection, appears to work by lessening the malignant characteristic of the tumor, rather than by destroying tissue, an approach not considered by oncologists, says Dr. Atkins. Among 210 of Dr. Keller�s patients with terminal cancer, 34 went into remission and 84 showed a halt in disease progression after using Carnivora�. Most Atkins Center patients take the Venus flytrap by drinking infusions of the whole plant as an herb tea. AMYGDALIN. Also known as laetrile or vitamin B17, amygdalin is extracted from the pits of apricots, peaches, cherries, and berries; the active agent is called nitriloside. One study showed a 60% reduction in the spread of cancer to the lungs through using amygdalin. �Amygdalin is another key component for keeping cancer from growing and should be considered a standard, entirely safe treatment for all cancer patients,� says Dr. Atkins. OXYGENATING THERAPIES. Dr. Atkins complements his intravenous program with an oxygen-providing preparation called DC4 (chlorine dioxide) which, when administered intravenously, releases oxygen in the form of ozone into the blood. Ozone itself may be administered with great success. Another injectable oxygen therapy called Koch�s glyoxylide �provides a constant oxygenating source and has a remarkable track record,� says Dr. Atkins. GLANDULAR EXTRACTS. Dr. Atkins uses a variety of animal-derived glandular extracts to strengthen the immune system, including thymus (thymosin), liver, spleen, and pineal. Giving them by injection allows them to be more effectively absorbed by the body. THE ORAL PROGRAM PANCREATIC ENZYMES. Perhaps the most valuable of the oral supplements are pancreatic enzymes. Dr. Atkins� patients take up to 30 capsules daily (over a 24-hour period) of crude pork pancreas extract. These enzymes �digest away the protective protein coating or shell which encases all tumors, leaving the cancer cells vulnerable,� explains Dr. Atkins. �Many of the successful cancer programs I have studied incorporate pancreatic enzymes. ANTIOXIDANTS. Employing the full spectrum of antioxidants is part of every Atkins Center patient�s program, whether as treatment or prevention,� says Dr. Atkins. �These substances help protect cells� genetic material and membranes from free radical damage, thereby preserving the cells� normal functions. Antioxidants are a huge part of the body�s anticancer defenses. Dosages vary with individual needs, but the centerpiece is the recently maligned beta carotene. �The trick is to use natural beta carotene and to give all the supporting nutrients that allow the carotene to be converted to vitamin A,� Dr. Atkins says. When cancer is present, the dosage level approaches 100,000 I.U. daily. In addition, Dr. Atkins prescribes vitamin C in dosages up to about 10 g daily. Vitamin E strengthens the immune response; in one study, of 43 oral cancer patients who took 400 I.U. twice daily for 24 weeks, 46% showed strong improvement. Selenium works with vitamin E and may be the reason the study from Linxian, China, that used beta carotene showed it producing 13% fewer cancer deaths. Other antioxidants central to Dr. Atkins� program are N-acetyl cysteine, glutathione, and lipoic acid; the latter has the effect of protecting all the other antioxidants. Coenzyme Q10, which has been linked to tumor regression at dosages of up to 390 mg daily, is included in the antioxidant program. Of importance, too, are the bioflavonoids, especially pycnogenol. Plant-based antioxidants, such as medicinal mushrooms, genistein (from soybeans), and green tea are on Dr. Atkin�s checklist also. SHARK CARTILAGE. The tough, elastic connective tissue from sharks seems to prevent cancer tumors from developing new blood vessels and expanding their blood supply. Therefore, �as long as your body receives a hefty daily dose, you can keep tumors from growing,� says Dr. Atkins, who recommends on average 3 ounces of pulverized cartilage. An interesting alternative is a derivative called Car-T cell; here one vial containing only 1/2 tablespoon of active shark cartilage extract (first frozen, then defrosted) is taken daily under the tongue. ESSIAC. This is an herbal formula, given as a tea, developed by the Canadian nurse Renee Caisse. Essiac�s main components include slippery elm, burdock, Indian rhubarb, and sorrel. It is known to strengthen the immune system, reduce drug toxicity, enhance energy, and sedate inflammations. �Such benefits may be mild in advanced-stage cancer therapy, but they can contribute to feelings of well-being which in turn influence the patient�s quality of life and potential for recovery,� says Dr. Atkins. CAT�S CLAW. Chemical components of this rain-forest plant (Uncaria tomentosa) have a strong antioxidant effect, says Dr. Atkins. Cat�s claw may have greater therapeutic value than other prominent anticancer herbs such as astragalus, Echinacea, and goldenseal, he adds. A typical dosage for cat�s claw is 3-6 g daily but, for more advanced cases, you may need up to 20 g, Dr. Atkins advises. HOXSEY HERBS. Originally developed by Harry Hoxsey in the 1950s and administered today in Tijuana, Mexico, this herbal formula includes internal and external applications of substances such as bloodroot, potassium iodide, red clover, buckthorn bark, burdock root, Stillingia root, berberis root, pokeberry, licorice root, Cascara amarga, and prickly ash bark. �Decades of observation attest to their potential merit,� says Dr. Atkins, adding that of his patients who have used the Hoxsey formula, �many seem to get better. SIBERIAN GINSENG. This form of ginseng, taken as a liquid extract, stimulates �natural killer cell� (NK) activity against cancer cells and may also help to regenerate NK cells destroyed by toxins or by toxic conventional treatments. WHOLESOME DIET. Dr. Atkins recommends following a sugarless diet, due to his faith in the teachings of Nobel Prize winner Otto Warburg, who demonstrated that cancer cells almost always depend upon anaerobic (without oxygen) nutrition, in which sugar is the primary fuel. Dr. Atkins also emphasizes eating vegetables, avoiding processed, refined foods, and using organically grown vegetables (preferably eaten raw) to maximize the absorption of their live enzyme content. He is reluctant to recommend a low protein diet because �so much of the biochemistry of the immune system is based on amino acids found in proteins. Illness is either worsened or bettered depending on your state of mind, says Dr. Atkins. All his therapies aim to enhance the patient�s mood, attitude, and psychological state as a means of facilitating the healing process and to avoid producing anxiety, depression, or despair, which commonly occur under conventional care. �Many of our patients come to us having been told they have 4 or 9 months to live. That can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. At the Atkins Center, the staff expect the patients to get well and stay well and the power of this positive expectation is contagious. According to Dr. Atkins, cancer survivors do not give in to the intimidation and mental toxicity of conventional medicine. The recent death of Jackie Kennedy Onassis shows how conventional medicine mistreats cancer. In effect, her oncologists had the attitude that �we�re either going to cure her or kill her,� as they poured chemotherapy into her early in the course of her treatment, says Dr. Atkins. When this intensely toxic treatment failed, Kennedy�s lymphoma sprinted away with her life. Her type of rapid demise is actually quite rare among patients who don�t receive chemotherapy. Summarizing his system, Dr. Atkins says, �The happy irony here is that there are 3 or 4 new therapies in the pipeline that appear sufficiently promising that they may one day make the entire Atkins Center program outmoded.

That�s where the future of your health lies. The trick is to convince the insurance industry that this is where its financial future best lies, too. Regrettably, they do not see the considerable cost savings awaiting their enthusiastic endorsement of alternative medicine, as the following news item indicates. On January 1, 1996, Deborah Senn, insurance commissioner for Washington State, set a national precedent by requiring all insurance companies to begin offering coverage for all categories of licensed health care. These will include naturopathy, acupuncture, massage, and nutrition, effective when current subscribers renew their policies. Seven insurance companies filed a lawsuit protesting Senn�s regulation. One insurance company executive stated that this �would make it virtually impossible to manage health care.� Evidently they haven�t discussed the advantages of offering coverage for alternative medicine with forward-looking companies such as American Western Life Insurance Company in San Mateo, California. Instead of waging a reactive, rear-guard battle to protect their presumed financial interests against alternative medicine, insurance executives would be wise businesspeople if they were to spend a minute thinking the news through. At American Western, insurers are discovering that offering an alternative health insurance program actually lowers medical bills, according to Marcel J. Hernandez, N.D., who directs their Wellness programs. American Western now offers a policy that enables holders to make reimbursable medical visits to any of 2000 alternative practitioners as well as 650 hospitals and 41,000 conventional doctors. In most cases, policy-holders pay $10 per visit after which 100% of their doctor�s fees are paid by American Western; up to $1000 a year for natural prescription medicines is covered as well. Their Prevention Plus coverage includes acupressure, acupuncture, Ayurvedic medicine, biofeedback, chiropractic, hypnotherapy, nutritional counseling, EDTA chelation therapy, among other techniques, and users are entitled to 2-12 visits per year in each category. Even better, American Western offers a Wellness Line, staffed by naturopathic physicians, that provides health information on a free 1-800 telephone connection 24 hours a day for advice on physical complaints without actual illness. Inquiries of this kind can amount to 30%-50% of the average physician�s case load. During 1994, American Western received 9105 calls of which 5600 were about specific medical problems; of these callers, 20.9% chose to practice self-care rather than visit a doctor, thereby saving an estimated $250,000 in doctors� fees and thus insurance reimbursements, says Dr. Hernandez. Of the total callers, 23.5% phoned for educational purposes, but many of these may take up self-care later, leading to further cost savings. �We can afford to offer this type of insurance to the public only if our clients take an active hand in making their own health care decisions,� says Dr. Hernandez. �Education on medical treatment is what makes our programs work.� Education, indeed. Were the majority of American insurance companies willing to do the merest amount of calculations, they would realize that the future of affordable and profitable health insurance lies with alternative medicine. First, you have a $14 billion ready market as anywhere from 33%-42% of Americans have consulted alternative practitioners. A great number of people are already using and demanding these services and, in most cases, paying for it themselves. For example, in a poll of Washington State adults, 58% said they would use alternative medicine if it were �affordable and convenient.� Even better, in a poll of physicians, 94% said they have referred patients for at least one unconventional therapy. Second, almost universally, the cost of alternative treatments is less than for conventional services. For example, the use of intravenously delivered magnesium rather than clot-dispersing drugs for heart attacks could save almost $1 billion a year. Third, nearly across the board, there are fewer complications, side effects, and costly, unexpected medical outcomes with alternative medicine procedures. For example, the annual hospitalization cost of drug prescription errors for conventional medicine is estimated to be $20 billion. Fourth, you have a clientele that is, in effect, trained by their alternative doctors to take more responsibility for their health, empowered with lists of self-care programs such as nutritional supplementation. As the American Western Wellness Line data shows, one-fifth of clients, when given adequate medical information, can successfully treat themselves for their nonemergency conditions. The plan emphasizes self-reliance and preventive health maintenance, values the Digest strongly endorses. One way to prevent illness, to develop self-reliance, and to practice self-care, is to know your health status. In this issue, we provide you with information on 3 different preventive (and inexpensive) laboratory health tests. See �What the �Whole-Body� Dentist Knows about Mercury Fillings� (p. 76) to learn how a biological dentist uses electro-dermal screening to identify health conditions related to mercury dental amalgams, dental infections, and impacted wisdom teeth, and problems such as fatigue and depression. See �Treating the Chemical Heart of Disease� (p. 28) for information on the Maverick Monitoring Test which assesses the damage of toxins and free radicals on your immune response. Finally, see �Lab Tests Rate Your Antioxidant Protection� (p. 61) for a description of 2 simple tests that reveal how well (or poorly) your body responds to the �oxidative stress� of free radical activity in your body. These tests, called preventive diagnostic screens, give you valuable medical information in advance of the actual development of illness. Do you want to insure your future health? I suggest 3 things. Get your insurance company to start covering alternative medicine. Get informed about the biochemical state of your health through a preventive lab test. Get self-reliant and confident about treating yourself whenever possible. For information and inspiration on these 3 important jobs, enjoy the self-empowering pages of our latest Digest.

The most common sleep disorder is insomnia of which there are 3 kinds. The most prevalent is sleep onset insomnia. Normally, a person should fall asleep within 5 to 15 minutes of going to bed. If you consistently stay awake beyond 45 minutes, you have sleep-onset insomnia. The other insomnias are mid-sleep onset insomnia (waking up in the middle of the night) and early morning insomnia (waking up too early). Other people suffer from restless leg syndrome. Here the legs twitch convulsively in one-second muscle contractions, with sometimes 500 episodes a night, and this seriously disrupts sleep. Sleep apnea, or moments during sleep when you stop breathing, is a more serious problem, and is often associated with obesity and overuse of alcohol. The sleep apnea patient often wakes up suddenly gasping for air; a night of this and one wakes up quite fatigued in the morning. Surely, being in bed but unable to sleep is one of the worst things in life. An estimated 49% of American adults today have had sleeping problems at one time in their lives. About 60 million people have chronic sleep disturbances, and women are twice as likely as men to have a sleep disorder and twice as likely to seek treatment. According to a Gallup survey of 1027 adults in October 1995, nearly 49% of adult Americans have trouble sleeping, a 13% increase from 1991. Further, 35% have occasional insomnia, 12% have chronic insomnia, 25% believe you cannot be successful and get enough sleep, and more women (52%) have sleep problems than men (45%). Many different types of people experience sleep disorders. It�s not just the stereotypical �Type A take-charge personality� who runs around all day and whose mind won�t turn off when it�s bedtime. Consider the case of Laurie. She is a professional hair colorist who came to me in desperation over her insomnia. Laurie would wake up after 2 hours of sleep and rarely be able to fall asleep again. Conventional medicine hadn�t helped her and antibiotics made her sinus infections and skin conditions even worse. I suspected that the coloring chemicals she worked with and the antibiotics she had taken had made her liver toxic; a functional liver detoxification profile by Great Smokies Diagnostic Laboratories confirmed our diagnosis. At our suggestion, Laurie took a month off from work during which time I put her on a program which included liver detoxification, sacro-occipital chiropractic work, and applied kinesiology (which is both a means of diagnosis by muscle testing and a therapeutic process). At my clinic, we taught her stress reduction and breathing techniques, self-hypnosis, and acupressure as tools to put herself to sleep if she had trouble sleeping. After 3 weeks on this program, Laurie began to sleep through the night and now, one year later, she is still doing well. She was not able to change her profession, so every month she does another liver detoxification. That, along with the adjustments she�s made in lifestyle, work to keep her sleeping soundly. Question: What causes sleeping disorders? It is important to remember that sleeplessness is often a symptom, warning you about a system breakdown somewhere else in your body, so you need to pay attention when your body gives you this clue. A toxic liver is one factor. In addition to environmental toxins such as Laurie was exposed to, other factors including stress, anxieties, grief, illness, faulty diet, allergies, drugs, and biochemical deficiencies can all contribute to sleep difficulties. It�s commonly believed that as we get older we should expect to sleep poorly. I disagree with that. How well you will sleep as you age depends on your lifestyle. If you are a senior citizen who has spent most of your life drinking alcohol, not exercising, abusing food and caffeine, your body will then serve you back with sleep problems. I have had many patients in their 60s, 70s, and 80s who sleep wonderfully well, because they have had healthy lifestyles. One of the main causes of sleeplessness, especially mid-sleep onset insomnia, is trouble in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. This is often related to taking antibiotics or exposure to toxic substances, even if it was many years ago. Antibiotics impair the intestinal tract and over time lodge in the liver rendering it toxic and unable to break down the poisons in the body. Instead, these flow into the bloodstream and the metabolic pathways. It is these poisons that cause people to wake up in the middle of the night. When a person goes through a liver detoxification program and the intestinal tract is rejuvenated, then the insomnia often disappears. Hormonal imbalances can be a major cause of sleep problems for women. The cycle of estrogen release is closely linked with the activities of the adrenal glands. Estrogens are necessary for the smooth functioning of the sleep cycle, so when women enter menopause and their estrogens start to fluctuate and diminish, if their adrenal glands and liver are stressed, they will probably experience disturbances in their sleep. Again, liver detoxification and adrenal support can eliminate this imbalanced relationship. Conversely, a strong, healthy liver and adrenal glands can be an alternative source of estrogens. Further evidence of the role of the liver in sleep problems is the fact that about 33% of people who take Prozac for depression have sleep problems (paradoxically, a strong symptom of depression). The liver breaks down the chemicals in Prozac, but if the liver is toxic, it�s unable to perform this function. Again, a liver detoxification may remedy this. One common sign of clinical depression is the early morning variety of insomnia. The person wakes up at 4:00 a.m., the mind starts working, and they go right into their depressive state, so that getting back to sleep is an impossibility. Depressed people often sleep during the day as an escape, so when night comes around they�re slept out. Question: What do you advise for getting over sleeping disorders? We must look at the whole picture of diet and lifestyle. Does the person use alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, salt, or sugar, or take recreational drugs? These can produce sleeping disorders. Does the person have a low blood sugar problem and over-consume sugar? This can make one wake up in the middle of the night craving more sugar. If someone is particularly sensitive to caffeine (present in many foods and products besides tea and coffee), even having it at breakfast can affect sleep that night because caffeine can stay in the blood for up to 16 hours. If it does, slow caffeine clearance usually means the liver is not detoxifying the caffeine. The liver function test (mentioned above) and diagnostic stool analysis, can tell us this, along with information about toxin levels. For treating the problems in the gastrointestinal tract, I use two detoxification products, called Ultraclear and Ultraclear Sustain. Depending on the severity of the problem, our patients will stay on this from 2-8 weeks, after which time most people feel a strong energy boost. I often recommend calcium and multimineral supplements. Many patients have systems that are too acidic and need to be more alkaline, a rebalancing that mineral supplements, which are alkaline and sedative in function, can achieve. There is a psychological dimension to our anti-insomnia prescriptions, too. I find many sleeping disorder patients are highly introverted; their inward-turning daytime focus encourages sleeplessness. This means the more adventurously and interactively you live your day, the greater your guarantee of good sleep during the night. In my sleep workshops, I emphasize avoiding the �victim complex.� When people say �I have insomnia,� in effect they have labeled themselves victims of their insomnia. I urge changing this to �I am going through the process of sleeplessness.� Then you can enter into and control this process. For patients who need it, I provide chiropractic adjustments to correct any structural problems that are especially likely in the sacro-occipital relationship. If the cranial-sacral pump is not working efficiently, it cannot transmit the neural message and, as a result, will negatively affect every system of the body, interfering with its ability to relax its muscles. Exercise is another important factor. The best time to exercise (with light to moderate aerobic exercise such as walking or swimming) is usually before 5 p.m. Vigorous exercise later than this will overstimulate the body and may keep you awake that night. For people who have caffeine addiction problems, I prescribe an allersode called Caffeine Mix, an allergy desensitization remedy containing homeopathically prepared substances from tea, chocolate, caffeine, cola, coffee, and histamine, plus components that work with the adrenals and liver. Flora Plus is another homeopathic product I use for relief of bowel congestion and food-related digestive disturbances. Herbal teas are helpful. Use the sleep-promoting herbs: catnip, chamomile, lime blossom, and primrose. For a foot or full-body herbal bath, use balm leaves (2 oz), boiled in a quart of water for 15 minutes; or angelica root (7 oz) in 2 quarts of cold water, then brought to a boil and steeped for 5 minutes. Or use valerian root (3-4 oz) to one quart of cold water; let this soak 10-12 hours, then briefly boil. Add the herbal liquid to your bath water and immerse yourself for 20 minutes. A sesame oil massage of the head and bottom of the feet works well for some people. Question: Does my bedroom have an effect on my sleeping problems? Yes, quite often it does, so it�s important to look at your sleeping environment. Electromagnetic pollution is increasingly a problem. Put your electric clock away from your bed because the electromagnetic frequency it emits may be interfering with your sleep. The same goes for cellular phones, electric blankets, and, for some especially sensitive people, metal beds. I prescribe a �Raya� pendant to wear during the day as a shield against electromagnetic pollution. Raya makes other products that create an energy field that reduces the effect of the electromagnetic pollution in the air around you and thereby allows you to sleep better. The right room temperature during sleep is also important. The best sleeping temperature is between 60 and 70�F. If it is above 75, you may have nighttime awakening, increased movement in bed, and shallower sleep. The colors in your bedroom are a factor, too: stay away from red which is overstimulating. Next, look at what you�re sleeping on. An estimated 7% of American adults with sleeping problems have uncomfortable mattresses. Cotton sheets and blankets are preferable to synthetic materials just as feather pillows are better than foam. A sheepskin mattress cover decreases movement during sleep and will help people have less pain from arthritic joints while sleeping. For people sensitive to nighttime noise or light, ear plugs and masks are helpful. A white-noise machine can aid sleep, too. Question: What can I do for myself to start sleeping better? Here is a simple breathing exercise to do when you�re in bed. Take a breath in, hold for a count of 4, let it out, then inhale again. Do this 3 or 4 times. Repeat, holding the pause before the next inhalation. This changes the oxygen/carbon dioxide ratio in the blood and will promote sleep. Here is a progressive muscle relaxation exercise in which you relax your muscles from head to toe, one region at a time. Clench then relax the muscles in your head, then your neck, then shoulders, arms, torso, hips, thighs, legs, ankles, and, finally, your feet. There are acupressure points you can hold to help put yourself to sleep. Rub and press upon these for a couple of minutes while in bed, before sleeping: Kidney 6, called Joyful Sleep, located directly below the inside of the ankle bone on either foot; Bladder 62, called Calm Sleep, in the indentation on the outside of the ankle bone. There are two points on the forearm: Pericardium 6, called the Inner Gate, located in the middle of the inside of the forearm, 2-1/2 finger widths from the wrist crease; and Heart 7, called Spirit Gate, on the inside of the wrist crease in line with the little finger. The brain hormone, melatonin, is an effective sleeping aid, especially for people with sleep-onset insomnia. The dosage I recommend is from 1-6 mg, taken 30-120 minutes before bedtime, although I adjust the dosage on an individual basis. Be sure your dosage is monitored by a health care professional. I also give people Serotonin Dopamine Liquescence, a remedy containing 14 different homeopathically prepared substances. This stimulates the uptake of the brain chemicals, serotonin and dopamine, which will in turn increase the availability of melatonin and will help you sleep better.

STANINGER, Ph.D. By the time Howard came to the Hospital of the Americas he had tried everything conventional medicine could offer to reverse his prostate cancer. The cancer had spread to his bone marrow and his conventional doctors had sent him home to die. At 82, Howard looked like �walking death,� his doctors admitted. He was excessively thin and his PSA (prostate specific antigen, a reliable indicator) was over 20, compared to a healthy normal of 0-4. The Hospital, administered by the World Center for Anti-Aging Medicine and set in a pristine, pollution-free coastal corner of the Dominican Republic, was his last hope. The Hospital�s team of doctors, led by founder Dr. James Monroe Parsons, M.D., started Howard on their multifaceted treatment program. They gave him shark cartilage (3 injections of 8 cc per week) and live cell thymus gland injections (8 cc once a week). Dr. Parsons� team also gave Howard a Chinese herbal detoxifying formula once daily (containing Fumaria officinalis, Fasera carolinensis, allicin, and garlic, among other ingredients); colonic irrigation once daily; and hyperbaric oxygen therapy for one hour, 6 days a week. In only the second week of this regimen, Howard began to notice an improvement. His energy picked up and he started to gain weight. After 12 weeks, he had no complaints, he had gained 12 pounds and no longer had that deathlike appearance. His PSA level dropped to within normal range. Three months later, not only was he still alive, but Howard was enjoying a �quality� life, says Dr. Parsons. THE FREEDOM TO HEAL. The Hospital offers a roster of progressive alternative therapies for the prevention and treatment of disease. The �anti-aging� in their name highlights the fact that as most diseases accelerate the aging process, good medicine will act to slow down the aging process. The facility, which opened in mid-1995, has an arrangement with 12 nearby hotels to provide lodging for patients. The cost of all treatments and a hotel room runs about $3000 per week (compared to $5000 per week for many off-shore treatment facilities). Total laboratory work typically costs a patient $500-$700. Dr. Parsons, who has been in practice for 30 years, founded the Hospital out of his frustration at not being able to offer effective treatments to his patients while in the U.S. It also represented his effort to bring to practical fruition an insight he had developed during his many years of practice: that our highly technologized civilization spews out so many toxins that surely this is a major cause of the incredible proliferation of disease over the last 50 years. �As a doctor, I have always felt this to be the truth and yet saw it was almost universally ignored,� Dr. Parsons explains. The Hospital of the Americas provides an array of treatments, some of them unavailable in the U.S. despite ample evidence of positive results. �Americans are starving, if not dying, for access to these treatments,� says Dr. Parsons, who is the Hospital�s chief medical consultant and an active member of the International Board of Medical Toxicologists. �You cannot practice medicine in the United States of America, period, end of statement,� he declares. �If a doctor sees or reads about a new, cutting-edge treatment that is effective, and uses it in the U.S., he could lose his license. The American Medical Association, FDA, and the state medical licensing boards put doctors into a kind of therapeutic gridlock, so they all march to the same conventional drummer and treat in the same way. If you do anything different, you�re said to not be practicing up to the accepted level of your colleagues. I had to get offshore in order to do more to help patients heal. Parsons� clinic has achieved success in treating a range of serious health conditions, including cancer, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer�s, circulatory disorders, diabetes, fungal infestation, chronic fatigue, Parkinson�s, and lupus. The key is to identify and then remove toxins from the body. In fact, 95% of all degenerative diseases, including cancer, are probably caused by chemicals and polluting substances, says Hildegarde L. A. Staninger, Ph.D., a prominent toxicologist with Sunstate Preventive Medicine Institute in Winter Park, Florida, who joined with Dr. Parsons to establish the Hospital. KNOW YOUR PATIENT�S TOXINS. Detoxification is a main component of the clinic�s program, but first you must identify the toxins, Dr. Staninger explains. Hospital toxicity tests screen up to 100,000 different substances, even at the minutest levels of parts per quadrillion. Dr. Parsons� staff routinely tests blood, plasma, urine, saliva, and hair as needed; hair analysis is the best way to detect heavy metals, says Dr. Parsons. To test for the damage level of toxin activity, the Hospital uses the Maverick Monitoring Test (MMT), an innovative protocol developed by Dr. Staninger. Maverick measures body levels of toxic agents that create harmful free radicals; these measures provide scientifically based indications for treatment. For example, Sarah, aged 11, was exposed to Ficam W, a pesticide normally used on cracks and crevices to kill molds. But at her school, the maintenance department irresponsibly sprayed it on the classroom rugs. Sarah had only a 15-minute exposure, but she developed pain in her liver and extreme fatigue. Within 12 hours, she was rushed to the clinic for treatment. Toxicity tests indicated pesticide solvents in her system and her liver enzymes were highly elevated, at 271 compared to 105, which is normal for a child her age. Sarah�s immune system was becoming severely compromised. A blood test revealed elevated Epstein-Barr virus levels, at 429 titer compared to a normal of less than 100. Dr. Parsons immediately put her on hyperbaric oxygen therapy for one hour a day for 5 days to flush the poisons out of her system. He also put her on vitamin E (400 I.U. daily) and a roster of specially formulated products including Vira Defense (1 capsule twice daily), Super Defense Plus (1 capsule, 3 times daily), Hepta Defense (1 capsule once daily), and Alpha Defense (1 capsule, twice daily). When Sarah was tested again after 5 days, she was negative for the toxic chemicals and her Epstein-Barr had dropped to a safer 78 titer. She no longer felt fatigued and her liver pain was gone. To complete her detoxification, drop the EBV even lower, and bolster her immune system, Dr. Parsons gave Sarah 5 more hyperbaric treatments, spaced a day apart, and continued her on the supplements for another 8 weeks. MANY WAYS TO DETOXIFY. As Sarah�s case shows, with the toxins identified, detoxification can proceed on a more precisely targeted and individually tailored basis, Dr. Staninger says. No two people are ever sick in the same way, even when they apparently have the same disease or have been poisoned by the same chemicals. A customized approach to detoxification and healing is essential, Dr. Staninger notes. The Hospital has multiple modalities at its disposal to detoxify its patients. These include: biological dentistry (removing mercury, gold, and nickel amalgams); colon cleansing and irrigation; oxygen therapy (including inhalation of mist and ionized oxygen); herbal soaks or poultices; parasitic disease control; homeopathic remedies; Chinese herbs; and medically supervised diets and fasts. Dr. Parsons� staff may also employ electroacupuncture (EAV, a form of electro-dermal screening) for both diagnosis and detoxification; a resonant frequency microcurrent treatment; color laser therapy; live cell therapy (to rejuvenate organs and the endocrine system); chelation therapy (to flush toxins out of the bloodstream); lymphatic drainage and recirculation; and colloidal mineral water, among others. The clinic�s multimodal approach also comprises psychotherapy, meditation, stress reduction techniques, hatha yoga, and exercise instruction. There are of course specific dietary programs for every patient, but in general Dr. Parsons� advice is to avoid �Fat White CATS� by which he means fats, white flour, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, and sugar. All of these approaches, both on their own and when applied in concert, pull out disease-producing toxins from the body which exerts a positive effect on mental function, states Dr. Parsons. Ionized oxygen breathing helps to rehabilitate tissues and cells, reduce free radical damage, and improve circulation. Breathing specially prepared mists helps to oxygenate and detoxify the tiny air passages in the lungs, thereby removing debris. This is especially effective for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Herbal soaks (a Chinese herbal formula combined with DMSO, made into a poultice) pull toxins out through the skin. There�s something to be said for the positive influence of the clinic�s environment, too. For many, the Playa Dorada (�Golden Beach�) area of the Dominican Republic is a �Caribbean Eden.� The Hospital is set in the midst of a considerable vacation resort development that offers 3692 hotel rooms, 35 restaurants, 3 casinos, and a golf course. MORE OXYGEN, LESS AGING. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is one of the most thoroughly detoxifying methods Dr. Parsons employs. �Oxygen can burn up toxic substances in the body in a short time,� he states. Dr. Parsons uses the monoplace chamber (a chamber for one person) because it achieves a thorough oxygenation by driving 100% oxygen through the skin. HBOT corrects the inadequate oxygen levels in the blood of elderly patients. In fact, Dr. Parsons contends that many of the diseases associated with aging are actually the product of severely and progressively decreased blood and tissue oxygenation. That�s why so many age-related degenerative conditions respond well to oxygen therapy. A now famous statement from Science (February 24, 1956, Vol. 123, No. 3191, �On the Origin of Cancer Cells�) reminds us that Otto Warburg, M.D., the only doctor to win two Nobel prizes for medicine, won them because of oxygen. He proved that cancer develops when the oxygen requirement of cells is reduced to 40% and that when cellular respiration is damaged from lack of oxygen, this provokes cells to mutate out of control into cancer cells. Oxygen therapy would therefore be an effective treatment for many diseases, said Dr. Warburg. Dr. Parsons agrees. �Older people, receiving more oxygen, regain the circulation of their blood and sometimes add years to their life span,� says Dr. Parsons. And these are �good years, worth living,� not just mere life extension. A SPA FOR THE HEALTHY TOURIST. It is not only the chronically or desperately ill who come to the Hospital. The facility offers techniques for rejuvenating the skin, removing wrinkles and blemishes, and achieving weight loss as well as body recontouring which is an alternative to plastic surgery. Lymphatic work, also offered, breaks up and flushes toxic collections of lymph fluid that may be contributing to unsightly skin. Often tourists from nearby resorts drop by for a toxicity test and detoxification regimen as a wise preventive measure, says Dr. Parsons. From blood and urine samples, Dr. Parsons� team can provide them with a complete report in a few days, telling them if their body harbors anything that is potentially illness-producing or age-accelerating. An ounce of smart prevention can so often be worth years of cure, quips Dr. Parsons. �I believe our multimodal approach to testing, detoxification, and nutritional support will be the standard medicine of the next century and will be ever more in demand as the years pass. Our medical care for the new millennium is ready now, to be used to achieve wellness.

BREINER, D.S.S. I believe that in most cases it is wise to remove toxic metals such as mercury from the mouth. Generally, by the time a patient gets to me, she may already be seriously ill or plagued with confusing symptoms for which no one has been able to find a medical answer. In most cases, patients in this condition request that I remove their mercury amalgam dental fillings, even though they have no firm assurance that their health problems will be improved. That was Melanie�s plight. DEPRESSION CAUSED BY MERCURY FILLINGS. Melanie suffered from severe depression which had worsened after she broke a tooth and exposed a new surface of amalgam. She wanted all 8 of her mercury amalgams removed immediately. Melanie told me she felt suicidal and out of control and could not wait even one more day to have this procedure done. I gave her vitamins, minerals, and homeopathic remedies to prepare her system for the mercury removal which would be done several days later. Her reaction to having the mercury removed was dramatic. Her depression lifted immediately and she rapidly became a normal, healthy woman again. Melanie feels she would have killed herself if the mercury had not been taken out of her teeth. In my experience, the majority of patients who have their mercury amalgams removed see positive and often dramatic improvements in their health. In fact, a Patient Adverse Reaction Report (1994) involving 762 people showed that about 24% reported symptoms of depression and 100% of these reported feeling �better or cured� after their mercury dental amalgams were removed. WHAT THE WHOLE-BODY DENTIST KNOWS. In December 1990, 60 Minutes aired a story called �Is There Poison in Your Mouth?� in which they focused on the controversy over mercury dental amalgam fillings. The viewing public responded in droves, requesting dentists across the U.S. to remove their mercury-based fillings. Many dentists reacted to this pressure and replaced their patients� fillings even though they were not adequately trained to do so. The results were disastrous. I received hundreds of calls during the months that followed this broadcast from patients who had their fillings removed and then became very ill. Why? Because improper amalgam removal, especially in patients already somewhat ill, can cause complications and possibly produce toxic mercury exposure at much higher levels than they had with the mercury in their teeth. Even worse, few dentists know how to recognize the symptoms of mercury poisoning or know how the human body stores and processes toxins, yet this information is crucial to a successful removal of mercury amalgams. A dentist trained adequately in the protocols of what I call Whole-Body Dentistry� will understand the body�s processes as a unified ecosystem and will never remove amalgam fillings without preliminary testing. First, we must evaluate how your body currently is handling the mercury poison; second, we must determine your overall health and immunological vitality. A �provocative urine� test can reveal how saturated with mercury your body tissues are. A mercury vapor test tells us how much mercury is escaping the fillings as vapor during chewing and when your teeth are at rest. A metals compatibility test shows us your reaction at the immunological level to the heavy metal components of the filling. I use electro-dermal screening to evaluate the impact of mercury on the body�s acupuncture meridians or energy circuits. I also check for electrical interference generated by the amalgam fillings, using a meter that reads electrical current in the mouth. These tests give the dentist evidence regarding how the patient�s body is managing the impact of mercury poison. However, each individual has a unique toxicity threshold. PREPARING FOR MERCURY REMOVAL. When the decision to remove the mercury fillings is made, before proceeding it�s important that the body systems be working efficiently. The feces are a major excretory route for mercury, so it�s essential that the patient�s eliminatory system be working well. If there is constipation or sluggish bowels, this must be corrected. While mercury remains in the teeth, there is a constant low level of mercury poisoning in the body; after amalgam removal when the body begins to detoxify, the mercury must be flushed out of the body rapidly and thoroughly. For a relatively healthy person preparing to remove the mercury, this involves taking vitamins, minerals, and homeopathic remedies. During the mercury removal, we administer vitamin C intravenously to minimize the harmful impact of mercury suddenly entering the bloodstream. Attention to diet and nutrition immediately before, during, and immediately after amalgam removal, factor heavily in a patient�s ability to flush toxins out of the body. Strategic use of the diet can help the body fight infection and hasten the healing process, sometimes even minimizing the need for medication. I encourage my patients to eat extra amounts of eggs (2-4 daily) for their high sulfur content; the sulfur bonds with mercury and other metals and carries them out of the body. I recommend higher than normal daily amounts of vitamin C (a maximum of 3000 g, taken in 1000 g doses). I often advise my patients to receive massage, acupuncture, or homeopathic remedies to help in the healing process. Detoxifying baths, sauna, and exercise are also useful because they help a patient to literally �sweat out� the poisons. When I remove the mercury amalgam from a patient who is suffering from a number of ailments and the symptoms do not completely clear up, I immediately think about the negative influence of root canals and cavitations (improperly healed tooth extraction sites). Both of these dental conditions can produce significant problems in the way the body functions. A WINDOW INTO THE BODY�S ENERGY SYSTEMS. The best way to isolate the role of these dental factors is with electro-dermal screening. Your dentist may not have heard of this approach yet, but in not too many years this device will undoubtedly be as common to the dental office as the treatment chair and X-ray machine. Since every major organ in your body is linked through the energy meridians of acupuncture to a specific tooth, electro-dermal screening (EDS) can provide the whole-body dentist with a great deal of useful information about the state of your teeth and how that state affects any part or system of the body. EDS can help identify �energetic stressors� in the body that are creating blockages in the natural flow of energy. Dental stressors can be anything alien or out of balance in the body such as fillings, crowns, impacted teeth, root canal teeth, sinuses, tonsils, scars, misaligned teeth, inflamed gums, and cavitations. These fields of disturbance are most often located in the head because the mouth is the place where we most readily allow thoughtless or unnecessary surgery, excessive procedures, and implantation of foreign materials. However, the results of this disturbance can be felt anywhere in the body and can block the effectiveness of virtually any treatment. EDS is an exceptionally useful, non- invasive investigational tool that helps me recognize which types of more conventional diagnostic testing might be appropriate to confirm my suspicions of what is going on in the patient�s mouth, as the following case study shows. NO WISDOM IN KEEPING THESE TEETH. Anne Marie first came into my office wearing an oxygen mask. She had to wear it continuously. Several years earlier she had been exposed to strong chemicals used for cleaning furnaces. She became sick, then sicker, especially with breathing problems and heart arrhythmia. When I met her, Anne Marie was so ill that the slightest exposure to any airborne chemical would produce a serious disturbance. Consequently, she couldn�t drive a car anymore and she was rapidly getting worse. When I removed her mercury fillings, this stopped her downward slide and produced a slight improvement, but she remained severely ill. I used electro-dermal screening to discover that her wisdom teeth were affecting her autonomic nervous system and possibly influencing her breathing and heart problems. Anne Marie also had gum infections around these teeth and I urged her to have them removed. She resisted the proposal. Over the next several months I repeated the EDS investigation and consistently determined that her wisdom teeth were related to her other problems. She finally agreed to have these teeth removed. When she returned after the operation, Anne Marie gleefully informed me that not only had she driven the 200 miles from her home but she was down from 5 canisters of oxygen to less than one a week. She told me the positive results of having the wisdom teeth removed were instantaneous, �like someone turning on a light switch.� Immediately following the extraction, her heart rate, which previously had been greatly elevated, returned to normal. DENTAL PATIENTS AWAKE! Regrettably, the prevailing attitude of most dental patients is this: close your mind and open your mouth (and wallet). They do just as their dentist tells them. People have not been taught that the health of their teeth is linked to their overall well-being. I�m amazed at how often people will routinely forget about certain conventional dental procedures they have received because they regard them as minor and without lasting impact. That is why I tell my new patients that D.D.S, the initials for the standard dental degree, could also mean Deadly Dental Syndrome: what your dentist is doing or doesn�t know may be killing you.

TREAT YOUR FIBROID WITHOUT SURGERY According to Susan Lark, M.D., about 40% of American women have a benign fibroid tumor in the uterus by the time they reach menopause. �Fibroids are one of the most common female health problems affecting women during their reproductive years,� Dr. Lark says. Although uterine fibroids can disturb the quality of life (with pain, excessive menstrual bleeding, infertility) for about 50% of women who have them, less than 0.5% of fibroids ever become cancerous. Through lifestyle and dietary adjustments, most women can avoid a hysterectomy, the conventional treatment for fibroids, states Dr. Lark. Many women in her practice have reported a noticeable decrease in heavy bleeding and menstrual pain and discomfort within 1-2 menstrual cycles after starting her program. Here�s how to do it: FOODS TO EMPHASIZE. Useful here are whole grain millet, buckwheat, oats, rice, and rye, but not whole wheat. Consume tofu, black, kidney, pinto, lima, and soybeans, chick-peas, fresh, organic vegetables and fruits�especially dried figs, blackberries, bananas, raisins, and oranges, says Dr. Lark. NUTS AND SEEDS. Dr. Lark recommends regular consumption of raw flax, pumpkin, sesame, and sunflower seeds, pistachios, pecans, and almonds. ANIMAL PRODUCTS. In general, keep your consumption of meat, poultry, and fish to a minimum, emphasizing fish and poultry (without the skin) or no more than 3 ounces of meat daily; avoid these foods altogether if your fibroid is large and uncomfortable. OILS. Small amounts of cold-pressed vegetable oils high in vitamin E are best, including corn, olive, canola, or flaxseed. FOODS TO AVOID. All milk products should be avoided until the fibroid has dissolved. Severely reduce your intake of all saturated fats, salt, alcohol, refined sugar, and caffeine. VITAMINS. Take beta carotene (vitamin A precursor) from vegetable sources (at least 20,000 I.U. daily); vitamin B complex (50-100 mg daily) with additional B6 (up to 300 mg daily); vitamin C (1000-4000 mg daily) plus bioflavonoids (from grape skins, cherries, blackberries, blueberries, pulp and white rind of citrus fruits); vitamin E (400-2000 I.U. daily) from wheat germ, walnut, or soybean oil. MINERALS. Dr. Lark recommends taking iron (the �heme� type from meat sources such as liver); nonheme iron must be accompanied by at least 75 mg vitamin C for absorption. In addition, take calcium (minimum of 800 mg day during menstruation); magnesium (400 mg daily); and potassium (99 mg, 1-3 times daily for one week preceding onset of menstruation). HERBS. Useful herbs include goldenseal, shepherd�s purse (to help stop excessive bleeding), yellow dock, pau d�arco, turmeric, silymarin (for anemia and liver health), meadowsweet, and white willow bark (for inflammation, pain, and fever). ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS. These are the raw materials from which prostaglandins (hormone-like chemicals) are made; they help to relax muscles and blood vessels, thereby reducing cramps and tension. Chief among these are linoleic acid (omega-6 family) and linolenic acid (omega-3 family), found in fresh flax and pumpkinseed oils. Fish oils, from salmon, tuna, rainbow trout, mackerel, and eel, are strong sources of linolenic acid, while safflower, corn, sesame, and wheat germ oils are high in linoleic acid. EXERCISE. Regular aerobic exercise, slowly performed, is important, at least 3 times weekly, states Dr. Lark. Hatha yoga exercises can reduce pelvic congestion, improve blood circulation, and relax uterine muscles. STRESS REDUCTION. Useful techniques include meditation, deep-breathing exercises, counseling, psychotherapy, and emotional support from friends and family to ease stressful situations. ADDITIONAL TIPS. The following additional tips, courtesy of Carolyn Dean, M.D., will also be helpful in reducing fibroids: Evening primrose oil, 4 capsules daily; Marine lipid capsules, 4 daily; Foot reflexology massage; Castor oil packs or bentonite clay poultices over the uterine area; Herbal formulas including chaste tree berry (Vitex agnus castus), dong quai, licorice root, wild yam (Dioscorea), and sarsaparilla.

PUT YOUR STRESS ON CHILL MODE With Essential Oils Here are 3 quick, simple, and effective ways to use the essential oils of aromatherapy to chill out next time you�re feeling tense, according to certified aromatherapist Roberta Wilson, who teaches and practices in California and New Mexico. LEAVE YOUR TENSION IN THE BATH. Mix 4 drops lavender, 3 drops marjoram, 2 drops chamomile, and 2 drops cypress oil, and disperse in a bathtub of warm water. Soak yourself in peace for at least 20 minutes. KEEP THE COOL CLOSE TO YOUR SKIN. Using 1/8 ounce of jojoba oil as a base, mix in 3 drops of sandalwood, 2 drops rosewood, 2 drops neroli, 1 drop frankincense, 1 drop jasmine, and 1 drop ylang-ylang oil. Daub this mixture lightly on your neck, near your nostrils, or on your stomach for anti-stress; or place in a small bottle so you may sniff it frequently. CHILL OUT THE ENTIRE ROOM. Mix 15 drops of lavender, 10 drops clary sage, 10 drops lemon, 8 drops rosewood, 6 drops marjoram, 4 drops geranium, and 2 drops ylang-ylang oil in a small glass container. Cover tightly and allow the oils to settle. Then add a few drops to an aromatherapy burner or diffuser to fill the room with a tension-easing aroma. An aromatherapy burner is a small, inexpensive porcelain device with a candle below and a shallow cup above; 5-20 drops of the oils are dribbled into water, then, when heated, the fragrances diffuse into the air.

QUICK & NATURAL REMEDIES FOR COMMON HEALTH PROBLEMS ASTHMA: Daily supplementation with 1000-2000 mg of vitamin C can significantly reduce typical asthma symptoms. This recommendation is supported by the fact that asthmatics tend to have a 50% lower blood concentration of vitamin C than healthy people. The Environmental Protection Agency is now reporting that low vitamin C intake is directly linked with a higher rate of asthma, bronchitis, and wheezing.

DEPRESSION: Next time depression threatens to bury you, try an extract of St. John�s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). In 25 double-blind studies with 1592 patients, St. John�s Wort extract, taken at the rate of 300 mg daily for 4 weeks, brought relief from mild to moderate depression in 65-80% of patients with almost no side effects, says Michael Murray, N.D. In a study with 135 patients, those taking St. John�s Wort had a 56% improvement in their depression compared to 45% for those taking imipramine hydrochloride, a conventional drug.

ENLARGED PROSTATE: Instead of reaching for Proscar for prostate enlargement (called benign prostatic hyperplasia), try a combination of saw palmetto and stinging nettle root (urtica) extracts, advises H. J. Schneider, M.D., and his German colleagues. In their study, 2030 patients with enlarged prostate took 320 mg of saw palmetto extract and 240 mg of urtica root extract daily for 12 weeks, after which 86% reported symptom improvement and 79% said they experienced an improvement in their quality of life. Urinary flow improved by 29%, post-voiding dribbling was reduced by 53%, and residual urine retention was reduced by 44%.

FLU: If your body is telling you it�s on the verge of developing the flu, Marcus Laux, N.D., has a strategy to stop it or at least reduce its effects. Dr. Laux recommends that you take a thymus glandular extract every day to bolster the immune system, along with daily Echinacea herbal extract and vitamin C (3000-5000 mg daily) with bioflavonoids. If the flu still slips past these immune defenses, Dr. Laux recommends the use of a homeopathic formula called Oscillococcinum (available in health food stores), zinc lozenges, unsweetened licorice, an herbal throat spray called Throat Mist, and Sambucol, a black elderberry herbal extract.

HEARTBURN: According to the late naturopathic physician Hazel Parcells, N.D., Ph.D., D.C., if, at the first sign of heartburn, you sip a glass of warm water into which is mixed one teaspoon of baking soda, your heartburn �will go away almost immediately.� The baking soda helps to neutralize the overly acid activity in the stomach.

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE: You can dramatically reduce high blood pressure (hypertension) with a daily intake of coenzyme Q10, according to P. Langsjoen, M.D., and colleagues at the University of Texas. Dr. Langsjoen treated 109 patients with an average dose of 225 mg daily of coenzyme Q10 and found a steady increase in the functioning of the cardiovascular system and a decreased need for standard high blood pressure medications within 1 to 6 months. In fact, 51% of patients were able to discontinue 1-3 different drugs only 4.4 months after starting coenzyme Q10 even though the majority of patients had been dependent on them for at least 9 years.

IMPOTENCE: If you suffer from an inability to achieve or maintain an erection, recent studies show that taking Gingko biloba herbal extract at 240 mg daily can change that in 6 months or less, even if previous intracavernous (inside the penis) medications failed. In a recent study of 20 patients who had received this conventional therapy, 100% regained the ability to have a spontaneous and sustained erection within 6 months of Gingko biloba supplementation; blood flow into the penis improved within 3 months.

Surviving Chemotherapy Nutritional Healing Can See You Through If chemotherapy or radiation therapy are unavoidable for treating cancer, Stephen T. Sinatra, M.D., Chief of Cardiology at Manchester Memorial Hospital in Connecticut, has a nutritional recipe to help reduce the debilitating effects of these toxic treatments. Follow this program during the period in which you are receiving chemotherapy and radiation, says Dr. Sinatra. 24-HOUR JUICE FAST. Start a day-long fast by mixing the fresh juice of half a lemon with one teaspoon of maple syrup in a glass of bottled or purified water. For breakfast, drink one glass of cranberry juice; For lunch, drink one glass of apple or carrot juice mixed with wheat grass juice, green barley, or chlorella; For dinner, drink one glass of papaya juice and 2 bowls of hot miso broth; At bedtime, drink one cup of chamomile, ginger, or Echinacea tea. Do this juice fast for one day, then go to the next step. NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT. Begin eating a vegan diet, which means no fish, animal, or dairy products. Drink ginseng tea daily. Have at least one cup of miso soup with parsley and shiitake mushrooms every day. Drink one serving daily of wheat grass, green barley, or green magma extract. Take glutathione (100 mg daily); one Optimum Health multivitamin after each meal; one ImmuBoost supplement with bioflavonoid complex following each meal; and coenzyme Q10 (30 mg) after each meal. Stay on this program for the full duration of your chemotherapy or radiation treatment and for a few weeks after, says Dr. Sinatra.

Lily, aged 35, came to Marie Hoshimi-Wilkes, O.M.D., N.D., Ph.D., with a diagnosis of anemia and thalassemia (a genetic allergy to iron, supposedly incurable). She had severe migraines, digestive problems, and sleeping difficulties; her hands and feet were always cold and would go purple when especially chilled; she was unable to gain weight; and her shoulders and back always felt constricted. Dr. Hoshimi-Wilkes started treating Lily twice weekly. First she inserted acupuncture needles at the points on Lily�s back corresponding to 7 internal organs; then she burned artemisia leaf (a procedure called moxabustion) over these same points. The goal was to strengthen the function of the internal organs, disperse stagnant energy, and improve blood and energy circulation to the head and extremities. Once weekly, Dr. Hoshimi-Wilkes inserted acupuncture needles at the specific body sites of discomfort, including Lily�s shoulders and back of the neck. Then she focused green and violet light beams onto these same points. Next, she gave Lily 2 Chinese herbal formulas, including donq quai (for blood circulation) and angelica (for headaches). Lily followed this regimen for a month, but even after the first visit, her headaches became less intense; soon after, her digestion improved, she was able to gain weight, and as her peripheral circulation improved, her hands became warmer. After several weeks, Lily experienced a healing crisis, says Dr. Hoshimi-Wilkes, when she underwent a four-day bout with the flu accompanied by intense headaches. This was a positive sign that her body was staging a major detoxification. Dr. Hoshimi-Wilkes applied more acupuncture and color therapy, and gave Lily homeopathic and flower essence remedies for her acute symptoms. A month later, a conventional medical test revealed that Lily was no longer allergic to iron, meaning that Chinese medicine, expertly applied, had reversed a condition that was believed to be incurable.

Dr. Abram Hoffer, M.D., Ph.D., relates a case of the �sickest arthritic� he had ever seen in 35 years of practice. Victoria was confined to a wheelchair and was unable to propel herself; her hands were �horribly deformed and misshapen� and she could not extend her legs, which were swollen; she had severe, continuous pain in her arms, hips, and back; her bowels bled; she had been unable to sit up, unassisted, for 15 years; she had bouts of suicidal depression and required 24-hour complete nursing care. Victoria told Dr. Hoffer that she expected he could help her only �very little.� Dr. Hoffer first put Victoria on a diet free from all refined sugars, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, and asked her to abstain from tobacco. Then he prescribed vitamin B3 (niacinamide: 500 mg, 4 times daily); vitamin C (ascorbic acid: 500 mg, 4 times daily); vitamin B6 (pyridoxine: 250 mg, once daily); zinc sulfate (220 mg, once daily); linseed oil (2 tablespoons daily); and cod liver oil (1 tablespoon daily). One month after starting this regimen, Victoria came in smiling to Dr. Hoffer�s office. Her back pain was much reduced, her hips were pain-free, and her bowels no longer bled. Dr. Hoffer added Linodil (inositol niacinate, a form of niacin: 500 mg, 4 times daily) to her program. After another month, Victoria was able to sit up in bed without help for the first time in 15 years. After another 2-1/2 months, she was able to wheel herself around unassisted and she could nurse her husband, who had the flu. A year later, Victoria had regained muscle tone and strength and only had mild pain in her left arm�altogether �a remarkable response in a very sick arthritic, states Dr. Hoffer.

DEPRESSION. Based on his work with hundreds of chronically depressed patients who failed to recover with antidepressant drugs, C. Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Shealy Institute in Springfield, Missouri, states forthrightly, �I have been able to bring 85% of these patients out of depression within two weeks, without drugs and undesirable side effects.� First, Dr. Shealy corrects electrical abnormalities in the brain-wave patterns of depressed patients. In 75% of depressed people, the right side of the brain has more electrical activity than the left, says Dr. Shealy. Using a cranial electrical stimulator (CES: it pulses a weak electrical current) for one hour daily, 50% of patients improve within 2 weeks with no other therapy and no side effects. One patient emerged from a 16-year depression only 24 hours after his first CES treatment. CES is best applied for 40-60 minutes daily between 6 and 9 a.m., Dr. Shealy says. As a complement to CES, Dr. Shealy recommends photostimulation using a device he invented called the Shealy RelaxMate� for 15 minutes twice daily and for 60 minutes before bedtime. In this therapy, the patient wears goggles which have 2 lights on their inside surface; these flash at varying brightness and frequency up to a maximum of 7.5 flashes per second. Specially selected music also provides a vibratory therapy that helps patients relax and release suppressed conflicts, says Dr. Shealy. He recommends Pachelbel�s Canon in D, Beethoven�s Sixth Symphony, Rachmaninoff�s Isle of the Dead, Mozart�s Requiem, David Ison�s Therasound, and Steven Halpern�s Spectrum Suite, among others. Listen to any of these for 1-2 hours daily, says Dr. Shealy. Nutritional supplementation is vitally important, Dr. Shealy explains. Almost every depressed patient is deficient in at least one amino acid (protein building block); about 78% are specifically lacking in taurine and 70-80% are short in magnesium. Dr. Shealy recommends magnesium taurate at 250 mg daily, taken before sleeping, in complement with 100 mg of a vitamin B complex. Taken orally, it may take 6 months to replenish magnesium stores, but if taken intravenously, the uptake is faster. For taurine amino acid supplementation, rather than supplements, Dr. Shealy prefers a homemade meat broth (simmered 12 hours). The broth is taken at the rate of one quart daily for the first month, then one pint for months 2-3, then one cup daily forever. About one-half of depressed patients are also deficient in an important adrenal hormone called DHEA, says Dr. Shealy. �Not one of more than 1000 depressed patients tested at the Shealy Institute has had optimal levels of DHEA.� If testing indicates your DHEA levels are too low, then supplement with DHEA for 3 months at 100 mg twice daily, Dr. Shealy recommends. Other useful supplements for depression include beta carotene (up to 200,000 I.U., daily), vitamin C (up to 2-5 g daily), vitamin B6 (100 mg), zinc (30 mg), pycnogenol (30 mg, twice daily). Dr. Shealy further advocates aerobic exercises on a regular basis. For example, this would be building up to walking 4 miles in 60 minutes 5 days a week and walking 2 miles in 30 minutes on the sixth day. Depression is reversible, following these protocols, says Dr. Shealy. �These results represent one of the most consistent miracles of alternative healing.

At 28, he had a nervous breakdown. When he came to acupuncturist David J. Nickel, O.M.D., L.Ac., at the age of 32, Dr. Nickel performed a mercury vapor analysis on Earl�s teeth. He found that the toxic fumes from Earl�s 6 mercury-based amalgam fillings was 42 times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency�s maximum allowable limit. A hair analysis indicated that Earl also had aluminum, copper, and mercury at toxic levels in his tissues and that he had an exceptionally slow metabolic rate. Earl suffered from fatigue, anger, anxiety, back problems, low blood sugar, nervousness, ringing in his ears, concentration loss, and prematurely greying hair. Dr. Nickel put Earl on a nutritional supplement program after which there was significant improvement in his metabolic rate and blood sugar levels and limited improvement in his other symptoms. But after Earl had all 6 mercury-based amalgams and his root canal tooth removed, he began to experience major change, states Dr. Nickel. In a month, his energy level returned to what he had enjoyed 15 years earlier and he was able to exercise, work, and play strenuously with no exhaustion. His other symptoms improved as well. �I don�t remember when I have ever felt so good,� Earl said. According to Dr. Nickel, removing the mercury fillings and root canal was responsible for Earl�s return to health. �Of the 90% of my patients with dental fillings, most have a mercury-induced copper toxicity, high calcium levels, and reduced thyroid and adrenal function,� states Dr. Nickel. �Mercury is associated with 258 different symptoms and copper with over 100. Almost all my patients who have had their mercury-based fillings removed showed moderate to dramatic improvement in their health in usually less than one month. SOURCE: Patient records of David J.

Katie, aged 42, had suffered from whole-body pain for 5 years before receiving treatment for fibromyalgia (chronic, severe muscle pain) from Ross A. Hauser, M.D. A series of previous diagnoses, physical therapy rounds, and anti-inflammatory medications and antidepressants (such as Elavil) had brought no relief. Her neck pain was so intense she had to wear a neck brace; she also had pain in her jaw, arms, legs, and back and the ligaments in these regions were especially tender. Dr. Hauser treated Katie with prolotherapy (also known as Reconstructive therapy), which involves the injection of a natural irritant substance (dextrose or lidocaine) into the junction of the bone and ligament or bone and tendon to encourage repair of damaged tissue and to stimulate the growth of new cells and collagen. Dr. Hauser made his injections at the tender spots over the ligaments and tendons of Katie�s arms, legs, jaw, back, and neck. Six weeks later, she no longer needed the neck brace and was able to go swimming and walking. Six months later (after a second prolotherapy treatment), Katie experienced pain only with strenuous exercise but was otherwise �doing great,� notes Dr. Hauser. After a third prolotherapy treatment, all her symptoms abated and �Katie has been doing fine since�sleeping like a baby�and she has a smile on her face again,� Dr. Hauser says.

Woodstock, New York dentist Victor Zeines, D.D.S., designed a study (1994) involving 20 healthy adults with either gingivitis or periodontitis to see how well an herbal mouth rinse could perform in reversing these early symptoms of dental decay. The study participants used the product (The Natural Dentist� Herbal Mouth and Gum Therapy) daily for 12 weeks, rinsing with one capful for 30 seconds, twice daily. The product contains 6 herbal extracts, including Echinacea, grapefruit seed, bloodroot, aloe, goldenseal, and calendula. At the end of the test period, gum bleeding was substantially reduced, the incidence of dental plaque was 50% less, and periodontal pockets decreased by 1-2 mm in depth from a typical depth of 4 mm, or by 25%-50%. Those patients using the placebo (a nonactive substance�in this case, a standard mouthwash) had no improvement in any category. �Patients with severe periodontal degradation reported greatly improved tissue tone and markedly reduced pocket depth,� states Dr. Zeines, referring to subsequent patient reports.

New evidence has emerged indicating that DMSO could save the lives and preserve nerve function of patients with head trauma, spinal cord injuries, and stroke, according to Stanley Jacob, M.D., professor at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, and a recognized world expert on the substance. DMSO, or dimethyl sulfoxide, was originally a papermaking by-product, but is now produced synthetically for therapeutic use. DMSO appears to reduce brain swelling and intracranial pressure following head injuries. A Turkish study of 20 patients with severe head injuries who took DMSO within a few hours after receiving the injury, then every 6 hours afterwards until pressure in the brain was relieved, had a 75% survival rate; 14 lived and only 1 sustained nerve damage. Putting this in perspective, of 30,000 people who suffer head trauma every year, 66% die in the emergency room, 2500 remain comatose, and of the 7500 who survive, most have a high degree of brain damage, states Julian Whitaker, M.D., who uses DMSO in his practice. DMSO can be given intravenously, as injections, applied on the skin, or taken orally in fruit juice or distilled water, says Dr. Whitaker. Its only drawback is the strong odor, which lingers for a few days following intravenous infusion.

Franklin, a 68-year-old attorney, had endured heartburn for 25 years and for the past 3 years had been taking Zantac (a conventional anti-heartburn medication) every night for relief. He noticed that the medication appeared to diminish his formerly strong sexual drive and function. Homeopath Andrea D. Sullivan, Ph.D., N.D., gave him a single dose of homeopathic Conium Maculatum 30c (from hemlock). After the first night on this remedy, Franklin reported that he was free of heartburn for the first time in 25 years. His need to smoke and drink coffee also was diminished; he was able to discontinue the commercial medications; and his ability to have erections improved. Dr. Sullivan gave him a second dose 6 weeks later, then a single dose of Conium at 200c one year later to clear up a small amount of gastric burning that had returned.

But she had one sterling quality that helped to guarantee her eventual cure: a positive attitude and determination to do whatever it would take to get better. Meanwhile, she was reeling from a progression of ever-higher doses of prednisone and anti-inflammatories, which had not improved her condition. Before coming to Dr. Wright, Angela had already changed her diet to include only whole and organically raised foods and to exclude all refined sugars, preservatives, and hydrogenated fats. In addition, she was taking 24 grams of vitamin C (in doses of 6 g, 4 times daily). Dr. Wright kept her on these 2 steps, further taking her off wheat, oats, barley, rye, and any other grains (excepting corn and rice) that contain the proteins gluten and gliadin; he also took her off all dairy products. �Our clinical experience supports the view that a food allergy can trigger lupus,� states Dr. Wright. Next, he put Angela on hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and digestive enzymes to help with her nutrient assimilation. Dr. Wright prescribed vitamin B6 (500 mg, 3 times daily); a complete B-complex supplement (with minerals, given by injection); flax oil (one tablespoon daily); gamma-linolenic acid (from primrose, black currant, or borage oils, 240 mg daily); vitamin E (800 I.U. daily); and zinc (picolinate, 30 mg daily). He further tested Angela for other allergies or nutrient sensitivities to be certain that none of the nutritional supplements aggravated her condition; then he desensitized Angela to these substances. Dr. Wright also prescribed doses of the hormones DHEA (a typical dose is 200 mg daily for women with lupus) and testosterone. It took about 18 months on this program to get all the nutritional factors under control and for Angela�s symptoms to abate. As of this reporting, 5 years later, she has remained symptom-free, says Dr. Wright. SOURCE: �Treatment of Lupus,� Nutrition & Healing, Jonathan V. Wright, with Alan R.

Birkmayer, M.D., Ph.D., of Vienna, Austria, NADH, delivered in either capsule or intravenous form, produced beneficial improvements in 80% of the cases. NADH, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is a chemical naturally found in human cells that is necessary for energy production. In a healthy person, muscle and brain cells contain about 50 mcg of NADH per gram of tissue, while the heart tissue contains 90 mcg per gram. In Dr. Birkmayer�s trial, 42 patients showed a 50% improvement in their disabilities, which included impairment of motor skills and cognitive dysfunction, while 54 patients experienced a 40% improvement; those patients receiving the oral form of NADH fared slightly better. NADH also seems to stimulate the production of dopamine, a brain chemical commonly deficient in patients with Parkinson�s.

Andy, aged 64, suffered from a chronically enlarged prostate gland, a clinical condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, reports Mitchell A. Fleisher, M.D., who practices at the Blue Ridge Medical Center in Arrington, Virginia. Andy�s condition kept him up at night with frequent urination; as a business executive, this made long airplane flights almost unbearable. Andy had tried conventional prostate drugs (such as Proscar) but found them ineffective; saw palmetto, an herbal extract often prescribed by holistic doctors as a Proscar alternative, had also not helped him. Dr. Fleisher put Andy on Pycnogenol�, a multipurpose antioxidant made from French maritime pine bark. Andy took this every day for 2 weeks, after which time the frequency of his day and night urinations was greatly reduced and he was able to enjoy a restful sleep. Dr. Fleisher put Andy on a �curative� dose of 100 mg, 2 times daily, for 2 weeks; at this point, Andy�s prostate had gone from hard to soft and was nearly normal again in size. Then Andy began a maintenance dose of 100 mg in the morning and 80 mg in the evening. Pycnogenol has been proven effective in helping to reduce the risk of developing up to 70 diseases associated with free radical damage, including heart disease, arthritis, cancer, and stroke. The typical dosage, says Dr. Fleisher, is 1 mg per pound of body weight divided into 2 daily dosages, taken for 7-10 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 50-100 mg daily.

Ten years prior to seeking treatment with David Steenblock, D.O., Sonya had suffered a stroke, which left her confined to a wheelchair and unable to take care of herself. After consulting 22 doctors for her paralysis and severe pain, she was no better and despairing. Sonya was one of the 500,000 Americans who suffer stroke each year, which tops the list as the leading cause of long-term disability and is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. Dr. Steenblock gave Sonya 10 treatments with hyperbaric oxygen, after which her pain subsided. After another 5 treatments, Sonya was able to walk again and begin taking care of herself. For the treatments, Dr. Steenblock placed Sonya inside a sealed chamber where she breathed oxygen through a mask as the air pressure was gradually increased. At 9 times the level provided to her body�s capillaries by breathing normal air, the oxygen began to revive brain tissue that hadn�t functioned since the stroke. Under this higher pressure, oxygen is able to reach areas in the brain where blood flow has been restricted and stimulate new blood vessels to grow. The use of oxygen under pressure to treat serious health conditions including stroke and athletic injuries is medically well-established, though not yet widely used in this country. In the U.S., there are 300 hyperbaric oxygen chambers, but in Russia, for example, there are 2000. A landmark 1971 study showed that hyperbaric oxygen treatment of 40 stroke patients produced moderate to significant improvement in 80% of patients.

For 20 years Maria, aged 52, had suffered with ringing and rushing sounds in her ears and progressive hearing loss, a condition called tinnitus. She had also been diagnosed and treated for cholesteatoma, a condition in which cholesterol deposits form a mass inside the ear. An operation had failed to bring any improvement, but when osteopath William J. Faber, D.O., director of the Milwaukee Pain Clinic, treated her with neural/fascial therapy, she began to quickly regain her hearing in the injured ear. Maria had injured her head in earlier accidents and had developed scar tissue from subsequent operations. Both factors led to adhesions in her ear tissue and to a restriction of the blood flow through that area; the result was a constant ringing sensation. According to Dr. Faber, scar tissue develops an �interference field� which blocks nerve impulse flow through that part of the body. Using a tiny dental-gauge needle, Dr. Faber made a series of precise injections of anesthetic (1% or 2% procaine or 1% lidocaine) at the site of the scar tissue (left from the previous operation) in her ear. Immediately after the treatment, Dr. Faber tested the results by rubbing his hands together near her ear. Maria discovered the ringing sounds had vanished and her hearing had returned in full. �Thus, precise placement of stabilizing local anesthetics in and around nerves, blood vessels, tissues, and cells has a paramount restorative and energizing effect on the human organism,� states Dr. Faber.

The program, which retails for about $59, is a blend of 27 herbs specifically chosen for their ability to flush toxins out of the organs and old fecal matter from the intestines. For example, buckthorn bark stimulates bile secretion; chickweed and black cohosh root combat blood toxicity; Cascara sagrada bark promotes intestinal peristalsis (the intestine�s natural contraction rhythms); yarrow flower regulates liver function; peach leaves are a natural laxative; and licorice root stimulates the adrenal glands. The program consists of two sets of pills: colon and whole body blends. Users start with one colon and 3 whole body pills taken twice daily with water, 30 minutes before breakfast and 30 minutes before dinner. The colon pills can be increased to 3 pills twice daily, or more, until the bowels move twice daily; the whole body pills are increased to 4-7, taken two times daily. Users need to double their intake of pure water (to at least 64 ounces daily), take one day off from the pills every week, and take a daily multivitamin. The key here, says company president Ken Wright, is to go slowly and be patient. �It took a while for you to build up these toxins, so it will take a while to get them out.� The program is designed to last about 30 days although first-time users may find that 3 courses are required for complete inner cleansing and detoxification. Even if you think you�re healthy, an inner cleansing is beneficial, given the degree of toxins in our outer and inner environments. When poor diet, stress, or lack of exercise tax the body beyond its natural abilities to digest, absorb, and eliminate wastes, it�s time for a general, internal �housecleaning,�� says Wright. Many doctors now consider a state of inner toxicity as a key factor predisposing a person to a wide range of degenerative diseases. Detoxifying the body is thus a key to preventing or reversing many health conditions. One product user, aged 43, suffered with aches, pains, sinus headaches, and fatigue for 15 years, but after taking the formula for 3 months, said, �I realized one day that a miracle had taken place: my body aches and pains have disappeared completely, the headaches are much milder, only about 10% of their former frequency, and my energy level is up 50%-70%. THE SUPER VITAMIN 2 Ways to Go Green It�s important when you are detoxifying your system to look after your nutrient intake. As the toxins are flushed out of your body, you need more high-quality nutrients and your system is more able to absorb them. One effective way to deliver them is through taking a green superfood every day. PRO-GREENS. Made by Nutricology-Allergy Research, this is a dry green powder taken in water or juice, 1-2 times daily, on an empty stomach. ProGreens contains 33 nutritional substances (packaged in a plastic tub, representing a 30-day supply) that act as a complete herbal multivitamin. The benefits of the ingredients in ProGreens, according to company president Stephen Levine, Ph.D., include immune system support, antioxidant protection, gastrointestinal fortification, energy boosting, and overall nutrient supplementation. The green grasses such as wheat, barley, alfalfa, and oat provide complete proteins. Among the 4 algae in the product, chlorella is known as the �unpoisoner� because it can detoxify the body of heavy metals (such as cadmium and lead) and uranium radiation. The �probiotic� or friendly bacterial cultures (about 5 billion organisms from 8 dairy-free sources) regulate and balance the intestines. The product also contains natural fibers (flaxseed meal), bioflavonoid extracts (milk thistle, bilberry), herbs (ginseng, Echinacea, licorice root), and other high-nutrient foods (lecithin, bee pollen, beet juice powder). GREEN MAGIC. This is a drinkable green superfood, in powder form, made by New Spirit Naturals, containing 16 ingredients. Its benefits include nourishing the body, strengthening the immune system, and detoxifying the blood, according to its developers, Debbie and Larry Milam. In addition to chlorella, spirulina, and wheat, barley, and kamut grasses, the product contains coenzyme Q10 (benefits the cardiovascular system and increases cellular energy), super oxide dismutase (neutralizes toxins), and Jerusalem artichoke flour (stabilizes blood sugar and supports colon health). The product can be used daily (1-3 tablespoons) as a source of multiple nutrients. HOMEOPATHIC FORMULAS FOR DETOXIFYING 37 Drainage Remedies Once you have completed your herbal colon and organ cleanse, you may find yourself enthusiastic about the prospects of detoxification as a way to stay healthy. Energique, Inc. has a line of 37 products it describes as homeopathic �drainage� detoxifiers available to help your lymphatic and circulatory system drain toxins, heavy metals, and pollutants out of your body, working at a more subtle, energetic level than herbs alone. The products, all low-potency blends of multiple homeopathic remedies, are available without a prescription and cost about $12 for a 1-ounce liquid bottle. Samples of Energique detoxifiers are: Alcostat for alcohol detoxification; Dentastat (containing 14 different remedies) for mercury and dental toxins; Metastat for heavy metals; Terrestristat for radon and geopathic stress; Vaccistat for vaccination residues; Parastat for systemic parasites; and Allerstat II for common allergenic substances that are inhaled. Energique has other products designed to treat specific organs and systems as well as toxins from other substances such as viruses and tobacco. According to Energique, the entire set of 37 drainage and detoxifying remedies represents a self-help repertoire for dealing with the major sources of systemic toxins. The low-potency formulations enable users to self-prescribe without concern about the powerful effects associated with higher- potency homeopathic remedies. LAB TESTS RATE YOUR ANTIOXIDANT PROTECTION When You Need to Know if Your Vitamins are Working Let�s say you have been faithfully taking multivitamin supplements and antioxidants (such as vitamins A, C, and E) regularly for years. How can you know for certain if you are now truly protected against free radical damage? Free radicals are oxygen by-products released during food digestion, and exercise, and through absorption of environmental poisons, chemical exposures, smoking, and excess fat consumption. If unopposed by antioxidants, free radicals can damage cells and tissues and produce illness. This process is called oxidative stress and is associated with the onset of numerous diseases, such as atherosclerosis, disorders of the lungs, liver, brain, and heart, and premature aging. OXIDATIVE PROTECTION SCREEN. Introduced in November 1995, the Oxidative Protection Screen from Antibody Assay Laboratories of Santa Ana, California, can provide your physician with an actual biochemical analysis of how well your body is handling free radicals, according to its designers. This information, in turn, is valuable for a physician in assessing a patient�s overall health, the degree of antioxidant �protection� one has, and the possible need for further nutrient supplementation. The test cost to patients is about $96. When lipids (fatty acids, steroids, and other oily organic compounds) are damaged by free radicals, they form lipid peroxides which circulate in the blood. Using a drawn blood sample from a patient, the lab test determines the amount of lipid peroxides in the plasma; these numbers vary with age and gender. For a 20-year-old woman, for example, the normal range is 1.5-1.99 mcmol/liter but for a 60-year-old female, it�s 2.15-2.82 mcmol/l. An amount beyond this range indicates a high production of free radicals, while the lower the amount of lipid peroxides, the stronger the antioxidant protection. According to Antibody Assay Laboratories, the Total Oxidative Protection Index� will indicate your system�s overall ability to withstand the �attack� of free radicals and thus your individual degree of oxidative protection. The normal range here is 45%-63%; ranges above 63% indicate a high degree of antioxidant protection and health. THE PANTOX ANTIOXIDANT PROFILE. Based on a blood sample of 5 ml, this diagnostic screen measures the status of 20 factors determining the body�s antioxidant cellular defense system in comparison with a database of 4000 other normal and healthy profiles. On the basis of this precise biochemical information, both physicians and patients can take nutritional steps to prevent disease from developing. The test cost to patients is about $250 prepaid and is covered by many health insurance companies, Medicare assignments, and managed care groups. Specifically, the screen reports on the biochemical presence of lipoproteins (cholesterol, triglycerides), fat-soluble antioxidants (vitamins A and E, carotenoids, coenzyme Q10), water-soluble antioxidants (vitamin C, uric acid, bilirubin), and iron balance. The test helps examine the question: are you getting the right antioxidants in the correct amounts? The Pantox profile is displayed in bar graphs with accompanying explanatory medical text telling you whether your levels of a specific nutrient are low and pose a health risk. It�s important to realize that just because you consume a nutrient does not mean your body has assimiliated it and that it�s present and active in your bloodstream. Stress produced by the heightened activity of free radicals can seriously deplete your reserves of antioxidants, despite a healthy diet and imprecise nutritional supplementation, explains Pantox Laboratories Director Charles A. Thomas, Jr., Ph.D. The practical goal, says Dr. Thomas, is for �an individual to take steps to change one�s levels so as to join others who are experiencing a lower rate of degenerative diseases. PROSTATE CANCER Modified Citrus Pectin May Stop Its Spread A specially modified form of citrus pectin, a substance normally used as a dietary fiber supplement, has provisionally been shown to be effective in halting the spread of cancer cells in prostate cancer. A 1995 study based on experiments with rats demonstrated that modified citrus pectin, when administered at the rate of up to 1% (weight/volume) to the rodents� drinking water for 3 weeks, significantly reduced the spread (metastasis) of cancer from the prostate to the lungs and lymph nodes of these laboratory animals. Specifically, while 15 out of 16 control animals developed a secondary lung cancer, 7 of 14 experimental rats did not, presumably because of the action of modified citrus pectin. While 55% of the control rats developed secondary lymph node cancer, of those on modified citrus pectin, only 13% had a lymph node metastasis. None of the rats on modified citrus pectin showed any signs of toxicity. This study was conducted by K. J., Pienta, M.D., of Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan, and published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, March 1995. Up to 6 other clinical studies suggest that the substance also enhances the anticancer effect of certain immune system cells. This effect is called cytotoxicity, meaning the ability to destroy cancer cells, which is the role of the CD3 and T-cells. Human studies, involving 100 people in a one-year program, are now under way to see if modified citrus pectin can similarly act to stop the spread of cancer in the human body. At the same time, a handful of progressive physicians are already incorporating modified citrus pectin in their anticancer supplement program.

Ever since their introduction in the 1870s, licensing laws have limited the supply of health care providers, thereby limiting competition and increasing doctors� incomes, Blevins explains. Government policies, which strongly favor (and reward) conventional medicine, are largely responsible for the escalation of health care costs and the lack of a wide range of choices in medical services. In addition, there is �little actual evidence that medical licensing improves quality [of care] or protects the public,� says Blevins. The result is a �government-imposed medical monopoly,� supported by the tax dollars of all Americans, including the 33% who consult alternative practitioners. Consider how licensing regulations restrict the public�s access to nonphysician health care providers, such as midwives. There are 10,000 midwives in the U.S., but 36 states either restrict or prohibit their activities. �American�s low usage of midwifery does not correlate with high-quality birth outcomes,� Blevins says, because the U.S. has the world�s second highest rate of Cesarean sections and has the fifth highest infant mortality rate among industrialized nations. Midwife-assisted births could save Americans $2.4 billion annually if only 20% of women used them. Nurse practitioners are another case in point. These are registered nurses (R.N.s) with advanced training. Research indicates that almost 80% of adult primary care and about 90% of child care services could be safely provided by nurse practitioners. A 1993 Gallup poll reported that 86% of consumers would willingly use nurse practitioners for all their basic medical services. Further, we could be saving between $6.4 and $8.75 billion a year if nurse practitioners were more widely used. But they�re not because �many states impose scope-of-practice regulations that prevent nurses from practicing independently as primary care providers,� says Blevins. This action suppresses the full potential demand for them because they are not legally free to compete. Whether you like it or not, your tax dollars directly subsidize conventional medical schools, but not alternative schools such as chiropractic or naturopathic colleges, says Blevins. Today only 5% of medical school income comes from tuition and fees; the rest comes from state and federal government subsidies. Of the $23 billion U.S. medical schools received in 1992, $2.7 billion came from state and local governments, and $10.3 billion came from the federal government. Your tax dollars support the medical monopoly through other means, too, such as research, training, and teaching grants from agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, which cover only conventional medicine, Blevins says. The time for reform is at hand, urges Blevins. Even if you do not particularly favor alternative medicine, she argues, the medical monopoly goes against the capitalist grain of free, unrestricted, nonmonopolistic competition in the marketplace. We haven�t seen that for over 125 years when it comes to medicine in this country. �Breaking the anti-competitive barriers of licensing laws and federal reimbursement regulations will provide meaningful health reform, increase consumer choice, and reduce health care costs,� states Blevins. HEALTH INSURANCE HYPOCRISY Smoking Both Ends In case you think major U.S. insurance companies actively discourage cigarette smoking, now conclusively linked with health deterioration, the fact that many of the largest health insurers are prime stockholders in tobacco companies should change your mind with a jolt. Prudential, the country�s largest health insurer and largest owner of for-profit HMOs, owns big shares (a total of 245 million) in 5 of the 6 largest tobacco companies. Traveler�s Insurance Company holds at least 88 million total shares in 2 companies; Met-Life, before it merged with Traveler�s, held 15 million; and Signa held 75 million shares in 2 tobacco companies. Industry analysts explain this extreme hypocrisy as a �win-win strategy� because even though every day about 1000 smokers die of tobacco poisoning, another 1000 recruits are signed up as new smokers. As the U.S. moves toward being the world�s first corporate-run for- profit health care system, the market seems to demand that allegiance to profit take precedence over concern for health. The major insurers collect higher premiums from smokers while profiting from their destructive smoking habits in higher tobacco sales as well.

GULF WAR SYNDROME Thanks to Biological Germ Warfare Research evidence is accumulating to suggest that Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) may be the result of genetically engineered germ warfare. That�s the view according to Garth Nicolson, Ph.D., professor of pathology and internal medicine, chairman of the tumor biology department at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas (the largest such facility in the world), and author of 400 scientific papers. Dr. Nicolson argues that the GWS microbe seems to be the product of combining a gene from the HIV-AIDS virus with a mycoplasma (a tiny cellular component, normally harmless, until activated) to produce a new super pathogenic and infectious microbe not otherwise found in nature. The genetic engineering was presumably conducted in a secret lab, probably in the U.S., Nicolson says, then sold (with at least 10 other biological warfare agents) to the Iraqi government between 1984 and 1989. While the U.S. government denies GWS as a legitimate illness category, as many as 6000 U.S. soldiers have already died from this otherwise mysterious illness, at least 15,000 more are sick from it, family members never in the Gulf are becoming infected, and miscarriages and congenitally deformed children are attributed to it as well, says Dr. Nicolson. Further, GWS symptoms are strikingly similar to chronic fatigue on 31 points, with the highest correlation (85%) being aching joints. Dr. Nicolson hints that the biological-warfare-derived microbe may be central to both illnesses. Meanwhile, Dr. Nicolson has published information on his successful antibiotic treatment (tetracycline at 100 mg, 2 times daily for 10 days, although up to 6 courses may be required) for GWS. Dr. Nicolson also contends, based on private sources, that the GWS HIV-mycoplasma microbe may have been tested on the prison inmate population in Texas. �We have possibly uncovered one of the messiest controversies and cover-ups since Watergate,� Dr. Nicolson states. �There is a huge cover-up of immense proportions. A lot of people are not happy about this getting out. SOURCES: GWS, Gulf War Syndrome,� Hans J.

MEAT-EATING�S $60 BILLION PRICE TAG A new report released by the Physicians� Committee for Responsible Medicine, a vegetarian advocacy group in Washington, D.C., calculated the medical costs of meat consumption according to health problem. The assumption in their calculations is that high levels of meat consumption have been proven to be linked to the development of serious medical conditions. In terms of treatment costs, doctors� fees, drugs, and hospitalizations, hypertension costs up to $8.5 billion; heart disease, $9.5 billion; cancer, $16.5 billion; diabetes, $17.1 billion; gallbladder disease, $2.4 billion; obesity-related musculoskeletal problems, $1.9 billion; and food-borne illness, $5.5 billion. In other words, the price tag for American-style meat-eating accounts for as much as $61.4 billion in direct health care costs each year. �It is time to stop scratching our heads about the nation�s exploding health care costs,� the report stated. �We can cut those costs by eliminating subsidies for livestock feed and dairy products, and scrapping out-of-date diet guidelines that encourage traditional, meat-based diets.

THE DEMAND FOR ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE IS 39% HIGHER THAN THE SUPPLY In July 1995, the Seattle-King County Department of Health in Washington State surveyed 759 patients to assess their use of alternative medicine. Of those polled, 77% were women, 26% were Asian, 67% were aged 20-49, and 35% had no health insurance. The study showed that 19% had used some form of alternative medicine in the past year and 58% would use such treatments if they were �affordable and convenient. Of those polled, 13% said they had at some time consulted an acupuncturist, 33% a chiropractor, 24% a massage therapist, 18% a naturopath, while 44% said they had used some form of alternative medicine at least once. The difference between the number of one-time users (19%) and possible future users (58%, if �affordable and convenient�) indicates a �potential unmet demand� of 39% of patients for alternative medicine.

NCI IGNORES THE FACTS Government Agency Misinforms the Public In their official handout for public inquiries regarding the Gerson Therapy for cancer, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a division of the U.S. Public Health Service, brazenly misinforms the public. Dr. Gerson�s methods were reviewed on a number of occasions; in no case was any evidence of effectiveness against cancer observed, NCI states. As a result, the Gerson method, which prescribes high amounts of carrot and apple juice, a vegetarian diet, and coffee enemas, is not considered to be an effective means of cancer treatment and no further evaluation is necessary. However, if NCI were to keep up with new medical developments, they would realize how out of touch they have become with true clinical efficacy. A recent retrospective British study of the 5-year survival rates of 153 melanoma patients treated with the Gerson method instead of surgery, shows a high degree of success. Patients with localized melanoma (stage I and II skin cancer) had a 100% survival rate with Gerson compared to 79% for conventional treatment. For patients with �regional spread melanoma� (stage III), the Gerson survival rate was 71% compared to 39%; and for �superficial distant spread� (stage IVA), Gerson scored 39% compared to 6% for orthodox methods. Lord Baldwin, Joint Chairman of the Parliamentary Group for Alternative and Complementary Medicine in London, England, urged the NCI to take up the challenge of this evidence �and give alternative therapies a proper trial.

According to cranial osteopath, Carlisle Holland, D.O., of the Santa Rosa Medical Group in Santa Rosa, California, the answer is yes. Among the many infants Dr. Holland has treated, he has observed a relationship of prime importance; that is, between distortions in the baby�s skull, often produced by the birthing process itself, and later health problems, such as colic, seizures, eye asymmetry, even autism. This is alarming because the incidence of soft tissue injury to newborns during birth approaches epidemic scale in this country, says Dr. Holland. Dr. Holland estimates that perhaps 80% of American newborns have a functional problem with the way their muscles, bones, and nervous system work together and that the majority of these neuromusculoskeletal dysfunctions happen in the birthing process. While the majority self-correct, about 15% require treatment. This underlines the need for screening because most problems are correctable by cranial osteopathy, a technique of gentle manipulation by the hands of muscles and bones (including the 33 spinal vertebrae), particularly the bones of the skull. The newborn�s skull is soft and highly malleable, says Dr. Holland. For many months after birth, the 13 bones (or plates) of the infant�s skull remain quite flexible, more like a thick starch than solidly knit bone. The trouble here is that slight to serious injuries to the baby�s delicate skull during birth can produce distortions and deformities in the arrangement of its bones. This in turn interferes with the natural flow of energy and cerebrospinal fluid from the base to the top of the spine. It�s what osteopaths call the cranial rhythmic impulse or CRI (sometimes known as the cranio-sacral pump). High-tech brain scans have confirmed what osteopaths have claimed for a century, that there are regular pulsations or physiological motions up and down the spine between the sacrum and cranium that are vital to the well-being of the body. Anything that interferes with this pulsation or CRI, such as a head or neck injury or skull distortion from birth, can lead to more serious functional problems and illness. DISTORTIONS IN THE SOFT SKULL OF THE NEWBORN There are many risk factors that can lead to cranial distortions in infants, says Dr. Holland: the infant is the firstborn, there is a rapid or prolonged labor or a difficult delivery, forceps were used, Cesarean section was needed, the mother was ill, it was a high risk pregnancy or premature delivery, the birth was one of twins or triplets, the infant had an early childhood illness�any of these can predispose a newborn to cranial injury. This is where osteopathy can make a significant contribution. �Our approaches are not only cost-effective, but offer a medically-based but medication-free way to interrupt functional and nervous system problems of small children,� Dr. Holland states. The reflexes of the autonomic nervous system play a central role in many problems experienced by infants. �Neuromuscular reflex imbalances are what cause many of the functional problems that pediatricians routinely medicate in children. Osteopathic manipulation can affect cranial nerves and rebalance autonomic reflex disturbances, thereby influencing the neuromusculoskeletal system without resorting to drugs. KINDER THAN SURGERY AND HEADBANDS The approach of conventional medicine to what they describe as lopsided skulls is rather severe and traumatic to infants, Dr. Holland explains. Since about 1992, American physicians have reported a huge increase in the incidence of infants born with misshapen skulls. At the same time, pediatric surgeons have performed an alarming number of surgeries on infant skulls for a condition they call cranio-synostosis. Here the skull plates have prematurely fused, constricting the brain and forcing it to bulge in places. The skull may also appear flattened in the back. Surgeons quite coldly refer to this operation as a �cranial vault remodel��the cutting and reshaping of infant skulls. Now some doctors are worried that pediatric surgeons are misdiagnosing this condition and seriously overprescribing the operation. Some talk about an �epidemic of misdiagnosis. As an alternative, conventional physicians favor a $2000 hard plastic corrective headband to restore the normal shape of the infant�s skull. This crude device works by applying constant hard pressure to the skull similar to the way dental braces squeeze crooked teeth into alignment. �Infants and little children hate this,� observes Dr. Holland. �Cranial osteopathy has a much kinder, less expensive, and more effective approach. ADJUSTING THE SKULL TO END COLIC Dr. Holland treated an infant named Annie, 6 months old, who had severe colic and had never slept for more than 2 hours at a time. Annie had episodes of persistent crying, spitting up, and signs of abdominal distress; she could turn her head only one way and did not breast-feed well. Technically, Dr. Holland explained, she had condylar compression, referring to the condyles, which are the cartilage attachments whereby the neck joins the base of the skull. During the infant�s passage down the mother�s birth canal, the head and neck can get compressed and thus distorted in shape. Annie�s preferential turning of her head in only one direction was a result and this produced the colic. �I estimate that about 10-20% of newborns have some degree of asymmetry in neck-turning when they are born.� In his initial session with Annie, Dr. Holland worked on balancing the muscle reflexes on the right side of her neck, which was the site of the compression. Suddenly, Annie took a deep breath and relaxed as the entire pattern of musculoskeletal movement up and down her back was reset. The whole pattern of distortion and spasming let go.� That night, Annie slept without interruption for 14 hours and she showed none of the signs of colic after that. Dr. Holland treated her twice more to reinforce the adjustment that had ended the colic. As much as one-third of all colic in newborns may have a structural origin, Dr. Holland adds. MAKING THE EYES SEE STRAIGHT When her mother brought Abby to Dr. Holland, she was a year old and had Duane�s Syndrome. One of her eyes had retracted into its eye socket, making it appear smaller than the other eye. It was primarily a cosmetic problem, affecting her appearance, but not vision, says Dr. Holland. Doctors had advised Abby�s mother that cosmetic skull surgery might be the only treatment (at a cost of $75,000-150,000), but Dr. Holland believed that osteopathy could produce far better results with no surgery. In fact, Dr. Holland�s video record of the way Abby�s retracted eye became normal again over a 6-month treatment period is highly impressive. The structural problem with Abby was that the base of her cranium was twisted, probably due to birth, says Dr. Holland. It might even have developed while Abby was still in the womb. The sphenoid bone under Abby�s pituitary gland was bent or distorted. This distortion produced the disfigurement in the eye. It wasn�t that one eye was measurably smaller than the other but, rather, the tension placed on the structures behind the eye�s orbit pulled it in, making it seem smaller. Dr. Holland used his hands to work on the sides of Abby�s head and the base of her neck. �Sometimes in a situation like this where the skull is twisted, you put one hand across the forehead and the other across the back of the head and apply a gentle twisting mechanical force to untwist it. Of course, you have to know the anatomy inside and out and how to use your hands exactly to make the right changes. Dr. Holland�s remark underscores a surprising fact about the skull of an infant, and about the entire human body, even that of adults. The skull is not a rigid unmoving entity; rather, it is �viscous, fluid, elastic, bendable,� says Dr. Holland. The cranial osteopath�s skill is to to apply just the right amount of pressure to the precise skull and neck structures to �bend� the distortion back to normal. �I liken this to whispering a request to somebody rather than yelling a command. When you induce a gentle force, the body can accept it and restore the correct balance.� Gentle can mean as light as the weight of a quarter on the skin. Dr. Holland began seeing positive changes in Abby within the first month of treatment. Each weekly session lasted about 20 minutes; after 3 months, Abby started �looking very good.� In all, it took 6 months to coax her muscles, tissues, and bones to reset themselves and for her retracted eye to come forward in alignment with the other eye. CALMING SEIZURES WITH THE DOCTOR�S HANDS Osteopaths who work with children are often criticized by conventional M.D.s. They say you cannot change the function of the brain by putting your hands on the outside of the head. But Dr. Holland proved them wrong quite convincingly in his successful treatment of a boy named Andrew, aged 14 months, who had infantile spasms or seizures. Dr. Holland was not at all surprised to discover that a cranial dysfunction was the cause. Andrew was the firstborn in the family and had arrived with a compressed shoulder which meant that the structural forces on his head were uneven. He had obvious skull distortion, the sutures between the skull plates overrode one another, his head bulged noticeably on one side, and he couldn�t turn his head, and thus nurse, in one direction. Andrew was suffering 30-40 seizures in quick succession. Doctors at a childrens� hospital told his mother that Andrew was likely to end up in a chronic vegetative state, his life wasted. Meanwhile, the anticonvulsant the doctors had him on failed to stop the seizures. The first step Dr. Holland took was to encourage the neurologist to prescribe a different anticonvulsant because the constant brain seizures kept erasing the corrections Dr. Holland�s osteopathic manipulations achieved. A new drug reduced Andrew�s spasms by about 60%, enabling Andrew�s musculoskeletal system to begin retaining Dr. Holland�s corrections. Next, by studying brain-scan printouts of Andrew�s brain energy patterns, Dr. Holland found that the location of his brain seizures matched the site where his skull was distorted. Using osteopathic manipulation techniques, he was able to release the constrictions and distortions in this area, thus freeing Andrew of the seizures. �There was a huge release in Andrew�s musculoskeletal system. I could feel how the structural forces were transferring evenly through his neck, up into his skull and down the back. The seizures completely stopped and never returned. This pivotal treatment occurred 4 months after Andrew first came to Dr. Holland. It took 3 months to find the right anticonvulsant for Andrew and to reduce his seizures. A month later, the osteopathic treatments completely eliminated them. Andrew was kept on the anticonvulsant for an additional 4 months, as a safety measure. Dr. Holland stopped Andrew�s seizures, although the child would be developmentally delayed as a result of virtually missing 9 months of his life due to recurrent seizures. But then he wouldn�t be spending his life as a helpless �vegetable� as his previous doctors had predicted. RESTORING THE AUTISTIC CHILD TO LIFE Many cases of autism also may be due to cranial distortions, says Dr. Holland. Of the 30 autistic children he has treated with cranial osteopathy, each had the same patterns of skull distortion. Specifically, this was a compression of the brain�s left hemisphere, a bending of the cranial base to the right side, and a bending downward of another bone, the spheno-basilar symphysis. Generally, it�s birth trauma that produces this degree of skull disfigurement, says Dr. Holland. This left-hemisphere compression of an autistic child�s skull could account for the poor processing between the two brain hemispheres. The key to success in treating autism that is structurally produced is to catch it as early as possible, ideally within the first days or weeks after birth. �In fact, I dream of the day when all newborns and babies will be checked by qualified palpatory diagnosticians,� says Dr. Holland. �That way I hope society can minimize the number of children suffering from potentially reversible conditions. Osteopathic research shows that 10-15% of newborns have functional problems that result from trauma, strain, injury, or distortion during birth and which do not self-correct. Of these, an estimated 5% develop persistent dysfunction in their body systems. �These figures are consistent with information about the incidence of chronic illness, learning disabilities, developmental delay, and other functional impairments of the general population,� Dr. Holland notes. What cranial osteopathy offers is the chance to avoid or reverse a great deal of misery in infancy, childhood, and adulthood that results from distortions in the structure and function of muscles and bones. Osteopathic manipulation is becoming much more accepted as a good treatment strategy for a variety of conditions,� Dr. Holland says. �The importance of the neuromusculoskeletal system in health and disease is beginning to be appreciated in medical training programs. -- RICHARD LEVITON Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing WT01-B17-144IA043-000787-B014-193http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue12/i12-a40.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305123049 text/html 13722HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 12:28:16 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html Feature Article (issue #11) [Go to the Table of Contents] Annie Potts -- Designing Healthy Women Actress Annie Potts' lifelong quest for health led her to alternative medicine solutions. When she was almost 40, Designing Women star Annie Potts known to fans over the show�s 7-year run as the pragmatic Mary Jo Shively wanted to have another baby, but discovered she couldn�t get pregnant. She worried that she might be infertile. No problem. After a few false starts with conventional doctors, she�d find that alternative medicine could help her out again as it had so many times before. Ever since she broke nearly every bone below her waist in a dramatic car accident when she was 21, Annie Potts had been designing her health using the best that alternative medicine had to offer, from reflexology to chiropractic, yoga to Pilates Method physical therapy, herbs to Chinese medicine. Annie�s faith was well-placed because, 4 months after consulting Dr. Y.C. Chiang, O.M.D., master acupuncturist of El Cerrito, California, she was pregnant. That baby was Jake; when Annie was 43, she gave birth to another child, again with the aid of Chinese herbs from Dr. Chiang. In this last pregnancy, I used Chinese medicine the whole time,� says Annie, in her trademark Kentucky twang. �I bounced back so quickly. I was back at the gym only 3 weeks after my baby was born. I�m only 5 pounds over my weight before I got pregnant, and I feel great.� When you know the Annie Potts story, which is a 23-year odyssey toward health, using alternative medicine against considerable odds, you�ll appreciate how much dedication �feeling great� has taken. MENDING AN ACTRESS� BROKEN BONES Annie is no stranger to the process of finding her own answers to her health problems. Just before her 21st birthday, on her way to perform at a high school assembly as part of her work with the New Mexico State Theater, drag-racing drunk drivers ran full speed into her car. When Annie woke up in the hospital, she found that, with one exception, every bone in her body below the waist was broken.�That accident almost obliterated my legs,� says Annie. Her budding acting career now in doubt, Annie left the hospital happy to be alive, but had to ask herself a hard question. �What do I do with this old person�s body that I have suddenly inherited at 21?� Doctors had put her in traction for 2 months in an attempt to get her thigh bone to reknit as the accident had created a 2-inch gap in her femur. When this didn�t work, they did a bone graft, harvesting the bone from her pelvis by cutting through the muscles of her lower back. This created another set of problems, but at least she could walk. From that moment onward, keeping her body functioning became a lifetime process for Annie. It didn�t make her acting career a breeze, either; she just had to work twice as hard. With chronic pain and traumatic arthritis caused by the injuries, her task has been formidable. �Every day I wake up and it�s �Houston, we�ve got a problem,�� comments Annie wryly. �It takes me half an hour to work all the kinks out of my body.� Over her years of productive acting, Annie designed and continually updated the maintenance program that keeps her injuries from ruling her life. Early on, she turned to yoga, which is well known for its therapeutic benefits. �For me, yoga is medicine,� Annie says. �I had a wonderful teacher�it was like finding a good doctor.� In the years following her accident, Annie relied on yoga and swimming to keep her flexible and strong . Then she broadened her scope of therapies, seeing a chiropractor, massage therapist, reflexologist, and acupuncturist. But it was Annie�s difficulties in getting pregnant in her late 30s and her frustration with conventional approaches that completely affirmed her allegiance to alternative medicine. By this time, Annie Potts had made a name for herself. To fans of Designing Women, a highly popular CBS show that ran from 1987-1994, she was like family. Arriving in Los Angeles in 1975 with a road production of �Charlie�s Aunt,� starring opposite Vincent Price and Roddy McDowall, Annie went on to appear in such films as King of the Gypsies, Ghostbusters I and II�she played the sardonic secretary�Pretty in Pink, and Texasville�here she stole the show as Jeff Bridges� sassy spouse. Annie won a Genie Award (Canada�s Oscar) for �best performance by a foreign actress� for her role in the film, Heartaches. When Designing Women closed up shop, Annie landed the lead female role in another CBS sitcom, Love and War, for which she received an Emmy nomination. Throughout her public success, few of her fans knew how much daily effort it required or to what degree alternative medicine had eased Annie�s way. ANNIE�S FERTILITY NIGHTMARE Even though she had given birth to a son named Clay 15 years earlier, somehow in the intervening years Annie had become seemingly infertile. At 39, she wanted another child. She spent a year trying to conceive, but was unsuccessful. When she consulted conventional physicians, they put her on Clomid (clomiphene citrate, a drug prescribed to reverse �ovulatory failure�). They reassured her that only 2% of women experience the negative side effects of abdominal discomfort, uterine bleeding, breast tenderness, depression, dizziness, and about 14 others. Annie found she was one of the unlucky 2%. I nearly went insane,� Annie reflects. �I never had PMS in my life before this. Suddenly I became somebody I didn�t recognize. I had terrible mood swings, weeping, and hot flashes in the middle of the night. I�d wake up and the sheets would be soaked from my sweating. It was awful.� Annie wanted a baby so much that she endured this state of nonstop PMS for 6 months. But still she wasn�t pregnant. Her doctors had an even more upsetting drug for her to try�Pergonal�. In effect, it would be a bizarre form of urine therapy. Pergonal is an injectable drug containing gonadotropins (hormones for the gonads�in this case, ovaries) purified from the urine of postmenopausal women. Annie�s doctors believed this drug would stimulate her system to produce multiple eggs which could then be fertilized in a test tube. They told her that of the 7 or 8 eggs that would be incubated, usually only 2 take; if 3 or more took, then they would eliminate the surplus by �selective reduction.� That phrase chilled me,� Annie says. �In my heart I felt that surely there must be another way to achieve the same end.� There was, but she wouldn�t find it until she gave up on conventional doctors and went in search of alternative medicine. Then she finally got the baby she wanted. CHINESE HERBS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE Dr. Chiang had a reputation for solving health problems against which others had failed. During their first consultation, as he sat with his fingers on her wrist reading her pulse, Annie waited anxiously for his analysis. Finally she asked him, �Do you think I can have another baby?� Dr. Chiang�s answer was yes, and it should take only about one month to get pregnant. It actually took 4 months because Dr. Chiang first had to balance and strengthen Annie�s organs and energy pathways with acupuncture. Then he gave her a combination of fertility herbs in pill and powder form, including, among others, white peony root, plantain seed, wolfberry fruit, licorice root, raspberry fruit, and glossy privet fruit. When she didn�t get pregnant in the first few months, Dr. Chiang put Annie�s husband, TV director Jim Hayman, on herbs as well. Then Annie was pregnant in a month. After Jake�s birth, Dr. Chiang gave Annie another herbal preparation to strengthen both her and the nursing baby. This formula contained white peony root, licorice root, and glossy privet fruit, along with lily bulb, codonopsis root, pinellia rhizome, ginger, citrus peel, and black jujube date. Dr. Chiang�s herbs helped her recover quickly, but carrying the extra weight of a 9-pound baby had taken its toll on Annie�s legs. It was time to consult alternative medicine�s natural pharmacy for a new remedy. RESTORING LOST BONE DENSITY Annie found the answer to her declining leg strength in the Pilates� Method, a form of physical therapy and conditioning. Practicing its exercises eased the arthritic stiffness and improved her stooping posture. Ever since her accident, one leg had been 2 inches shorter than the other; that and having had her back muscles cut down to the bone on the same side had put a stoop in her gait. The Pilates exercises strengthened Annie in the ways she needed. From here, her renewed strength allowed her to start lifting weights. Knowing that women over 40 tend to lose bone density, Annie was concerned that, with all her broken bones, this would likely be a big problem for her. When she learned that weight lifting helps increase bone density, Annie headed for the gym. One of her leg fractures had never healed; worse, she had reinjured it. Yet, after hoisting weights for 18 months, her bone density was actually increasing, which meant her leg was healing�and she had an X-ray to prove it. �My medical specialist was stunned,� reports Annie. �He�d never seen anything like that. I�m going to pump iron for the rest of my life.� Recently, she added boxing to her regimen of physical exercises as a way to keep her weight trim and stay light on her legs. When you have a body with a history like Annie�s, health care can take a lot of your time. �My body is definitely a high maintenance proposition,� she admits with a laugh. But that high-maintenance body has kept her open to alternatives that work, such as Chinese medicine. Since her pregnancy success, Annie has become something of a missionary for alternative medicine. She spends a couple of hours every week on the phone with women her age who are trying to get pregnant. �I always send them to the doctors of Chinese medicine because conventional medicine has made them �insane.� The drugs are so harsh.� Meanwhile, Annie keeps consulting with Dr. Chiang. �I talked to him last night,� she confides. Her arthritis was acting up under the rainy winter weather of Southern California at the same time she was getting ready to start filming a new show. I told Dr. Chiang I was still nursing my baby,� says Annie, �and as I would be working 15 hours a day, I needed lots of energy. He said, �That�s okay, I will send you some herbs.�� -- STEPHANIE MAROHN Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing WT01-B17-145IA043-000787-B014-221http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue12/i12-a44.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305123212 text/html 18038HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 12:29:43 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html Feature Article (issue #11) [Go to the Table of Contents] Diabetes -- It's Reversible Both juvenile and adult-onset diabetes can be successfully treated with minimal insulin injections once you bring the pancreas, adrenals, and liver into balance again using diet and herbs. by Daniel Dunphy, P.A. N.D. ABOUT 95% of the country�s 15 million diabetes cases are preventable and can be treated successfully with diet, nutrition, and herbs. While juvenile diabetes can have a genetic factor, adult-onset diabetes, in most cases, is produced by a combination of factors such as high stress, faulty diet, impaired digestion, and an overworked pancreas. That is why I maintain that diabetes is primarily a dietary disease. UNDERSTANDING DIABETES Diabetes mellitus is a degenerative illness involving the pancreas and the hormone insulin. Normally, the pancreas releases insulin to regulate the level of blood sugar, or glucose, absorbed from meals, and to move it into the body�s cells and tissues for nourishment. In people with diabetes, the pancreas is unable to fulfill its function and normal glucose blood levels cannot be maintained. Insulin is a protein comprised of 51 amino acids (protein building blocks); its chief role is to enable the body to use glucose as energy. About 25% of diabetics requiring insulin receive daily injections of insulin derived from pigs or cows; the remaining diabetics can use any of 38 different types of genetically engineered human-based insulin (called �humalin�), also by injection. There are two forms of diabetes. In Type I diabetes, also called insulin-dependent juvenile diabetes (which represents 5%-10% of diabetes cases), the pancreas is unable to make insulin. Glucose builds up in the bloodstream, but cannot be delivered to the body�s cells, which begin to �starve.� Type II diabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent adult-onset diabetes, represents 90%-95% of all cases and develops in middle age. Statistics indicate that about 85% of all Type II diabetics are overweight when diagnosed. Here the pancreas produces insulin, but the body�s cells do not respond to its action and cannot absorb the glucose from food. When the glucose levels in the blood continue to rise because the body does not respond to insulin, the pancreas releases even more insulin to deal with the excess blood sugar. The result is both a state of low blood sugar (in that the cells cannot receive energy) and too much insulin (hyperinsulinism). Both types of diabetes, if not controlled, can lead to even more serious health conditions, such as heart and kidney disease, high blood pressure, strokes, nerve damage, cataracts, blindness, coma, and even death. A NEW CACTUS REMEDY REVERSES ADULT DIABETES At 42, Franklin was a highly athletic man, bicycling up to 50 miles a day and maintaining a healthy diet. Suddenly he developed symptoms of chronic fatigue and decreased circulation. During my examination of Franklin, I learned that he had been following a high energy, high fructose diet for his athletic needs, but that this had produced a condition of low blood sugar and high insulin, which is only a step away from diabetes. The high fructose intake overstimulated his pancreas which produced too much insulin. A blood test revealed that Franklin had higher than normal levels of Epstein-Barr virus, which is a marker for chronic fatigue syndrome. His adrenal glands were exhausted. He had been under a lot of stress; his father had recently died, he was having troubles with his teenage boys, and an old neck injury produced congestion in the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid through his spinal cord. At the time, I treated Franklin for chronic fatigue syndrome, using intravenous vitamin C and vitamin-mineral injections. I didn�t see Franklin again for 6 months. When he came back, his blood sugar levels had climbed past 300 (compared to a normal of 70-120); another doctor had started him on insulin, and now the insulin wasn�t working. Franklin had no family history of diabetes. His was caused mainly by stress and dietary factors. In fact, most of adult-onset diabetes is attributable to too much refined sugar and carbohydrates in the diet and too much stress. Franklin seemed to be a laid-back man, but on the inside, he was wrapped pretty tightly and had to exercise vigorously to burn off all his energy. I suspected an allergy factor in Franklin�s diabetes, and to prove this, I studied his bowel ecology. A stool analysis indicated he had a high level of the yeast Candida and a one-celled microscopic parasite called Blastocys-tis hominus in his intestines. His system was not metabolizing the short-chain fatty acids in his foods nor most fibers or proteins. A hair analysis told us that Franklin was deficient in chromium and vanadium and that he had elevated mercury levels. His blood sugar went as high as 500, and he was on 30 units of insulin a day to keep it down around 80. I devised a treatment program beginning with the root of a Mexican cactus called huereque (pronounced where-AY-kay) This is a cactus that grows in the northwestern Mexican desert and it seems to have strong effects on lowering blood sugar levels. In the last 9 months, I have prescribed heureque to 15 patients who came in insulin-dependent with adult-onset diabetes; all 15 are now almost or entirely off insulin. I started Franklin on 1200 mg daily, taken as 2 capsules (200 mg each), 3 times daily with meals. Using huereque, Franklin tapered his insulin injections down to 10 units a day within the first week. By the second week, he was off insulin entirely, with blood sugar levels remaining under 110. The only drawback to huereque is that after 6 months of steady use, its ability to control blood sugar starts to wear off as the body seems to develop a tolerance to it in the same way it does to insulin. It�s important to realize that huereque is not a �cure� for diabetes, but is a helpful aid in controlling blood sugar if it is used with other nutrients and if you�re addressing all the factors that triggered the adult diabetes. One option is to use huereque for 3 months, then switch to nopal (another cactus which reduces blood sugar) for a month, and return to huereque at a lower dose, such as 800 mg in 4 daily divided doses. When you give the body a month�s rest from huereque, it works again. Incidentally, huereque is remarkably inexpensive; 1000 capsules cost about $15. The huereque was only a part of Franklin�s program. I put him on vanadyl sulfate (200 mg, 3 times daily), chromium (200 mcg, 3 times daily), acidophilus (1 capsule, 3 times daily), and a colon cleanser called Perfect 7. He also started taking UltraClear� for cleansing the liver. Twice daily, Franklin drank a mixture of UltraClear� with a heaping teaspoon of spirulina (a phytoplankton containing amino acids and chlorophyll), a banana, one tablespoon each of flaxseed oil and lecithin granules, and filtered water. The liver mediates between the activities of the pancreas, which releases insulin to lower blood sugar, and the adrenal and thyroid glands which elevate the blood sugar. However, if a person�s liver is sluggish, stressed out, or toxic (as was Franklin�s), it no longer stores glucose and the buffer between the pancreas and adrenals goes out of balance. In effect, the adrenal and thyroid glands �tell� the liver to release glucose, and it cannot. Then, if the patient eats a great deal of refined carbohydrates (white flour products) and simple sugars, this stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin to control the higher blood sugar levels. This gives the person a chronically elevated insulin level (or hyperinsulinism), which in turn suppresses the normal activities of the adrenals and thyroid. The result is that these systems �fight� each other because the liver cannot act as a harmonizing organ. Franklin�s adrenal glands were stronger than his pancreas, so he developed diabetes. If his pancreas had been the stronger organ, which is more common, then he would have fatigue, lowered body temperature, reduced enzymatic activity, and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Franklin�s original condition was chronic fatigue; this developed into the more complex and serious problem of diabetes. In Franklin�s case, a series of �insults� earlier in his life weakened his body�s ability to maintain balance. He had mononucleosis and abused psychedelic drugs when he was young; he was an exercise maniac for years and exhausted his adrenal glands; he worried a great deal and was under constant emotional stress. These factors weakened his pancreas and adrenal glands. With Franklin, I further suspected that the chronic viral infection from Epstein-Barr had injured his pancreas. I prescribed a series of homeopathic nosodes, specifically from the Epstein-Barr virus as well as Staphylococcinum and Streptococci-num, to help his immune system remove any adverse taints of these microorganisms. In addition, I prescribed Spengler colloids, a therapy originally developed in Germany. These included Polysan T (for tuberculosis) and Polysan M (for malaria). The Spengler colloid is a broth made of weakened bacterial toxins which is rubbed on the patient�s skin and absorbed into the bloodstream. The Spengler colloid works as an antitoxin therapy or nosode for various chronic bacterial infections. My thinking here was that Franklin had a multiple infection syndrome of which Epstein-Barr was a part. The matrix of all these bacterial infections contributed to his chronic fatigue and diabetes. He was not strong enough to tolerate the nosode therapy, however, until his body was detoxified, stabilized, and strengthened. There are two additional therapies I used with Franklin. First, neural therapy works on the damage resulting from his neck injury which interferes with the flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal cord from the sacrum to the head. After using electro-dermal screening to determine which substances are needed, I inject homeopathic and probiotic remedies (from �friendly� beneficial bacteria) directly into specific acupuncture points. When I first treated Franklin, I did this weekly for 3 months. Second, Franklin undergoes intravenous chelation therapy to remove heavy metals from his system and to generally improve his blood circulation. He receives vitamins, minerals, and a protein substance called EDTA in monthly infusions; he�s had 30 chelations thus far. After 18 months on this program, Franklin takes a low dose of insulin (10 units) only 3-4 times a week. His diabetes is stable. This is a maintenance plan and he will have to live with it for a while. None of these therapies are miraculous cures, but a patient�s hopeful, committed attitude and the desire to get well go a long way. REVERSING JUVENILE DIABETES IN 2 WEEKS Perhaps 5% of all cases of diabetes begin suddenly in childhood. When Billy came to me at age 5, he had been diagnosed with acute juvenile-onset diabetes. His blood sugar level was 700 (compared to a normal range of 70-120) and already he had been hospitalized a few times. His health history revealed the causes of his diabetes. When Billy�s mother gave birth to him, she had a Candida infection (candidiasis). This meant Billy was born with an internal fungal infection. When he drank his mother�s breast milk, the candidiasis became seated in his intestines and blood. When he was 6 months old, Billy had a series of ear infections for which he received antibiotics over a 4-month period. After that, he periodically had allergy symptoms, rashes, nasal congestion, sinus problems, and more ear infections. When he was 3, he started having excessive thirst and frequent urination, which are often early signs of diabetes. By the time he was 5, Billy was drinking 6-7 glasses of fruit juice every day. He craved sugar. The sugar in these juices fed his Candida and made him hyperactive and hypoglycemic. The antibiotics supported the Candida, rather than helping to remove it. Billy may have had a genetic predisposition to a weak pancreas, but by the time he was 5, the combination of these three factors�candidiasis, ear infections, and antibiotics�had exhausted his pancreas and sent him into a diabetic crisis. Billy�s insulin levels were so high (he was taking 30 units daily) that he became irritable, developed heart palpitations, and perspired heavily. The high insulin levels nearly sent him into a diabetic coma every day. His mother was frantic; meanwhile, his doctor was trying his best to manage the sugar swings with insulin. Yet, we got Billy completely off his insulin in less than 2 weeks. Here�s how we did it. We eliminated all fruit, fruit juice, and dairy products from Billy�s diet, except for one slice of apple or a cup of berries per day. We put him on a diet of proteins, vegetables, and whole grains, thereby replacing sugars with complex carbohydrates. We made sure he had frequent small meals instead of large ones. This is called an insulin-sparing diet. Then I put him on vanadyl sulfate (7.5 mg, 2 times daily) and chromium (in picolinate form, 200 mcg, 3 times daily). Chromium is a coenzyme that enhances the cellular activity of insulin and the enzymatic processes necessary for it to function smoothly; chromium is also found in high concentrations in the pancreas and is considered a sugar regulator. Vanadyl is a form of vanadium, an essential trace element that may have activities that mimic insulin. Billy would need to take both these supplements for many months. Next, I gave Billy a homeopathic remedy for the Candida infection; specifically, this was a nosode of Candida itself (Candida 6c, 3 times daily for at least 2 months). In addition, I gave him acidophilus and bifidus to fortify his intestines with �friendly� bacteria (called probiotics). To supplement this, I put Billy on a bowel and liver-cleansing program, using UltraClear�. We monitored Billy�s blood sugar levels carefully and very slowly reduced his daily insulin. Within 3 days, his intake was 50% reduced, and within a week he was taking no insulin. I then instructed his mother not to give him any insulin unless his blood sugar went above 200. This happened only once in the first 3 months, when Billy had some fruit juice. Three months into this program, when Billy was stronger and his diabetes reduced and under control, I prescribed a single dose of Diptherinum 200c, a homeopathic remedy that was indicated because Billy�s father had suffered from diptheria and there was still a taint or energy residue of this illness in Billy�s system. This case shows that it is possible to significantly help manage and reverse childhood diabetes using herbs and nutrition.

"Then the interval environment no longer supports the existence of cancer cells." by Nathaniel Mead ACCORDING to Victor Marcial-Vega, M.D., the laws of health are inseparable from the laws of Nature. �Once we live according to the laws of Nature, we are never sick and healing occurs effortlessly, in an orderly way.� Dr. Marcial-Vega has seen thousands of cancer patients in the past five years alone and has carried out 2 years of in-depth clinical research on complementary medicine. The purpose of a cancer cell is to signal the body to get rid of matter in the body that did not replicate normally,� says Dr. Marcial-Vega. �When cancer cells occur�and everyone has abnormal cells arising in their bodies throughout the day�they are readily detected and removed by a healthy immune system. The immune system helps maintain and revitalize the body by eliminating cancer or otherwise abnormal cells. Only when the immune system weakens can the cancer cells multiply and spread through the body. For Dr. Marcial-Vega, then, the key to successful cancer therapy is strengthening the immune system. �At least 95% of my cancer patients are immunosuppressed due to physical, chemical, mental, and/or environmental causes,� Dr. Marcial-Vega says. �This means if you do not address the immune system, you�re treating the cancer without really treating the cause of the cancer. Dr. Marcial-Vega has developed a three-pronged strategy for treating cancer: overpower the cancer, strengthen the body, and heal the psyche. In his view, while some patients may need chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery to overpower the cancer, most do not. Dr. Marcial-Vega contends that the latter methods are often �overutilized,� even abused by cancer doctors today. If people use the natural treatments in the early stages of their cancer, they might not have to endure the conventional methods. Unfortunately, many people wait until they have exhausted all those possibilities and are in the advanced stages of cancer before turning to alternatives. Although most of Dr. Marcial-Vega's patients are in this category, �I have patients who have been cured by the natural treatments only.� He estimates that 5-10% of those who come to him in the advanced stages have cancers reversed by his treatments, and 90% are helped to some degree. OVERPOWER THE CANCER Dr. Marcial-Vega uses the following treatments which he says �attack� the cancer directly: Essiac. This 8-herb formula is believed to strengthen the immune system, reduce the toxic side effects of many drugs, in-crease energy levels, and diminish inflammatory pro-cesses, says Dr. Marcial-Vega. Cartilage. Cartilage (bovine and shark) contains factors that help block the formation of new blood vessels, thereby starving tumors so that they cannot continue to grow. Enzymes. Enzymes not only digest food, but also help the immune system eliminate cancer cells. It is vital, says Dr. Marcial-Vega, to take the enzymes between meals, on an empty stomach, and preferably not at the same time as Essiac or cartilage. Dr. Marcial-Vega uses Intenzyme Forte (containing pancreatin, bromelain, papain, lipase, amylase, and trypsin) and Retenzyme Forte (with bovine thymus, pea and lentil concentrate, papain, and pancreatin). Intravenous Vitamin C. Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C can selectively kill tumor cells in a manner similar to other chemotherapy drugs. Research shows that vitamin C boosts Natural Killer (NK) cell activity against cancer cells, and this increased activity is greatest between 8 and 24 hours after ingesting the vitamin C. STRENGTHEN THE BODY We now have evidence that chemo-therapy, radiation, and surgery flush out vitamins and minerals from the body from day one.,� says Dr. Marcial-Vega. Without supplements, patients will most likely get sicker from the lack of nutrition needed to protect them from the side effects of conventional treatments. Another reason they feel sick, Dr. Marcial-Vega adds, is the accumulation of cellular debris from the killing of cancer cells. If the body does not eliminate these toxins, a person feels sick, with nausea, flu-like symptoms, achy joints, and headaches. Herbal and nutritional supplements will support the body�s self-healing ability, detoxification mechanisms, and the removal of toxic substances. Oral Vitamin C. Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Linus Pauling found that a daily dose of 10 grams of vitamin C significantly extended survival and improved the quality of life in 100 terminal cancer patients. In addition, vitamin C can improve pain control and increase intracellular peroxidases, which are enzymes that help protect cells against harmful free radicals. Vitamin B complex. Deficiencies of one or more B vitamins tend to impair the immune system�s ability to repel cancer. Both pantothenic acid and vitamin B6 have been shown to inhibit tumor growth. Women with female-related cancers had about 20 times higher life expectancy when taking vitamin B3. Vitamin E. One of the body�s primary agents for protecting cell membranes, vitamin E is also among the major nutrients required for a strong immune response. One study found that 46% of patients given 400 I.U. of vitamin E twice daily for 24 weeks, had significant clinical improvement. Selenium. Selenium has potent effects when used with vitamin E. Certain chemotherapeutic drugs, as well as heavy metals (cadmium, lead, and mercury), tend to inactivate selenium, rendering it unavailable to the body. While supplementing, the physician must closely monitor blood levels to avoid selenium toxicity, says Dr. Marcial-Vega. Coenzyme Q10. This unique antioxidant protects the heart from the adverse effects of chemotherapy and other toxic influences, and has immune-enhancing effects. In one study, coQ10 was given daily to 32 breast cancer patients for 2 years at the dose of 90 mg daily. All patients survived; 6 patients had partial remissions. One of the partial responders then received a high dose of 390 mg daily. This resulted in a complete regression of the tumor within 3 months. Beta Carotene. A key antioxidant and precursor to vitamin A, beta carotene (a plant pigment) has re-peatedly been shown to enhance the activity of NK cells and other immune cells against tumors. Green Superfoods. Green vegetable concentrates, such as blue-green algae, spirulina, wheat grass, watercress, or green magma, contain a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, as well as various probiotics, or �friendly� bacteria, that aid in digestion, detoxification, and other key functions. Multivitamins. These all-purpose supplements ensure that nutritional deficiencies do not develop during cancer treatment and recovery. Herbal Medicines. To bolster immunity, Dr. Marcial-Vega recommends stinging nettle (Urtica urens), dandelion (Taraxacum officin), plantain (Plantago mayor), and South American rainforest herbs such as Quinchamalium majus and Tristerix tetrandus chilensis. Willard�s Water. This water helps patients to eliminate toxic chemicals and heavy metals from the body,� says Dr. Marcial-Vega. Willard�s Water�s makers refer to it as catalyst-altered water, based on a �micelle,� comprising tiny electrically charged particles, which changes water�s molecular structure and thereby its properties. Heal the Psyche The third area of Dr. Marcial-Vega�s approach is psychospiritual healing. In this, he works closely with his colleague, Dr. Andrea Marzouca, Ph.D. The goals of this healing are intangible yet universal: awareness of self, gratitude and reverence toward the universe, unconditional self-acceptance and realization, self-forgiveness, and taking action and responsibility for oneself. Basic to the therapeutic process, says Dr. Marcial-Vega, is helping cancer patients learn to see their condition as a signal to reorient their life. When the body is free from chronic distress, it is far more resistant to toxic insults from the environment which can trigger the onset of cancer. In 9 out of 10 cases, says Dr. Marcial-Vega, this stress involves some form of denial, emotional repression, or shutting down of one�s feelings. It is a grave error, says Dr Marcial-Vega, for doctors to prescribe supplements and other nontoxic strategies without paying attention to the person�s areas of denial or repression. Sometimes it�s helpful to guide the patient through a visualization exercise that helps them experience silence, receptivity, and safety, says Dr. Marcial-Vega. �After this process, patients often decide they are ready to nurture themselves and commit to their healing process.

Because it�s in bed with the conventional medical establishment, NCI wants to keep successful alternative cancer treatments from being fairly tested, approved, and made available in the medical marketplace. I refer to the case of Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D., medical director of the Burzynski Research Institute, Inc., in Houston, Texas. Dr. Burzynski is the inventor of an effective, nontoxic treatment for cancer called antineoplaston therapy, and for the last 12 years every available government, state, and medical agency has been doing its best to put him out of business. Why? Because America�s mainstream cancer establishment, led by the NCI (under the Department of Health and Human Services), seemingly does not want a cure or even a successful treatment for cancer to ever be found. That thousands of cancer patients suffer or die each year from lack of access to �approved� alternative cancer treatments is evidently of no concern to them. The way the medical power structure is set up in the United States any cancer therapy must be tested, validated, and approved by the FDA in cooperation with the NCI before it can be officially and legally supplied to patients. Theoretically, NCI and FDA use unbiased scientific criteria to make their determinations. In practice, they seem to bend science to deliver a predetermined outcome. When you sit at the top of the medical power structure, it�s pretty easy to get the results you want. Here�s how NCI fixed the research study to disqualify Dr. Burzynski�s antineoplastons. Dr. Burzynski had been using his antineoplastons for over a decade, successfully reversing life-threatening cancers in at least 30% of his patients whom conventional doctors had predicted would die. Antineoplastons are derived from amino acids and peptides, which are building blocks for proteins. Dr. Burzynski originally identified and isolated at least 5 different antineoplastons in the urine of healthy humans. He determined that these molecules, naturally found in a healthy human body as part of its immune defense system, have a strong anticancer effect at a genetic level. In fact, according to Dr. Burzynski, these molecules are able to turn off the activity of genes that would otherwise lead to cancerous (neoplastic) growths. They can actually stop cells from dividing and increasing, and eventually producing a tumor mass. It is almost as if cancer is the result of an antineoplaston deficiency. Dr. Burzynski synthesizes antineoplastons in his 47,000-square-foot government-approved facility in Texas. For Dr. Burzynski�s 3000 patients, antineoplaston treatment is a lifesaver; among prominent alternative physicians, the treatment is gaining respect and credibility. Outspoken alternative medicine advocate Julian Whitaker, M.D., for example, has stated: �This is a treatment I would try if I discovered I had cancer. Even though getting an essentially hostile and intrinsically biased government agency such as NCI to cooperate fairly in a clinical trial to test and possibly approve an alternative cancer treatment is a dubious long shot, Dr. Burzynski knew NCI validation was necessary for the future of his antineoplaston therapy. In 1991, Dr. Burzynski began negotiating with NCI to set up a study involving his patients and protocols. There were problems from the beginning and, in August 1995, NCI shut down the cancer trials and blamed the failure on Dr. Burzynski. However, a careful study of the correspondence between him and NCI officials reveals how NCI deliberately and craftily scuttled the research trials, then tried to cover its tracks with bureaucratic backfilling and misleading statements. They weren�t quite clever enough because they left a smoking gun. In October 1995, NCI released a statement to the press and public called �Cancer Facts,� explaining why the antineoplaston trials, part of its official Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), were closed. NCI�s �facts� were more sleight-of-hand and misrepresentation than fact. First, NCI said that out of Dr. Burzynski�s �entire� clinical experience, he was able to select only seven brain tumor patients who had benefited from antineoplastons. The inference, of course, is that for the several thousand other patients, the therapy had been ineffective. According to Dr. Burzynski, he prepared �dozens of cases for the NCI reviewers.� They had seen only seven because they had budgeted only one day to visit his office. Second, NCI claimed Dr. Burzynski had not included all available patient information. The opposite is true, says Dr. Burzynski, who notes that an NCI official actually commended him on �how complete and well-organized� his patient studies were. Third, specific ground rules were established by Dr. Burzynski. At the dosage level to be tested, only patients with a tumor of a specific size would be included in the study. At the time, NCI agreed, but in late 1993, Michael A. Friedman, M.D., Associate Director of CTEP, asked Dr. Burzynski if NCI could change the protocols and make cancer patients with bigger tumors eligible. Dr. Burzynski said no, because this would require a stronger dose, not agreed-upon in the study. In a letter dated November 2, 1993, Dr. Friedman acknowledged this and agreed that NCI would �accede to all the modifications that you have stipulated.� In March 1994, Mario Sznol, M.D., also of CTEP, asked Dr. Burzynski if they could modify the protocols. In April 1994, Dr. Burzynski declined again, requesting a separate trial for patients with larger tumors. After all, the clinical future of his antineoplastons was at stake and they must be given a test equal to their therapeutic abilities. It�s hard to believe that anyone at CTEP or NCI really wanted any proof to emerge that antineoplastons worked. The dates are not clear for the next stage, but at some point NCI disqualified two patients from the ongoing study. One patient no longer had any detectable cancer cells; the second had skin reactions, not from antineoplastons, but from a different drug. Actually, this skin condition had improved under antineoplastons. In other words, the minute NCI saw evidence of antineoplastons working, they scuttled the data by withdrawing the two patients and thus the evidence. In early 1995, NCI investigators modified the testing protocols without Dr. Burzynski�s permission or knowledge. Later, when challenged by him, Dr. Sznol tried to prove that what they had done was not that much different from �criteria and methods in [Burzynski�s] experience.� A few months later, the legal advisor for NCI�s parent organization, the National Institutes of Health, told Burzynski that permission of a drug�s inventor �is not required� in order to make changes in a study. In effect, NCI was saying they can change the research rules anytime they want and Dr. Burzynski can�t stop them. For good measure, NCI also blamed the change in rules on its research affiliate, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, who, in turn, blamed NCI. Finally, NCI said they dropped the studies because �there was no hope of completing the studies in a timely manner.� Since when is there a time limit when it comes to saving lives? NCI has already had more than 30 years to find a cancer cure. Is this a �timely� manner? The net result of NCI�s shady backroom maneuvers is that the trials were halted and Dr. Burzynski�s antineoplastons are no closer to government approval in 1996 than they were in 1991. Science is not always completely objective; if you are clever, you can set up an experiment to prove (or disprove) virtually anything you want. NCI was able to stack the odds against antineoplastons by altering the eligibility criteria so they would be tested under conditions for which they were not designed. It�s like fixing a horse race because you�ve bet heavily on a lame horse (chemotherapy) that would otherwise not even place. Then, when the antineoplastons did poorly, NCI could claim they had scientifically and objectively evaluated them and antineoplastons had come up short. But as the documents suggest, it was a rigged outcome. If NCI was genuinely interested in finding a nontoxic alternative to conventional cancer treatment, they would have worked with Dr. Burzynski every step of the way, on his terms as the inventor and prime clinical user of antineoplastons. They could have assured that this therapy would be given the best conditions in which to exhibit and prove its benefits. Instead, they used the situation to discredit it. Today, almost 1 out of every 3 Americans is expected to develop cancer. Existing conventional cancer treatments are dangerous, toxic, expensive, and usually ineffective. NCI should be doing everything possible to find safe, nontoxic, and effective alternatives for cancer treatments. Instead, they are conspiring with our tax dollars to defraud the U.S. public of life after cancer.

STOFF, M.D. Successfully treating severe and chronic autoimmune diseases and �the real heavy hitters� of today�s illnesses such as AIDS, chronic fatigue, and cancer is the specialty of Solstice Clinical Associates in Tucson, Arizona, says director Jesse A. Stoff, M.D. Here they regularly treat patients with multiple sclerosis, lupus, scleroderma, chronic inflammatory nerve degeneration, leaky gut syndrome, debilitating allergies, and environmental illness. THE EMPHASIS IS BALANCE. Since 1991, this multifaceted holistic health clinic has been employing everything�nutrition to homeopathy, Chinese herbs to Anthroposophic medicines, relaxation and guided imagery to massage�to help restore energy, life, and health to thousands of patients. And this health is restored to the whole patient, not just the body, says Dr. Stoff. Patients at Solstice often experience major life course corrections through healing. �Metaphorically, this parallels the profound personal transformation that can occur in people�s lives through therapies offered at our center,� Dr. Stoff explains. The goal is to help each client achieve a working balance between physical healing and emotional, mental, even spiritual aspects of their life. �We will assist and encourage you, the patient, to take an active role in your healing process,� says Dr. Stoff. A FULL DAY�S DIAGNOSIS. Coming up with the diagnosis and treatment plan is a full day�s task at Solstice Clinical Associates. It�s a round-robin of evaluations of a patient�s blood, urine, and stool, consultations with staff physicians and specialists, and an assessment of a client�s innate healing resources and state of mind. The new patient will spend an hour with Dr. Stoff, who is an M.D. specializing in homeopathy and, in fact, a world-acknowledged expert in holistic protocols for chronic fatigue. His 1988 book, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: The Hidden Epidemic, still in print, is recognized as a standard work in the field of alternative medicine solutions for this illness. Next, the patient meets with George B. Olson, Ph.D., an immunologist and expert in the application of guided imagery for the treatment of infectious diseases. Dr. Olson often prepares instructional tapes for clients, taking them through the stages of generating mental images of healing. Then comes nutritional assessment and counseling with Lance J. Morris, N.M.D., a naturopathic physician trained in acupuncture, herbs, homeopathy, and structural/energy work. Finally, the new patient talks with one of several staff psychologists. Here the psychologist assesses the patient�s self-image and attitude about the illness, whether there are psychological or unconscious factors��secondary gain and codependency��that make it advantageous for the patient to remain sick. As Dr. Stoff puts it, �Most importantly, we want to know: what are this person�s perceived roadblocks to healing?� Through close collaboration among our staff members, we provide an individualized and comprehensive treatment program based on an in-depth understanding of each of our patients,� Dr. Stoff explains. Quite often, Stoff�s team gets a patient who has received the �proverbial million-dollar work-up� from conventional medicine, but still has no clear diagnosis. NEVER A COOKBOOK PRESCRIPTION. Dr. Stoff wants lots of details about a patient�s immune system and the status of its different cells such as lymphocytes. The results of a test for levels of T and B immune cells, for example, tell Dr. Stoff whether the person�s system is fighting a chronic virus and, if so, which type. Dr. Stoff checks the patient�s organic acid levels (found in the urine) as a gauge of how well their system can detoxify itself. �Our extensive lab tests show us where the patient�s problems lie. That way I can tell, for example, if the person has an underlying autoimmune problem.� Not infrequently�at the rate of nearly 2 patients per month now�Solstice doctors discover that a patient actually has cancer, misdiagnosed as chronic fatigue. Often, conventional doctors fail to do a complete series of tests and come up with a chronic fatigue diagnosis because it seems to fit the symptoms, says Dr. Stoff. But this can be misleading and sometimes simply wrong. �As much as possible, we try to approach the patient without any blinders on. I don�t just rubberstamp another doctor�s diagnosis.� Nor is the final prescription out of a therapeutic cookbook. �We may see 100 women with breast cancer, but the treatment protocol will be different for each. We don�t have any canned protocols that we take off the shelf just because a person has a presumed diagnosis.� Solstice staff meet to discuss their findings and to come up with an overall treatment plan. �We don�t miss a trick,� says Dr. Stoff. �That�s how we consistently get good results.� At the end of the 2-day evaluation, patients get a little bonus from Dr. Stoff�a warm, insightful, affable, even jolly healer who chuckles a lot. �Almost always I give them a hug.� FEELING BETTER IN 10 DAYS. Usually a patient stays in Tucson for 2 days for a complete evaluation and initial treatment prescription. If the patient has cancer or a serious autoimmune problem, it may require staying in town for a month to receive daily intravenous treatments. Patients, incidentally, come from all over: Singapore, Thailand, England, Switzerland, France, Colombia, and the continental U.S. Typically, a patient with an autoimmune disease starts to feel improvement within 5-10 days of starting the full supplement program, reports Dr. Stoff. More energy, less pain�this indicates their system is absorbing the health-restoring nutrients. Then there may be a period lasting several weeks to months in which their improvement waxes and wanes; this means their immune system is �doing battle� with the illness and restoring health. Most often, the immune system wins the day, even against AIDS. �We have a large, long-term survivor population. I don�t have a cure for AIDS, but what we do stabilizes our AIDS patients and keeps them stable for many years.� PAUL�S CASE: DOWN-AND- OUT WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE. Paul came to Dr. Stoff�s clinic suffering from chronic fatigue. A former missionary, at 39 he was so exhausted that some days he lacked the energy even to get out of bed. Paul had a constant sore throat, swollen glands, recurrent low-grade fever, muscle and joint aches, headaches, chronic indigestion, sleeping disorders, depression, and problems with memory, concentration, and focus. He was tired all the time, took frequent naps, and often could not keep his eyes open in the mornings. During his time as a missionary, Paul had often skipped meals even though he was doing strenuous physical work; so his body had become undernourished and the continual stress regarding money problems further depleted his system, Dr. Stoff learned. �Paul crashed and burned from this lifestyle and, as a result, he was down for the count by the time I met him.� Although Paul�s work had been in the back country of South America, Dr. Stoff�s blood, urine, and stool tests did not reveal the presence of any exotic tropical or parasitic infections. But Paul did have high levels of Epstein-Barr virus, commonly associated with chronic fatigue. His inadequate diet, high physical demands, and stress had left his system seriously deficient in many amino acids and essential fatty acids, says Dr. Stoff. Even more serious, Paul�s basic biological rhythms and hormonal cycles were out of balance. For example, his levels of ACTH (adreno-cortico-tropic hormone, secreted by the pituitary gland, vital for adrenal gland health) were undetectable; his DHEA (an adrenal hormone) was almost negligible; his cortisol (another adrenal hormone) levels were way too high; and he had multiple enzyme failures (based in his pancreas), which made his system unable to absorb nutrients from foods or supplements. �Paul�s immune system wasn�t working properly because his body could no longer regulate these natural, deep-set cycles,� explains Dr. Stoff. Dr. Stoff�s treatment program had many facets. First, he gave Paul a series of Anthroposophic remedies (Echinacea Argentum, to stimulate the immune system; Apis Belladonna, to work against inflammations; and Cardus Marianas, to detoxify the liver) through a single injection every day for 10 days. Next, Dr. Stoff put Paul on a multivitamin and acidophilus. To help regulate his biological cycles and promote sleep, Dr. Stoff put Paul on melatonin (a brain hormone from the pineal gland) at the initial rate of 9 mg at bedtime, then gradually lowering it to 3 mg daily. Dr. Stoff also started Paul on a commercial amino acid formula called Amino-virox� (2 capsules, 3 times daily, taken 30 minutes before meals) and a multinutrient supplement called Immune Boosters (3 capsules daily, with meals). To reduce Paul�s depression, Stoff gave him 5-hydroxy-tryptophan, a form of the amino acid L-tryptophan (100 mg at bedtime), to promote sleep, increase levels of serotonin (a key brain chemical), and to counter the depression. To restore depleted levels of dopamine, another important brain chemical, Dr. Stoff prescribed Catemine, a form of the amino acid L-tyrosine, and activated vitamin B6 (peridoxyl-s-phosphate). The goal was to balance the relationship between two vital brain chemicals (serotonin and dopamine) which in turn would reset Paul�s biocycles. To address Paul�s enzyme deficiencies and to increase his nutrient absorption, Dr. Stoff prescribed an enzyme formula called Absorbaid. After 3 days, Paul began to feel much better and experience more energy; this was evidence that his body was resetting its biological clock. A month later, Dr. Stoff added a natural form of the adrenal hormone DHEA (100 mg, taken at dinner) to Paul�s program. In all, it took about 18 months before Paul was fully recovered. Normally, chronic fatigue patients recover faster, �but Paul was so nutritionally depleted that it took much longer.� As Stoff sees it�and he has successfully treated some 1500 cases of chronic fatigue�the return to health involves 3 stages. First, you put the virus into remission. Second, you have to repair the cellular and systemic damage. Third, the patient must �learn the lessons of the disease� so the same lifestyle and emotional patterns are not repeated in the future. Paul had to learn how to pace himself, maintain his priorities, and �gain insight into the deeper significance� of his illness. To further this, the Solstice staff taught Paul guided visualization techniques and gave him stress reduction counseling. The goal, says Dr. Stoff, �is to get the person feeling 110% improved without taking any supplements, but this third stage, when they�re fully functional, feeling great, and without symptoms, is the longest. Then things slowly, but progressively improve.� In general, most of Dr. Stoff�s chronic fatigue patients �do well fairly quickly if they follow our directions.� As for Paul, he recently left for Russia to do missionary work. THEODORE�S CASE: PUTTING HIS LEUKEMIA INTO REMISSION. Theodore, aged 50, came to Solstice Clinical Associates with a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. His conventional doctors were urging a bone marrow transplant and high-dose chemotherapy, but Theodore wanted none of that. Dr. Stoff�s blood test showed that Theodore�s bone marrow was being attacked by cytomegalovirus, a herpes virus which is often active in people with a compromised immune system. This virus was triggering malignant changes in Theodore�s bone marrow, thereby producing the leukemia, Dr. Stoff explains. But rather than treating the cancer (leukemia), Dr. Stoff focused his treatment on the virus. He gave Theodore a series of injectable remedies, most notably a preparation used in Anthroposophic medicine called Iscucin (made from Viscum album, or mistletoe) to stimulate the Natural Killer cells of his immune system. Next, he gave Theodore once daily intravenous infusions of nutrients, including vitamin C (50 g), calcium chloride (5 g), vitamin B12 (1000 mcg), vitamin B6 (300 mg), magnesium (2 g), vitamin B complex, adrenal cortex extract, and licorice extract. In addition, Dr. Stoff prescribed a series of oral supplements including Aminovirox� (2 capsules, 3 times daily), Immune Boosters (3 daily, one after each meal), Super Colloidal Silver (one teaspoon, twice daily), folic acid (400 mcg daily), and acidophilus (3 daily doses). Dr. Stoff rotated Theodore through acidophilus brands, including powders, liquids, and capsules, to give him the broadest spectrum of microorganisms. Next it was necessary to give Theodore�s system high nitrogen amino acids, such as arginine (500 mg, taken 3 times daily), to �feed� the Natural Killer cells so they could neutralize the cancer. A Green Tea Extract (2 capsules, taken 3 times daily) also helped here. Further supplements included Super Antioxidant Formula (2 tablets, 3 times daily), borage oil (as gamma linolenic acid, or GLA 240, 2 capsules, twice daily), and Super EPA fish oil (to replenish Theodore�s essential fatty acid reserves; 2 capsules, twice daily), and a balanced multivitamin. The synergistic formula paid off. Theodore�s lymphocyte count (a measure of white blood cells, elevated during disease) eventually dropped from an extreme high of 60,000 to a more manageable 11,000, but it took the first year to get it down to 20,000. At that point, Dr. Stoff stopped Aminovirox� and substituted Aminoplex�, a different amino acid formula. After 6 months on this program, �the virus was gone and Theodore was in remission,� says Dr. Stoff. Theodore would remain on the Iscucin injections for 6 weeks twice a year and continue with the supplements. �He still has leukemia, but it�s no longer active and shows no signs of threatening to come out again.� LOIS� CASE: THE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE THAT MADE HER NECK SPASM. When Lois, aged 35, first walked into Solstice Clinical Associates, she brought a diagnosis of spasmodic torticollis. This is a debilitating disease in which certain neck muscles go into spasm, causing the neck to turn sharply and stay fixed in one direction. She had suffered with this for 9 years. Lois� conventional doctors had her on Botox injections, which is the botulism toxin, injected into the neck muscles as a relaxant; they also had her on a series of painkillers, anti-inflammatory medications, and muscle relaxants. �They had no treatment for her anymore because she had failed every therapy they had tried,� says Dr. Stoff. �Ironically, Lois had never had a decent medical evaluation.� He performed blood tests and found her immune system was making antibodies typical of an autoimmune disease. Lois� neck spasms were only a symptom of something deeper. Dr. Stoff put Lois on a supplement program beginning with Aminoplex� and Sof Gel EFA (an essential fatty acid formula in soft gelcaps to work as a natural anti-inflammatory). He gave her vitamin C (2000 mg, 3 times daily), a natural multivitamin, melatonin (3 mg, at bedtime), and acidophilus (3 daily doses, rotating the brands). Next, Dr. Stoff prescribed a remedy special to Anthroposophic medicine: Erysidoron 2 (containing Carbo vegetabilis, from birchwood, and sulphur) to counter her neck inflammation. He also gave her another Anthroposophic remedy (containing, in part, homeopathically prepared stibium and quartz) in liquid form to soothe her hyperactive neck muscles. Finally, he started her on a course of myotherapy to eliminate the pain. It took only 3 weeks of myotherapy sessions to remove the pain, but about one year to completely undo the inflammation and reduce the neck spasms so she could freely turn and straighten her head. These conditions improved steadily and today Lois �looks fine and has a job as a supermarket comptroller.

Rise above impotence with herbal helpers | Natural remedies for dental plaque | Use herbs to ease PMS discomfort | Your household carpets may be toxic RISE ABOVE IMPOTENCE WITH HERBAL HELPERS A study of 1709 men, aged 40-70, revealed that 52% have experienced some degree of impotence, according to The Journal of Urology, January 1994. Impotence increases with age; at age 40, 5% of men have complete impotence and by age 70, 15% are completely unable to have an erection. However, alternative medicine has natural remedies for restoring male sexual vitality, according to naturopathic physician Marcus Laux, N.D. L-ARGININE is an amino acid that can help enhance erections. Take 3-9 g daily with meals or up to 15 g about 45 minutes before sexual activity, says Dr. Laux. Arginine is not recommended if you have diabetes, arthritis, cancer, herpes, fever blisters, cold sores, or shingles. CHOLINE is a key component of the brain chemical (neurotransmitter) acetylcholine, which helps transmit messages and nerve impulses from the brain to the genitals. Take 1000 mg daily on an empty stomach, advises Dr. Laux. VITAMIN B5 helps to boost levels of acetylcholine, increase stamina and muscular endurance, and produce adrenal hormones. Take 300-500 mg daily on an empty stomach, advises Dr. Laux. CORYNANTHE YOHIMBE is a traditional herb used as an aphrodisiac to enhance overall sexual desire rather than improving erection response, says Dr. Laux. Take as directed by product label. MARAPUAMA (potency wood) is another traditional herb for reviving libido and tonifying the nervous system. In a French study of 262 men who either lacked sexual desire or experienced impotence, within 2 weeks of taking about 1.5 g daily of this herb, 67% of those with depressed libido reported a dramatic improvement and 51% of those with erection failure claimed positive benefits. A standard dosage is 20 drops in water, taken orally twice daily. CATUABA, also known as Brazilian juniper, is recognized by the Tipu Indians of Brazil as a tonic for the male sexual organs, as it produces an aphrodisiac effect with no known side effects. A typical dosage is 20 drops in water, taken orally twice daily. OPTI-POTENT POTION contains 5 Brazilian herbs, including marapuama, catuaba, suma, guarana, and damiana, in fairly strong dosages, says Dr. Laux. He advises men to take 1-2 capsules (500 mg each) once or twice daily, but not to exceed 3 g daily as its ingredients can act as a stimulant like caffeine. PANAX PLUS a blend of Panax ginseng, a known sexual stimulant, Siberian ginseng, and selected rainforest aphrodisiacal herbs (such as catuaba and marapuama), is highly energizing. Dr. Laux suggests 2-3 drops twice daily. WARRIOR a formula usually prescribed for building athletic stamina, blends 14 herbs from both rainforest and Chinese medicine traditions. Take 2-3 drops 2-3 times daily, as needed, recommends Dr. Laux. OTHER FACTORS Chronic stress and pre-existing illnesses such as diabetes can contribute to male impotence, says Dr. Laux, as well as the frequent use of at least 200 different medications, such as beta blockers, diuretics, and antidepressants. Over-use of alcohol and overeating can each inhibit male sexual vitality. Dr. Laux suggests that men abstain from alcohol for 30 days to see if there is improvement.

These bacteria�most common of which are Streptococcus salivarius, S. mitis, and S. mutans�feed on the ingredients in the foods we eat, especially sugars, and adhere to the dense enamel surface of our teeth. As the oral bacteria digest our carbohydrates, they produce acids that begin to dissolve the protective enamel tooth surface. The eventual result can be cavities, gum disease, and the deterioration of the teeth�s supporting structures. In addition to regular professional teeth cleanings, here are self-care recommendations for controlling plaque from dentist Flora Parsa Stay, D.D.S., who practices holistic dentistry in Oxnard, California. SUPPLEMENTS. Take calcium (1500 mg daily) to prevent bone loss; coenzyme Q10 (60 mg daily) to get more oxygen to the gums; kelp (500 mg daily) for trace minerals; magnesium (750 mg daily) to support the activity of calcium; phosphorus (1500 mg daily) to help reduce cavity formation; and vitamin C (2000 mg daily) to help heal bleeding gums. HERBS. Useful here are alfalfa (1000 mg daily) for trace minerals, and goldenseal and myrrh, used as a mouthwash, to help heal gum disease. To prepare a goldenseal mouthwash, mix one tablespoon goldenseal tincture with one teaspoon baking soda and one cup warm water; cool and strain before using. To make the myrrh mouthwash, mix one tablespoon myrrh tincture with one cup of warm water; cool before using. HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES. Use these only as needed, Dr. Parsa Stay advises: Mercurius Solubilis 6X (one tablet daily) to help heal inflamed gums; and Staphysagria 30X (one tablet daily) to help heal gums that bleed and feel spongy. PROFESSIONAL TIPS. Daily teeth brushing and flossing are better at controlling plaque than most commercial mouthwashes and toothpastes. An effective way to reduce the acid level in your mouth is to do daily rinses with a baking soda solution (such as with goldenseal, described above) and a toothpaste containing baking soda. Reduce your consumption of sugars and processed carbohydrates and eat more raw vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, says Dr. Parsa Stay.

HERBS CAN EASE YOUR WAY THROUGH PMS For many women, especially those aged 30-40, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) can be a once-monthly time of discomfort. Typical symptoms can include nervousness, irritability, mood swings, abdominal bloating, depression, headaches, water retention, breast tenderness, nausea, constipation, or backache. The strategic use of herbs can help reduce the discomfort of PMS, advises naturopath Donald J. Brown, N.D. Here are his recommendations: Vitus agnus-castus (chaste tree), taken as 40 drops liquid extract or one capsule dried extract, once daily in the morning to help restore the normal balance of progesterone and estrogen. Evening primrose oil (3-4 g daily, with meals) to correct imbalanced metabolism of essential fatty acids. This will release the hormone prostaglandin which reduces cramps in the uterus and breast tenderness. Dong quai (Angelica sinensis; 2-3 g, in 2-3 divided doses) for relief of uterine cramps and pain. Milk thistle extract (420 mg daily, divided into 3 doses; it should contain 70-80% silymarin) to support the function of the liver where excess estrogen is metabolized. Nutritional supplements: Dr. Brown further recommends taking an allergen-free multivitamin every day, vitamin B6 (100 mg, 2X daily), magnesium (400-600 mg daily), and vitamin E (400 IU, with meals). Dietary Recommendations: Dr. Brown advises cutting down on saturated fats from meat and dairy products; reducing intake of processed carbohydrates (white flour products) and concentrated carbohydrates (fruit juices, dried fruits), diet sodas, and caffeine; and eating more complex carbohydrates and fiber foods from vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.

KILLER CARPETS Your Allergies Are Not in Your Head, But May Be in the Rug Many people who are chemically-sensitive, highly allergic, or laid low with chronic fatigue syndrome often tell their physicians that they suspected common household items, including carpets, were somehow poisoning them. Often doctors dismiss these associations as purely in the patient�s head. Now there is substantial scientific data to support the claims of poisoning. Your carpet may be bad for your health and you may be better off with bare floors. Rosalind Anderson, Ph.D., of Anderson Laboratories in Dedham, Massachusetts, analyzed the effect of gas emissions on laboratory mice, based on over 300 carpet samples obtained through retail stores, carpet mills, or from patients� homes. All carpets had been in use from one week to 12 years and none were older than 40 years. To get her disturbing results, Dr. Anderson performed over 500 different experiments. She found that carpet emissions decreased the breathing rate of mice immediately on contact, from a norm of 280 times per minute to a low, after 8 minutes of exposure, of 235. When the mice were removed from exposure to the carpet emissions, their respiration rates became normal again. Dr. Anderson next learned that one or more exposures of the mice to the carpet samples produced a range of alarming symptoms, including swollen face, hemorrhaging beneath the skin surface, altered posture, loss of balance, hyperactivity, tremors, limb paralysis, convulsions, even death. Then she analyzed 125 carpet samples for signs of neurotoxicity, that is, emissions that harm brain cells or the nervous system. Dr. Anderson found that 90% produced at least one toxic effect and 60% produced 3 or more �severe neurotoxic effects� in at least 25% of the mice. Over 200 different chemicals have been identified in the typical modern carpet, according to Dr. Anderson, and these can produce �diverse toxic effects� in humans, including flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, fatigue, tremors, headaches (lasting up to 16 weeks after exposure), memory loss, and concentration difficulties. When it comes to negative health effects from carpets, �this is not a psychological phenomenon,� says Dr. Anderson. SOURCE Toxic Emissions from Carpets,� Rosalind C.

M. van Benschoten, O.M.D., practicing in Reseda, California, Albert, aged 37, had been beset by chronic fatigue syndrome for 7 years. He reported headaches, chest pain, fatigue, lymph node swelling, muscle aches, irritability, and lightheadness. Although Albert had elevated blood levels of Epstein-Barr virus, normally associated with chronic fatigue, Dr. van Benschoten�s analysis of Albert�s acupuncture meridians (energy pathways through the body) showed no indication of bacterial or viral activity capable of producing his symptoms. Instead, he found mercury toxicity from dental amalgams to be the fundamental underlying cause of the suppression of Albert�s immune system. To arrive at this conclusion, Dr. van Benschoten used an energy medicine device in an analytical approach called �acupoint biophoton diagnostics.� Toxic metals such as mercury interfere with the normal energy patterns in various acupuncture channels; harmful energies set up interference patterns (�biophoton� emissions) in the meridians, in this case, the heart channel, explains Dr. van Benschoten. He prescribed a series of Chinese herbs, including chrysanthemum, angelica dahurica, isatis, bupleurum, cnidium, astragalus, salvia, platycodon, siler, taraxacum, ligustrum lucidum, and fructus lycium. After taking these herbs for 6 weeks, Albert was headache-free and had relief from fatigue and chest pain. The degree to which mercury toxicity was interfering with his energy pathways also was reduced. Three months later, Albert had 14 mercury amalgams removed. However, on his next visit, Dr. van Benschoten found that the mercury interference had increased. �Over-zealous removal of all amalgam fillings can significantly increase the patient�s mercury levels if done without adequate precautions during amalgam removal and proper mercury detoxification therapy,� notes Dr. van Benschoten. He instructs his patients to wear an oxygen mask during amalgam removal, in addition to having their dentists use a rubber dam and high speed suction with water. But Dr. van Benschoten says that Chinese herbal medicines successfully help detoxify the patient and restore immune function after mercury amalgam removal. He prescribed a second series of herbs, including moutan, taraxacum, prunella, glycyrrhiza, grifola, ligustrum lucidum, and verbena to clear the mercury from Albert�s system. After taking them for several months, Albert reported he was still free from chronic fatigue and that he had a stronger resistance to infection.

CONSTIPATION When Robert�s mother brought him to homeopath Sujata Owens, RS Hom., he had suffered from severe constipation since birth. In fact, during his first 4 months of life, Robert had almost no bowel movements. When he saw Dr. Owens for the first time, Robert, age 7, had a condition conventional medicine called congenital megacolon or Hirschsprung�s disease. A portion of his large intestine lacked the nerve endings necessary to produce peristalsis, or muscular movements leading towards evacuation. Robert�s symptoms included bloating, vomiting, sharp, twisting, cramping pains in his abdomen, and frequent, painful urination. On the average, he moved his bowels only once a week and only after great effort. He was always exhausted; he looked sad, rarely smiled, and had little interest in anything; he had difficulty learning, was underweight, sucked his thumb constantly, wet his bed at night, had poor appetite, and was nervous. �He is a quiet, shy boy with very low energy,� says Dr. Owens. He had undergone numerous conventional medical tests and procedures, including ultrasound, surgery, and antibiotics, and frequent short-term hospitalization for pain attacks, but benefited very little from any of it, Robert�s mother reported. Dr. Owens prescribed a single medium-potency dose of Plumbum Metallicum 200c, which is homeopathic lead. Two weeks later in a follow-up consultation, Dr. Owens judged the results to be �excellent, with 80% improvement.� Robert was a changed boy: he was talkative, energetic, mentally alert, enjoying 1-3 bowel movements every day; he was free of abdominal pain, vomiting, and bedwetting; his appetite was good and he urinated without any pain. Dr. Owens gave Robert no further remedies at all, and saw him again in 6 months. She admitted that even she was �amazed� at the changes in personality and physical health she observed. Robert had gained weight and grown taller; his bowel movements continued to be regular; his interest in life was vigorous, and he appeared mature and confident, said Dr. Owens.

DEPRESSION Bill, aged 47, had suffered from depression for 12 years. He had no energy, his memory was failing, he could barely work, his feet were often numb, and he sometimes had to shuffle when he wanted to walk. Bill was on Zoloft (sertraline hydrochloride, an oral antidepressant) and a strong anti-insomnia medication, but all his symptoms persisted, for which his conventional doctors had no medical explanation. It wasn't until consulting with nutritionist Phyllis Bronson and physician Harold Whitcomb, M.D., at the Aspen Clinic for Preventive and Environ-mental Medicine in Colorado, that Bill learned the source of his condition. Bronson and Whit-comb did a hair analysis on Bill and found that his system had a dangerously high level of mercury. Depression originating in heavy metal toxicity is fairly common, says Bronson. Bill�s family, including his father, mother, and siblings, had similarly high levels of heavy metals and also suffered from depression. Electro-dermal screening revealed that mercury from his dental fillings was not the cause; rather, it was probably contaminated fish, as Bill�s family grew up near the sea and consumed a lot of shellfish. Bill was also deficient in magnesium, zinc, and certain key brain chemicals such as acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, and histadine. His physician took Bill off his sleeping pills, then Whitcomb and Bronson started him on a course of oral chelation to remove the heavy metals from his body. They used a multinutrient supplement called OC 2 Pack, taken at the rate of 2 packs a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for 6 months. The purpose of OC 2 Pack (which contains 30 nutrients including antioxidants, soluble fiber, fatty acids, garlic, alfalfa, and parsley) is to provide essential dietary factors to promote the health of the heart and lungs as well as metabolism of fats and cholesterol. They further prescribed Osatate (a calcium source from bone) and Vasotate (magnesium L-aspartate), both of which would facilitate fuller absorption of each mineral. Bill took Sedaphan Plus, which includes amino acids (taurine, glycine, glutamine), vitamins (B2, B6, B3), herbs (valerian, passiflora, chamomile), and glandulars (brain, pituitary) to help restore his depleted nervous system. Whitcomb and Bronson gave Bill Chromease (which combines chromium with zinc, manganese, magnesium, vitamin B1, and whole pancreas glandular extract) to subdue his acute sugar cravings (200 mg twice a day); vitamin B12 (1500 mg 3 times a week) to help his anemia; and Zinotate (containing zinc picolinate) to facilitate the smooth functioning of about 70 enzymatic reactions throughout the body. Within 4 months, there was marked improvement in Bill�s depression. For the first time in years, he had enough energy to work and to be an active father. With his physician�s permission, he reduced his Zoloft from once every day to taking it occasionally, as needed, with ever longer gaps in between, provided he maintained his supplement intake. �That was 3 years ago and he�s still doing fine,� says Bronson.

EMPHYSEMA After smoking cigarettes for 20 years, Betty, 57, was diagnosed with emphysema, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. That made her finally quit smoking. She had seen 5 doctors but none had helped her condition, which was worsening. By the time Betty arrived at the offices of Robert C. Atkins, M.D., in New York City, she was out of breath most of the time, especially upon exertion; she had no energy for work, could not walk up or down steps, suffered from migraine headaches, and had numbness in her fingers and feet. Her conventional doctors gave her a bronchodilator spray and told her she would have to live with this disabling condition. Dr. Atkins prescribed a low carbohydrate, low fat diet (to improve exercise tolerance and reduce breathlessness) and started her on a special nutrient program. The supplements, taken daily, included: magnesium (elemental, 300-500 mg); omega-3 fatty acids (6-12 g); glutathione (400-600 mg); vitamin C (3 g); vitamin E (mixed tocopherols, 400 IU); beta carotene (50,000 IU); N-acetyl-cysteine (1000-2000 mg); selenium (200-300 mcg); pantethine (500-750 mg); licorice root (glycyrrhizin, 300-600 mg); and Gingko biloba (40 mg). Within a week on this program, Betty�s breathing capacity and energy level improved, and after 3 months, she described her progress as �terrific.� She was able to climb stairs and perform physical chores more easily. The headaches disappeared and she only rarely had to use her bronchodilator spray. �She�s very happy with her current condition and I expect her to improve,� says Dr. Atkins.

Frase, M.D., and Michael Weiser, Dr.rer.nat, conducted a study involving 126 doctors and 1090 hay fever patients. The patients were predominantly aged 21-24 and about 58% were allergic to grass, herb, and tree pollen. The patients took Luffa compositum Heel nasal spray 3-5 times daily and Luffa compositum Heel tablets 3 times daily. Both contain 4 homeopathic remedies. They continued this program for 2-6 weeks after which 72% reported either �very good� or �good� results; the patients� tolerance for the remedies was also rated �very good.� Only 10% found the therapy unsuccessful. In a second study by Karl Heinz Ricken, M.D., involving 50 hay fever patients (with allergies to blooming plants or grasses), 34 patients finished the treatment with both remedies (lasting 2-6 weeks) completely free of symptoms; 13 patients had a distinct improvement, and 3 patients had a slight benefit. In this study, 68% rated the results as �very good� and 26% as �good.� SOURCES Antihomotoxic Treatment of Hay Fever,� W. Frase, M.D., and M.

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE When John, aged 62, first came to Eric Braverman, M.D., director of the Princeton Associates for Total Health, he had suffered from high blood pressure for 10 years. His levels for cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), which are key indicators of heart health, were highly imbalanced and he was taking strong daily doses of 3 conventional medications. When John began Dr. Braverman�s program, his blood pressure was 140/90. First, Dr. Braverman put John on a low carbohydrate, high protein diet to help him lose weight. Next, he started John on daily supplementation with evening primrose and fish oil, a niacin-garlic formula, safflower oil, and a hypertension nutrient formula. This consisted of garlic powder (200 mg), the amino acid taurine (200 mg), magnesium (oxide, 50 mg), potassium (chloride, 6.7 mg), selenium (sodium selenite, 20 mcg), zinc (chelate, 4 mg), chromium (chloride, 26.7 mcg), niacinamide (50 mg), vitamin C (40 mg), molybdenum (40 mg), vitamin B6 (50 mg), and beta carotene (1222.33 IU). John took 6 pills daily of this formula. Dr. Braverman used a hypertension formula he specially developed for his blood-pressure-lowering program, as well as a magnesium formula, containing vitamin B6 (65 mg), magnesium (oxide, 470 mg), and zinc (chelate, 15 mg). Two weeks into the program, John�s cholesterol had dropped from 264 to 131, his triglycerides had decreased from 161 to 100, his blood pressure was 120/80, and his HDL increased positively from 59 to 64. John was able to stop taking his conventional medications. After another week on the nutrients, his blood pressure was a healthier 110/80. Over the following months, Dr. Braverman reduced John�s nutrient program and adjusted his diet. John continued to be drug-free, his energy level and sexual drive had increased, and he was �doing fantastically well,� reports Dr. Braverman.

INSOMNIA Ellen, aged 39, had endured intermittent insomnia for 3 years, accompanied by indigestion and temporomandibular joint dysfunction when she came to the medical offices of Denise McKee, M.D., at the University of Nevada School of Medicine in Reno. Ellen preferred a treatment approach that did not use drugs, so Dr. McKee prescribed cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES), a safe, nonaddictive use of microelectric impulses. CES stimulates the production of endorphins (pleasure-inducing molecules) in the brain by delivering 100 pulses per second of alternating current electricity from a cigarette-pack size model (weighing 8 ounces) with ear-clip electrodes that apply the current across the patient�s brain stem. CES is commonly used for treatment of insomnia, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, gastritis, substance abuse, migraines, and other conditions, reports Dr. McKee. She instructed Ellen to use the CES unit for 40 minutes each night before attempting to sleep. During the first 2 weeks, Ellen�s dreams became quite vivid and colorful, then after another 2 weeks, Ellen reported she was able to sleep through the night. In addition, her indigestion and jaw problems showed improvement. �CES is a forgotten, safe therapeutic modality that should be brought to the primary care physician�s awareness as an adjunctive treatment,� says Dr. McKee.

MIGRAINES Cheryl, aged 39, had suffered from chronic severe migraine headaches during the 3 weeks before menstruation ever since her periods started at age 11. For some time, she had been using birth control pills to regulate her period and Imitrex (a conventional drug) to subdue her migraines. However, this drug left her constantly fatigued and did not quell all the migraine symptoms, Cheryl told Ellen W. Cutler, D.C., chiropractor, nutritionist, and director of the Tamalpais Pain Clinic in Corte Madera, California. Cheryl�s skin color was poor and looked devitalized, Dr. Cutler noted. Dr. Cutler used muscle response testing (also called applied kinesiology) and a 24-hour urine analysis to test Cheryl for imbalances in her digestion and nutrient assimilation as well as for shortages in key enzymes. When she discovered that Cheryl�s system was intolerant to sugars, Dr. Cutler prescribed an enzyme mixture to rebalance this. In addition, the muscle response testing revealed that Cheryl was allergic to a long list of foods, including salt, vinegar, ascorbic acid, lactose, and certain fruits. She was also allergic to alcohol, the hormones progesterone and adrenalin, thyroid extract, and radiation. Using an innovative approach called the Nambudripad Allergy Elimination Technique (N.A.E.T.), Dr. Cutler desensitized Cheryl�s nervous system so that it would not stage an allergic reaction to these substances, which had been producing her migraines. It took about 3 months, after which Cheryl had complete relief from her symptoms. Dr. Cutler also put Cheryl on a Systemic Formula called Ga Adrenal containing adrenal and spleen glandular factors, Echinacea, selenium, zinc, inositol, vitamin C and vitamin B complex, to be taken at the dosage of 2-6 pills in the morning. She had Cheryl apply a progesterone cream to her temples and the back of her head, knowing that her allergy to progesterone actually indicated a deficiency of it in her system. In addition, Cheryl took both vitamin C (3000 mg daily) and evening primrose oil, on the days between ovulation and the start of her period. Once taking these, Cheryl had no further migraines and was able to discontinue the Imitrex. �The last time Cheryl came to see us, she wore bright colors and looked vibrant and happy,� says Dr. Cutler. �For the first time in years, she didn�t have a PMS headache.� SOURCE Patient records of Ellen W.

When he came to Steven Margolis, M.D., director of Complete Family Care in Sterling Heights, Michigan, Thomas was a stressed-out executive who was dependent on conventional medications such as Tums, Rolaids, Pepsid AC, and Tagamet for temporary relief. Dr. Margolis put Thomas on an herbal preparation called de-glycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL) at a dosage level of 1 tablet (380 mg) 20 minutes before each meal. Dr. Margolis took Thomas off all his other medications. Thomas reported some relief within 48 hours and considerable relief from his ulcer pain within 2 weeks. Thomas remained on the licorice preparation for 6 weeks, sufficient to enable the stomach lining to heal. Dr. Margolis also prescribed aloe vera juice (4 ounces daily), taken before meals with the DGL, to help the stomach lining heal and become more resistant to its own acids. Other supplements Dr. Margolis often uses with DGL are fresh cabbage juice or olive oil (1 teaspoon before meals). In a recent clinical study involving 874 ulcer patients, 77% were healed with DGL versus 65% with Tagamet, reports Dr. Margolis. In his practice, the success rate is roughly 80-85%, and at far less cost. Typically, a one month�s supply of DGL costs about $15 retail compared to up to $100 a month for conventional drugs. q SOURCE Patient records of Steven Margolis, M.D., Complete Family Care, 35429 Schoenherr, Sterling Heights, MI 48312; tel: 810-979-0022.

An estimated 5 million Japanese use this medicinal algae every day. Chlorella�s broad spectrum health benefits, amply researched by Japanese scientists, include the impressive fact that it contains 60% protein, including all the essential amino acids, and high levels of beta carotene and chlorophyll. It is to chlorella�s high chlorophyll content (more chlorophyll per gram than any other plant) that many researchers (and enthusiastic users) attribute its multiple health benefits, but new research from Japan suggests that chlorella�s secret might lie elsewhere�in its effect on albumin. Albumin, continually secreted by the liver, is the most abundant protein found in the blood. It acts as a major natural antioxidant, contributing an estimated 80% of all neutralizing activity against free radicals in the blood that would otherwise damage cells and tissues. Albumin transports key nutritional substances and detoxifies the fluid surrounding cells in the connective tissue. But most important, at least 38 recent scientific studies have demonstrated the strong relationship between high blood levels of albumin and the lifespan of cells. This research, says Tim Sara, president of Nature�s Balance, a major U.S. supplier of chlorella, �has confirmed that serum levels of albumin are extremely accurate indicators of overall health status and that low albumin levels exist at the onset and progression of virtually every nonhereditary, degenerative disease process, including cancers and cardiovascular heart disease.� The chlorella connection is simple, says Sara, who discerned it amidst Japanese research data. A series of studies with rats demonstrated that chlorella supplementation increases albumin levels by 16-21%. Another study showed that among 50 people with Alzheimer�s, aged 70-90, taking 6 g daily of chlorella for 6 months, 68% experienced either a stabilization or improvement in cognitive functions. Both scientific documentation and reliable anecdotal reports indicate that chlorella is effective in helping to reduce the symptoms of numerous types of cancers, diabetes, low blood sugar, arthritis, AIDS, pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatitis, peptic ulcers, viral and bacterial infections, anemia, and multiple sclerosis. Chlorella is considered a first-string detoxifying agent, capable of removing alcohol from the liver and heavy metals (such as cadmium and mercury), certain pesticides, herbicides, and polychlorbiphenyls (P.C.B.s) from the body�s tissues. A Japanese study showed that taking 4-6 grams of chlorella before consuming alcohol can prevent hangovers 96% of the time, even after a night of heavy drinking. Chlorella can also absorb toxins from the intestines, help relieve chronic constipation, favorably alter the bacteria flora content of the bowel, and eliminate intestinal gas. It�s also effective in healing skin wounds, both mild and severe. READING THE HEALTH MESSAGE IN THE BLOOD Making the Blood Test a Guide to Therapy Whether you�re a conventional physician, a naturopath, or a chiropractor�or their patient�knowing as much as possible about the biochemical status of a person is an invaluable guide to developing the most effective, individually tailored supplement program. With this in mind, in 1985, Mark A. Schauss developed a new method for making optimum, practical use of information revealed by the standard blood test. Now, through his Carbon Based Corporation, the Blood Test inexpensively offers both doctors and patients a 5-part user-friendly formulation of the information, opening �a therapeutic window� to one�s unique biochemistry, says Schauss. It also empowers users to take more control of their health care by being able to make more informed decisions. The Basic Status Report alphabetically lists the amounts detected of about 44 substances normally found in the blood. But it also ranks these items, such as cholesterol, lymphocytes, sodium, and bilirubin, according to their relative deviation from the mean. Schauss calls this ranking �% Status,� which demonstrates by what percentage the client�s readings are higher or lower than a statistical norm. For example, normal sodium levels range from 135 to 145, so a one-point deviation is substantial as there are only 10 points for normalcy, Schauss explains. On the other hand, normal triglycerides range from 0-250 so a one-point change here is not significant. The idea is to provide a statistical context and normative comparison for the test results as measured against agreed-upon standards of what�s normal, Schauss says. The Blood Test also offers a Panel Report that groups the results according to 14 biochemical considerations, such as electrolytes, kidney function, acid or alkaline pH, nitrogen, and protein. �You can review each of the panels at a glance for unbalanced patterns in your patient�s blood chemistry,� says Schauss. A particularly innovative feature is the Disease Indicators Report, in which the total blood status is compared with the known indicators of any of 140 diseases. Here, known disease patterns, as revealed in a blood analysis, are correlated with the individual�s results. For example, the test might indicate a 62.5% match for myasthenia gravis, a 40% match for folic acid deficiency, and a 33.33% match for angina pectoris. This is preventive information of high value. The Drug Interactions Report identifies potential aggravating effects if the patient were to use any of hundreds of conventional drugs. For example, if one�s total bilirubin is out of balance, the use of aspirin, pencillin, niacin, or streptomycin is contraindicated because these would further the imbalance. Finally, the Biochemical Pharmacology Report suggests which supplements are indicated for the given abnormal blood chemistry; the exact dosages are left to a physician to determine. Carbon Based Corporation delivers the 5-part report to clients within 48 hours for a cost of about $100, including blood test fees. UNKNOWN REMEDY FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS Intravenous Calcium Effective Against Autoimmune Diseases Although German physician Hans Nieper, M.D., devoted 35 years of professional study to calcium AEP (a calcium salt of 2-amino ethanol phosphate, naturally found in the human body, especially the brain) and reported on his successful clinical use of this substance back in 1968, the medical world has ignored it ever since. Dr. Nieper used calcium AEP to treat 4000 patients and Robert C. Atkins, M.D., medical director of The Atkins Center in New York City, has used it with great results on 600 patients, most of whom had multiple sclerosis (MS). CaAEP is given intravenously 3-5 times weekly in a dosage of 400 mg in 10 cc of liquid carrier; up to 6 pills of CaAEP are taken orally at the same time, says Dr. Atkins. In 1986, when 151 of Dr. Nieper�s American MS patients were polled, 63% reported neurological improvements from using this natural chemical. �My 600 or so MS patients confirm the results,� adds Dr. Atkins. They reported less fatigue and numbness, reduced spasms, better bladder function, and improvements in coordination, walking, balance, and general muscular strength. Calcium AEP is most successful when used in the early stages of MS. CaAEP has produced clinical improvements in numerous autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn�s, colitis, nephritis, and Type I diabetes, says Dr. Atkins. Early indications suggest it might be effective in preventing breast cancer. Its unique quality appears to be an ability to improve illnesses against which conventional medicine has had no success other than using risky or toxic drugs that suppress the immune system. The only disadvantage is that injectable calcium AEP is difficult to obtain, thanks almost entirely to unwarranted interference by the FDA. However, the skillful application of �compassionate use� personal import provisions in cooperation with a physician can be a successful way to get it from Germany, says Dr. Atkins.

Monsanto May Bringing You Cancer | What Sends Americans to the Doctor's Office? | No Standard of Care in Conventional Medicine -- Just Whatever the Market Can Bear | How To Waste 59% of Health Care Costs -- Conventional Medicine Does it Best | Dentists' Cowardly Politics Mercury --"Don't Ask; We Won't Tell You." TRAINING CHILDREN TO BE DRUG ADDICTS Ritalin Can Do It Ritalin, a drug widely prescribed to control hyperactivity and attention-deficit disorder in children, is now used by 3-5% of all U.S. schoolchildren, most of whom are boys. This means that 10-12% of all boys in the U.S. between ages 6-14 are on Ritalin. Experts at the International Narcotics Control Board in Vienna, Austria, which released a report on worldwide Ritalin use, suggest this could pose long-term risks for teenage addiction and compromised well-being. �Our concern is over-prescription,� said the U.S. representative to the Board. Worldwide, Ritalin sales grew from less than 3 tons in 1990 to 8.5 tons in 1994; of this, 90% of Ritalin is made and used in the U.S. Helping this trend along is Ritalin�s maker, Ciba-Geigy, a Swiss-based pharmaceutical company with U.S. branches. Ciba-Geigy makes considerable financial contributions to Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder, a prominent parents� group that supports the widespread use of Ritalin to control troublesome children. A study of 1000 U.S. pediatricians found that 70% use Ritalin as a diagnostic �litmus� test to see whether children have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This procedure too often results in misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. If the children respond, they must have ADHD. Doctors overuse Ritalin because of time pressures, failure to do a thorough patient workup, and the need to get children treated and out of the office quickly. New studies indicate that high doses of Ritalin can produce cancer in mice. It�s not only Ritalin that may be making addicts of children. Drug dependency starts in childhood with over-the-counter (OTC) medications, admitted the Journal of the American Medical Association in October 1994. Interviews with 8145 mothers of 3-year-old children revealed that, in a one-month period, 53% had received OTC drugs, most commonly Tylenol (66.7%) and cough/cold medicines (66.7%). Of these children, 40% received 2 drugs concurrently, while 5% received 3-4, and 15% received anti-diarrheal medications even though they are not recommended for young children.

Monsanto May Be Bringing You Cancer Ever since recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH) was approved by the FDA in 1993 for injection in dairy cows to increase milk yield, consumers have been alarmed about its possible negative health effects and the lack of solid scientific support for its safety. Many have also been outraged by the FDA�s failure to require dairies to label milk and milk products as being derived from rBGH-treated cows. Interest among dairy farmers in using rBGH is dropping off as 87% of those not yet using the hormone do not plan to ever use it and only about 12% of American dairy farms are currently employing it. Meanwhile, the 14-nation European Union has banned its use and Canada has called for a 2-year moratorium on its further use in that country. So the news that �converging lines of evidence� now incriminate rBGH �as a potential risk for both breast and gastrointestinal cancers� should be the catalyst that gets the FDA to ban the substance from American milk. That is, if they can free themselves from suspected insider connections with Monsanto and several other chemical companies that make rBGH. In a new study published in the International Journal of Health Services, Samuel S. Epstein, M.D., chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition and professor at the University of Illinois Medical Center, both in Chicago, Illinois, states that �with the active complicity of the FDA, the entire nation is currently being subjected to...large-scale adulteration of an age-old dietary staple by a poorly characterized and unlabeled biotechnology product.� The result may be major potential public health risks for the entire country, Epstein suggests. The problem with rBGH is that it contains a hormone common to cows and humans called IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor). IGF-1, normally found in the human body, causes cells to divide and grow, but when extra amounts enter the human body in the presence of milk protein, the body is unable to destroy it, and it is absorbed by the colon, which is known to have cell receptor sites for IGF-1. The hormone is also known to promote the growth of breast cancer cells. At least 17 scientific studies published since 1991 argue that rBGH milk may have cancer-producing effects. Monsanto studies prepared for the FDA indicate that the IGF-1 levels in cows injected with rBGH can rise by a range of 25-70%. But independent European studies say that rBGH milk may contain a 10-fold increase in IGF-1. High IGF-1 levels are particularly dangerous for infants and young children, states Dr. Epstein. �The FDA has dismissed these concerns without investigation and on the basis of unpublished �confidential� short-term toxicity data, primarily from an industry consulting firm with a tainted track record,� Epstein says. Got milk? Better wipe that coy milk mustache off your face, because rBGH milk may be the Trojan horse that brings cancer into your body. One day the FDA will have to answer to Americans for this serious lapse in judgment. SOURCES.

WHAT SENDS AMERICANS TO THE DOCTOR�S OFFICE? Americans make about 1.5 billion office visits to doctors every year, reported American Health in December 1995. For respiratory problems, colds, and bronchitis, Americans make 187 million visits (10% of total); hypertension and heart disease represent 147 million; migraines and eye problems, 146 million; arthritis and backaches, 95 million; prostate and bladder infections, 94 million; mental illness, 85 million; ulcers and digestive and bowel diseases, 70 million; thyroid and endocrine problems, 69 million; skin problems, 68 million; infections and parasitic diseases, 47 million; and cancer and benign tumors, 46 million. NO STANDARD OF CARE IN CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE Just Whatever the Market Can Bear The numbers of doctors, the rates of surgeries performed, and the costs to patients can vary greatly depending on the geographic region, according to the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, the product of 10 years of research. Cities with the highest medical costs also have the highest number of physicians and hospitals, clearly suggesting that the supply determines the demand and cost. For example, Medicare costs per person on a fee-for-service basis were $5966 in Miami, Florida, but only $2729 in Lincoln, Nebraska. Annual Medicare reimbursements to doctors for their services and lab tests were $2380 per person in Miami, but only $585 in Minneapolis. Per capita costs for hospitalized acute care varied from the high of $1475 in Chicago to a low of $856 in Portland; the national average is $1049. Regarding mammograms, in Lansing, Michigan, 34.7% of female Medicare enrollees had one or more, while in Oklahoma City, only 13.1% had them. Among women eligible for Medicare, the proportion of mastectomies performed that were breast-sparing ranged from 1.4% to 48%, depending on geographical location. Rates of coronary artery bypass grafting ranged from a high of 8.5 per 1000 Medicare enrollees in Joliet, Illinois, to a low of 2.1 in Grand Junction, Colorado. The rate of back surgery and prostate biopsy, depending on region, varied by a factor of 7; a man with early prostate cancer was 4 times as likely to have his prostate removed in Salt Lake City than in New York City. The study also showed that an area with more surgeons means more surgeries will be performed regardless of need. The astonishing degree of geographic disparity in conventional medical treatment raises reasonable questions as to whether there is a uniform standard of care or if treatment is based on what the local market can pay. The statistics �explode the myth that this country has a �health care system,�� comments John E. Wennberg, M.D., leader of the Dartmouth study�s research team. There is no evidence that patients are the source of these �wide variations in every part of the health care system� or that spending more on medical services actually leads to better health, Wennberg says.

HOW TO WASTE 59% OF HEALTH CARE COSTS Conventional Medicine Does It Best As much as 59% of conventional inpatient care commercially provided for people under 65 may be medically unnecessary, as is 49% of Medicare-provided inpatient care, according to a 1994 study by Milliman & Robertson, Inc., a health care industry consulting firm. The figures for unnecessary commercial care ranged from 43% in Portland, Oregon, to 69% in New York City, while for Medicare services, it ranged from 25% in Salt Lake City to 63% in New York City. An earlier Milliman & Robertson study (1991) estimated that for patients under age 65, 53% of time spent in hospitals is medically unnecessary, as are 24% of hospital admissions and 15% of doctors� office visits. The highest rates of unneeded hospital stays were in New York (65%), Chicago (62%), and Miami (61%). Los Angeles had the highest rate (36%) of unneeded outpatient office visits. �Health care costs can be significantly reduced by first eliminating unnecessary care,� the new report concludes.

THE DENTISTS� COWARDLY POLITICS OF MERCURY Don�t Ask; We Won�t Tell You. A civil lawsuit was filed in 1995 in Santa Clara, California, by a man who claimed he sustained injuries related to his exposure to mercury from his dental amalgams. He filed his suit against his dentist, two amalgam manufacturers, one distributor, and the American Dental Association (ADA). In response, the ADA adroitly bailed itself out from all responsibility to practicing dentists and the public in general. The ADA told the Court that it �owes no legal duty of care to protect the public from allegedly dangerous products used by dentists.� As it does not make or install mercury fillings, the ADA claimed it does not control those who do. Therefore, its �only alleged involvement in the product was to provide information regarding its use,� but this does not �create a duty of care to protect the public from potential injury. The Court agreed with the ADA and dismissed it from the case, leaving all the dentists in America swinging in the breeze without the defense of organized dentistry for their continued use of mercury. According to Michael Ziff, D.D.S., of the Foundation for Toxic Free Dentistry in Orlando, Florida, �the hope that use of dental amalgam can be defended on the basis that it is a legally approved dental device, accepted and classified by the FDA, is a hollow dream.� The FDA (and the ADA) has never accepted or classified mixed dental amalgam, but rather has classified �dental mercury� and �amalgam alloy� separately. In fact, both ADA and FDA officials argue that insofar as dental amalgam is a �reaction product� made by the dentist, sole responsibility for it rests with the dentists. �All of this adds up to one conclusion,� says Dr. Ziff. �If there ever is a legal liability for placing dental amalgam into humans, the practicing dentist has been left holding the bag.� It gets even worse, says Dr. Ziff. The FDA classifies mercury as a drug in its First Aid Materials regulations. �Since scientific documentation has clearly proven that mercury is released from mercury dental amalgam [in a person�s teeth] on a daily basis and does accumulate in human tissues over time,� says Dr. Ziff, �the placement of dental amalgam constitutes implantation of a time-released highly toxic drug into humans. Legal precedent has established that in any other medical circumstance, this cannot be done without informed consent.� With the ADA exempting itself from any legal duty to protect the public from dangerous dental products, this leaves only the state Boards of Dentistry. Many of them ignore this charge and harass dentists who inform their patients of the dangers of mercury fillings. State Boards are now caught in the web of their own cowardly politics. �In view of the FDA�s refusal to accept and classify dental amalgam, the Boards are faced with defending punishment for opposition to a dental device that has no legal acceptance,� says Dr. Ziff. What they should be doing, according to their legal mandate, is protecting the public from dangerous dental products, such as mercury, says Dr. Ziff. This means that if a dentist or a patient protests a case of harassment by the state Dental Board to the governor or state legislature, the Dental Board will have to defend its actions �without benefit of scientific documentation or the support of organized dentistry,� Dr. Ziff explains. Given enough consumer complaints, that could be enough to bring down the edifice of mercury-based dentistry.

BY DWIGHT S. JENNINGS, D.D.S. A problem with your jaw can create serious health conditions. A misalignment of the jaws, teeth, and face muscles, known as temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJS) can definitely affect other parts of the body. The standard definition of TMJS is an obvious problem in the jaw. Here you have observable symptoms such as facial or jaw joint pain, clicking, popping, or grating sounds when the mouth opens, and difficulty opening the mouth wide. But I see patients who have no facial pain yet have hidden or covert TMJS problems. That is, there may be a problem in the jaw that produces no direct symptoms that they're aware of, but which may be affecting their health elsewhere in the body. Over the years, as I started treating the hidden problem of jaw misalignment, I have seen surprising improvement in or reversal of other seemingly unrelated problems. These include seizures, chronic fatigue, immune dysfunction, and multiple sclerosis.My approach is called jaw orthopedics and I've also achieved a high success rate in eliminating neck pain, migraines, and cluster headaches. In addition, studies have shown that jaw therapy is about 95% effective in eliminating middle ear infections. Jaw orthopedics typically includes the use of a dental appliance, such as a plastic insert, that gives the client a different biting surface to realign the jaw and reset the bite. TREATING TMJS TO REVERSE SEIZURES Betty, aged 42, was involved in a car accident which led to her having many severe neck aches and headaches, sometimes lasting all day. Also, she had endured grand mal seizures about 6 times a year since she was 3; she'd also had fainting spells as a child. After her accident, Betty tried physical therapy and chiropractic because she was resistant to using prescription medications due to the side effects. Over-the-counter pills, such as Excedrin, Tylenol, and Amprin, did not help her much.To start with, I did a jaw motion analysis on Betty. Viewed from the side, the jaw makes an arc as it swings down and closes back up. Typically, we want to see these lines superimposed on each other, on both opening and closing, but in somebody like Betty, whose jaw is dysfunctional, they'll often open on one pattern and close on another. Another test, involving electrical readings of muscles, gives us information about the jaw muscles at rest and in function. From this I learned that when Betty clenched her jaw, one muscle (the anterior temporalis, which pulls your jaw back into your skull) was electrically firing much sooner than another (the masseter muscle, that closes your jaw). This meant that she had a musculoskeletal misalignment of the jaw.I made Betty a small wire appliance with little plastic pads that fit on top of her back teeth to build them up higher and allow her jaw to be supported in a more forward position. Eventually, this appliance will be adjusted to allow her back teeth to actually grow higher themselves, something that can't happen when the tooth surface is exposed to chewing and grinding. Betty had one appliance for daytime use and a different one for sleeping. This is because when you're awake your muscle tone keeps your jaw in a certain position, but when you fall asleep and lose muscle tone, your jaw tends to displace and you need appliances that will control your jaw position. Within 3 weeks, Betty's joint pain was better, and within 6 weeks, she couldn't remove her dental appliance without experiencing pain in the jaw muscles and joints. That was a positive sign that the appliances were working to correct the misalignment. After 2 months, Betty was mostly headache free. In all, it took about 18 months for her back molars to grow to the desired length. Betty has gone 5 years now without a single seizure. In fact, she never had another seizure after I put in the appliances. She's still wearing them and probably will for 2-3 more years while her jaw is retraining.To date, I've had a dozen patients with various types of seizures, including petit or grand mal, for whom this approach has seemed to work. CORRECTING THE JAW CAN REVERSE PNEUMONIA I treated an 8-year-old girl named Rosalind who had been hospitalized 12 times for chronic pneumonia. She had been on daily antibiotics and monthly immunoglobulin (antibodies derived from a healthy human) injections for 5 years, yet she continued to have infections. A cyst developed in one of her lungs and had to be removed. Chest X rays showed that Rosalind had moderately severe scoliosis (sideways curve to the spine). Her father was a chiropractor and gave her frequent adjustments, but her body was unable to hold them. Of particular interest to me when I first met Rosalind was that she had a severe lisp. Some years ago I figured out that a person's speech is a clue to whether the jaw is lined up properly. The fact that Rosalind had a speech defect told me she had a major jaw misalignment. To address this, I installed a plastic appliance in her mouth to slightly elongate her front teeth and to support her jaw. This immediately eliminated about 60% of her lisp. Rosalind wore the appliance for 14 months. To date, she has gone almost 2 years without any recurrent infections and she is off antibiotics and immunoglobulin injections. In addition, her spine is no longer unstable, so it holds the chiropractic adjustments. EXAMINING THE TEETH AS THEY FUNCTION Conventional dentistry and orthodontics have you bite your teeth together, then they try to figure out what's wrong by studying your clenched jaw. In my practice, I examine the teeth as the jaw functions, in swallowing, talking, chewing, or smiling. Rosalind's teeth with the jaws clenched were fine, but when her mouth was at rest or when she spoke, there was a gap between her upper and lower teeth. As yet, I have only partially corrected this because Rosalind is still a child and her permanent teeth have not all come in. Rosalind's case implies that musculoskeletal stress from jaw problems appears to have a major impact on the immune system. There is clinical research that supports this idea. For example, the level of a brain chemical called Substance P, which transmits electrical information between brain cells, rises with chronic jaw problems. Substance P affects immune function; it is known to influence the brain's hypothalamus and thereby interfere with both stress and immune response. I deduced that Rosalind's jaw misalignment negatively affected her immune system, making her susceptible to recurrent pneumonia. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS CAN BE CONNECTED TO THE JAW Ellen, aged 40, originally came to me with TMJS, including headaches and severe facial pain, of a year's duration. She hadn't been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but had received chiropractic care for severe numbness in her legs. I was able to eliminate Ellen's headaches and jaw pain with dental appliances which, as with Betty, were to correct the problem of back teeth that were too short . Ellen wore the appliances for about 3 years, at which time her treatment with me was finished. I suggested she continue wearing her appliance at night, but as time went by and she had no further symptoms, she stopped using it. About 3 months later, Ellen developed severe numbness, tingling, weakness, and paralysis in her legs. During acute episodes, Ellen couldn't walk. Conventional medical diagnosis said she had multiple sclerosis. She came back to me after living with these symptoms for 2 months. I reinserted appliances and from that moment forward�it's been 2 years now�she has had no more acute leg symptoms or walking problems. I contend that anybody with musculoskeletal problems should be screened for jaw dysfunction. These problems can include tension headaches, neck and backaches, hip and knee pain, and uneven leg length or scoliosis. Most conventional medicine has not recognized the neurological connections between the jaw and the rest of the body. The jaw nerve is involved with facial sensation and jaw motion. A problem in the jaw nerve plays a role in many different health conditions and illnesses because not only is it the body's largest nerve, but about 28% of your brain's sensory cortex is devoted to receiving information from the jaw nerve. All headaches, for example, are mediated by the jaw nerve. So when your head hurts, it's really your jaw nerve being hyperactive. When the trigeminal nerve is hyperactive, in effect, the brain becomes hyperactive in response. This in turn has an impact on the entire nervous system and body. Another reason for the importance of the trigeminal nerve is that Substance P is primarily secreted by nerve endings that sense pain. The only pain nerve endings in the brain are in the dura mater (the outermost membrane covering the brain and spinal cord) and two-thirds of the dura mater is supplied by nerve endings from the jaw nerve. When the jaw nerve becomes overactive, so do the pain signals. The third reason is that the majority of the messages regarding posture and muscle tension pass through the jaw nerve on their way from the brain to muscles in the rest of the body. This means that when your jaw nerve becomes hyperactive from having to accommodate a misaligned bite, this affects muscle tension throughout your body. JAW NERVES AND YOUR NECK The fourth reason for the importance of the jaw nerve has to do with its relationship with the 7 cervical vertebrae in the neck. I'm talking about the effect, both biochemical and neurological, of the jaw nerve on the health of the muscles holding the neck vertebrae in place. The jaw nerve is the 5th cranial nerve. The nerve endings of the 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th cranial nerves and 3 neck (cervical) vertebrae (C1, C2, C3) "mix" and interact in the brainstem. Anything going on in your jaw nerve, such as increased muscle tone, is going to cause increased muscle tension around the first 3 vertebrae in your neck. Since the vagus nerve (the 10th and second largest cranial nerve, which coordinates swallowing, speech, breathing, and heart rate) also passes through this area, jaw nerve dysfunction will also affect the way your heart and internal organs perform. Most dentists and physicians do not know about these connections. They do not have a proper model with which to consider these problems or what I have been describing as hidden TMJ dysfunction. For them, the definition of whether your jaw is out of alignment is whether you have pain. In the cases I've presented here, I hope I have shown that this view needs to broaden to include the many whole-body effects of a misaligned jaw.

Law the need to be informed about medical alternatives. Today, they argue the case that alternative medicine keeps them healthy. Ten years ago, Jill Eikenberry, co-star of the long-running TV show, L.A. Law, learned she had breast cancer. She might have been the well-briefed activist counselor Ann Kelsey on TV, but in real life Jill had no idea that alternative medicine could help her, that there were any alternative treatments, or that women could survive breast cancer, even after a mastectomy or radiation. Today, Jill devotes her free time, when she's not starring in a new film, play, or TV show, to telling recently diagnosed women that there is life after breast cancer. In fact, as Jill, now 49, has discovered, life can be vibrant, full of self-discovery and constantly improving health. "I've never felt better in my life than now. I have enormous vitality and joy, every day."Jill and husband Michael Tucker�another L.A. Law co-star, playing Stuart Markowitz, a kind-hearted lawyer amidst the cutthroats of office and courtroom politics�speak to audiences at hospitals, to breast cancer support groups, to anybody who wants to learn how cancer can be a positive turning point in life. Along the way, Jill and Michael, 51, talk enthusiastically about how acupuncture, herbs, homeopathy, chiropractic, and massage have helped them end long-standing health problems and keep them in top form. A STRANGER HELPS JILL SAVE HER BREAST Jill's breast cancer couldn't have come at a worse time. She was 39 and on the verge of almost guaranteed stardom. As it turned out, L.A. Law ran on Thursday nights on NBC for 8 years, until 1994; Michael received 3 Emmy nominations, and Jill won a Golden Globe. She and Michael had completed the L.A. Law pilot, and had a few weeks to rest up before beginning the fall season's filming in earnest. Instead of relaxing, they would be entering the most stressful period of their lives�dealing with a breast cancer diagnosis. In 1986, neither Jill nor Michael were familiar with alternative medicine or what it could do for cancer. "I wish I had been," Jill admits today. "I was not informed and was terrified and didn't do things right." Almost immediately, the first doctor she consulted told her to have her breast removed, a surgical procedure called a mastectomy. "That's what he did the most frequently, so I said okay, take it off�whatever you have to do," Jill says. "I simply didn't know anybody who had survived breast cancer. I also didn't have the courage then to ask the right questions." But Jill got lucky. She and Michael were at the screening of a new film in which she starred. A young woman from the cast approached Jill, studied her face, and asked her, point blank, what had happened. Even though Jill and Michael had resolved to keep the diagnosis confidential (as it could have jeopardized her career), Jill was evidently wearing the emotional impact of it on her face. Forgetting her resolve to keep it a secret, Jill told her co-actor everything. The young woman then introduced Jill to her mother who, after hearing the story, took Jill into the ladies' room. The mother abruptly hiked up her blouse and showed Jill a little scar on her right breast. "That's all I have left to remind me of my breast cancer 11 years ago," she said. That little scar on the woman's intact breast came as a revelation for Jill. "It was the first time it occurred to me that I might survive." The experience in the ladies' room was a turning point. It helped Jill find the courage to get a second medical opinion. The second doctor said she would be better served by a lumpectomy, which would entail the removal of only the tumor. Jill had radiation therapy and the lumpectomy, and saved her breast. BRIMMING WITH NEW LIFE, OPEN TO CHANGE Overall, it was a frightening experience, says Jill, but the worst part was not knowing what her medical options were and not having a support group beyond husband Michael. But being a woman of strength, Jill turned all that around in 3 years. In 1989, she coproduced and hosted an NBC documentary called Destined to Live. The film featured interviews with breast cancer survivors, including former First Lady Nancy Reagan, and how they coped with the emotional trauma of a life-threatening illness. "We made the documentary to show women with breast cancer that they are not alone." It was this face-to-face confrontation with her own mortality�the fear that she could die from breast cancer�that helped Jill make major changes in her life. "Having breast cancer absolutely was a catalyst for me�for both of us�to get onto a new path," Jill explains."The wonderful thing about interviewing the women was that we saw how many of them felt that, ultimately, the cancer experience had been good for them, that it had been a wake-up call, that they had used it to turn their lives around and start doing what they really wanted to. Breast cancer survivors are wonderful to speak to because they've seen their mortality and are so open to change."Jill was no exception. In her case, life after breast cancer was "an extraordinarily fulfilling life." Working with mind-body expert (and endocrinologist) Deepak Chopra, M.D., Jill began to understand how women can store emotional pain in their breasts and genitals. Another way of saying this is that many of the unresolved emotions women are carrying around relate to their sexuality and their experiences as a woman. It's important to release these blockages and "open up all the places that women tend to hold a lot of their frustration, anger, tensions, and past abuses�everything to do with our sexuality," says Jill. Then the energy can flow freely again through the mind and body. Women of her age, as they edge into menopause, often despondently assume that life as a woman in her 50s means a dampened sexuality and diminished libido. After measuring her hormones levels, Jill's gynecologist expected Jill's sexual drive to be "completely gone," but the opposite was true instead. "Frankly, I've never had more libido. I've never felt more vital and alive, more sensually and sexually in my body." ACUPUNCTURE FINe-TUNES THEIR HEALTH Since their introduction to serious illness and the elements of healing, Jill and Michael both have benefited from alternative medicine. For Michael, it was stress reduction. As Jill's sole support team during the breast cancer ordeal and as an actor with a demanding schedule, Michael developed a great deal of stress. This raised his cholesterol level to 240, a dangerous level according to conventional medicine. Using only the stress reduction techniques he learned from Deepak Chopra, M.D., over a 12-month period, Michael was able to relax enough to help produce a dramatic drop in his cholesterol, down to 196. But next came shoulder pain. A few years ago, Jill and Michael left Southern California and bought a house in Mill Valley, a pleasant, upmarket town amidst the redwoods near the San Francisco Bay. Michael began to have trouble getting full range of motion in his shoulder without considerable pain. A medical examination by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed that he had a water cyst impinging on a nerve. Michael's orthopedic surgeon then did something unusual for a conventional doctor: He recommended that he see Ira J. Golchehreh, O.M.D., L.Ac., an acupuncturist in nearby San Rafael. Over the course of 6 weeks, Dr. Golchehreh treated Michael with acupuncture and herbs twice weekly. "It's been totally successful," says Michael, who no longer has any shoulder pain. Seeing an acupuncturist was not new to Michael; he had consulted one regularly in Los Angeles for years. The relief from the shoulder pain convinced him of the preventive benefits of alternative medicine. "Now I go often for acupuncture and herbs for general balancing and well-being." His experience with alternative medicine has also shown him what holism means."You have to tie it all together. If your emotional life is good and you're happy, then you've a better chance of staying healthy." Since her recovery from breast cancer, Jill has also used acupuncture as a way of fine-tuning her system. She had a chronic problem with her stomach including digestive difficulties and colon discomfort�most likely an ulcer in its early stages, she says. Like Michael, Jill had consulted an acupuncturist while they lived in Los Angeles. He gave her nutritional supplements, regular acupuncture treatments, and dietary advice, such as eating only warm, cooked foods. She had excellent results and her stomach problems faded away until the stress of moving brought them back. Once relocated in Mill Valley, Jill followed Michael to Dr. Golchehreh who used acupuncture and herbs to boost Jill's liver energy and overall digestive vitality. "I swear by acupuncture. It's about getting the energy flowing, and Dr. Golchehreh is brilliant at this." Regular contact with acupuncturists over the years also introduced Jill to the benefits of homeopathy, especially as a safe and effective first-aid measure. "I am mostly drug-free and use homeopathic remedies for whatever comes up, such as a rash or fever. When we're worried about getting a cold, we use Chinese herbs." As appropriate, Jill and Michael rely on massage, chiropractic, and special breathing techniques. Now that they have known serious illness and exultant healing from the inside, they'll never lose sight of what makes both happen. Emotions can make or break your health; and sexuality, depending on whether it's open or blocked, can also shift the picture one way or another. For them, love and intimacy, expressed in both domains, can be a healing force, too. It's not surprising to find the "Tuckerberrys"�their whimsical term for themselves as a couple� taking a little time off from TV shows and films to star in a new production of the classic two-part play, Love Letters, celebrating the lifelong friendship of two characters as expressed through their letters. It's another way of taking their message on the road, telling people that healing is possible and that personal growth is a lifetime project. And while on the road, not forgetting their L.A. Law roots, Jill and Michael won't hesitate to argue the case for alternative medicine. "We don't give any prescriptions," says Jill. "We just tell our story." � RICHARD LEVITON Ira J. Golchehreh, The Tuckerberrys' Alternative Doctor For Ira J. Golchehreh, L.Ac., O.M.D., prevention is one of Chinese medicine's strengths."Based on my experience with acupuncture and Chinese herbs, I can say confidently that serious illness at midlife does not have to happen. With the strategic use of Chinese medicine, you can successfully prevent a series of chronic problems from becoming one big acute problem later."

To be honest, I was gratified to hear this. To me, this is what being on the edge is about. It told me our mission is showing signs of success, our message is being heard, and we're stirring things up. "Too" means just the right amount of pressure is being applied to move something that doesn't want to move. When an issue becomes controversial, it means that somewhere the truth is being resisted; the more controversial things get, the more the resistance is mobilized to deny or block the truth. It's not that we relish being controversial for its own sake. Rather, it's that the urgency of our times demands that medical truths and the politics of medicine be spoken about in strong language. Too much is at stake for passivity or understated discourse. The future of American health care and the health of Americans are at stake. How can you keep quiet when you read the clinical research and see that oncologists ignore it, when you see how conventional medicine is harming people, and when you see how alternative medicine reverses illness quickly, affordably, and without damaging the patient? Unless alternative medicine is recognized at the federal level as a viable, legal, and supported medical option, conventional medicine and its toxic treatments mandated by the government as the only legitimate treatment will bankrupt us, and it may kill us as well. The more I study the field of American health care and its skewed politics, the more outraged I feel. Consider these recent examples. In February 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally designated tamoxifen a carcinogen. A synthetic hormone, tamoxifen is the drug most widely prescribed to prevent breast cancer recurrence. Studies now show that a significant number of women taking tamoxifen after surviving breast cancer develop endometrial cancer. In response to WHO's anouncement, the National Cancer Institute and Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, which makes the drug, aggressively lobbied State of California regulators to keep them from adding tamoxifen to their list of carcinogens. This is not from some underground news source, but the mainstream journal, Science News, March 2, 1996. Here is open evidence of a government agency, chartered to find a cure for cancer, flagrantly colluding with a drug company to keep a known carcinogen on the market and keep the public from learning of its dangers. In this instance, NCI worked to promote cancer by suppressing information about a known carcinogen. This should have been a controversy of high order; instead, it was barely reported in the press and few heard about it.Here is a second example. On September 28, 1996, patients and supporters of the beleaguered Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D., inventor of the successful antineoplaston therapy for cancer, will march in Washington, D.C. They will be protesting the FDA's unjustified and continuing persecution and prosecution of Dr. Burzynski and its attempts to use the courts to put him in jail and send his antineoplastons to the rubbish heap of outlawed cancer therapies. In October, Dr. Burzynski goes to court to defend himself against the FDA's criminal charge that he treated cancer patients who crossed state lines to get his antineoplastons. That's the best FDA could concoct against him in their efforts to quash antineoplastons, which are antitumor substances originally identified in human urine. The fact that Dr. Burzynski runs an FDA-approved drug manufacturing plant and that he has cooperated with the National Institutes of Health in studies on the effectiveness of antineoplastons against cancer, and that many of his patients publicly avow they owe their life to him seems to have little bearing on FDA's witch-hunt. "If the FDA wins," says Rita Starr, spokesperson for the Burzynski Patients Organization, "it will reinforce FDA's legal right to make the most personal and important decision of our lives: the right to heal ourselves as we choose. Leave it to the FDA to criminalize the saving of human life." The FDA's role in our health care system and their power to criminalize successful alternative physicians ought to be a great deal more controversial than it is. The case of Dr. Burzynski, not the first innovative physician to be harassed by the U.S. government, may be the wedge that cracks open the monopolistic edifice of conventional medicine and puts a muzzle on its rabid watchdog, public health enemy No. 1, the FDA.Elsewhere in the country, in July of this year, the Medical Board of New Jersey suspended the license of Eric R. Braverman, M.D., director of Princeton Associates for Total Health and a leading proponent of alternative medicine in that state. According to Dr. Braverman (author of several important books including PATH Wellness Manual and, with Carl C. Pfeiffer, M.D., Ph.D., the giant of orthomolecular nutrition, The Healing Nutrients Within), the Medical Board has been trying to nail him for 18 months, in large part because the Board didn't approve of his alternative approach to medical care. Dr. Braverman was saving patients a lot of money by presenting low-cost alternatives to expensive heart bypass and hysterectomy surgeries. Any time a doctor jeopardizes the $1 trillion honey pot of conventional medicine with an inexpensive and almost always more effective alternative, the financial watchdogs mobilize the medical licensing boards to start tearing up the doctor's reputation. The best the New Jersey Board could scrape up in 18 months of investigations at taxpayers' expense were 3 patient complaints, which were actually about billing, not therapy. "On a legal basis, they showed no evidence of harm by me whatsoever to any patients and no errors of significance," says Dr. Braverman. "I am defending my right as a doctor to use psychopharmacological agents for the treatment of my patients." Dr. Braverman's case, and the dozens of others involving reputable, competent physicians that preceded it, ought to be a matter of serious and raging controversy. Before you can raise your voice and add volume to the controversy, you need to understand the issues at stake. Alerting our readers to these issues is what the Digest is all about, and if we attract controversy in the process, so much the better. That's why we call the Digest the voice of alternative medicine�because we're willing to use it to speak out on behalf of your health and freedom.

By Christopher Hussar, D.D.S., D.O. Over the last 10 years, I've verified a secret about chronic pain. It may be caused by previously unsuspected infections in the jaw and can be easily eliminated through simple surgical procedures. I say "verified" because, surprisingly, medical literature from the 1850s indicates that U.S. physicians were aware that chronic, untreated dental infections could produce serious symptoms elsewhere in the body. In fact, although this application has since been discredited, physicians once routinely recommended having teeth extracted as a cure for arthritis. The concept of chronic dental infections producing pain elsewhere in the body used to be more widely accepted in American medicine; these infections were known as a cause of "focal disease." Most American doctors and dentists seem to have forgotten this link but, since 1988, using an approach called neural therapy, I have performed thousands of dental procedures to remove chronically infected or dead bony tissue to relieve unexplained pain. The procedure is to inject a local anesthetic, such as procaine hydrochloride or lidocaine hydrochloride, into a scar, nerve ganglion, or an infected area of the jaw to numb then block the nerve flow�in this case, through a specific tooth or tooth site. This calms down the inflamed or overactive nerve at the site for perhaps 10 hours, so it stops sending pain messages to other parts of the body, whether it is the face, knees, or anywhere else. Often you will get a lightning-quick reaction, an instantaneous relief of pain. You can also use neural therapy to diagnose potential problems. If the pain is abolished with this injection, you can be certain you have found the primary problem site in the jaw. In other words, your teeth are connected to the rest of your body.Using this approach, I have been able to reverse headaches, blindness, hearing disorders, arthritic pain, rheumatological problems, and all manner of unexplained pain disorders. This technique has given life back to people who were suicidal because of their ceaseless pain. HEALING MARTHA'S KNEES THROUGH HER CANINES Martha, aged 86, suffered from arthritic pain in both knees. She had consulted numerous orthopedic surgeons, all of whom told her she had arthritis and should take aspirin for the pain. But Martha's pain was so excruciating she had difficulty standing and moving about; even wearing stockings hurt too much. It turns out the knees are associated with the 2 canine teeth in the mouth. When she was younger, Martha's teeth became infected and had to be extracted, but not until long after they should have been. She was then fitted with dentures. I injected lidocaine into the gum area corresponding to where each canine tooth would be if still intact. Seemingly in minutes, Martha was literally dancing in my office without her crutches, pain free. After that, I had to numb her canine area once every 2 weeks, then gradually only once every 2 months. Martha completely recovered and the last time I checked (as I subsequently relocated my practice), she was in her mid-90s and doing well. MARINDA BECOMES PAIN FREE AFTER 13 YEARS Here is another case that shows how a hidden dental infection can create long-term pain if left untreated. Marinda, aged 55, had suffered with severe facial pain for 13 years. She estimated she had seen at least 50 doctors, including neurologists, oral surgeons, dentists, internists, and chiropractors, none of whom had helped her. A few of them wanted to put Marinda on the kind of medications normally given for hysteria. One dentist thought she had temporo-mandibular joint dysfunction and installed a bite implant, but it produced no change. She had acupuncture, which helped only briefly. When acupuncture doesn't hold, it can mean there is some kind of "focal"disturbance in the mouth that is blocking the flow of energy throughout the body. In other words, somewhere in the mouth, a tooth or hidden infection is focusing its unhealthy condition on other areas of the body�creating a dental focal disturbance�and possibly causing a disease. In Marinda's case, her lower jaw harbored a deep chronic infection that had wrapped itself around the major nerve trunk that passes through the jaw. This had probably originated with faulty dental extractions of her wisdom teeth. Unfortunately, dentistry still does not recognize that the area around the extraction site of most wisdom teeth is infected. Consequently, dentists often fail to properly clean out (debride) all the unhealthy tissue and dead bone from the site, thereby creating chronic infection. This can produce referred pain, which is pain felt elsewhere in the body rather than in the jaw. Marinda also had undergone a root canal and the bone around this tooth was dead, with a festering infection near the root canal. Technically, the root canal was unnecessary because it was done to help relieve the pain from the wisdom tooth socket. The dental sockets and ridges on the upper and lower jaws develop lesions or cavities as a result of chronic infections. The lesions are hollow, set inside the jawbone. They are often hard to spot through conventional X rays. When you open up these lesions, and see the mush that comes out, you can understand why these infection sites will not heal on their own. I have opened up sections of jawbones and taken out decayed vegetable matter such as corn and carrots that had become locked within the original extraction site and were not reabsorbed by the body. Inside these jawbone cavities you may also encounter viruses, bacteria, yeasts, and parasites, all of which contribute to the harmful dental focal disturbance. The mouth is the filthiest place in the body. I made a small incision in Marinda's jaw, giving me access to the inside. I was able to clean out the infection, irrigate the area with disinfectants, such as peroxide, ozone water, and selected antibiotics, then meticulously close up the jaw so nothing could leak into it. When I was finished with Marinda�the procedure took 2 hours�she had almost no postoperative pain and all her facial pain was gone. It never returned, either. RESTORING THE RHYTHM TO ROBERTA'S HEARTBEAT Roberta, aged 40, is a nurse whom I treated recently for irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia. She had consulted other practitioners but none had been able to figure out the cause. I extracted a dead wisdom tooth and cleaned out the bone around it. The next day, Roberta called me to say that her arrhythmia had disappeared. The intriguing question is this: what is the connection between the tooth I extracted and Roberta's heart? The answer is that the tooth was situated on a special energy pathway, or meridian as described by acupuncture, called the Heart channel. According to acupuncture, numerous energy pathways traverse the body, running from head to toe, and most of them pass through the jaw in direct association with specific teeth. Roberta's dead jawbone and infected tooth had a negative impact on her heartbeat through the energy channel connecting them. I've treated patients with chronic chest pain, mitral valve prolapse, and other heart conditions. When I cleaned out the chronic infection at their third molar, which is on the Heart meridian, I have been able to end the problem without any other intervention. All 4 wisdom teeth are on the Heart meridian which runs through both sides of the mouth. I speculate that some of the high incidence of heart disease in the U.S. may be attributed to chronic infections left over from faulty wisdom teeth extractions sending their negative influence through the Heart meridian to the actual heart. There is yet another dental connection with the heart. Usually, a prolonged infection makes the blood more prone to clotting, more likely to coagulate in undesirable ways. I advise my patients to take steps to thin their blood to prevent blood clotting which can lead to heart attacks. I often recommend niacin, Ginkgo biloba, L-arginine, garlic and fish oil, C and B-complex vitamins, homeopathic remedies, and regular vigorous exercise. In more serious cases, I will recommend the administration of oxygen under pressure (called hyperbaric) to increase the levels and distribution of oxygen in the body. One factor that seems to be a common denominator in my patients is a lack of adequate blood flow through the face and the entire body. When I send dental tissue out for a biopsy, often it comes back labeled "ischemic osteonecrosis." This means lack of blood flow (ischemia) related to dead (necrosis) bone (osteo) in the jaw. POISONOUS ROOT CANALS Another source of hidden but chronic dental infection is the root canal. In the 1920s, a pioneering American dentist named Weston Price, D.D.S., while working for the American Dental Association, demonstrated that dead teeth and root canals could make people sick, producing rheumatoid arthritis, heart and kidney disease, and other chronic problems. Dr. Price showed that in many cases, extraction of the root-canaled tooth and a thorough cleaning out of the infected jaw could reverse these conditions in a dramatically short time, usually in a few days. To prove how toxic the removed dental material was, Dr. Price sewed a root-canaled tooth under the skin of a laboratory rabbit. Within 3 days, the rabbit died from the same condition that had made the person ill. My colleague, Jerry Bouquot, D.D.S., calls the condition often produced by tooth extractions "NICO," for "neuralgia inducing cavitational osteonecrosis." A place in the jaw where a tooth has been removed, but in which an inflammatory bone lesion has developed, is called a cavitation. The bone cavitates, or forms a mushy depression (a cavity) subject to infection and the death of bone tissue. This results when the bone of the extraction site refuses to heal properly, literally leaving the root outlined.This situation leads to dead bone (osteonecrosis) that produces nerve pain (neuralgia), usually in the head, face, neck, or shoulders. But NICO can produce problems elsewhere in the body, such as heart disease, low back pain, intestinal disorders, pain in the groin or legs, all without accompanying facial pain. I have treated many low back pain patients (sometimes 3-4 a day) by removing infected bone in the third molar area. Chronic fatigue and arthritic pain disappear in many patients with these conditions after I've removed their dental infections. CROSSED EYES DUE TO INFECTED WISDOM TEETH Susan, aged 45, came to me with an eye condition diagnosed as "orbital pseudo-tumor." This means she had pain around her eyes, which were inflamed, but there was no physical evidence of a tumor, which would be the likely cause. Susan told me she had been to 50 doctors and had cost her insurance company $100,000 trying to find a cure. Susan was cross-eyed. My examination revealed that she had chronic infections in the upper wisdom teeth. In extracting her wisdom teeth, her previous dentist had broken off the root tips, leaving them behind in Susan's jaw where they festered, reducing the blood flow through the bone. This in turn caused a local inflammation and the eye problem. Unfortunately, this is quite common. In addition to the problem mentioned above of not cleaning an extraction area properly, dental surgeons often are sloppy about sewing things up tightly after surgery. It is essential to close up the jaw as securely as possible to prevent a reinfection. A few weeks after the surgery, Susan called me with great excitement. "You did it! My eyes have changed back. I'm no longer cross-eyed." The only down side to this case was that her insurance company would not pay for the surgery that cleaned out her infected jawbone. They were willing to spend $100,000 for medical treatment that produced no benefit, but refused to reimburse the $2000 for oral surgery�I billed it as a medical procedure�that actually cured the problem, because her policy did not include dentistry or surgery on the bones of the jaw. Apparently insurers believe the mouth is not part of the human body. With the "disproving" of the focal theory by our increasingly autocratic medical/dental complex, the concept of a chronic dental infection as a source of referred pain has gone practically unrecognized for 60 years. I hope the examples provided here and the work of other forward-thinking dentists will help to change this.

Every emergency room in the United States should have a hyperbaric oxygen chamber and every physician in the U.S. should be trained in its use, says David A. Steen-block, M.S., D.O., director of the Health Restoration Medical Center in Mission Viejo, California. Dr. Steen-block is well qualified to make this kind of sweeping statement. He is one of the country�s leading practitioners in the therapeutic use of oxygen under pressure to dramatically reduce the effects of stroke and brain injury. �If you can get more oxygen to the brain within the first 24 hours of having a stroke, you can often stop most of the damage and salvage a great deal of brain tissue, eliminating 70-80% of the damage,� Dr Steenblock says. �Treating the patient by getting more oxygen to the brain during the first 3 weeks after the stroke makes it still possible to minimize the damage.� In fact, Dr. Steenblock has produced unexpected positive outcomes, treating people as much as 15 years after their stroke. The Facts of Stroke Stroke, which is the sudden disturbance of blood flow to the brain, is the third leading single cause of death in the U.S., and the leading cause of adult disability, with an estimated annual medical cost of $30 billion. Approximately 500,000 Americans suffer a stroke every year. In general terms, a stroke can be described as a �heart attack� in the brain. Most commonly, an artery, blocked by a blood clot, interrupts the flow of blood and oxygen to a region of the brain, producing tissue death by starving the brain cells of oxygen. This is called an ischemic stroke, meaning there is decreased blood flow, and it represents about 70% of stroke cases. The term embolism means the blockage of an artery by an embolus, which can be a blood clot, foreign object, air or gas bubble; this type represents about 15-20% of cases. About 10-15% of strokes are caused by an aneurysm, which is bleeding within the brain, such as from an injury. In the U.S., there are about 1.7 million stroke survivors at any given moment, and 75% of these are aged 55-84. Only about 10% of stroke survivors are fit enough to return to work without a disability; 40% have a mild disability, 40% are severely disabled, and 10% must be hospitalized. While drug companies continue to search for a �cure� for acute stroke, an effective way to restore a damaged brain to healthy function already exists: oxygen. Since 1971, over 1,000 cases demonstrating a 40-100% rate of improvement for stroke victims receiving oxygen under pressure have been reported in scientific journals. Given the facts about positive outcomes, Dr. Steen-block encourages U.S. physicians to consider the merits of this approach, as revealed in the following cases. MOVING AGAIN AFTER RIGHT-SIDE PARALYSIS Barbara, aged 62, had a stroke that completely paralyzed her right arm and left her severely bent over, limping, with pain in her right leg, and unable to control her urination. She had physical therapy and took conventional prescription medications, but nothing helped her. Barbara remained in this condition for 42 months before seeing Dr. Steenblock. Over the course of 12 weeks, he started Barbara on a series of 60 treatments in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Hyperbaric means pure oxygen under pressure. It is delivered to the body at an atmospheric pressure 1.5 to 1.75 times stronger than what we normally breathe. Barbara wore an oxygen mask and lay down inside a sealed chamber that resembles a miniature submarine. Barbara breathed pure oxygen for an hour. The higher atmospheric pressure inside the chamber literally forced more oxygen into her blood. In fact, hyperbaric oxygen can deliver 8-9 times more oxygen to the capillaries compared to breathing normal air, says Dr. Steenblock. �With 100% oxygen under pressure, oxygen is dissolved into the red blood cells and into body and brain fluids.� The goal is to get as much oxygen into the brain as possible. This helps to revive oxygen-starved brain tissue that was damaged but not entirely destroyed by the stroke, Dr. Steenblock explains. The principle holds true for traumatic brain injury as well, such as people sustain from accidents. Some of the brain tissue is irreversibly destroyed, as brain cells deprived of oxygen usually die within 10 minutes, but a larger portion is potentially revivable. A stroke produces most of its damage through swelling and damage to surrounding brain tissue, yet this tissue lies dormant, not dead but not active either, surviving on as little as 15-20% of its normal oxygen supply. If you can restore blood flow and flood this area with oxygen, there is a strong likelihood of restoring these �hibernating� brain cells to function, 5 or even 10 years after a stroke, says Dr. Steenblock. Dr. Steenblock gave Barbara a 2-month course of chelation therapy consisting of 23 infusions to improve her general circulation. Her carotid artery, which is the main artery that passes through the neck, supplying blood to the brain, was about 50% blocked; in addition, Barbara had high blood pressure and atherosclerosis (arteries lined and clogged with deposits)�conditions that contributed strongly to her stroke, says Dr. Steenblock. Barbara also received about 2 hours of physical therapy 5 days a week and went on a nutritional supplementation program. After one month of treatment, Barbara showed clear signs of improvement. Her walking improved noticeably and, instead of shuffling, she could raise her right heel off the ground and move with a smoother gait. Her posture also was more erect. Barbara was able to open and close her right hand, and use it to grip and squeeze objects. She could also raise her arm to her chest level. Hyperbaric oxygen, by restoring proper circulation to damaged brain tissues, can also stimulate the growth of new blood vessels and the repair of damaged ones, but this takes time, Dr. Steenblock explains. �It may take upwards of 2 years of this therapy for all these cells to regrow, reconnect, and start to function again. But you�re going to keep on seeing improvement.� A QUADRIPLEGIC REGAINS HIS ABILITY TO MOVE One day while getting up from a sofa in the lounge at chiropractic school, David, aged 25, fell over, unconscious. He had sustained a hemorrhagic stroke (aneurysm) that left him a quadriplegic. He could move only his eyelids and occasionally one eye. He ate by way of a stomach tube. He had to have everything done for him and was transported on an electric cart. David also suffered from a chronic cough and recurrent pneumonia. By the time David came to Dr. Steenblock, he had endured 8 years of physical therapy and numerous therapies, all of which failed to improve him. Dr. Steenblock started David on a 2-month series of daily hyperbaric oxygen treatments. At the end of 2 months, David began regaining neck strength and right-side motion. He could stand with support straps or parallel bars for up to an hour and for 3 minutes without any assistance. Feeling started to return on his right side. He could sit up in his wheelchair and hold his head erect. His constant drooling started to diminish, and his swallowing became easier. His eyes were able to track objects normally and his facial muscles filled out. For the first time in 8 years, David was able to feed himself. David also received regular physical therapy, biofeedback, and a nutritional prescription. After 4 months of therapy, David regained full hearing in his right ear; since childhood, he had had only 70% of hearing capacity in that ear. �He�s gradually getting better, and his voice is starting to come back, but it�s a slow process when somebody has that level of damage,� says Dr. Steenblock. David works out regularly with weights and is able to lift about 100 pounds with his legs and 60 pounds with his arms, adds Dr. Steenblock. �And his brain is fine.� Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing WT01-B17-159IA043-000787-B014-686http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue15/i15-a40.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305125612 text/html 16280HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 12:53:41 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html      Cloris Leachman, Showboating Alternative Medicine (Issue #15)   [Go to the Table of Contents] Cloris Leachman Cloris Leachman Showboating Alternative Medicine Why is Cloris Leachman wearing only fruits and vegetables and flaunting herself on the cover of our magazine? The answer is she's celebrating a healthy body and what has kept her going strong over a 50-year acting career: a natural approach to eating, healing, and living. Cloris has always been a pioneer. Long before it was popular, she was using alternative medicine to keep herself healthy. Now, at the age of 70, Cloris is reaping the benefits. Currently starring as the captain's spirited wife, Parthy, in the touring show of the Broadway musical favorite, Showboat, Cloris astonishes the younger cast members who can hardly keep up with her energy. The musical is based on a 1926 novel by Edna Ferber about a late 19th-century family traveling on a riverboat down "old man river." After performances in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Minneapolis, Showboat opens in Los Angeles in mid-November this year. The role is Cloris' most recent in a lifetime of memorable, high-energy acting. Some fans may remember her as Ruth Martin, the sympathetic mother in the 1950s television series, Lassie. In the 1970s, she was known to many as dotty Phyllis Lindstrom on the Mary Tyler Moore Show; afterwards, Cloris went on to greater recognition in her own spin-off series, Phyllis. Winner of 6 Emmys, a Golden Globe, an English Academy award, and an Oscar, Cloris has starred in 6 television series and appeared in over 40 feature films, 35 films for television, and 24 theatrical productions from the comedies of Shakespeare to the musicals of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein. Cloris has played everything from a comical dominatrix nurse in Mel Brooks' High Anxiety to a lonely housewife in Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show. Mary Tyler Moore, Cloris' co-star for 5 years, reports that when Cloris came across a stage direction she thought was wanting in some way, she would cross it out and write in "opportunity." In other words, find your own way. Cloris has long used the same approach for health and healing. When she didn't like the prescription of conventional medicine, she came up with her own, enlisting the help of alternative medicine. However, she dislikes the term "alternative" because, as she puts it, "We're the health people, not them. They're the ones on the wrong side of the track. " "Just Let the Body Heal Itself" It was at the age of 35 that Cloris took her health into her own hands. She had suffered from boils since her teen years; severe hay fever caused her to take pills all day; and arthritis in her fingers was so painful she couldn't bear to shake hands. When she was diagnosed with asthma on top of everything else, she decided she wasn't going to accept it and set out in search of help. In the early 1960s, the notion of healthy and natural living was barely a rumor in American culture and holistic healers were hard to find. Cloris consulted physicians, therapists, psychiatrists, "everybody�and of course nothing helped." What happened next would be described today as finding the doctor within. In a time when few people had heard of such a thing, Cloris went on a water and fresh juice fast, alternating orange, grapefruit, and watermelon on different days. "I didn't know why I was doing it," she reports. "I just knew I couldn't put another thing into my body until whatever was in me came out." Later she learned that food allergies, particularly dairy, were at the root of her health problems.Her instinct to "just let the body heal itself" allowed her to detoxify. On the first day, her nose was running like a faucet, the area under her tongue swelled up, her ears were draining, and her skin broke into a rash. As she grew up in Iowa, meat, eggs, and dairy products were staples of Cloris' diet. Now, her instincts again told her that she needed to change her diet. During the juice fast, the idea came to her: "I guess I won't be eating meat anymore." By the fourth day of the fast, all of her symptoms were gone. "That's when I understood that your body cleans out the minute you let it. I was so cleaned out, so pure, so new. I was bursting with life and vitality. It was a huge life-changing experience." Cloris had also been anemic, but she turned that around within 2 weeks by drinking freshly-squeezed carrot juice. Since then, Cloris has continued to take responsibility for her own health and that of her family. When her son was 7 and came down with tonsillitis, Cloris went into action. "Adam, if you'll cooperate with me, we'll take care of this quickly," she told him. "I gave him freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice all day long. By the first night, Adam's fever was down, and in a couple more days he was fine�with no drugs." Over the years, Cloris has explored nearly every alternative modality in the field. She's used and benefited from the more familiar practices of acupuncture, herbs, homeopathy, chiropractic, and muscle response testing (applied kinesiology). But she has also ventured into progressive health therapies such as chelation, energy medicine through the Electro-Acuscope, and live blood analysis through darkfield microscopy. Chelation improves circulation and pulls heavy metals from the body; the Electro-Acuscope uses a low electrical current to stimulate tissue repair; and darkfield microscopy analyzes the living blood for information about overall health, nutritional deficiencies, and the presence of disease before it manifests in physical symptoms. Chinese Medicine Saves a Family Member's Life Cloris and her family use alternative medicine regularly. Cloris' daughter-in-law, Pamela Pietri, a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine in San Diego, California, used it to save her father's life. He was in the hospital with congestive heart failure complicated by pneumonia. The specialists attending him�one each for his kidneys, heart, and lungs�said his kidneys were failing and he wouldn't last another day. Pamela wanted to give him acupuncture, but the doctors forbid it. The chief resident declared: "No licensed acupuncturist is going to get by me in this hospital." The only option they gave Pamela was to sit and watch her father die. Pamela rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night and found her father shivering in bed, covered only with a single blanket. Hooked up to an intravenous feed for 10 days and fed only ice cream by the nurses, he was suffering from malnutrition. Pamela also discovered that the lung specialist had given her father a drug that, by the books, could have killed most people with a serious heart condition. When no one was looking, Pamela treated her father with the appropriate herbs, such as ginseng to restore his digestive function. She also massaged certain acupressure points to get his kidneys and bladder functioning again. He began to steadily improve and, 3 days later, was able to come home from the hospital. "Conventional doctors divide your body up," says Cloris. "They don't seem to know that it's all connected." As for the doctors, they took all the credit, she reports. "They told us, 'Well, yes, all the antibiotics finally worked.'" With the knowledge of 35 years of pursuing healthy alternatives, Cloris is a resource for those around her. Showboat cast members come to her with questions: What do I do for a sore throat? How can I keep from getting cancer? What about my child's tonsils? One of her sourcebooks is Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide. "If anybody has anything wrong, I look it up," says Cloris. "I'm always looking up things for people in Showboat." Although she is a fountain of information, Cloris considers health a personal journey and emphasizes that she is not advocating anything. "That makes it all sound so boring and separates me from other people," she says. "When I talk about health, it's not about advocating; it comes out of enthusiasm." In her view, a healthy life is enjoyable and words of denial�such as should, allowed, regimen, diet, practice, control, and discipline�have no place. Cloris is creative in fostering the healthy rather than forbidding the unhealthy. One day, nearly faint with hunger, she walked into a swank restaurant in Westport, Connecticut. The air was full of cigarette smoke to which Cloris is allergic. She would either have to go without lunch or figure something out. "I'll give anybody a back rub who will stop smoking," she called out. Thirty people put out their cigarettes and queued for a massage. She gave every one of them a back rub and never did get around to eating. A year later Cloris was waiting for lunch at another posh restaurant, this time in Manhattan. A woman at a nearby table lit a cigarette, but before she inhaled even once, Cloris made her an offer she couldn't refuse. "If you don't smoke, I'll give you a back rub." Turning to a woman at the next table, Cloris recounted the Westport back-rub marathon. The woman said, "I own that restaurant." Wheat Grass Juice Keeps the Doctor Away For the most part, Cloris eats healthy, vegetarian fare�"food that is closest to the ground or tree as possible"�but she is not rigid about it. She does, however, "enjoy" a glass of wheat grass juice every morning ("I really hate the taste, but it does the trick"). Once a week, she gets a tray of sprouted wheat grains�it looks like a miniature lawn�and liquefies the grass in a special juicer. For those unfamiliar with its virtues, wheat grass juice is often prescribed by acupuncturists and naturopaths as a blood restorative and energy builder. A half an hour or so before the wheat grass juice, Cloris gets the morning started with a liquid fiber concoction of psyllium seeds, aloe vera, apple juice, and hot water. She follows the wheat grass juice with a high-energy blend called Nature's Blessing Herbal Superfood (containing 55 natural ingredients), to which she adds spirulina, vitamin C powder, freshly-ground raw sunflower seeds, and blueberries or peaches. Then she may have fresh fruit as well. "That's generally my morning routine," says Cloris, "It keeps me going. I do fruit in the morning, vegetables at night but don't mix them because they require different digestive enzymes." Throughout the day, Cloris does what she calls "body checks." She tunes in for a moment to see how her body is feeling and what it needs. Do I need to get up and stretch? Would I like some water? Do I need something to eat? Would I like to uncross my legs? "If you do this, you won't need a cigarette, a pill, or a drink at the end of the day," says Cloris. In addition to choosing healthy foods and being aware of what is happening in her body, a major part of Cloris' health success has been her decision to not be sick. On occasion, she'll exert this power of intention on other people's behalf, healing migraines with a back and neck rub to get the blood flowing. "I can often stop a migraine in 1 to 5 minutes," she says. Cloris' former husband, producer George Englund, performed a similar service for her when she broke a leg and came down with the flu after the death of her mother. "I got so low I thought I could just slip away easily," recalls Cloris. "My husband came home in the middle of the day with an armload of flowers. He got me out of bed, fever and all, and said, 'We're going out for dinner.' That was the beginning of my way back up." The Medical System Is All about Money and Power Cloris may view health as a personal journey, but she can wax a little wroth at the abuses and political power structures of the U.S. medical system. More than a talker, Cloris backs up her beliefs with action. In 1994, when Congress was deliberating on giving the FDA control over vitamins and herbal supplements, Cloris was involved in the campaign aimed at defeating the bill, which would have been disastrous for alternative medicine. "I have a huge rage at this," she declares. "It's all about money and power. Physicians have been 'indoctorinated' by the American Medical Association and the big pharmaceutical companies. I've been to doctors' offices where they'll reach in a drawer and give you samples of anything you want. Half the time they don't even know what they're for." "If you embrace health, you don't need all those drugs and you don't have to be subjected to the usual list of 'old-age' health problems," says Cloris. If she has any health advice to dispense, it is this: don't eat red meat, try to avoid operations, and go to your local health food store and start educating yourself. Above all, "Don't have anything to do with anything that doesn't invite your soul."To all appearances, this natural healing pioneer will be dancing circles around her fellow cast members and swinging from trees for many years to come. - STEPHANIE MAROHN Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing WT01-B17-160IA043-000787-B026-94http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue15/i15-a44.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305125735 text/html 8863HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 12:55:07 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html           How to Prevent a Heart Attack (Issue #15)   [Go to the Table of Contents] How to Prevent a Heart Attack Examining a live sample of your blood can reveal whether you're prone to a heart attack�and show you how to prevent it from ever happening. By James R. Privitera, M.D. Suppose you think you�re prone to a heart attack or have health factors suggesting the possibility of one, there is a simple, inexpensive way to �ask� your body if conditions exist to make a heart attack possible. Even better, once you know your level of risk, it�s easy to take preventive steps, using nutrition, to keep it from ever happening. The simple, inexpensive technique is called darkfield live blood microscopy. We draw a drop of your blood from your fingertip and place it on a microscope slide. Then a special lens inside the microscope projects an intimate view of your living blood onto a television or computer screen by way of a video camera. A Polaroid camera is hooked up to the device enabling us to take photographs of a patient�s blood condition before and after treatment. The result is a living picture of the cellular you. WHAT SILENT CLOTS CAN DO WITHOUT WARNING The advantage of using a darkfield microscope instead of the more conventional brightfield is that we can see much more detail, such as the contours and shapes of red blood cells and platelets. In a cubic centimeter of blood from a healthy individual, there are usually close to 300,000 platelets, which are disc-shaped elements essential for blood clotting. In most cases, clotting is good because it stops uncontrolled bleeding; but if excess clotting happens in a blood vessel, it can cause a heart attack. When platelets start aggregating and sticking together in the blood, they form a clot, which can block the flow of blood through that vessel. Then, if the platelet aggregation is 3-4 times larger than a red blood cell (which is often the case), it will block the movement of the red blood cells through a capillary (which is a tiny, tributary blood vessel) and block them from releasing oxygen to the tissues. This means you will have a lower oxygen concentration in your blood, a clinical condition called ischemia (iss-KEY-mee-uh). The biggest problem about blood clotting inside your blood vessels is that you probably will have no idea it�s happening. When patients come to the office with chest pains (a strong indication of risk), I immediately have a look at their blood. But about 80% of heart attacks are painless, which means the ischemia due to blood clotting produces no pain or gasping and therefore gives you no warning. You may be driving the car and suddenly slump over the wheel with a silent heart attack. This frightening event may be prevented through a darkfield examination of your blood, followed by a precise nutritional prescription to reduce platelet aggregation. In the darkfield blood pictures [see left], the platelet cluster looks like a blob of oatmeal poured onto a black surface. This is what blood clotting looks like, and it�s also the face of a condition that could produce a heart attack. HOW CARLON AVOIDED A TRIPLE BYPASS SURGERY Carlon, aged 62, came to me with high blood pressure (170/70), chest pains, and a 5-year history of serious heart problems, including a moderate heart attack. He had undergone numerous mainstream treatments, which hadn�t helped him, and now his conventional physician was urging him to have triple-bypass surgery. �A total of 14 doctors of the highest degree told me I couldn�t live without this surgery, that it was imperative,� Carlon reported. �They all agreed that this was the �only� way they had to keep me alive.� They told him if he didn�t have the surgery in 2 weeks or less, he would probably die. Carlon didn�t buy this pessimistic forecast and refused the surgery. He came to me for help. �I believe God built a cage over my heart for a reason. It doesn�t need to be messed up with a knife,� said Carlon. I performed a comprehensive mineral analysis from a sample of Carlon�s hair, and a darkfield examination of his blood. He was seriously low in selenium, magnesium, zinc, chromium, and manganese, and he had some large clots which, incidentally, are associated with a magnesium deficiency. My treatment program for Carlon had 2 major aspects: chelation therapy and a nutritional prescription. First, Carlon started having intravenous chelation twice weekly to improve his circulation and remove heavy metals from his system. Chelation therapy is a clinically proven method of binding up (�chelating�) and draining toxins and metabolic wastes from the body while at the same time increasing blood flow and removing arterial plaque. In chelation, a nontoxic substance called EDTA is intravenously infused over a 3-1/2 hour period; usually 20-30 treatments are recommended at the rate of 1-3 sessions per week. Second, I developed a nutritional supplementation formula for Carlon to help thin his blood and dissolve the clots. Although the nutrients and dosages must be adjusted to the conditions of individual patients, the list [see table] will give the reader a practical idea of how a nutrient program can help prevent heart attacks. It only took Carlon only 3 months of chelation and supplementation for his chest pains to disappear. Even better, at that point he was able to ride his bicycle 25 miles a day with no discomfort. That was 5 years ago. He bypassed the bypass and is doing well. Carlon follows a reduced dosage maintenance plan for supplements and has chelation about once monthly. �I have skipped the scalpel 5 times in my life,� Carlon told me recently. �I thank God I was stubborn enough to choose my own doctors.� Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing WT01-B17-161IA043-000787-B026-121http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue15/i15-a48.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305125859 text/html 12474HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 12:56:29 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html      Reversing Cancer in an Oasis of Hope (Issue #15)   [Go to the Table of Contents] Reversing Cancer in an Oasis of Hope In Tijuana, the Oasis Hospital uses a clinically proven blend of nutrients, intravenous laetrile, detoxification, dietary change, and counseling to successfully treat cancer. Since 1963, Ernesto R. Contreras, M.D., founder and medical director of Oasis Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, and his staff have treated over 40,000 cancer patients with a high degree of success using nontoxic alternative methods. In fact, Dr. Contreras was the first in Mexico to introduce a multimodal alternative approach to cancer. In 33 years of treating cancer, Dr. Contreras (originally trained as a pathologist) has never wavered from his commitment to �total care,� addressing the whole patient, in body, mind, emotions, and spirit. �This approach is made possible only when physicians are willing to use a special blend of science, medicine, faith, and compassion to make a vital and lasting connection with the patient,� says Dr. Contreras. HOPE AND OPTIMISM ARE ALWAYS THERAPEUTIC An essential aspect of this connection is strongly encouraging the attitude of hope. �A person�s positive attitude and faith bring about favorable chemical changes in the body that ward off offending cancer-causing chemical messengers.� As Dr. Contreras sees it, there is no false hope�all hope is therapeutic, which is why optimists live longer. For lasting success, the cancer patient must become an active participant in the selection and administration of the treatment program, says Dr. Contreras. Oasis staff form patient-physician partnerships that include the patient in �every part of the healing process,� Dr Contreras explains. �Our staff advise patients, listen to them compassionately, even pray actively with and for them because we believe that in doing so we can maximize the possibility of realizing complete healing and remission in each patient.� Dr. Contreras� staff includes 8 other M.D.s (among them his son and grandson) who work in a modern 80-bed facility, complete with an intensive care unit, radiology department (for CT scans, X rays, and ultrasound), and a high-tech laboratory for producing several of their special medicines. The average length of stay is 2-3 weeks. a gentle approach works Most often, patients arrive at Oasis Hospital after having tried conventional treatments that failed to help them. A woman in her thirties arrived from California with a grim prognosis of imminent death from bone marrow cancer. Chemotherapy had made no improvement in her condition. �Cancer treatment in the U.S. is somewhat primitive with its looming doomsday feeling over your head all the time compared to Oasis where the care is humane,� she remarked. �We�re treated with hope, smiles, and lots of optimism.� Dr. Contreras is firmly committed to the belief that a cancer approach more in accord with the Hippocratic oath to �first, do no harm� to the patient is not only advisable but gets better results. This means a radically reduced clinical dependency on the highly aggressive forms of treatment such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, and a greater reliance on methods that support the immune system. �Over the years, we have been able to prove by our statistics that it is true: our patients have longer survival rates and a better quality of life than those using only conventional treatments,� says Dr. Contreras. A statistical analysis of 5-year survival outcomes for 1000 Oasis Hospital patients with prostate cancer came out at 83% compared to 73% under conventional care. With Stage 4 cancers (the most serious, in which cancer has spread throughout the body), Oasis Hospital gets an average of 35% objective improvement, meaning the tumor shrinks by at least 50%, and 80% subjective improvement, meaning the patient feels better without a change in tumor size. These results are much better than those obtained by conventional therapy. STIMULATing the IMMUNE system �Our 15-day metabolic program is a treatment based on the use of laetrile, proteolytic enzymes, immuno-stimulants, vitamin and mineral supplements, and other nontoxic anticancer agents,� says Dr. Contreras. LAETRILE. Also known as amygdalin, this is a natural substance extracted from any of 1,200 plants, but primarily from apricot pits. �For the prevention of cancer and the maintenance of remission, there is nothing as effective as laetrile,� says Dr. Contreras. �Its nontoxicity permits its use indefinitely in the prevention of relapses and metastases.� Oasis Hospital manufactures its own laetrile for use with its patients; typically, it is given intravenously. PREVEN-CA. This blend of medicinal herbs and shark cartilage (produced at the hospital) helps to stop tumors from creating new blood vessels and thereby from growing; it also acts as a detoxifying agent and an antioxidant. Preven-Ca contains Cardus marianus, apricot kernel flour, carrot root, shark cartilage, garlic, alfalfa, and boldo (a bitter liver-cleansing herb), and is taken in tablet form, usually 1 before each meal. �Preven-Ca contains most of the nutrients that our daily diet does not contain but that are necessary for our body to work at its highest potential,� says Dr. Contreras. WARBURG/CONE CANCER THERAPY. This approach is based on metabolic principles developed by Otto Warburg, M.D., (who won 2 Nobel prizes) and Clarence D. Cone, Ph.D. Metabolism refers to the processes by which the body extracts energy from foods. �The therapy is designed to selectively destroy malignant cells without harming the normal cells of the body,� Dr. Contreras explains. Patients go on a low-fat, high-complex-carbohydrate diet (3,000 calories daily, largely from whole grains) while receiving 3 nontoxic medications: lente insulin (a common prescription drug), thyroid hormone, and the bioflavonoid quercetin (delivered intravenously). �The 3 substances work together, synergistically producing a blockage around the cancer cells such that they cannot breathe or get nourishment, so they starve to death.� Patients receive this therapy for 1-3 weeks at Oasis, then continue it at home, usually for 3 months. NUTRIENTS. Vitamin C is given intravenously in high doses, often up to 50 g daily, followed by a 10 g daily oral maintenance dose at home. High dose vitamin A is given, although in cases of liver cancer or dysfunction, the dosage does not exceed 300,000 IU daily. ENZYMES. Dr. Contreras administers Wobe-Mugos enzymes (from Germany) derived from both vegetable and animal sources. Proteolytic (protein-digesting) enzymes, along with hydrochloric acid in the stomach, are the body�s first defense against tumors. This formula contains pancreatin, papain, bromelain, trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, amylase, and rutin (a bioflavonoid). Initially, the enzymes are given as suppositories (1-2 daily), then as pills (6-9 daily) for an indefinite period. DIET. The Contreras� dietary plan has both general and patient-specific requirements. Among the general recommendations, Dr. Contreras advises his patients to avoid the following: frozen and canned foods; foods with preservatives, additives, or colorings; white flour, salt, white sugar, caffeine, alcohol, shellfish, and red meat. On the positive side, patients are urged to eat �living� foods such as organic fruits and vegetables, whole or as juices. Depending on the laetrile dosage prescribed, the specific dietary recommendations may be stricter or looser, says Dr. Contreras. �The nutritional programs are designed to release patients from the harmful effects that certain foods have on them and to encourage the consumption of foods that have beneficial effects.� DETOXIFICATION. Oasis Hospital administers a 5-10 day detoxification program that includes a complete physical examination, laboratory tests, an organic foods diet, intravenous solutions of vitamin C, potassium, and other natural substances to improve the immune system, and a series of high-colonic and coffee enemas. The goal is to help the body collect and drain its numerous toxins. CHELATION THERAPY. By giving an intravenous solution containing selected vitamins, minerals, heparin (a blood thinner), and EDTA (a synthetic amino acid that binds up or �chelates� heavy metals), a patient�s circulation is greatly improved and the toxicity load reduced. The solution acts as a magnet, pulling positively charged calcium and other metal ions out of the cells of arterial walls. COUNSELING. Oasis patients receive regular counseling sessions with both a staff psychologist and a pastoral adviser. �We believe that the main stimulants we can use for our patients, in addition to the metabolic program, are emotional and spiritual. Every Thursday afternoon, I get together with my patients, not as a doctor, but as a spiritual advisor. We have a full hour of good humor, laughter, spiritual readings, music, and singing together. That really helps, believe me, better than the injections. It deeply relaxes the patients and improves their immune system tremendously.� �Richard Leviton Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing WT01-B17-162IA043-000787-B026-143http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue15/i15-a04.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305130023 text/html 12369HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 12:57:53 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html      You Don't Have to Be Sick (Issue #15)   [Go to the Table of Contents] You Don't Have to Be Sick On the Edge with BURTON GOLDBERG Gulf War Syndrome Military Made? Outrageous U.S. Germ Warfare Program Backfires While Military & Media Stage Cover-up A cover-up of immense proportions is under way in the U.S. Defense Department, with the complicity of the media. It�s about the origin of Gulf War Syndrome (GWS), a disease similar to chronic fatigue syndrome and with 31 different symptoms. GWS has already taken the lives of at least 6,000 U.S. soldiers and infected an estimated 100,000 more of those who fought in the 1991 Gulf War. It may also be entering the general civilian population, but the media are conspicuously silent on the true source of GWS. While the Pentagon is now finally admitting that the destruction of an ammunition dump in southern Iraq in March 1991 may have exposed 15,000 U.S. soldiers to toxic nerve gas and chemical agents, possibly producing GWS, the reality may be far worse. Evidence suggests that our soldiers were poisoned by our own germ warfare agents developed by the U.S. military and sold in the 1980s to the Iraqis, who then used them against us in the Gulf War. These conclusions sound unbelievable yet they are supported by testimony and documents presented during U.S. Congressional hearings on the investigation of GWS by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Senator Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (D�Michigan), who led the investigation, submitted his report to the Senate on February 9, 1994. The Riegle Committee, with actual shipping invoices, batch numbers, company names, and inventories in hand, proved that during the 1980s the U.S. government provided Iraq with 28 different germ warfare agents for use against Iran in their nearly decade-long conflict. Senator Riegle�s 2-year investigation showed that U.S. forces destroyed 12 biological and 18 chemical facilities in Iraq during the war, releasing into the air huge amounts of toxic substances which subsequently drifted over the troops. It is now known that up until 2 weeks before Iraq�s invasion of Kuwait in August 1991, U.S. trained experts were working with Iraqi scientists in Baghdad to develop biological agents as weapons. The Riegle Committee further established that the U.S. military installed 14,000 chemical alarm monitoring units in the battle areas to alert soldiers to the presence of biological agents, but when too many such alarms went off, the military disabled them. Under oath, Army Sergeant Randall Vallee told the Riegle Committee that he was ordered to ignore the alarms. From the beginning, Pentagon officials have denied that any germ warfare agents were used in the Gulf. Their use would be in direct violation of the Geneva Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, signed by both the U.S. and Iraq, prohibiting experimentation with and sale of biological weapons. Yet on May 1, 1996, Major General Ronald Blanck, senior physician at Walter Reed Army Hospital, told the President�s Panel on Gulf War Illnesses that chemical and biological weapons had been used in Operation Desert Storm and that this probably led to low-level exposures. Evidence also exists that the Iraqis painted SCUD and Frog missiles with biological agents including anthrax, botulinum, �yellow rain� (a lethal fungi), and others, so that toxic infections would be spread through the air on explosion. Soldiers who were never in the Gulf but who came in contact with military clothing or aircraft returning from the war, and domestic airline attendants on flights which transported Gulf soldiers, have now developed GWS. If all this is true�the evidence supporting it is solid, much of it given under oath�we need no longer worry about Nature producing new diseases. Now it seems our own government is creating toxic threats to human health, at taxpayer expense, and often with taxpayers as the test subjects, on a scale far more life-threatening than anything Nature can �cook� up. According to �Gulf War Syn-drome: A Second Opinion,� a 4-hour radio show aired on WBAI in New York City from August 6 to 9, 1996, not only does the U.S. government know fully about GWS, it may have invented it decades ago. Based on 2 years of research by noted health researcher and educator Gary Null, Ph.D., the show provides evidence that GWS was created in a U.S. laboratory as part of a 50-year ongoing germ warfare research program which produced such products as AIDS and Ebola virus, and used thousands of unsuspecting U.S. citizens as guinea pigs. A key piece of the puzzle comes from Garth L. Nicolson, Ph.D., former chairman of the tumor biology department at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston. Dr. Nicolson�s genetic analysis of the GWS microbe shows it to be the result of genetic engineering. It combines a gene from the HIV-1 virus and genetically altered anthrax genes with a mycoplasma (a tiny biological life form without a cell wall, normally harmless). The result is a new, highly infectious and deadly microbe not previously found in Nature. The GWS microbe acts as a silent, undetectable pathogen that slowly kills a person from the inside, starting with cell nuclei, and leaving almost no trace of its presence, Dr. Nicolson explains. Not only were U.S. soldiers exposed to Iraqi germ warfare, the U.S. military may have used them as guinea pigs to test experimental vaccines. According to Dr. Null�s research, about 100,000 U.S. troops (plus those of other nations) who were to fight in the Gulf against Iraq received multiple vaccinations against suspected Iraqi biological agents. However, some of the vaccinations were against germ warfare agents the Iraqis were not known to possess. Dr. Null claims that, in fact, U.S. soldiers were the unwitting test subjects for experimental, genetically engineered biological agents as part of a germ warfare research program. For example, the Pentagon strong-armed the FDA into approving the use of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) tablets ostensibly to protect soldiers against Iraqi biological attacks. PB is only given for the treatment of a chronic muscle weakness disorder called myasthenia gravis. Now evidence suggests that PB and the other experimental vaccines themselves may have contributed to GWS. According to Dr. Null, the U.S. Defense Department is proceeding with its cover-up of GWS because the real story is appalling. Not only were U.S. soldiers exposed to multiple biological agents, but it is probable that these agents, now released, can no longer be controlled and that they are capable of mutating into more virulent forms. It is certain that they are airborne and contagious. The spouses of Gulf soldiers are showing symptoms of GWS at the rate of 78%, according to the Riegle report which polled 1,000 servicemen. In addition, there has been a dramatic increase in birth defects in these military families�30% according to one study cited by Dr. Null. The infection rate of GWS may grow exponentially, to 1 million infected within a few years, warns Dr. Null. Who�s to blame for this? At all levels of government there is the predictable denial of responsibility or knowledge. For one, the FDA, this so-called watchdog of public health, approved the use of experimental vaccines on U.S. soldiers even though there was no proof of their safety or effectiveness�the very criteria FDA�s charter empowers it to ensure. According to Dr. Null�s research, over 2,000 studies demonstrate that upwards of 10 million American citizens (soldiers, children, the elderly, and those in psychiatric wards or prisons) have been secretly used as that test subjects in a 50-year program of germ warfare research. GWS is apparently only the latest in a heinous succession of experiments. The fact that infectious disease is now the third leading cause of death in the U.S. (whereas 50 years ago it wasn�t even in the top 15) may turn out to be the result of the deliberate, systematic, and unpardonable poisoning of the American population by its own government in the interests of national �defense.� I ask the American public to demand of the Pentagon an answer as to why Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was left in power in Iraq. Could it be our �heroic� generals know that Iraq has insulated itself against further military inroads by a germ warfare shield? Could it be that they knew in 1991 that germ warfare was involved in the Gulf War? Let�s demand that they answer this. The outrageous facts about U.S. military use of germ warfare and its disastrous consequences for our own soldiers are in the public record. Yet the U.S. government and nearly all the media continue to stonewall the truth. This cover-up must be thoroughly unmasked in the interests of our national health security without which we have nothing. Burton Goldberg's appearances are listed on his calendar.

While I may recommend herbal and nutritional supplements or work in tandem with other health professionals such as an acupuncturist or nutritionist, I have found that flower essences can play a major role in resolving menopausal transitions by addressing the deep emotional and psychological issues women face during this life change. Herbal and nutritional supplements can help reduce the physical symptoms, but it is also vitally important to help each woman understand her own body�s expressions as carrying a larger message about her life. In my experience, when the body is understood from this larger perspective, women do more than adjust to or reverse uncomfortable menopausal symptoms. Instead, they develop depth and maturity and can move confidently toward menopause as a positive part of their life, as Alice�s case demonstrates. RAPID ONSET OF MENO-PAUSE. Alice, aged 48, entered rapidly into full-blown menopausal symptoms with little warning. She was a highly successful career woman who married late and had her first child when she was 44. But rather than fully enjoying her young daughter, Alice found herself completely exhausted and in emotional turmoil. She suffered from debilitating hot flashes and drenching night sweats. In addition, she developed urinary incontinence, making it difficult to get adequate rest at night. After nursing her child, Alice�s periods became scanty and irregular for one year, then ceased altogether. In response to these conditions, her conventional doctor prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but after 6 months, Alice sought an alternative treatment. While on HRT, her hot flashes and night sweats subsided, but Alice developed many PMS-like symptoms�bloating, tender breasts, bouts of nausea and weight gain�and she still had bladder control problems at night. She reported feeling even more tense and moody than before, and generally exhausted. When I first saw Alice, our immediate goal was to wean her from the HRT, which was creating havoc in her body. We used an herbal formula consisting of black cohosh (Cimifuga racemosa), dong quai (Angelica sinensis), and chasteberry (Vitex agnus castus). I also recommended that Alice add a combination of evening primrose, black currant, and borage oils to her diet along with increasing her consumption of calcium-rich foods such as dark leafy greens. These changes helped Alice cope without synthetic hormones, although her hot flashes and night sweats returned in a diminished form. I began flower essence therapy with a single remedy called Scarlet Monkeyflower. This would help her address the sensation of hot flashes and night sweats from a deeper level. To see how this is possible, it�s helpful to know something about the plant from which the flower essence is made. INSIDE THE EMOTIONS OF THE HOT FLASH. As a plant, Scarlet Monkeyflower is a bright red flower with many fiery qualities, yet it grows in a shady environment near flowing streams. As we understand its operation in flower essence therapy, this plant can help to bring deep primal feelings of anger or other forms of �raw fire� into more harmonious or flowing expression. With the help of Scarlet Monkeyflower, Alice was able to stop resisting her symptoms and move toward them, and to begin to experience their inner meaning and purpose for the first time. Flower essences help to clarify emotions and bring insight into their origin and purpose. In her journal, Alice wrote: �I felt a burning wave of energy pass over my body from below, spreading upwards until my neck was red hot and my skin prickled. I could breathe into them as though they were labor pains. I began to feel as if I were giving birth to some new part of myself.� On one occasion she awoke from a night sweat and recalled an intense dream during which she was expressing anger toward her mother. As the days passed, she uncovered many painful memories and emotions. �I feel now as though a flame is burning in me, purifying and illumining me, helping me to see many emotions which I have repressed for a long time,� Alice wrote. Although others had always seen her as a �helper� and a �pleaser,� Alice felt that �inside, another part of me is ready to explode.� As she assimilated the �message� of the Scarlet Monkeyflower in terms of her emotional insights over the next 2 months, her hot flashes and night sweats subsided, for the most part, along with her frequent urination. More predominant now were symptoms of deep fatigue, punctuated by brief bouts of nervous hyperactivity. HELPED BY A ROSE AND A LILY. At this point, I developed a flower essence combination that combined plant remedies from the lilies and roses. With their affinity to water and their round bulbs with shallow roots, the lilies have long been associated in herbal (and artistic) tradition with the feminine. On the other hand, the roses have deep roots and sharp thorns, and can help make changes in a person�s masculine qualities. In flower essence theory, the quality, nature, setting, and growth patterns of plants are taken to be clues as to the kind of healing effects they might have when taken as flower essences. The flower essences selected for Alice included Tiger Lily, which helps to stabilize the masculine elements within a woman�s psyche, and Mariposa Lily. This essence addresses issues of mothering and nurturance, such as relatedness to one�s own mother or doubts about one�s ability to be a mother. Alice had many internal conflicts that came to the surface in raising her daughter. Another remedy I gave Alice was Alpine Lily to help her sustain and heal the biological demands of late motherhood and to stay aware of the physical expressions of her body rather than denying or masking them as she tended to do. The rose flower essences included California Wild Rose, which brings renewed vitality and enthusiasm by giving one a new sense of passion or vision for one�s life; Quince, a remedy often recommended for those with a �helper or pleaser� personality, by giving more strength and firmness to one�s expressions; and Blackberry, a remedy that helps to strengthen the will. I also prepared these essences in a base of Self-Heal cream, to which was added several drops of pure rose essential oil. Alice massaged this formula twice daily onto her heart and chest area. She took 4 drops sublingually of each flower essence 4 times daily, upon rising, before lunch and dinner, and before going to bed. RENEWED ENERGY AND PURPOSE. During the 3 months in which she used these flower essences, Alice experienced profound changes in her body and emotions. She no longer felt exhausted. She spent more time at home with her daughter. In her relationship with her husband she became more openly expressive rather than stifling her resentments. She developed new career plans, for teaching and consulting. She also enrolled in an art course which helped her to find expression for the new parts of herself the flower essences had helped to uncover. Most surprisingly, her menstrual period returned and has been regular for 2 years. �I used to feel annoyed by my period and couldn�t wait for it to be over,� Alice told me. Now she welcomes it. About a year after using these essences, Alice reported she felt like an entirely different person. �I don�t want to see menopause as �fixing� my biological clock. I have gone through a dark tunnel and come out the other side. I have never felt more excited about my future.� Alternative Medicine Digest © 1996 by Future Medicine Publishing WT01-B17-164IA043-000787-B026-198http://www.alternativemedicine.com:80/alternativemedicine/digest/issue15/i15-a25.shtml 206.12.188.18 19970305130310 text/html 13919HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 05 Mar 1997 13:00:41 GMTServer: Apache/1.0.5Content-type: text/html      Ask the Physician (Issue #15)   [Go to the Table of Contents] Ask the Physician Health Hazard in Your Intestines William Lee Cowden, M.D. In what ways can a problem in the intestines be interfering with good health? For centuries, physicians across many disciplines have said that health begins and ends in the intestines. Many illnesses, such as colon, liver, breast, and prostate cancers, most allergies, infections, liver diseases, acne, psoriasis, and asthma, start in the intestines. The intestines become clogged, toxic, and diseased by what and how we eat and by how poorly we eliminate waste material. The intestines, when stretched out, are over 25 feet long. In fact, if the inner surface of the small intestines was smooth and flat rather than convoluted, they would stretch for 2-1/4 miles or completely cover an area the size of a tennis court. You can see how crucial intestinal health is to your well-being. Once the bowel is toxic, it creates toxicity for the entire body and an inability to absorb the nutrients necessary for healing. About 100 years ago, most people in the U.S. had a short intestinal transit time. That means it took only about 15-20 hours from the time food entered the mouth until it was excreted as feces. Today, many have a seriously delayed transit time of 50-70 hours. This means there is more time for the stool to putrefy, for harmful microorganisms to flourish, for �friendly� bacteria to die off, and for toxins to develop and poison the tissues. When you eat mucus-producing foods, this further slows down the transit time. It should now be easier to understand how a toxic bowel can lead to cancer, allergies, and infections. It should also be clear how important it is to prevent and reverse bowel toxicity. A material similar to papier-m�ch� can develop in the lining of the small and large intestines as a result of eating white flour products combined with fluid and cellulose, which is found in vegetables. When you eat other foods that produce mucus, such as dairy products, the result is a rubbery-like material that combines with the papier-m�ch� lining, and it builds up even faster. Mucus-producing foods are nearly all foods aside from most vegetables and fruits; however, the most mucus-producing foods are milk products. Other foods include meats, fish, fowl, eggs, soybeans, oily seeds and nuts, and cooked beans and grains (but not beans and grains that have sprouted and grown for 6 days). Fruits and vegetables tend to cause the mucus in the intestines to break down somewhat and be eliminated. As this sticky mucoid false lining builds up in the small intestines, it blocks absorption of essential nutrients into the bloodstream and produces a hiding place in both intestines for bacteria, fungi, yeast, and parasites that are harmful to human health. When these abnormal life forms start growing too freely in the intestines, they kill off Lactobacillus acidophilus and other �friendly� bacteria. They also create a situation called dysbiosis (or an imbalance among intestinal microflora) in which the contents of the intestines putrefy and harmful chemicals are generated. The result is a toxic bowel and a body-wide condition of toxicity as toxins leech out of the intestines into other tissues. The toxins pass through the intestinal wall and accumulate in the lymph vessels. Too many toxins can block the lymphatic syste, which, no longer able to drain and filter poisons efficiently, becomes overloaded. As toxins build up in all the tissues, the result can be swelling of the torso and legs and damage to the immune system, liver, and, eventually, the other organs. The inevitable result is illness. Are there general precautionary steps to improve intestinal health? There are 7 steps anyone can adopt, starting today, to improve their intestinal health as a way of preventing illness. First, make some dietary changes. Start eating a diet that is high in fiber, fresh raw vegetables and fruits, and very low in mucoid-producing foods. It would be wise to completely stop eating all milk products from cows and all refined white flour products, such as pastas, breads, and baked goods. It is also advisable to reduce your intake of sugar, eggs, meats, fowl, most fish, nuts, seeds, and unsprouted beans and grains. Second, reduce your stress load. Practice stress reduction techniques before each meal. These might include muscle relaxation, deep breathing, or the visualization of a favorite and pleasant natural setting. Listen to a stress reduction audiotape before eating, then try to have your meals in a calm, pleasant environment. Third, practice lymphatic drain-age. It is important to take steps to clean out your lymphatic system, especially the lymph vessels that attach to the intestines. You can do this by gently bouncing on a mini-trampoline or rebounder for 5-15 minutes once daily, but don�t overexert yourself. This will stimulate the numerous lymph nodes in your neck, chest, and groin to start draining toxins into the bloodstream for removal from the body. Fourth, brush your skin. In the early morning, soon after you get up, take a wooden brush with stiff natural bristles and lightly brush your skin. Move the brush across the skin towards the middle end of the collarbones on each side of the body, as important lymph drainage sites are located there. Spend 8-10 minutes dry brushing your entire body. This procedure will mechanically aid your lymph system in its detoxification efforts. Do the dry brushing before taking a bath, but be aware that skin brushing just before bedtime can make it difficult to fall asleep. Fifth, try ozonated bathing. Many of the toxins that build up in the body are fat soluble and gather in the fatty tissues. Immersing yourself in a bathtub of warm ozonated water for 30 minutes once daily for 2-3 weeks, will aid in their removal from your body. Ozone purifies the bathwater by killing living viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. It will also oxidize the water-insoluble toxins on the skin and in the bathwater, turning them into water-soluble toxins. Once water-soluble, they are easily flushed from the system. Here�s how to ozonate a bath. Purify the tap water by running it through a KDF solid charcoal showerhead filter as you fill the tub. This filter can remove up to 99% of the toxic substances found in tap water. Next, bubble ozone (O3, a form of oxygen) into the water using an ultraviolet ozone generator and an ozone-diffusing bath bubbler. Bubble the ozone for 15 minutes before you get into the tub and keep it going during your 30-minute soak. The bath bubbler converts the ozone that is accumulating in the air above the bubbling water back into oxygen so that it is not irritating to the lungs. Adding 1/2 cup of Body Soak Gold to your bathwater, and increasing this amount to 1 cup over 2-3 weeks, will usually produce a faster removal of toxins from the body than ozonated water alone. After you have used one full bottle of Body Soak Gold, you may gain additional detoxification benefit by switching to 1/4 cup of Liquid Needles Foot Soak added to the bathwater; over a period of several days, increase this amount to 1 cup for each 30-minute bath. Best results are obtained if both soaks are added to KDF charcoal-filtered water. Scrub your entire skin surface with a loofah sponge or natural fiber brush 3 times during the 30-minute soak. Sixth, I generally recommend the following, taken 30-40 minutes before your ozonated bath or 10-15 minutes after it: at least 400 IU of vitamin E; 25,000 IU of beta carotene and/or mixed carotenoids; 2000 mg vitamin C; and 100 mg of grape seed extract (pycnogenol). Seventh, I generally recommend 1 lozenge of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 100 mg of L-glutathione powder (an amino acid). Dissolve both substances under your tongue before each bath; this enables it to be absorbed faster and more completely. These nutrients will facilitate toxin removal from your system. SOD is an antioxidant enzyme that protects the system against free radical damage from chemicals or radiation. L-glutathione is a sulfur-containing peptide (made of amino acids, which are protein building blocks), an antioxidant essential to the body�s toxic waste disposal system. Do you have a long-term intestinal detoxification and disease prevention program? I often recommend a 5-month gentle detoxification program. Here, you are required to maintain a diet that is low in mucus-forming foods and to take herbs and fiber that help to break up the intestines� mucoid lining. This program, which takes about 3-5 months to clean out the intestines� false lining, is effective for people with allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, yeast and fungal overgrowth, parasites, severe liver or kidney disease, or for anyone seeking an improved state of health. PRELIMINARIES. Begin a low-mucus-forming diet (as described above) and practice dry skin brushing once daily for 3 months, then twice weekly afterwards. In collaboration with Health Restoration Systems, I have developed products that make it easy for people to do this program at home. HERBAL FIBER. Take an herbal fiber product as a bowel-bulking agent 2 times daily at first, building up to 3-4 times daily after a week. We developed the NatureSpring Friend-ly Flora and Fiber formula specifically for this purpose. This product may be taken daily for maintenance after the 3 to 5 month cleanse is finished. Along with this, I generally recommend an herbal product called NatureSpring Intestinal Cleanse at the rate of 1 capsule twice daily, building up gradually to 1-2 taken 3-4 times daily. The goal is to have 2-3 bowel movements per day. The herbs in the Cleanse�slippery elm, Cascara sagrada, papain, cay-enne, ginger�will help break down the mucoid lining of the intestines and stimulate the intestines to push toxic feces out. Of those who use the Cleanse, most should taper off after 4-5 weeks. MUCOID REMOVER. On the third day of the program, I generally recommend Nature-Spring Bowel, Blood and Body Cleansing Formula, starting with 1/2 to 1 tablet, 2 times daily then building gradually to 2 tablets taken 3-4 times daily. This formula has 30 ingredients that break down mucus, cleanse the blood, drain the lymphatics, and stabilize the function of various organ systems. Based on transient symptoms that you notice once you begin this program�release of toxins, increase in frequency and size of bowel movements�the user may adjust the dosage. Be sure to drink copious amounts of pure water (nonchlorinated and nonfluoridated but not distilled) while on this program.

Alternative medicine needs the support of the general public if the American people are to be given the right to choose their preferred form of treatment under any third party payment plan. Outlandish accusations, such as those contained in your book review, only serve to completely discredit all information contained in your magazine in the eyes of the general public. �FRANCES WOLFF, SAN DIEGO, CA Conspiracy Theory? Absolutely I received a copy of your magazine and was quite impressed by it. It�s about time I read material regarding health issues that doesn�t feel like a pack of lies....The FDA still after all these years does not allow folic acid to be sold in greater doses than 800 mcg. I am supposed to take from 50-150 mg daily! In order to get that amount, I would have to swallow a whole bottle of pills every day.... It seems odd to me that this harmless but essential nutrient must be ordered on prescription as if it were a dangerous drug. This may sound pessimistic but I believe that this was a preplanned strategy to create an epidemic of iatrogenic [doctor-caused] diseases. More and more Americans have no choice but to explore alternative solutions to health care. These days health is truly for the wealthy....Keep up the good work. �L.E.

The correspondent sent copies of this exchange along with the following letter to U.S. Congressional representatives. I have lost many near and dear ones to cancer....Their loss made me tremendously sad, angry, and frustrated. I�m one of those people who have no doubt that rising cancer rates are due primarily to ubiquitous environmental pollution, and secondarily, to the short- and long-term effects of conventional medicine. The enclosed communiqu�s deal with the issue of providing information to individuals diagnosed with cancer. I agree that the diagnosis is a source of trauma, and that virtually any and all information provided may be overwhelming to the individual. However, I do not believe the solution to this problem is to withhold information, but to provide resources to the individual to assist them in dealing with the information.

Lee, M.D., a leading women�s health expert and educator. ENDOMETRIOSIS. In this condition, the cells of the lining of the uterus (called endometrium) become established elsewhere, such as in the Fallopian tubes, uterine muscles, colon, bladder, and sides of the pelvic cavity. During menstruation, these displaced cells swell with blood and bleed, causing pain and inflammation. According to Dr. Lee, natural progesterone can stop the spread of endometrial cells by blocking the activity of estrogen which otherwise stimulates the growth of these aberrant cells. Dr. Lee suggests using natural progesterone cream from days 6 to 26 of the monthly cycle, stopping just before menstruation begins. After 4-6 months of this treatment, the monthly pains and bleeding due to endometriosis will usually subside, he says. OVARIAN CYSTS. Cysts result from a failed or disordered ovulation due to hormonal imbalances, says Dr. Lee. After the cyst forms, during the monthly surge of luteinizing hormone (LH, which promotes ovulation and the transformation of the follicle into the corpus luteum which produces progesterone), it swells and stretches the ovarian membrane, and can cause pain and bleeding. Natural progesterone, given before ovulation, can inhibit the levels of LH and in effect block ovulation as both ovaries �think� the other one has released an egg, says Dr. Lee. He recommends taking natural progesterone from day 10 to 26 of the cycle. Within 1-2 cycles, as the cyst is no longer stimulated, it will �very likely shrink and disappear without further treatment.� Dr. Lee prefers transdermal natural progesterone (which means it is �absorbed through the skin�) in cream or oil formulation, because it is absorbed more efficiently and the effect lasts longer, without the emotional highs and lows from oral drops. A woman addressing endometriosis or ovarian cysts will probably need to use anywhere from 1/8 to 1/2 teaspoon of cream per day or 3-10 drops of oil, says Dr. Lee. The cream may be applied to the palms, face, neck, upper chest, breast, inside of the arms, or behind the knees. The key criterion is the amount of progesterone (in milligrams) contained in a given natural progesterone product. Under healthy conditions, a premenopausal woman�s system produces about 20 mg daily of progesterone between days 15 and 26 of the cycle. While amounts in the range of 20-30 mg daily are often sufficient, relief from the primary symptoms will indicate a woman is taking the appropriate dosage. SOURCE�John R.

If surgery for breast cancer is medically unavoidable, choosing the time in a woman�s menstrual cycle for the operation can make a crucial difference in its success. A study of 289 premenopausal women undergoing mastectomy or lumpectomy revealed that those who had the surgery between days 18 and 20 of their cycle fared the best, with a 76% better survival rate (up to 18 years of follow-up) than women having surgery during days 3 to 12 of their cycle. The difference is progesterone. Its levels increase steadily as the menstrual cycle progresses, but especially after ovulation until about day 23. The desirable level of progesterone was placed at 4 nanograms/ml. Matching surgery to menstrual cycles doubles the survival rate for cancers involving the lymph nodes. SOURCE�P.E.

The use of fish oil supplements can produce a dramatic reduction in the number of flare-ups of Crohn�s disease (recurrent intestinal inflammation), according to researchers at the University of Bologna in Italy. Working with 78 patients classified as high risk for a Crohn�s relapse, the researchers gave them 500 mg of marine lipid concentrate fish oil containing 40% eicosapentaenoic acid and 20% docosahexaenoic acid, for a daily total of 2.7 g of these fatty acids. The capsules were specially coated so that they would not dissolve until they reached the patient�s small intestine and would not produce unpleasant side effects such as heartburn or belching. The study lasted one year. In the control group, which received a placebo, 69% had a relapse, but in the fish oil group, only 28% had a Crohn�s flare-up during the year. At the end of this year, 59% of those in the fish oil group were still in remission compared to only 26% in the control group.

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. Self-guided relaxation techniques can be a quick and effective way to lower the blood pressure in men and women, according to researchers at the National Taiwan University in Taiwan. High blood pressure (hypertension) is widespread there with 27% of men and 13% of women having readings of at least 140/90. Based on a study group of 590 individuals with high blood pressure, Taiwanese researchers found that practicing progressive relaxation techniques (from a taped cassette) coupled with home study of healthful practices led to an average drop of blood pressure to 130/85 after 2 months. No drugs or other treatments were involved other than the power of self-directed relaxation.

MIGRAINES. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) can reduce the number of migraine �attacks� by more than two-thirds, according to a study involving 49 individuals with recurrent migraines. They took 400 mg daily of vitamin B2 with breakfast for 3 months. At the end of this period, the number of migraine episodes was reduced by 67% and their severity was decreased by 68%. Once a migraine has started, intravenous magnesium can quickly reduce its intensity and pain. When 40 individuals with acute migraine symptoms received an intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate (1 g, given over 5 minutes), 35 experienced a 50% reduction in headache pain within 15 minutes. For 18 patients, the pain relief lasted for at least 24 hours. SOURCE�J.

GET ANXIETY RELIEF WITH AROMATHERAPY Chronic anxiety can contribute to many health problems, but aromatherapy has a quick and simple method for reducing it, according to aromatherapist Valerie Ann Worwood in her new guide, The Fragrant Mind. Aromatherapy works with the essential oils of plants, prepared in any of the following ways, says Worwood: blend with 1 ounce of base oil to make a massage oil; add to bath water; gently heat in a room diffuser; or inhale from a tissue. Tense Anxiety�Symptoms include bodily tension, muscle pains, aches, and a generalized soreness. Mix clary sage (10 drops), lavender (15 drops), and Roman chamomile (5 drops). Restless Anxiety�Here one feels dizzy, sweaty, overactive, with palpitations, the sense of a lump in the throat, frequent urination, diarrhea, or upset stomach. Worwood recommends vetiver (5 drops), juniper (10 drops), and cedarwood (15 drops). Apprehensive Anxie-ty�Symptoms generally include worrying, brooding, unease, a sense of foreboding, even paranoia. For relief of this emotional state, try mixing bergamot (15 drops), lavender (5 drops), and geranium (10 drops). Repressed Anxiety�This variant of anxiety involves feeling on edge, concentration difficulties, irritability, insomnia, or a sense of chronic exhaustion. Worwood advises a blend of neroli (10 drops), rose otto (10 drops), and bergamot (10 drops).

CHILDREN�S HEALTH Think Twice about Fluoride Toothpastes and Antidepressants Researchers at the University of Connecticut studied 460 children, aged 10-13, who had lived the first 8 years of their lives in a community that did not fluoridate public water supplies. Of the children who received fluoride supplements through toothpaste between ages 2-8, there was an 8 times higher incidence of enamel fluorosis after the second year. This condition indicates chronic fluoride poisoning and shows up as mottled, pitted teeth. More brushing with fluoride toothpaste at an early age only makes it worse. Children who started brushing their teeth twice daily at ages 1-2 had 4 times more fluorosis than children brushing once daily after age 2, according to the American Journal of Epidemiology (April 1996). The study strongly contradicts the popular notion that fluoride has health benefits for children. Regarding antidepressants, scientists reviewing the results of 5 clinical studies declared that tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine, desipramine, Prozac, Dista, and others, are little better than placebos at relieving childhood depression. They found that such medications brought relief in only 8%-45% of children while placebos (containing no active ingredients) actually helped more children, in the range of 17%-68%, according to Professional Psychology: Research and Practice (1996). LIFT DEPRESSION WITHOUT PROZAC An estimated 12 million people worldwide (6 million Americans) take Prozac for depression, resulting in annual sales of $2 billion for Eli Lilly and Company, Prozac�s maker. Why further enrich this drug company when safer, inexpensive alternatives exist to successfully elevate your mood? According to naturopathic physician and educator, Michael T. Murray, N.D., lifestyle, dietary, and psychological therapies can serve as natural antidepressants and keep you Prozac free. Lifestyle�First, make sure your depression does not have an organic, physiological cause, such as diabetes, cancer, or heavy metal toxicity, or is due to a food allergy or overuse of prescription drugs. Then know that it is highly beneficial to create a mental attitude that is positive and optimistic, says Dr. Murray. Set achievement goals, practice affirmations. Quit smoking, reduce or eliminate your intake of caffeine and alcohol, exercise regularly, practice a relaxation and stress reduction exercise every day for at least 10 minutes, and laugh more. Dietary�Nutrient imbalances or deficiencies can contribute to chronic depression, says Dr. Murray. �Correcting an underlying nutritional deficiency can restore normal mental function and relieve depression,� he adds. Among Dr. Murray�s recommendations: reduce your fat intake; eat at least 5 daily servings of fresh fruits and vegetables; minimize your consumption of refined sugars and salt; eat much more fiber and complex carbohydrates (whole grains); and keep your protein intake moderate. Supplements�Start correcting the nutritional foundations of your health with a daily high-potency multiple vitamin and mineral formula, says Dr. Murray. In addition, he suggests taking daily folic acid (800 mcg), vitamin B12 (800 mcg), vitamin B6 (50-100 mg), and flaxseed oil. Herbs�As an additional antidepressant support, Dr. Murray recommends using Ginkgo biloba. For people over 50, take 80 mg, 3 times daily, with additional folic acid (1200 mcg) and vitamin B12 (1200 mcg). For people under 50, take St. John�s wort extract, 300 mg, 3 times daily. Amino Acids�Deficiencies or imbalances in the body�s levels of amino acids, which are essential protein building blocks, can also contribute to depression. Dr. Murray suggests 2000 mg of D- or L-phenylalanine, or 1000 mg of L-tyrosine, taken once daily, before breakfast. Insomnia�Depression often brings a disruption of normal sleeping rhythms. Helpful here are melatonin (3 mg) before bedtime; valerian herbal extract (150-300 mg) taken 30 minutes before bedtime; or GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid, an amino acid derivative), taken at 200-400 mg 30 minutes before bedtime. �Adopting these guidelines is all that the majority of people with depression will need to do to elevate their mood,� says Dr. Murray.

NUTRITIONAL AID FOR MALE INFERTILITY Of the estimated 15% of U.S. couples who have problems conceiving, in about one-third of the cases, it is due to male infertility. In fact, approximately 6% of men aged 15-50 are believed to be infertile and, in 90% of cases, this is due to lowered sperm production, says naturopathic physician and educator Michael Pizzorno, N.D. In many cases, men are supplying �only about 40% of the number of sperm per ejaculation compared to 1940 levels,� he reports in Total Wellness. Causes�Jeans and underwear that are tight-fitting heat the scrotum and testes, thereby inhibiting sperm production. Environmental pollution from cigarette smoke, heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic), pesticides, solvents, toxic chemicals, aflatoxin (a fungus found on peanuts and grains), and synthetic estrogens in poultry and dairy feed all interfere with sperm formation and protection. In a study of 100 males, aflatoxin levels in infertile men were 60% higher than in fertile men. Dietary practices are also at fault, says Dr. Pizzorno. These include overconsumption of saturated fats, reduced intake of whole grains, fiber, and fresh vegetables and fruits, compounded with nutrient deficiencies. Chronic urinary or genital infections such as Chlamydia trachomati (a sexually transmitted disease) can impede fertility; research suggests that from 28% to 71% of infertile men have Chlamydia. Cool the Scrotum�The ideal temperature for the male scrotum and testes is between 94 and 96�. Higher temperatures can severely inhibit or even stop sperm production. Dr. Pizzorno recommends wearing loose-fitting clothing, avoiding hot tubs, and taking occasional cold showers, especially after exercise. Garlic�Clinical evidence shows that garlic can neutralize numerous toxins, including aflatoxin, which otherwise start damaging DNA, says Dr. Pizzorno. �The message is clear: If you want healthy sperm, then avoid toxins and eat garlic.� Dr. Pizzorno also recommends eating organically raised fruits and vegetables to minimize toxin intake. Vitamin C�Levels of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) are higher in sperm than in other bodily fluids, including the blood. Vitamin C deficiencies have been linked with reduced seminal fluid ascorbic acid content and increased DNA damage. A group of 30 infertile men taking 1000 mg of vitamin C experienced a 140% increase in sperm count after one week; those taking 200 mg daily registered a 112% increase. After 60 days, all 30 men had successfully impregnated their wives. Dr. Pizzorno recommends 1000 mg of vitamin C daily, divided into 3 doses. Zinc�This mineral is crucial to all aspects of male reproductive function including sperm formation and movement. In a study involving 22 men who had been infertile for 5 or more years, after taking zinc sulfate (60 mg of elemental zinc) daily for 45 days, their sperm count increased by 250%; testosterone levels also increased. Dr. Pizzorno suggests taking 25 mg of zinc picolinate daily. Vitamin B12�Deficiencies in this vitamin are linked with lowered sperm counts and reduced sperm vitality. When men with sperm counts of less than 20 million per ml (the healthy norm for 1940 was 113 million per ml) took vitamin B12 at a daily dosage of 1000 mcg, 27% experienced an increase in sperm production to over 100 million per ml. Dr. Pizzorno recommends 1000 mcg daily of vitamin B12. Antioxidants�Environmental toxins generate harmful free radicals which in turn damage sperm and lead to lowered sperm counts. According to 2 studies, high levels of free radicals have been noted in the semen of 40% of infertile men. Antioxidants are nutritional substances that counter the negative effects of free radicals. Among those suitable for male infertility, Dr. Pizzorno recommends daily maintenance doses of beta carotene (25 mg, as mixed carotenoids), selenium (125 mcg), and vitamin E (400 IU of mixed tocopherols) as being helpful in protecting sperm.

This event put him in the hospital where he received intravenous antibiotics, followed by oral antibiotics when he returned home. Before becoming sick, Matthew had been physically active and alert, but once home again, he was lethargic. His symptoms included shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, chronic coughing with greenish mucus, wheezing, night sweats, a chronic fever (as high as 104� F), chills, rapid heartbeat, indigestion, decreased appetite, and weight loss, among others. Chronic coughing, chronic lung infections, and excessive chloride in the sweat are classic symptoms of cystic fibrosis. The condition also usually involves mucus in enzyme-secreting ducts in the pancreas. Matthew's parents took him to acupuncturist Gary F. Fleischman, D.P.M., director of the Acupuncture Health Services of New Haven, in Connecticut. Dr. Fleischman used acupuncture to treat points (corresponding to Matthew's lung, liver, kidneys, spleen, and stomach) on 4 consecutive days, then twice weekly for 7 weeks for a total of 18 treatments. In addition, Dr. Fleischman prescribed 2 Chinese herbs: in the second week of therapy, Pinellia, to remove phlegm and reduce the cough; in the fifth week, Tremella (silver ear), to help moisten the lungs. Matthew took one tablet of each herb, 3 times daily. He continued to take ibuprofen, a conventional drug, to reduce his high fever. Over the course of 8 weeks, Matthew experienced positive changes. Within the first 20 days, a pulmonary CT scan showed that his lungs were now clear of mucus and abscesses. After 10 weeks, his fevers subsided and his ibuprofen dosage was reduced. His coughing and wheezing disappeared, his breathing improved, and he was capable of more physical activity. Matthew remained on a dose of Tremella and Pinellia, taking 2 tablets of each, twice daily. After one year, Matthew's mother assessed the results: "Acupuncture and Chinese herbs cleared out the mucus and gave him a burst of energy." Matthew's mental and physical development was on a par again with that of his peers, and he was enjoying skiing, rollerblading, and baseball. The case results show that acupuncture and herbs can provide "significant relief" for cystic fibrosis patients, says Dr. Fleischman. In Matthew's case, this approach left him symptom free.

ENVIRONMENTAL ILLNESS When Marilyn, aged 42, consulted Helen Thomas, D.C., a chiropractor practicing in Santa Rosa, California, she had been enduring the serious symptoms of environmental illness for 5 years. She had been nauseous every day since she had given birth to her child 5 years before. Also, Marilyn had developed toxemia during her pregnancy and, 2 days before delivery, had slipped into a coma and almost died. After the birth, she developed chronic fatigue, her hands and feet remained swollen, the nausea continued, and she experienced severe dizziness and headaches. Marilyn's conventional physicians kept her on numerous medications in an attempt to reduce these symptoms. As Dr. Thomas' speciality is allergy testing and elimination, she found that Marilyn tested allergically sensitive to 40 different items. The list of substances producing an allergic reaction in her was formidable, including all egg and chicken products, calcium, milk protein, all fruits and vegetables containing vitamin C and B-complex, all sugars, iron, vitamin A, fish, most minerals, salt, wheat gluten, and corn. In addition, Marilyn was allergic to most of the key brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters. According to Dr. Thomas, Marilyn had major imbalances in her nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, such that her stress mechanism (her system's ability to tolerate the stress of allergic reactions to food and from her environment) was incapacitated. Dr. Thomas used a special allergy desensitization approach called NAET (Nambudripad Allergy Elimination Technique) to remove Marilyn's multiple sensitivities. Progress was unmistakable and steady after this. In about 3 weeks, the nausea began to recede; then within 2 months, the headaches lessened and her energy levels started to pick up considerably. About 5 months after the NAET treatments, Marilyn was able to wash every window in her house, clean all the rooms, and host a dinner party. In a subsequent letter to Dr. Thomas, Marilyn wrote: "I feel well and truly cared for, eased and comforted. Your treatments allowed my body to remember how well it could be."

FATIGUE For Gary, aged 34, his problems began with a sudden dizzy spell while driving his car. Everything around him seemed to spin for 5 seconds. The incident repeated itself 6 more times in the next month. A consultation with a physician, eye doctor, and neurologist resulted in a diagnosis of nasal polyps (benign nodules on the inner mucous membrane of the nose). Nothing further happened for another month, but then Gary had another dizzy spell and was unable to think straight; he felt in a state of "total confusion." His health history indicated that he had always had trouble breathing; he also had bad breath and a snoring problem. Gary underwent surgery to have the polyps removed, and for another 3 weeks felt reasonably well. A year later, the dizziness and dazed feelings had returned. In addition, Gary was fatigued, his head felt "foggy," he had dark rings around his eyes, his face was swelling, and he regarded his physical condition as only about 20% of normal. He started receiving twice-weekly allergy shots, but reached the point of having to take a leave of absence from work. After he had seen 8 physicians and undergone numerous tests, "the doctors ran out of ideas and really didn't seem to care," Gary comments. One physician lamely recommended he go on Prozac for depression. While undergoing some dental work, it occurred to Gary that his teeth might have something to do with his problems. He asked his dentist to order a heavy metals test to see if any of the mercury from his dental fillings had leaked into his body. The test indicated it had: his urine registered mercury at 4.8 compared to an "acceptable" level of 2.0. Gary consulted Marika von Viczay, N.D., Ph.D., a naturopathic physician based in Asheville, North Carolina, who specializes in clearing the lymph system as a way of treating illness. Dr. von Viczay said the reason Gary's face was swollen was that excess toxic waste in his facial lymph nodes had backed up and actually solidified. The primary lymph drainage sites in the neck and collarbone area, by which lymph enters the bloodstream, were completely closed off. Gary's neck and chest also showed signs of swelling, which indicated that the lymph was similarly blocked in that region, explained Dr. von Viczay. To relieve the lymph blockages, Dr. von Viczay used a Lymph-Pho Laser�, a device she invented as part of her treatment protocol, Electro-Lymphatic� therapy. The idea is that electrically charged light, when applied carefully to the area around the lymph nodes, can gently dissolve lymph blockages. Dr. von Viczay followed this up with gentle massage to further encourage Gary's system to drain the lymph nodes. "I watched as my chest, which I had thought was in good shape because it was so round and full, went from a rounded mound to a flat surface," says Gary.Gary made steady progress from this point forward. During the next several months, he had all 14 of his mercury amalgam fillings and a nickle-plated crown, replaced. As each quadrant of his mouth had the mercury fillings removed, Gary felt a 15% increase in his energy. Dr. von Viczay continued with the Electro-Lymphatic therapy treatments to keep the lymph system draining the toxins (residual mercury) from his body. Finally, Gary had a root canal redone to remove the toxic metals involved. During the intensive phase of Dr. von Viczay's treatment, Gary had twice-weekly sessions; later, he saw her once every 6 weeks."I am now back to about 85-90%," says Gary. "I feel that if I had listened to the M.D.s, I would be doped up on Prozac now and maybe even be in a mental ward. Dr. von Viczay was able to find the cause of my problem�too much toxic waste in my system, mostly from my mercury amalgams�and work on that cause, not just treat the symptoms as so many doctors do."

KIDNEY PAIN At 54, Jonathan suffered from acute kidney pain that occasionally required hospitalization. He also had to urinate frequently. Jonathan had lived with these problems for 10 years when he consulted Patrick J. McNally, D.C., a chiropractor specializing in reflexology at the Elden Street Back & Neck Pain Center in Herndon, Virginia. Reflexology involves gentle massage and manipulation of specific points on the hands and soles of the feet as a way of influencing conditions inside the body. Dr. McNally found the kidney region on Jonathan's feet to be "extremely tender," such that Jonathan could barely tolerate normal pressure which Dr. McNally applied with his fingertips. The first night after treatment, however, Jonathan unaccustomedly wet his bed. "The reflexology had relaxed the structures of his kidneys and bladder leading to this release," explains Dr. McNally. "The basic principle of reflexology is that it produces relaxation by removing energy blockages and increasing blood flow to the particular area, helping the healing process." Jonathan received weekly reflexology treatments for about 2 months. Each session lasted an hour in which Dr. McNally focused on the kidney points on Jonathan's soles for about 10 minutes. At this point, Jonathan reported that his kidney pain had significantly diminished and that his frequent urination had also decreased. Ten years later, when Dr. McNally checked with him again, Jonathan still had no kidney problems. SOURCE�Patient records of Patrick J.

PNEUMONIA Kimberly, aged 43, had undergone a 7-week bout of pneumonia 9 months before consulting acupuncturist Ira J. Golchehreh, L.Ac., O.M.D. When the acute phase of the pneumonia lifted, she had 7 months of chronic headaches, neck and back aches, eye pain, constant dizziness, distorted vision, visual floaters, facial numbness, and the subjective feelings of being stuck, worried while driving, and "not feeling myself." Kimberly had consulted various physicians, including an optometrist, opthalmologist, internist, neurologist, and physical therapist, but had no permanent relief from them. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed no organic problems. Kimberly was taking Advil, Excedrin, Tylenol, and Aleve for her pain, but nothing helped. At the time she consulted Dr. Golchehreh, Kimberly was unable to continue her job as a schoolteacher. Conventional doctors were unable to "figure out exactly how this imbalanced pattern came to be, with all its residual pneumonia symptoms," says Dr. Golchehreh. After giving her an acupuncture treatment, Dr. Golchehreh prescribed an herbal laxative containing senna leaves, Cascara sagrada bark, rhubarb, anise seed, and licorice powder. Within one week of taking them, all her symptoms were gone, except the visual floaters. According to Dr. Golchehreh, the pneumonia virus had affected Kimberly's liver, creating a functional imbalance that prevented liver energy from moving upwards into the head through the energy channels known in acupuncture as meridians. Dr. Golchehreh placed about 55 acupuncture needles at points on the front of Kimberly's body to enable energy to move through the liver, abdomen, chest, and neck, into the head. Technically, he treated meridians corresponding to the spleen, stomach, liver, and gallbladder. The herbal laxative helped her liver remove toxins and got her bowels moving more frequently. At the time Dr. Golchehreh treated Kimberly, her pneumonia was more a problem with her liver and intestines than lungs, as the virus had settled deeper into her system. "The next time she came in, Kimberly had a big, beautiful smile. One treatment had completely changed the life of this woman." SOURCE� Patient records of Ira J.

PROSTATE CANCER When Philip, aged 60, arrived at the Schachter Center for Complementary Medicine in Suffern, New York, he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. It was in the form of a small nodule in the right lobe of his prostate gland. His PSA reading (prostate specific antigen, an indicator of prostate tumor activity) was a moderate 7.0, yet Philip's urologist recommended a radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate). When he went for a second opinion, external beam radiation therapy was recommended. However, Philip was reluctant to undergo either and consulted Michael Schachter, M.D., for a nutritional program. In taking Philip's case history, Dr. Schachter learned that Philip's diet was "extremely poor" and that he was under considerable stress due to a difficult financial situation. When Philip decided to solely follow Dr. Schach-ter's alternative cancer treatment program, his urologist wrote him a strong letter criticizing his decision. Dr. Schachter recommended major dietary changes for Philip. He was to avoid alcohol, white sugar, white flour, caffeine, artificial sweeteners, preservatives and other food additives, pesticides, fluoridated or chlorinated water, hydrogenated fats (i.e., margarine), aluminum cookware, and aluminum in general. Philip was to adopt a low-fat, high-fiber, high-complex-carbohydrate diet centered around whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and modest amounts of nuts, seeds, fish, and organically raised chicken. If tolerated, he was to consume approximately 50% of his diet as raw food, mainly in the form of fresh raw vegetable juices. Then Dr. Schachter prescribed an intensive program of nutrients provided orally and by retention enema. These included, on a daily basis: vitamin C (9 g); beta carotene (50,000 IU); shark cartilage (3 tablespoons, rectally); laetrile (amygdalin, 1500 mg); sodium selenite (750 mcg); flaxseed oil (1 tablespoon); Vitae Elixxir (an herbal blend, 12-18 drops); cod liver oil (1 tablespoon); maitake mushrooms (9 tablets); FlorEssence (Essiac, an herbal tea, 4 ounces); coenzyme Q10 (400 mg); pycnogenol (an antioxidant from grape seed or pine bark, 150 mg); apricot kernels (15); hydrazine sulfate (a synthetic chemical of proven clinical benefit for cancer, 60 mg); a multiple vitamin and mineral formula; and a rectal retention enema of a multiple enzyme formula. The nutrient program was not introduced all at once but in stages over a period of several months, says Dr. Schachter. Within 1-2 months of starting the program, Philip's energy improved and he reported feeling "very well," says Dr. Schachter. "His prostate symptoms were mild but did include occasional bed-wetting�about once a month." But soon this symptom disappeared.

Similarly, the benefits of aromatherapy�the inhalation of the vapors of essential plant oils�are widely recognized among alternative practitioners. Now Variel Health International has combined both modalities in the form of the aromaSpa� aromatic steam capsule suitable for home use as a portable health spa. The unit stands 5�6�, weighs about 68 pounds, may be easily disassembled, and plugs into any standard 115- volt socket. Its walls and sliding door are made of transparent polycarbonate used for airplane windows. The steam generator and aroma diffuser are located on the floor of the unit. Any of at least 250 aromatherapy oils may be used, singly or in combination, to support muscle relaxation, detoxification, and immune system stimulation, or for eliminating fatigue, lifting mood, revitalizing skin, or general rejuvenation. Other self-care benefits include general mind and body relaxation, stress reduction, energizing, emotional cleansing, and �customized personal pampering,� depending on the aromatherapy formula used, says Variel�s Cathy Dammann. In the self-contained aromatherapy and steam heat diffuser, soothing mists carrying aromatic molecules envelop the entire body surface for maximum absorption and benefit. The aromaSpa uses one quart of distilled water (preferable to chlorinated and fluoridated tap water) for a 40-minute steam heat session and can reach inside temperatures of 115�-120�F within about 10 minutes. These temperatures are necessary as hyperthermia provides its benefits by temporarily raising the body temperature to between 101� and 103�F and inducing perspiration. Clinical information suggests that steam heat may have therapeutic advantages over the dry heat associated with most saunas, says Dammann. The aromaSpa was tested in 1994 by Jerry Schindler, Ph.D., director of the Sports Health Science Human Performance Lab at Life College School of Chiropractic in Marietta, Georgia. Dr. Schindler reported that the unit was effective in decreasing the risk of everyday and athletic injuries, primarily by increasing muscle flexibility, blood flow, and oxygen delivery to the muscles. Dr. Schindler demonstrated these benefits by way of thermographic studies (which register nerve sense pathways) comparing the left and right sides of a test subject�s body. Individuals whose thermographic readings are asymmetrical (indicating imbalances and sensory interference) are prone to injury, says Dr. Schindler. Symmetrical patterns were achieved after 30 minutes in the aromaSpa. According to Dam-mann, aroma steam therapy can also reduce lactic acid buildup in muscles following exercise, thereby preventing soreness. The approach may be effective in reducing cellulite (lumpy fat areas in the skin), especially when used with rosemary, sandalwood, juniper, geranium, or lemon essential oils. These can produce detoxifying and water-draining effects in only 10 minutes compared to standard hot body wraps, which require 60 minutes, says Dammann. Steam heat therapy may increase blood circulation and heighten immune response by stimulating white blood cell production, Dammann says. The aromaSpa is now being used experimentally by patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, she reports. According to Zand Gard, M.D., �the only detoxification program that has proven successful in removing fat-stored toxins from the body is hyperthermia.� The use of the essential oils of clove, cinnamon, melissa, or lavender have been clinically shown to benefit bronchial conditions as effectively as antibiotics, especially when delivered by steam heat, Dammann says. MAKING CANCER TREATMENT RATIONAL Lab Test Accurately Predicts Outcomes Conventional cancer treatment routinely administers powerful and toxic chemotherapy drugs to cancer patients based on statistical probabilities that these drugs will have some effect. Yet, often patients find out that particular cancer drugs are ineffective for them only after taking them and enduring their toxic side effects. A new lab test takes the blind flying out of conventional and alternative cancer treatments. It�s called the �Ex Vivo Apoptotic Assay� and was developed by Robert A. Nagourney, M.D. Dr. Nagourney, a board-certified oncologist, hematologist, and pharmacology professor, is founder and medical director of Rational Therapeutics of Long Beach, California, which provides the test. Apoptosis (pronounced ap-op-TOW-sis) is a clinical term that means �programmed cell death.� The test is a short-term measure of the ability of a substance to produce cancer cell death. �Our role is to inject some logic and sense into a rather hectic and haphazard administration of therapies,� says Dr. Nagourney. �We call our approach �rational therapeutics� because we think it�s a very intelligent way to deal with cancer.� Let�s say your physician tells you that the use of adriamycin (a chemotherapy drug) induces remissions in 38% of women with breast cancer. How can you tell in advance if you�re part of the 38% for whom it works or the 62% for whom it has no effect? �We can now determine things in a test tube painlessly for a patient that they would only be able to find out if they went through the treatments,� Dr. Nagourney says. Based on their cumulative results, Dr. Nagourney�s team has compiled a bell-shaped data curve that shows the range of sensitivity and resistance to different drugs among individuals with the same kinds of cancer. From this he can predict that out of 100 women with breast cancer, perhaps 35 will have cancer cell death taking 0.15 mcg/ml of doxorubicin, while 25 will require only 0.05 mcg/ml, and still others will need 1.0 mcg/ml. The test evaluates the likely effect on human cancer tissue from any of about 70 chemotherapy drugs, given singly or in combination. It can also test botanical substances such as betulinic acid (from white birch bark), Alvium (a 12-herb formula), antineoplastons, interferons, or, theoretically, any substance capable of killing cancer cells. All that�s required is a living tissue sample of cancer cells obtained by biopsy (or blood sample, in the case of leukemia) from the patient. The goal is to see which substances produce cancer cell death during a 72 to 96 hour process in which the cancer is grown in a test tube. The result objectively indicates the likely human response of an individual patient to a specific drug, says Dr. Nagourney. On this basis, the physician may then tailor a customized treatment plan with a fair measure of assurance that it will be effective. On the average, Dr. Nagourney says, a patient who is found �sensitive� (responsive) to an identified drug or substance is 2-3 times more likely to respond favorably when that drug is given clinically. This also means that the test can produce 2-3 times better outcomes in patients than the national averages reported by the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Nagourney notes. Generally, the assay�s ability to predict outcomes was scored at 19 out of 21 in a test published in the Journal of Hematology and Blood Transfusion in 1990, while between 85% and 95% of specimens submitted provide successful studies. For example, a man with colon cancer was tested for sensitivity to 16 chemotherapy drugs. The results indicated his system was �resistant� (unresponsive) to 6 drugs, including carmustin, nitrogen mustard, and taxol, and that he had an �extreme drug resistance� to doxorubicin, �with a near-zero response probability to that agent.� The assay also indicated the Ex Vivo Best Regimen; in this case, a combination of 2 drugs whose effects would be strengthened for this individual when applied together. While Rational Therapeutics does not prescribe medicines for cancer as a complement to the test results, clinicians will suggest �a carefully developed antioxidant and nutrition program designed to aid in the patient�s recovery and minimize the toxic side effects of chemotherapy treatments,� says Dr. Nagourney. It�s a holistic approach in that �we make a global or �whole person� assessment of each patient,� so that treatment can be objectively individualized. In this way, says Dr. Nagourney, the field of cancer treatment can be �advanced by studying the most rational and reliable indicators of positive cancer response: each patient�s own cancer cells.� KYOLIC GARLIC EXTRACT EFFECTIVE FOR CANCER Long appreciated as a folk remedy believed to benefit the immune system and to help ward off colds, garlic�s proven ability to work as a cancer inhibitor and as a valuable adjunct to alternative cancer therapy is now highlighted by cumulative scientific research. Much of this progressive research began in the 1950s in Japan, a country known for its medicinal use of garlic. In 1954, a German researcher joined forces with Japan�s garlic expert, Manji Wakunaga. Together they established a method of growing by organic means in the virgin woodlands of Hokkai-do, Japan, a high potency garlic, free of pesticides, chemical seed treatment, and inorganic fertilizers. Wakunaga then perfected a 20-month cold-aging process by which garlic�s offensive odor was naturally removed and the herb�s healing properties strengthened. The result is Kyolic� Aged Garlic Extract�, for which Wakunaga received a special industry award from the Japanese government in 1991. The product is now widely available in liquid, tablet, or capsule form. Why take a garlic pill when you can eat fresh raw garlic? Evidence suggests that the cold-aging process may actually enhance garlic�s medicinal qualities, rendering it more suitable than the raw form. Specifically, the aging process removes garlic�s harsh, irritating, and toxic compounds and its strong odor; it also converts certain components (such as alliin and allicin) into valuable, safe, and stable compounds (such as thioallyl). �These compounds represent the activated, predigested, readily bioavailable, and effective forms of garlic�s active principles,� says Brenda Lynn Petesch, Wakunaga�s research and development nutritionist. Data supporting garlic�s medicinal claims comes from human, animal, and cell studies, says Petesch. Studies of eating habits in China and Italy, where garlic consumption is high, established that the risk of stomach cancer declined by about 50% among those people with a high raw garlic intake. Residents of Cangshan County in China regularly ate 20 g of garlic daily and enjoyed the lowest death rate due to stomach cancer in China, while residents in Qixia County, where garlic consumption was minimal, had a death rate from stomach cancer that was 13 times higher. Animal studies have shown that aged garlic extract appears to stop the growth of cancers of the breast, bladder, skin, and colon, and the initial development of malignant tumors of the esophagus, stomach, and lungs. One study involving mice who received 20 once-weekly injections of diallyl sulfide (a garlic constituent) showed that this supplementation reduced the frequency of colon and rectal cancer by 74%. Research involving human cell cultures in test tubes indicates that garlic may inhibit the proliferation of breast, skin, and nerve cancer cells. A study at the National Medical Center Hospital in Japan showed that the garlic extract (with added vitamins B1 and B12 and liver extract) produced a �moderately effective� response in 70% of patients. Garlic helped reduce anorexia and fatigue and the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy for patients with head and neck tumors; it reduced the toxic effect on the heart of a cancer drug called doxorubicin; and according to researcher Dr. Minoru Toriyama, it enhanced �the patient�s will to fight against his disease.� According to Petesch, Kyolic Aged Garlic Extract may produce these anticancer benefits by speeding up the excretion of chemical carcinogens from the cells, by protecting DNA from carcinogenic damage, by enhancing the activity of enzymes that detoxify poisons, and by boosting the vitality of the immune system. Garlic protects DNA by blocking the toxic effects of aflatoxin, a fungus found on peanuts and grains that would otherwise help precipitate harmful genetic mutations. Other proven health benefits attributable to Kyolic, says Petesch, summarizing Wakunaga�s research results, include an ability to promote energy, protect against free radicals in the blood, detoxify and protect the liver, minimize immune suppression as a result of radiation, curtail the growth of the yeast Candida albicans, reduce the secretion of stress hormones, increase levels of beneficial intestinal bacteria, and protect the heart by inhibiting inappropriate blood clotting. HOMEOPATHIC HERBS FOR CANCER & FATIGUE Argentina�s HANSI Gets Remissions The name HANSI refers to a series of homeopathically prepared herbs that have been proven effective in the treatment of cancer and chronic fatigue. The product was developed by Argentinian biologist Juan Jose Hirschmann who named it after his childhood nickname Hansi, which is German for �little John.� But the name also refers to Homeopathic Activator of the Natural Immune System, which concisely describes the product. When Hirschmann first introduced HANSI in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 1990, so great was the demand for this alternative cancer formula that even with 40 physicians on staff, his clinic reached operating capacity in its first week, registering, at peak time, 1200 patients a day. Since then, says David C. Christner, managing director of Hansi International, Ltd., in Sarasota, Florida, an estimated 100,000 cancer patients have used HANSI with good results, indicated most notably in dramatic increases in levels and activity of natural killer cells, central to the immune response to cancer. �A large amount of evidence is leading to the conclusion that HANSI is a powerful enhancer of the human system,� Christner says. The basic product starts with about 10 components, then is adjusted acording to whether it will be delivered orally or by injection and whether it is to address cancer, chronic fatigue, AIDS, asthma, or other conditions, Christner says. For example, the basic HANSI contains low potency homeopathic dilutions (4X to 11X) of mostly rain forest and desert plants such as Cacti grandiflora (cactus), aloe, arnica, lachesis, licopodium, and others, in a 2-8% alcohol base tincture. HANSI formula variations include these plus Colocinthis, Pulmonaria reticulosa, Berberis vulgaris, and silica. Hirschmann and Christner emphasize their company�s commitment to performing the �hard science� to provide physicians with �incontrovertible evidence� that HANSI gets results. In a landmark study in 1992 involving 87 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (which is usually fatal within 3-6 months and presents a cure rate of 1%), 60 of the patients taking HANSI daily remained alive one year after the study began. Two years later, more than 50% of the patients were still alive and well, says study director, Cesar Bertacchini, M.D., of the Instituto de Medicina Integracion in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Further, appetite remained stable in 57% of the cases and increased in 7%, 73% had no pain or only mild pain, 56% reported no nausea or vomiting, and 36% experienced a reduction in these symptoms. HANSI was able to stop weight loss (which is typical of advanced cancer) for 34%, and 11% gained some weight. Patients receiving HANSI did not have chemotherapy or radiation during this treatment. In addition, several studies have shown conclusively that HANSI has no toxicity or secondary effects, said Dr. Bertacchini. Subsequent studies indicate that HANSI produces a greater tolerance for radiation and chemotherapy, both subjectively and in terms of the return of a patient�s blood to �normal� or pretreatment status. Early results from a 1995 study at the Goodwin Institute for Cancer Research in Plantation, Florida, involving breast cancer in mice demonstrated that HANSI treatment produced a 40% decrease in tumor size in 30 days. Hansi International is presently engaged in several key research projects in conjunction with the University of California at Irvine, College of Medicine, where HANSI�s efficacy in treating chronic fatigue syndrome will be evaluated. Chief researcher, Darryl M. See, M.D., comments: �Over the past two years I have been involved in screening various herbs and homeopathic preparations for in vitro immune-stimulating effects. Among the 200 or so I have tested, HANSI proved to be among the most effective in increasing natural killer cell function.� Natural killer cells are key cancer-fighters in the immune system. Christner says that HANSI, for injection or intravenous infusion, is available to people in the U.S. in accordance with the FDA�s �Personal Use Exemption� which permits importation by individuals of a 3-month supply. On the other hand, HANSI oral formulas (Rejuvenator Formula �J� and �H� for chronic fatigue, arthritis, or immune boosting) are, technically, available to anyone as over-the-counter remedies, without restrictions, says Christner. However, oral HANSI is absorbed more slowly and dissipates faster than the injected form. At present, HANSI in all applications is fully legal in Mexico, the Bahamas, Argentina, and Hungary.

These four categories represent, on average, 64% of a natural retailer�s sales. Among vitamins, multiple vitamin and mineral formulas represent 30% of sales, single vitamins 20%, led by vitamin C (33%), followed by vitamin E (20%), and B complex (18%), reports Whole Foods. Among the most promising of new supplements expected to soar in sales were melatonin, antioxidants, shark cartilage, and green foods. Pycnogenol, cat�s claw, and glucosamine sulfate, tied with vitamin E. Product categories that showed the most sales growth in 1995 over 1994 included homeopathic remedies (85%), specialty supplements and herbs (44%), single vitamins (28%), sports nutrition formulas (25%), and single minerals (19%). Speciality supplements include antioxidants, stress formulas, weight-loss aids, green concentrates (e.g., spirulina, chlorella, wheat grass), and probiotics (�friendly� bacteria for the intestines).

U.S. Cardiologists Displeased American cardiologists hold �highly negative attitudes� toward the FDA and its regulatory policies, according to a poll of 216 cardiologists and cardiac surgeons conducted in 1996 by the Competitive Enterprise Institute of Washington, D.C. About 94% of the cardiologists were men and 56% have been practicing for more than 15 years. In the survey, a majority (57%) said that FDA�s long approval process for new drugs results in patient deaths, 46% contend FDA regulations prevent physicians from using promising new drugs or medical devices, and 65% believe the FDA acts too slowly in approving new drugs. Of considerable interest is the opinion of 63% of cardiologists that the general public does not understand the �human cost� in suffering and lost lives caused by FDA regulations. According to 60% of cardiologists polled, the FDA�s policy of limiting information about off-label, �unapproved� uses for drugs and devices, makes it more difficult for them to learn about them. When asked if the FDA�s approval process has hurt their ability to treat patients with the �best possible care,� 71% said yes. Finally, 53% favor FDA reform so that unapproved drugs can be used by physicians, and 47% said the most important criterion informing their decision to use an unapproved substance would be persuasive published research; only 25% said FDA approval or product use in other countries would be good enough. �Something is wrong when an agency charged with protecting public health is viewed this negatively by physicians fighting for their patients� lives,� said Sam Kazman for the Institute.

THE FINANCIAL POLITICS OF MAMMOGRAMS The Results Don�t Support the Expense Current research within conventional medicine itself provides 4 strong reasons why the unquestioned popularity and use of mammogram screening for detection of breast cancer ought to be reconsidered. First, mammograms are costly (from $50-$200) and have a low accuracy rate for early detection of breast cancer, according to The Lancet (July 1995). The article states that breast cancer screening via mammography for women under 50 years old is inappropriate, and goes on to say that, in general, �The benefit is marginal, the harm caused is substantial, and the costs incurred are enormous, [so] we suggest that public funding for breast cancer screening in any age group is not justifiable.� Second, since mammographic screening was introduced in 1983, the incidence of a form of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which represents 12% of all breast cancer cases, has increased by 328%, and 200% of this increase is due to the use of mammography. For women under 50, the increase in DCIS diagnoses rose 4000% during this same period. About 97% of women with DCIS are treated with surgery or radiation despite the fact that physicians do not know whether either treatment actually extends lives at all, according to The Journal of the American Medical Association (March 27, 1996). Physicians conducting the study admitted there is an urgent need to reevaluate the appropriateness of these treatment options. Third, mammography�s false-positives waste money. A Swedish study of 60,000 women, aged 40-64, who were screened for breast cancer revealed that of the 726 actually referred to oncologists for treatment, 70% were found to be cancer free. For women under 50, the number of false positives for breast cancer was 86% of those referred for more testing. In addition to the needless anxiety produced, the clinical follow-up for false positives accounted for almost 33% of the total cost of the entire screening program, according to the British Medical Journal (February 1996). Fourth, estrogen therapy confuses mammogram results. According to a study of 8,800 postmenopausal women, aged 50 and older, the use of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) leads to a 71% increased likelihood of receiving a false-positive result on mammogram screening, according to Mary B. Laya, M.D., M.P.H., study leader at the University of Washington at Seattle, who published the results in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in 1996. Dr. Laya also found that women on ERT were more likely to get false-negative readings. In summary, faulty mammogram results endanger health, exact a heavy emotional toll, and can lead to expensive and unnecesssary tests. LETTING THE REAL PROS HANDLE HEALTH CARE Medical Racketeering Gets Organized Many critics of the conventional medical establishment in the U.S. have likened it to organized crime and racketeering for the way huge profits are skimmed off at taxpayers� expense, but now evidence has emerged in New Jersey indicating the Mafia is actually in on the profits of America�s $1 trillion healthcare honeypot. According to Peter G. Verniero, New Jersey Attorney General, authorities �smashed a ring� of at least 12 individuals with known Mafia family connections. The ring was involved in siphoning off money and filing fraudulent medical claims in union-sponsored healthcare plans covering one million patients. The company in question was Tri-Con Associates which arranged and managed medical, dental, and optical group plans for employers and unions. �We hope it�s not a national trend, but we cannot dismiss that possibility,� Verniero commented. His investigators stated that the U.S. healthcare industry is �a potential treasure trove for mobsters� to use personal information from insurance programs to blackmail and extort patients and providers. Somehow Mob involvment in U.S. healthcare seems in keeping with the prevailing spirit of the conventional medical establishment. SOURCE� Selwyn Raab, �New Jersey Officials Say Mafia Infiltrated Health-Care Industry,� The New York Times, August 21, 1996. THE DRUGS AND TESTS MAY NOT BE NEEDED But the Profits Are Hard to Resist ANTIBIOTICS. Antibiotics are never warranted in cases of acute bronchitis, according to doctors in The Lancet (March 1995). Seven double-blind trials show no major clinical benefit to taking antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis, yet 50-70% of patients with this condition are still being given antibiotics, as doctors continue to prescribe them at an �alarming� rate. Further, a study of 1439 Medicaid patients who consulted doctors for colds revealed that 60% received prescriptions for antibiotics even though only 2% actually had secondary acute sinusitis or ear infection that would indicate the need for such drugs. Otherwise, antibiotics for colds (or acute nasopharyngitis) are considered ineffective, reports The Journal of Family Practice (1996). This use of ineffective antibiotics adds an estimated $37.5 million to the annual cost of U.S. health care and it might contribute to the proliferation of drug-resistant bacteria, the researchers said. LASER SURGERY. Since the introduction of laparoscopic (laser) surgery, the number of gallbladder operations on people 65 years and older has increased by 22%, despite the fact that 67% of these surgical patients suffered only from uncomplicated gallstone disease, which does not normally require surgery, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association, May 1995. At the same time, malpractice suits for bile duct injuries during gallbladder removal have risen by 500% since the introduction of laparoscopic surgery. HEART TESTS. Researchers at the Maine Medical Center found that the number of bypass surgeries and angioplasties performed in a region of the U.S. depends entirely upon the amount of diagnostic testing of patients, but not necessarily upon actual medical need, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (April 17, 1996). The researchers estimated that 80% of all heart testing procedures are inappropriate and that 50% of all bypass operations in the U.S. are unnecessary. The total 1993 cost for Medicare billings for diagnosis and treatment of heart disease was $1 billion. LETTING AIR OUT OF THE MEDICAL BLOAT Earnings Drop for Physicians A small decline in the earnings of conventional physicians in 1995 may indicate larger changes to come in the financial bloat known as U.S. health care. According to a poll of 4,000 physicians, the average physician�s income dropped by 4% in 1995 from 1994, and for the specialist (surgeon, psychiatrist, gynecologist), the drop was 5.3%. The decline would seem paltry except for the facts that it is the first income reduction since 1982 and that, for the last 12 years, physicians� incomes have risen 6% yearly. The reversal is due mostly to the rapid growth of managed-care insurance plans and their tendency to squeeze out excessive spending, said researchers in Health Affairs (September 1996), the journal that published the report. It may finally indicate that some of the bloat is being let out of U.S. health care. DON�T EXPECT THE MEDICAL TRUTH ON ER According to a recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine, television�s portrayal of emergency allopathic medicine may glamorize the treatments at the sacrifice of accuracy. The researchers analyzed 97 episodes of ER, Chicago Hope, and Rescue 911, highly popular television shows that constantly portray heroic chest thumping and last-minute cardiac resuscitations of dying patients by presumably skilled doctors and nurses; ER alone has an estimated 35 million viewers. However, the researchers found that at least 60 of these episodes that presented �seemingly authentic detail� actually quite misrepresented emergency room realities. On TV, only 17% of those receiving CPR are elderly, yet in �real life,� the majority of cases are old people; on TV, about 75% of cases requiring CPR derived from accidents, in real life 75%-95% are caused by underlying heart disease; and while 66% of CPR patients on TV survive, the reality is more like 7%-15%. The �real life� version of CPR is gruesome, violent, undignified, and sometimes causes broken bones, the researchers noted. Television�s glamorized version of amazing medical successes succeeds only in fabricating an illusory picture of allopathic competence. While it may be a fabrication, it is fabulous propaganda for conventional medicine. SOURCE��CPR�s Effects are Glamorized on Television, a Study Says,� The New York Times, June 17, 1996.

Why is Ritalin, a potentially addictive stimulant derived from the same drug family as cocaine, now prescribed regularly for an estimated 1.3 million children between the ages of 5 and 14, or 3-5% of all U.S. schoolchildren? Since 1990, the number of children diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) has grown from 750,000 to almost 4 million. Symptoms of ADD are variable, including a spaced-out quality, concentration difficulties, excessive activity, low impulse control, loud, pushy, defiant, or careless behavior, and a quality of seeming to be �motorized.� Conventional physicians now routinely prescribe Ritalin to ADD children and adolescents, despite the fact that 25-40% show no response to medication, that its side effects (appetite loss, insomnia, tics, and growth retardation) are serious, and that clinical research demonstrates a lack of consistent long-term benefits. Ritalin, stimulants, and antidepressants do not treat the root causes of ADD; at best, they suppress some of its symptoms. Even more alarming, teenagers are using Ritalin as an illicit drug, crushing and snorting it like cocaine, according to naturopathic physicians Judyth Reichenberg-Ullman, N.D., M.S.W., and Robert Ullman, N.D. Facts such as these strongly suggest it is time to seek an alternative. Based on the Ullmans� results in treating 400 children with ADD at their Northwest Center for Homeopathic Medicine in Edmonds, Washington, homeopathic remedies can produce a 70% success rate in reversing ADD symptoms. Homeopathic remedies are safe, inexpensive, completely nonaddictive, and deep-acting. In contrast, the effects of Ritalin last about 4 hours. The Ullmans, who began treating ADD children in 1987, have been �astounded at how homeopathy transformed the lives of many of these children in a positive way.� Based on their clinical experience and the reported cases of other homeopathic physicians, �homeopathy offers an effective alternative to stimulants and antidepressants in the treatment of ADD.� While changing a child�s diet is helpful (eliminating sugars, food additives, and processed foods), the Ullmans contend that using homeopathic remedies produces a more �consistent, profound, and lasting impact.� Homeopathy does not have a single cookbook answer for ADD because every child�s case is individual and must be prescribed accordingly, state the Ullmans. But drawing on their casebook of 400 treatments, they present a representative sampling of the types of homeopathic remedies they have found to be effective against the complicated ADD symptom picture. Jimmy, aged 9, had been in and out of foster homes, experiencing both physical abuse and neglect. His parents were alcoholics and he associated using the toilet with being beaten by his mother in the bathroom. In class, Jimmy was disruptive, hyperactive, fidgety, impatient, completely restless, and a nuisance to other children; at night, he slept fitfully. This is a classic profile of an ADD-troubled child. The Ullmans prescribed homeopathic Veratrum album (from white hellebore) and observed that, within a few days, Jimmy�s hyperactivity was �dramatically� reduced. Over the next days and weeks, his condition continued to improve, and over the next 2 years in which the Ullmans tracked him, Jimmy continued to do well. Darin, aged 5, exhibited oppositional behavior; he was anxious, insecure, impatient, and fearful, and had trouble concentrating. His mother had started him on Ritalin, then abandoned that for a natural alternative. The Ullmans prescribed homeopathic Capsicum (red pepper), which produced gradual but steady improvement over 2 months. Most importantly, the Ullmans urge parents that before they fill the doctor�s prescription for Ritalin, they carefully consider the alternatives.
