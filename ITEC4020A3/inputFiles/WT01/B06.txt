The new Executive order relates to my decision to transfer certain encryption products from the United States Munitions List administered by the Department of State to the Commerce Control List administered by the Department of Commerce. When I made that decision I also decided to amend Executive Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, which sets forth procedures for the interagency review and disposition of dual-use export license applications, to include the Department of Justice among the agencies that have the opportunity to review such applications with respect to encryption products transferred to Department of Commerce control. Also, in issuing the new order, I provided for appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination of encryption products transferred to the Department of Commerce. Among other provisions, I determined that the export of encryption products transferred to Department of Commerce control could harm national security and foreign policy interests of the United States even where comparable products are or appear to be available from foreign sources. Accordingly, the new order makes clear that any EAA provision dealing with issuance of licenses or removal of controls based on foreign availability considerations shall not apply with respect to export controls on such encryption products. Notwithstanding this, the Secretary of Commerce retains the discretion to consider the foreign availability of comparable encryption products in any particular case. Sincerely, WILLIAM J. CLINTON # # # THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release November 15, 1996 November 15, 1996 MEMORANDUM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT                  THE SECRETARY OF STATE                 THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY                 THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE                 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL                 THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE                 UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE                 DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET                 CHIEF OF STAFF TO THE PRESIDENT                 DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE                 DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION                 DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY                 ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL                    SECURITY AFFAIRS                 ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR ECONOMIC POLICY                 ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR SCIENCE AND                    TECHNOLOGY POLICY  SUBJECT:       Encryption Export Policy Encryption products, when used outside the United States, can jeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests. Moreover, such products, when used by international criminal organizations, can threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here and abroad, as well as the safety of the citizens of other countries. The exportation of encryption products accordingly must be controlled to further U.S. foreign policy objectives, and promote our national security, including the protection of the safety of U.S. citizens abroad. Nonetheless, because of the increasingly widespread use of encryption products for the legitimate protection of the privacy of data and communications in nonmilitary contexts; because of the importance to U.S. economic interests of the market for encryption products; and because, pursuant to the terms set forth in the Executive order entitled Administration of Export Controls on Encryption Products (the "new Executive order") of November 15, 1996, Commerce Department controls of the export of such dual-use encryption products can be accomplished without compromising U.S. foreign policy objectives and national security interests, I have determined at this time not to continue to designate such encryption products as defense articles on the United States Munitions List. Accordingly, under the powers vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, I direct that: Encryption products that presently are or would be designated in Category XIII of the United States Munitions List and regulated by the Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq.) shall be transferred to the Commerce Control List, and regulated by the Department of Commerce under the authority conferred more (OVER) 2 in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 (as continued on August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996), Executive Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, and the new Executive order except that encryption products specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or modified for military applications (including command, control, and intelligence applications), shall continue to be designated as defense articles, shall remain on the United States Munitions List, and shall continue to be controlled under the Arms Export Control Act. The transfer described in this paragraph shall be effective upon the issuance of final regulations (the "Final Regulations") implementing the safeguards specified in this directive and in the new Executive order. 2. The Final Regulations shall specify that the encryption products specified in section 1 of this memorandum shall be placed on the Commerce Control List administered by the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce shall, to the extent permitted by law, administer the export of such encryption products, including encryption software, pursuant to the requirements of sections 5 and 6 of the former Export Administration Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the regulations thereunder, as continued in effect by Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 (continued on August 15, 1995, and on August 14, 1996), except as otherwise indicated in or modified by the new Executive order, Executive Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders and laws cited therein. 3. The Final Regulations shall provide that encryption products described in section 1 of this memorandum can be licensed for export only if the requirements of the controls of both sections 5 and 6 of the former Export Administration Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the regulations thereunder, as modified by the new Executive order, Executive Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders and laws cited therein, are satisfied. Consistent with section 742.1(f) of the current Export Administration Regulations, the Final Regulations shall ensure that a license for such a product will be issued only if an application can be and is approved under both section 5 and section 6. The controls on such products will apply to all destinations. Except for those products transferred to the Commerce Control List prior to the effective date of the Final Regulations, exports and reexports of encryption products shall initially be subject to case-by-case review to ensure that export thereof would be consistent with U.S. foreign policy objectives and national security interests, including the safety of U.S. citizens. Consideration shall be given to more liberalized licensing treatment of each such individual product after interagency review is completed. The Final Regulations shall also effectuate all other specific objectives and directives set forth in this directive. 4. Because encryption source code can easily and mechanically be transformed into object code, and because export of such source code is controlled because of the code's functional capacity, rather than because of any "information" such code might convey, the Final Regulations shall specify that encryption source code shall be treated as an encryption product, and not as technical data or technology, for export licensing purposes. 5. All provisions in the Final Regulations regarding "de minimis" domestic content of items shall not apply with respect to the encryption products described in paragraph 1 of this memorandum. more 3 6. The Final Regulations shall, in a manner consistent with section 16(5)(C) of the EAA, 50 U.S.C. App. 2415(5)(C), provide that it will constitute an export of encryption source code or object code software for a person to make such software available for transfer outside the United States, over radio, electromagnetic, photooptical, or photoelectric communications facilities accessible to persons outside the United States, including transfer from electronic bulletin boards and Internet file transfer protocol sites, unless the party making the software available takes precautions adequate to prevent the unauthorized transfer of such code outside the United States. 7. Until the Final Regulations are issued, the Department of State shall continue to have authority to administer the export of encryption products described in section 1 of this memorandum as defense articles designated in Category XIII of the United States Munitions List, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act. 8. Upon enactment of any legislation reauthorizing the administration of export controls, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General shall reexamine whether adequate controls on encryption products can be maintained under the provisions of the new statute and advise the Secretary of Commerce of their conclusions as well as any recommendations for action. If adequate controls on encryption products cannot be maintained under a new statute, then such products shall, where consistent with law, be designated or redesignated as defense articles under 22 U.S.C. 2778(a)(1), to be placed on the United States Munitions List and controlled pursuant to the terms of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Any disputes regarding the decision to designate or redesignate shall be resolved by the President. WILLIAM J. CLINTON # # # THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release November 15, 1996 EXECUTIVE ORDER ADMINISTRATION OF EXPORT CONTROLS ON ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and in order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency described and declared in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and continued on August 15, 1995, and on August 14, 1996, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, have decided that the provisions set forth below shall apply to administration of the export control system maintained by the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730 et seq. ("the EAR"). Accordingly, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Treatment of Encryption Products. In order to provide for appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination of encryption products, export controls of encryption products that are or would be, on this date, designated as defense articles in Category XIII of the United States Munitions List and regulated by the United States Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq. ("the AECA"), but that subsequently are placed on the Commerce Control List in the EAR, shall be subject to the following conditions: (a) I have determined that the export of encryption products described in this section could harm national security and foreign policy interests even where comparable products are or appear to be available from sources outside the United States, and that facts and questions concerning the foreign availability of such encryption products cannot be made subject to public disclosure or judicial review without revealing or implicating classified information that could harm United States national security and foreign policy interests. Accordingly, sections 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 ("the EAA"), 50 U.S.C. App. 2403(c) and 2405(h)(2)-(4), as amended and as continued in effect by Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and by notices of August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996, all other analogous provisions of the EAA relating to foreign availability, and the regulations in the EAR relating to such EAA provisions, shall not be applicable with respect to export controls on such encryption products. Notwithstanding this, the Secretary of Commerce ("Secretary") may, in his discretion, consider the foreign availability of comparable encryption products in determining whether to issue a license in a particular case or to remove controls on particular products, but is not required to issue licenses in particular cases or to remove controls on particular products based on such consideration; (b) Executive Order 12981, as amended by Executive Order 13020 of October 12, 1996, is further amended as follows: (1) A new section 6 is added to read as follows: "Sec. 6. Encryption Products. In conducting the license review described in section 1 above, with respect to export controls of encryption products that are or would be, on November 15, 1996, designated as defense articles in Category more (OVER) 2 XIII of the United States Munitions List and regulated by the United States Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq., but that subsequently are placed on the Commerce Control List in the Export Administration Regulations, the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, and Justice and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency shall have the opportunity to review any export license application submitted to the Department of Commerce. The Department of Justice shall, with respect to such encryption products, be a voting member of the Export Administration Review Board described in section 5(a)(1) of this order and of the Advisory Committee on Export Policy described in section 5(a)(2) of this order. The Department of Justice shall be a full member of the Operating Committee of the ACEP described in section 5(a)(3) of this order, and of any other committees and consultation groups reviewing export controls with respect to such encryption products." (2) Sections 6 and 7 of Executive Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, are renumbered as new sections 7 and 8, respectively. (c) Because the export of encryption software, like the export of other encryption products described in this section, must be controlled because of such software's functional capacity, rather than because of any possible informational value of such software, such software shall not be considered or treated as "technology," as that term is defined in section 16 of the EAA (50 U.S.C. App. 2415) and in the EAR (61 Fed. Reg. 12714, March 25, 1996); (d) With respect to encryption products described in this section, the Secretary shall take such actions, including the promulgation of rules, regulations, and amendments thereto, as may be necessary to control the export of assistance (including training) to foreign persons in the same manner and to the same extent as the export of such assistance is controlled under the AECA, as amended by section 151 of Public Law 104-164; (e) Appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination of encryption products described in this section may include, but are not limited to, measures that promote the use of strong encryption products and the development of a key recovery management infrastructure; and (f) Regulation of encryption products described in this section shall be subject to such further conditions as the President may direct. Sec. 2. Effective Date. The provisions described in section 1 shall take effect as soon as any encryption products described in section 1 are placed on the Commerce Control List in the EAR. Sec. 3. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and to ensure the implementation of appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination of encryption products. It is not intended to, and does not, create any rights to administrative or judicial review, or any other right or benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

Benson Gottschalk v. Benson Supreme Court of the United States 409 U.S. 63 1972 Mr. Justice Douglas delivered the opinion ofthe Court. Respondents filed in the Patent Office an application for an inventionwhich was described as being related ``to the processing of data byprogram and more particularly to the programmed conversion ofnumerical information'' in general-purpose digital computers. Theyclaimed a method for converting binary-coded decimal (BCD) numeralsinto pure binary numerals. The claims were not limited to anyparticular art or technology, to any particular apparatus ormachinery, or to any particular end use. They purported to cover anyuse of the claimed method in a general-purpose digital computer of anytype. Claims 8 and 131 were rejected by the Patent Office but sustained by theCourt of Customs and Patent Appeals, 441 F.2d 682. The case is here ona petition for a writ of certiorari. 405 U.S. 915. The question is whether the method described and claimed is a``process'' within the meaning of the PatentAct.2 A digital computer, as distinguished from an analog computer, operateson data expressed in digits, solving a problem by doing arithmetic asa person would do it by head and hand.3 Some of the digits arestored as components of the computer. Others are introduced into thecomputer in a form which it is designed to recognize. The computeroperates then upon both new and previously stored data. Thegeneral-purpose computer is designed to perform operations under manydifferent programs. The representation of numbers may be in the form of a time seriesof electrical impulses, magnetized spots on the surface of tapes,drums, or discs, charged spots on cathode-ray tube screens, thepresence or absence of punched holes on paper cards, or other devices.The method or program is a sequence of coded instructions for adigital computer. The patent sought is on a method of programming a general-purposedigital computer to convert signals from binary-coded decimal forminto pure binary form. A procedure for solving a given type ofmathematical problem is known as an ``algorithm.'' The procedures setforth in the present claims are of that kind; that is to say, they area generalized formulation for programs to solve mathematical problemsof converting one form of numerical representation to another. Fromthe generic formulation, programs may be developed as specificapplications. The decimal system uses as digits the 10 symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6, 7, 8, and 9. The value represented by any digit depends, as itdoes in any positional system of notation, both on its individualvalue and on its relative position in the numeral. Decimal numeralsare written by placing digits in the appropriate positions or columnsof the numerical sequence, i. e., ``unit''100, ``tens'' 101,``hundreds'' 102, ``thousands'' 103, etc. Accordingly, thenumeral 1492 signifies (1 x 103) + (4 x 102) + (9 x 101) + (2 x 100). The pure binary system of positional notation uses two symbols asdigits -- 0 and 1, placed in a numerical sequence with values based onconsecutively ascending powers of 2. In pure binary notation, whatwould be the tens position is the twos position; what would behundreds position is the fours position; what would be the thousandsposition is the eights. Any decimal number from 0 to 10 canbe represented in the binary system with four digits or positions asindicated in the following table. Shown as the sum of powers of 2 23 22 21 20 Pure Decimal (8) (4) (2) (1) Binary 0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0000 1 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 20 = 0001 2 = 0 + 0 + 21 + 0 = 0010 3 = 0 + 0 + 21 + 20 = 0011 4 = 0 + 22 + 0 + 0 = 0100 5 = 0 + 22 + 0 + 20 = 0101 6 = 0 + 22 + 21 + 0 = 0110 7 = 0 + 22 + 21 + 20 = 0111 8 = 23 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1000 9 = 23 + 0 + 0 + 20 = 1001 10 = 23 + 0 + 21 + 0 = 1010 The BCD system using decimal numerals replaces the character foreach component decimal digit in the decimal numeral with thecorresponding four-digit binary numeral, shown in the righthand columnof the table. Thus decimal 53 is represented as 0101 0011 in BCD,because decimal 5 is equal to binary 0101 and decimal 3 is equivalentto binary 0011. In pure binary notation, however, decimal 53 equalsbinary 110101. The conversion of BCD numerals to pure binary numeralscan be done mentally through use of the foregoing table. The methodsought to be patented varies the ordinary arithmetic steps a humanwould use by changing the order of the steps, changing the symbolismfor writing the multiplier used in some steps, and by taking subtotalsafter each successive operation. The mathematical procedures can becarried out in existing computers long in use, no new machinery beingnecessary. And, as noted, they can also be performed without acomputer. The Court stated in Mackay Co. v. Radio Corp., 306 U.S. 86, 94,that ``[w]hile a scientific truth, or the mathematical expression of it,is not a patentable invention, a novel and useful structure createdwith the aid of knowledge of scientific truth may be.'' That statementfollowed the longstanding rule that ``[a]n idea of itself is notpatentable.'' Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v. Howard, 20 Wall. 498, 507.``A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an originalcause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim ineither of them an exclusive right.'' Le Roy v. Tatham, 14 How. 156,175. Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes,and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are thebasic tools of scientific and technological work. As we stated inFunk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Co., 333 U.S. 127, 130, ``He who discoversa hitherto unknown phenomenon of nature has no claim to a monopoly ofit which the law recognizes. If there is to be invention from such adiscovery, it must come from the application of the law of nature to anew and useful end.'' We dealt there with a ``product'' claim, while thepresent case deals with a ``process'' claim. But we think thesame principle applies. Here the ``process'' claim is so abstract and sweeping as to coverboth known and unknown uses of the BCD to pure binary conversion. Theend use may (1) vary from the operation of a train to verification ofdrivers' licenses to researching the law books for precedents and (2)be performed through any existing machinery or future-devisedmachinery or without any apparatus. In O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, Morse was allowed a patent for aprocess of using electromagnetism to produce distinguishable signs fortelegraphy. Id., at 111. But the Court denied the eighth claim inwhich Morse claimed the use of ``electro magnetism, however developedfor marking or printing intelligible characters, signs, or letters, atany distances.'' Id., at 112. The Court in disallowing that claim said,``If this claim can be maintained, it matters not by what process ormachinery the result is accomplished. For aught that we now know,some future inventor, in the onward march of science, may discover amode of writing or printing at a distance by means of the electric orgalvanic current, without using any part of the process or combinationset forth in the plaintiff's specification. His invention may be lesscomplicated -- less liable to get out of order -- less expensive inconstruction, and in its operation. But yet, if it is covered by thispatent, the inventor could not use it, nor the public have the benefit ofit, without the permission of this patentee.'' Id., at 113. In The Telephone Cases, 126 U.S. 1, 534, the Court explained theMorse case as follows: ``The effect of that decision was, therefore,that the use of magnetism as a motive power, without regard to theparticular process with which it was connected in the patent, couldnot be claimed, but that its use in that connection could.'' Bell'sinvention was the use of electric current to transmit vocal or othersounds. The claim was not ``for the use of a current of electricity inits natural state as it comes from the battery, but for putting acontinuous current in a closed circuit into a certain specifiedcondition suited to the transmission of vocal and other sounds, andusing it in that condition for that purpose.'' Ibid. The claim, inother words, was not ``one for the use of electricity distinct from theparticular process with which it is connected in his patent.'' Id., at535. The patent was for that use of electricity ``both for the magnetoand variable resistance methods.'' Id., at 538. Bell's claim, in otherwords, was not one for all telephonic use of electricity. In Corning v. Burden, 15 How. 252, 267-268, the Court said, ``One may discovera new and useful improvement in the process of tanning, dyeing, etc.,irrespective of any particular form of machinery or mechanical device.'' Theexamples given were the ``arts of tanning, dyeing, making waterproof cloth,vulcanizing India rubber, smelting ores.'' Id., at 267. Those are instances,however, where the use of chemical substances or physical acts, such astemperature control, changes articles or materials. The chemical process or thephysical acts which transform the raw material are, however, sufficientlydefinite to confine the patent monopoly within rather definite bounds. Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U.S. 780, involved a process formanufacturing flour so as to improve its quality. The process firstseparated the superfine flour and then removed impurities from themiddlings by blasts of air, reground the middlings, and then combinedthe product with the superfine. Id., at 785. The claim was notlimited to any special arrangement of machinery. Ibid. The Courtsaid, ``That a process may be patentable, irrespective of the particularform of the instrumentalities used, cannot be disputed. If one of thesteps of a process be that a certain substance is to be reduced to apowder, it may not be at all material what instrument or machinery isused to effect that object, whether a hammer, a pestle and mortar, ora mill. Either may be pointed out; but if the patent is not confinedto that particular tool or machine, the use of the others would be aninfringement, the general process being the same. A process is a modeof treatment of certain materials to produce a given result. It is anact, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to betransformed and reduced to a different state or thing.'' Id., at787-788. Transformation and reduction of an article ``to a different stateor thing'' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim thatdoes not include particular machines. So it is that a patent in theprocess of ``manufacturing fat acids and glycerine from fatty bodiesby the action of water at a high temperature and pressure'' wassustained in Tilghman v. Proctor, 102 U.S. 707,721. The Court said, ``The chemical principle or scientific fact uponwhich it is founded is, that the elements of neutral fat require to beseverally united with an atomic equivalent of water in order toseparate from each other and become free. This chemical fact was notdiscovered by Tilghman. He only claims to have invented a particularmode of bringing about the desired chemical union between the fattyelements and water.'' Id., at 729. Expanded Metal Co. v. Bradford, 214 U.S. 366, sustained a patent on a``process'' for expanding metal. A process ``involving mechanical operations, andproducing a new and useful result,'' id., at 385-386, was held to be a patentableprocess, process patents not being limited to chemical action. Smith v. Snow, 294 U.S. 1, and Waxham v.Smith, 294 U.S. 20, involved a process for setting eggs instaged incubation and applying mechanically circulated currents of airto the eggs. The Court, in sustaining the function performed (thehatching of eggs) and the means or process by which that is done,said: ``By the use of materials in a particular manner he secured theperformance of the function by a means which had never occurred innature, and had not been anticipated by the prior art; this is apatentable method or process. . . . A method, which may be patentedirrespective of the particular form of the mechanism which may beavailed of for carrying it into operation, is not to be rejected as`functional,' merely because the specifications show a machine capableof using it.'' 294 U.S., at 22. It is argued that a process patent must either be tied to aparticular machine or apparatus or must operate to change articles ormaterials to a ``different state or thing.'' We do not hold that noprocess patent could ever qualify if it did not meet the requirementsof our prior precedents. It is said that the decision precludes apatent for any program servicing a computer. We do not so hold. Itis said that we have before us a program for a digital computer butextend our holding to programs for analog computers. We have,however, made clear from the start that we deal with a program onlyfor digital computers. It is said we freeze process patents to oldtechnologies, leaving no room for the revelations of the new,onrushing technology. Such is not our purpose. What we come down toin a nutshell is the following. It is conceded that one may not patent an idea. But in practical effect thatwould be the result if the formula for converting BCD numerals to pure binarynumerals were patented in this case. The mathematical formula involved here hasno substantial practical application except in connection with a digitalcomputer, which means that if the judgment below is affirmed, thepatent would wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effectwould be a patent on the algorithm itself. It may be that the patent laws should be extended to cover theseprograms, a policy matter to which we are not competent to speak. ThePresident's Commission on the Patent System4 rejected the proposal that theseprograms be patentable:5 ``Uncertainty now exists as to whether the statute permits a validpatent to be granted on programs. Direct attempts to patent programshave been rejected on the ground of nonstatutory subject matter.Indirect attempts to obtain patents and avoid the rejection, bydrafting claims as a process, or a machine or components thereofprogrammed in a given manner, rather than as a program itself, haveconfused the issue further and should not be permitted. ``The Patent Office now cannot examine applications for programs because of alack of a classification technique and the requisite search files. Even ifthese were available, reliable searches would not be feasible or economicbecause of the tremendous volume of prior art being generated. Without thissearch, the patenting of programs would be tantamount to mere registration andthe presumption of validity would be all but nonexistent. ``It is noted that the creation of programs has undergone substantial andsatisfactory growth in the absence of patent protection and that copyrightprotection for programs is presently available.'' If these programs are to be patentable,6 considerable problems are raised which only committees ofCongress can manage, for broad powers of investigation are needed,including hearings which canvass the wide variety of views which thoseoperating in this field entertain. The technological problemstendered in the many briefs before us7indicate to us that considered action by the Congress is needed. Reversed. Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and Mr. JusticePowell took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.

Rich, Judge, delivered the opinion of the court. This appeal is from the January 31, 1968 decision of the Patent Office Boardof Appeals1 affirming the rejection of claims 8 and 13, the only claimsremaining in appellants' application serial No. 315,050, filed October 9, 1963,and assigned to Bell Telephone Laboratories Incorporated, entitled ``Conversionof Numerical Information.'' We reverse. The Invention The invention of the appealed claims is in the field of computer technologyand relates to data processing systems. The claims are both directed tomethods. The opening sentence of the specification states that the inventionrelates to the processing of data by program and more particularly to theprogramed conversion of numerical information. The particular conversion towhich both of the claims on appeal are directed is the conversion of ``binarycoded decimal'' (BCD) numerical information in the form of ``signals'' (claim 8) or``representations'' (claim 13) into binary number signals or representations,respectively. Though we presume this statement would be an adequate explanationto those skilled in the computer art, for the benefit of those not so skilled wewill elucidate further. Most digital computers perform their computing operations oninformation in binary form, a system of representation having only twoelementary constituents, called ``bits,'' indicated by ``1'' and ``0''. Men, on theother hand, are accustomed to quantitative information in decimal form and, forthe computer to work on or utilize it, it must be converted intobinary form. It has become a general practice to make this conversion in twostages: from decimal to BCD; from BCD to binary. The following table shows theten familiar decimal digits and their binary equivalents expressed in groups offour bits: Decimal Binary Decimal Binary 0 0000 5 0101 1 0001 6 0110 2 0010 7 0111 3 0011 8 1000 4 0100 9 1001 In BCD notation the decimal number 53 would be represented as 0101 0011, thebinary form of 5 followed by the binary form of 3, each group of four bits beinga BCD ``digit.'' Although the BCD notation is in terms of ``1'' and ``0'' only and canbe represented in a binary machine, it is not in a form in which the machine canutilize it to perform its computing operations. In true binary the decimalnumber 53 is represented by 110101. The problem is to convert the intermediateBCD representation into the true binary. Various ways of doing this were knownprior to appellants' invention. They claim to have discovered a better andsimpler way of doing it having various advantages recited in the specificationsuch as reducing the number of steps required to be taken, dispensing with therepetitive storing and retrieval of partially converted information, eliminatingthe need for interchanging signals among various equipment components and theneed for auxiliary equipment, and decreasing the chance of error. The digital computer which is to receive the information in BCD form canitself be programed to convert it into binary form. The specification gives asan illustrative example an actual program for converting a binary-coded decimalnumber to ordinary binary and apparatus is described in conventional blockdiagram form in which the program can be carried out. The two claims on appeal read as follows: 8. The method of converting signals from binary coded decimal form intobinary which comprises the steps of (1) storing the binary coded decimal signals in a reentrant shift register, (2) shifting the signals to the right by at least three places, until thereis a binary ``1'' in the second position of said register, (3) masking out said binary ``1'' in said second position of said register, (4) adding a binary ``1'' to the first position of said register, (5) shifting the signals to the left by two positions, (6) adding a ``1'' to said first position, and (7) shifting the signals to the right by at least three positions inpreparation for a succeeding binary ``1'' in the second position of said register. 13. A data processing method for converting binary coded decimal numberrepresentations into binary number representations comprising the steps of (1) testing each binary digit position i, beginning with the leastsignificant binary digit position, of the most significant decimal digitrepresentation for a binary ``0'' or a binary ``1''; (2) if a binary ``0'' is detected, repeating step (1) for the next leastsignificant binary digit position of said most significant decimal digitrepresentation; (3) if a binary ``1'' is detected, adding a binary ``1'' at the (i + 1)th and (i+ 3)th least significant binary digit positions of the next lesser significantdecimal digit representation, and repeating step (1) for the next leastsignificant binary digit position of said most significant decimal digitrepresentation; (4) upon exhausting the binary digit positions of said most significant decimal digit representation, repeating steps (1) through (3) for thenext lesser significant decimal digit representation as modified by the previousexecution of steps (1) through (3); and (5) repeating steps (1) through (4) until the second least significantdecimal digit representation has been so processed. As to these claims, no prior art is cited and no question is raised as toutility, novelty, or unobviousness.The asserted advantages and the implicitadvance resulting therefrom in the data-processing art have not been questioned. The Rejection The first problem it is necessary to settle is what the ground or grounds ofrejection is or are. Appellants' brief correctly states ``The only explicitrejection outstanding against claims 8 and 13 is the rejection on the grounds[sic] that these claims are directed to subject matter not embraced by Section101.'' Study of the two Examiner's Answers makes it clear that that was the onlyground he relied on. In his first Answer the examiner specified that ``allgrounds of rejection are withdrawn except the art rejections and nonstatutorysubject matter rejections.'' We no longer have any art rejections. In his secondAnswer, on remand, he said: In summary, the remaining ground of rejection of claims 8 and 13 now in thecase is that these claims are directed to non-statutory subject matter. In reciting what the rejection was, the board opinion says: Claims 8 and 13 stand rejected as for subject matter not embraced by 35U.S.C. 101 in that they set forth ``mental processes'' and ``mathematical steps,''neither being an ``art'' as construed by a long line of decisions * * *. Nowhere does the board opinion indicate that any new ground ofrejection is being made. In discussing appellants' arguments traversing the contention that the claimsare directed to non-statutory subject matter, the board, answering the argumentthat ``The only way applicants' claims can be construed to include mental stepsis to construe them contrary to the disclosure rather than in accord therewith,''made the following somewhat off-the-point observations: We are not convinced by appellants' arguments to the effect that thedisclosure in an application, not the claims thereof, should be the proper basisfor judging whether the claims are drawn to subject matter outside the statute.Certainly a claim which embraces that which was already in the prior art or wasobvious therefrom could not be sustained under 35 U.S.C. 102 or 103 merelybecause there may have been something patentable disclosed in the specification.35 U.S.C. 112 [2d par., 1st sentence] requires the claim to point out thesubject matter which the applicant regards as his invention so that a claimwhich is so broad and indistinct as to embrace within its terms subject matterthat can not be patented under section 101 of the statute, similarly must beunpatentable. [Emphasis ours.] While from that point on in its opinion the board discussed the breadth ofthe claims and what in its opinion they cover, it never so much as suggestedthat the claims are ``indistinct'' or do not point out ``the subject matter whichthe applicant regards as his invention.'' The board did not again refer tosection 112 nor in any way suggest failure of the claims to comply with thesecond paragraph of that section and merely affirmed the rejection on the groundthat the claims, as it read them, were directed to methods which arenon-statutory under section 101. It is our opinion that up until the time ofthe appeal to this court there was only one ground of rejection relied on andthat was non-compliance with section 101. However, apparently out of an abundance of caution and noting the board's reference to section 112 in the above-quoted passage, as well as asimilar passage in the Examiner's Answer on Remand,2 appellants' main brief,toward its end, says of the italicized passage in the above quotation from theboard's opinion that it could be construed as another example similar to thesections 102 and 103 example preceding, or it could also beconstrued as an entirely new ground of rejection under section 112,simultaneously deploring the ``vagaries of prosecution [which] leave some of thebasic issues in doubt.'' Appellants thereupon spent a page of their brief statingtheir reasons why a rejection under the second paragraph of section 112, if suchhad been made, would be in error. That would seem a cautious thing to do but itdoes not bring such a rejection into the case unless it was already there. The brief for the Patent Office trades heavily on this situation. On page 2it quotes appellants as saying that they ``have no alternative but to consider arejection under Section 112 as having been raised and requiring a response'' andproceeds to the conclusion that ``A rejection under 35 USC 112, 2nd paragraph,would thus also appear to [be] present,'' pointing out that a reason of appeal inappellants' Notice of Appeal alleges that the board erred * * * in sustaining the Examiner's rejection of claims 8 and 13 as failing topoint out the subject matter which appellants regard as their invention under 35U.S.C. 112 in that the claims are so broad and indistinct as to embrace withintheir terms subject matter that can not be patented under 35 U.S.C. 101. This, it will be seen, is a close paraphrase of what the board said in theparagraph quoted above. It was an appropriate reason of appeal to file to coverthe contingency that what the board said might be a new ground of rejection.The Patent Office brief goes on to argue, it would seem as its principalcontention,3 not that the claims are directed to non-statutory subject matterbecause directed to mental or mathematical steps, which do no constitute an``art,''4 but that ``the rejection under 35 USC 112 should be affirmed'' becauseappellants admitted during prosecution that their process is capable of manualimplementation with the aid of pencil and paper, that this is ``beyond that whichthey presently regard as their invention,'' and that the claims must be rejectedunder section 112 by reason of our decision in In re Prater and Wei, 56 CCPA1381, 415 F.2d 1393, 162 USPQ 541 (1969). Opinion We have decided a number of cases in the general field of computer science inaddition to the Prater case, supra, since the briefs in this case were filedwhich we list here for convenient reference: In re Bernhart, 57 CCPA 737, 417 F.2d 1395, 163 USPQ 611 (1969) In re Mahony, 57 CCPA 939, 421 F.2d 742, 164 USPQ 572 (1970) In re Musgrave, 57 CCPA 1352, 431 F.2d 882, 167 USPQ 280 (1970) In re Foster, 58 CCPA 1001, 438 F.2d 1011, 169 USPQ 99 (1971) This is an appropriate place to point out a significant differencebetween most of those cases and the present case. The claims in thiscase are directed solely to the art of data-processing itself whereasin most of the above cases some subsidiary or additional art wasinvolved. In Bernhart it was ``Planar Illustration Methodand Apparatus'' by which two-dimensional illustrations ofthree-dimensional objects could be produced; in Mahony wewere concerned with dataprocessing itself in that the invention was amethod of locating the framing bits in a bit stream; in bothMusgrave and Foster computers were used to processseismograms; and in Prater the invention related to thespectrographic analysis of gases. All of the above cases and thepresent case have in common, however, the fact that they are theoutgrowth of a blanket Patent Office policy, which remained inexistence for some time after the decision of the board in this case,to deny claims such as those before us here on the ground that theywere not for statutory subject matter.5 This policy waslater modified.6 The decisionhere for review is a typical product of its time. Reverting now to the first problem which confronts us, what rejection do wehave before us for decision? We conclude, appellants' apprehensionnotwithstanding, that the examiner and the board relied on only one ground,predicated on 35 USC 101, that claims 8 and 13 are either directed to or atleast embrace non-statutory subject matter. Neither of them complained that theclaims are unclear, ambiguous, indistinct, or otherwise incomprehensible so asnot to comply with section 112, second paragraph. In Mahony we made it clearthat ``To inject any question of statutory subject matter into that paragraph isto depart from its wording and to complicate the law unnecessarily.'' Thesolicitor's attempt to build up a rejection on section 112 in order to defeatappellants under the second Prater case decision--a decision not rendered untilfive months after appellants filed their main brief in this court--must fail. It would have to fail in any case for, as appellants point out intheir reply brief, in Prater appellants admitted in the course of the appealthat their claims read on a mental step implementation and we based our decisionon that admission insofar as we affirmed the rejection, whereas here appellantshave made no such admission and, for reasons hereinafter stated, we do not thinkthe claims read on any ``mental step'' implementation. We turn then to consideration of what the solicitor's brief admits is the``principal rejection'' predicated on section 101, which we find to be the onlyrejection. Claim 8 We have set forth claim 8 above and have stated that the examiner andboard rejected it because they considered it to be directed to ``mentalprocesses'' and ``mathematical steps.'' The reasoning of the board's opinion bearsa remarkable similarity to the opinion of the board in Musgrave,which is not surprising since it was the same board and the opinion was by thesame member. The same line of cases is relied on here that was relied on inPrater and Musgrave and we have given them full consideration before,particularly in those two cases in which we considered at length the ``mentalsteps'' doctrine. One of the many sound ideas expressed in the concurringopinion delivered by Judge Baldwin in Musgrave is ``that in reality very littleremains [as a result of our recent decisions] of the `mental steps' doctrine.''Another is that as a result of Prater and Mahony--If, indeed, it has not alwaysbeen so7--there is a ``standard of reasonableness'' in the interpretationof claims which is that they should be given the meaning they would have ``to oneof ordinary skill in the pertinent art when read in light of and consistentlywith the specification.'' The question Judge Baldwin asked in Musgrave is thequestion we have here: ``* * * would a reasonable interpretation of the claimsinclude coverage of the process implemented by the human mind?'' The answerclearly is ``No,'' for the same reasons it had to be ``No'' in Mahony and inMusgrave. Claim 8 is for a method to be practiced in part on particularapparatus specified to be a ``reentrant shift register.'' The first sentence of athree-paragraph definition of ``shift register'' in the ``Condensed ComputerEncyclopedia'' edited by Jordain, McGraw-Hill Book Co. (1969), is: ``A hardwareelement constructed so as to perform the shifting of its containeddata.'' At argument, the Patent Office Solicitor admitted that the reference tothis piece of apparatus in the claim was, for him, its ``most embarrassingphrase.'' It is not only a phrase, it is referred to expressly in elements (1),(2), (3), (4) and (7) and by implication in element (5) which refers to``shifting.'' Claim 8, moreover, refers to the operations of storing, shifting,and masking ``signals'' which, by a reasonable interpretation in the light of thespecification, can only mean signals of the kind upon which the disclosedelectronic digital computer hardware operates. The signals are like the ``bits''and ``bit streams'' with which we were concerned in Mahony. Claim 8 thereforecovers only a machine-implemented process and the apparatus for carrying it outhas been disclosed. The process can be carried out with no intervention by ahuman being once the apparatus is set up--that is to say, the appropriatecomputer system has been assembled and programmed. The solicitor would have ushold the method is not a ``process'' within section 101 on the ground that aprogrammable computer is merely a ``tool of the mind'' and the method is basically``mental'' in character, apparently because the ``workstuff'' of the method isnumbers which are mathematical abstractions. As the Patent Office would say, wedo not find the argument persuasive. Cash registers, bookkeeping machines, andadding machines also work only with numbers but this has never been considered aground for taking them out of the ``machine'' category of section 101. Claim 13 This claim was rejected on the same ground as claim 8 from which itdiffers in containing no reference to any apparatus and in referringto the thing operated upon not as ``signals'' but as``representations.'' The claimed method is one for converting ``binarycoded decimal number representations'' into ``binary numberrepresentations.'' The supporting disclosure against which the claimmust be reasonably interpreted is the identical programmed digitalcomputer system which supports claim 8. The operational steps to becarried out call for ``testing each binary digit position'' todetermine whether it is a ``binary `0''' or a ``binary `1''' andperforming a specified act according to what is found, i.e., moving tothe next position if it is ``0'' and repeating the test or adding abinary ``1'' at two specified positions and then moving to the nextposition, and so on, each action being prescribed so that no humanjudgment or decision is required--merely observation and takingprescribed action according to what is observed. Apparatus,machinery, ``hardware''--whatever it may be called--is disclosed bywhich the steps can be carried out without human intervention but atthe same time, since the claim does not itself call for any particularhardware, the method within the claim can be practiced either withapparatus other than that described or with the simplest of equipmentwhich will enable one to provide and to manipulate ``binary codeddecimal representations'' and convert them into ``binary numberrepresentations.'' This could in theory be any kind of writingimplement and any kind of recording medium--``pencil and paper''--oreven, we suppose, red and blue poker chips and a surface to put themon or slots to put them in so that ``0''s and ``1''s can berepresented. It will aid in understanding the terms of claim 13 to state that thediscovery which is the essence of appellants' invention was that, for each bitposition in each BCD digit, conversion can be accomplished by adding a binary``1'' to two specific bit positions of the next lesser significant BCD digit andthat in normal notation ``significance'' of bits or digits increases to the left,e.g., in the decimal number ``53'' the 5 is more significant than the 3. Thusconversion can be carried out by the steps of (1) testing each BCD bit positionfor all but the least significant BCD digit and (2) for each ``1'' bit detected,adding a binary ``1'' to each of two specified bit positions in the next lessersignificant BCD digit. The only argument put forward by the Patent Office for holding claim 13non-statutory under section 101 is that the method is basically ``mental'' incharacter. Looking at the present case in the light of all its circumstances,we observe in claim 13 a process consisting of a sequence of steps which can becarried out by machine implementation as disclosed in the specification, bystill another machine as disclosed during the prosecution, and even manuallyalthough in actual practice it seems improbable anyone would ever do that, speedmeasured in milli- or even micro-seconds being essential in the practicalutilization of such a process. Only in the manual performance would it requirethe operator even to think and then only to the extent necessary to assure thathe is doing what the claim tells him to do. In no case is the exercise ofjudgment required or even the making of a decision as between alternatives. Realistically, the process of claim 13 has no practical use other than themore effective operation and utilization of a machine known as a digitalcomputer. It seems beyond question that the machines--the computers--are inthe technological field, are a part of one of our best-known technologies, andare in the ``useful arts'' rather than the ``liberal arts,'' as are all other typesof ``business machines,'' regardless of the uses to which their users may putthem. How can it be said that a process having no practical value other thanenhancing the internal operation of those machines is not likewisein the technological or useful arts? We conclude that the Patent Office has putforth no sound reason why the claims in this case should be held to benon-statutory. The decision of the board is reversed. Footnotes 1 Consisting of Kreek, Keely, and Andrews, Examiners-in-Chief, opinion byAndrews. 2 Continuing the statement quoted above as the first quotation in thissection, the examiner said: ``The method set forth is by applicants' own assertion `directed to a machinealgorithm'; and as understood recites a series of steps for manipulation of datarequired to be carried out by a programmed computer. Such a method, set forthin this manner, is not considered to properly set forth a process within themeaning of 35 USC 101, in light of prior decisions and the requirements of 35USC 112. The subject matter of the claims is thus deemed non-statutory.'' That paragraph by the examiner therefore begins and ends with the summarystatement of his position that the single ground of rejection is that the claimsare directed to non-statutory subject matter under 35 USC 101. In short, amethod carried out by a programmed computer is non-statutory. His reference tosection 112 is not clear as to its purpose and seems superfluous. 3 More than 5 of the 7 pages of argument are devoted to this point. Thebrief begins by stating, however, that the principal rejection, of course, isthat ``[claims] 8 and 13 stand rejected as for subject matter not embraced by 35U.S.C. 101 in that they set forth `mental processes' and `mathematical steps,'neither being an `art' * * *'' 4 The term ``art,'' of course, is the term used in the statutes prior to 1953,the term now being ``process'' (35 USC 101) which is defined to include ``art ormethod'' (35 USC 100(b)). The board used the term ``art'' because it was referringto a number of pre-1953 cases which dealt with the meaning of that term in R.S.4886, old Title 35 USC, section 31. 5 For a full exposition of that policy see the speech of Commissioner ofPatents Brenner of October 22, 1968, which is part of the proceedings of thatyear of the Computers-in-Law Institute, National Law Center, George WashingtonUniversity, section B-1, entitled ``The Future of Computer Programs in the U.S.Patent Office.'' 6 See the speech by Commissioner Schuyler, October 8, 1969, 1969Computers-in-Law Institute, Section H, entitled ``Protecting Property in ComputerSoftware.'' 7 See ``PatentClaims'' by Ridsdale Ellis (1949), Chapt. 3 entitled ``General Rulesof Claim Construction'' especially Secs. 21, 22 referring toreasonableness in claim interpretation and citing decisions of theCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1924 and 1915.WT01-B06-6IA044-000801-B015-220http://samsara.law.cwru.edu:80/comp_law/apple.html 129.22.184.108 19970118135234 text/html 60557HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 18 Jan 1997 13:56:10 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 60385Last-modified: Mon, 05 Aug 1996 13:25:01 GMT Apple v. Franklin Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp. United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit 714 F.2d 1240 1983 Before: Hunter, Higginbotham and Sloviter, Circuit Judges OPINION OF THE COURT Sloviter, Circuit Judge. I. INTRODUCTION Apple Computer, Inc. appeals from the district court's denial of a motion topreliminarily enjoin Franklin Computer Corp. from infringing the copyrights Apple holds on fourteen computer programs. The decision to grant or refuse to grant a preliminary injunctionis within the discretion of the district court. See A.O. SmithCorp. v. FTC, 530 F.2d 515, 525 (3d Cir. 1976). Although thescope of our review of the action of the district court in ruling on amotion for preliminary injunction is narrow, reversal is warranted ifthe trial court has abused its discretion or committed error inapplying the law. Kennecott Corp. v. Smith, 637 F.2d181, 187 (3d Cir. 1980). As the Second Circuit has stated recently,``Despite oft repeated statements that the issuance of a preliminaryinjunction rests in the discretion of the trial judge whose decisionswill be reversed only for `abuse', a court of appeals must reverse ifthe district court has proceeded on the basis of an erroneous view ofthe applicable law.'' Donovan v. Bierwirth, 680 F.2d 263,269 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1069, 103 S. Ct. 488, 74L. Ed. 2d 631 (1982). In this case the district court denied the preliminary injunction,inter alia, because it had ``some doubt as to thecopyrightability of the programs.'' Apple Computer, Inc. v.Franklin Computer Corp., 545 F. Supp. 812, 812 (E.D. Pa.1982). This legal ruling is fundamental to all future proceedings inthis action and, as the parties and amici curiae seem to agree, hasconsiderable significance to the computer servicesindustry.1Because we conclude that the district court proceeded under an erroneousview of the applicable law, we reverse the denial of the preliminaryinjunction and remand. II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY Apple, one of the computer industry leaders, manufactures and markets personal computers (microcomputers), related peripheral equipment such as disk drives (peripherals), and computer programs (software). It presently manufactures Apple II computers and distributes over 150 programs. Apple has sold over 400,000 Apple II computers, employs approximately 3,000 people, and had annual sales of $335,000,000 for fiscal year 1981. One of the by-products of Apple's success is the independent development by third parties of numerous computer programs which are designed to run on the Apple II computer. Franklin, the defendant below, manufactures and sells the ACE 100 personal computer and at the time of the hearing employed about 75 people and had sold fewer than 1,000 computers. The ACE 100 was designed to be ``Apple compatible,'' so that peripheral equipment and software developed for use with the Apple II computer could be used in conjunction with the ACE 100. Franklin's copying of Apple's operating system computer programs in an effort to achieve such compatibility precipitated this suit. Like all computers both the Apple II and ACE 100 have a central processing unit (CPU) which is the integrated circuit that executes programs. In lay terms, the CPU does the work it is instructed to do. Those instructions are contained on computer programs. There are three levels of computer language in which computer programs may be written.2 High level language, such as the commonly used BASIC or FORTRAN, uses English words and symbols, and is relatively easy to learn and understand (e.g., ``GO TO 40'' tells the computer to skip intervening steps and go to the step at line 40). A somewhat lower level language is assembly language, which consists of alphanumeric labels (e.g., ``ADC'' means ``add with carry''). Statements in high level language, and apparently also statements in assembly language, are referred to as written in ``source code.'' The third, or lowest level computer language, is machine language, a binary language using two symbols, 0 and 1, to indicate an open or closed switch (e.g., ``01101001'' means, to the Apple, add two numbers and save the result). Statements in machine language are referred to as written in ``object code.'' The CPU can only follow instructions written in object code. However, programs are usually written in source code which is more intelligible to humans. Programs written in source code can be converted or translated by a ``compiler'' program into object code for use by the computer. Programs are generally distributed only in their object code version stored on a memory device. A computer program can be stored or fixed on a variety of memory devices, two of which are of particular relevance for this case. The ROM (Read Only Memory) is an internal permanent memory device consisting of a semi-conductor ``chip'' which is incorporated into the circuitry of the computer. A program in object code is embedded on a ROM before it is incorporated in the computer. Information stored on a ROM can only be read, not erased or rewritten.3 The ACE 100 apparently contains EPROMS (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) on which the stored information can be erased and the chip reprogrammed, but the district court found that for purposes of this proceeding, the difference between ROMs and EPROMs is inconsequential. 545 F. Supp. at 813 n.3. The other device used for storing the programs at issue is a diskette or ``floppy disk'', an auxiliary memory device consisting of a flexible magnetic disk resembling a phonograph record, which can be inserted into the computer and from which data or instructions can be read. Computer programs can be categorized by function as either application programs or operating system programs. Application programs usually perform a specific task for the computer user, such as word processing, checkbook balancing, or playing a game. In contrast, operating system programs generally manage the internal functions of the computer or facilitate use of application programs. The parties agree that the fourteen computer programs at issue in this suit are operating system programs.4 Apple filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1338 on May 12, 1982, alleging that Franklin was liable for copyright infringement of the fourteen computer programs, patent infringement, unfair competition, and misappropriation. Franklin's answer in respect to the copyright counts included the affirmative defense that the programs contained no copyrightable subject matter. Franklin counterclaimed for declaratory judgment that the copyright registrations were invalid and unenforceable, and sought affirmative relief on the basis of Apple's alleged misuse. Franklin also moved to dismiss eleven of the fourteen copyright infringement counts on the ground that Apple failed to comply with the procedural requirements for suit under 17 U.S.C. §§ 410, 411. After expedited discovery, Apple moved for a preliminary injunctionto restrain Franklin from using, copying, selling, or infringingApple's copyrights. The district court held a three day evidentiaryhearing limited to the copyright infringement claims. Apple producedevidence at the hearing in the form of affidavits and testimony thatprograms sold by Franklin in conjunction with its ACE 100 computerwere virtually identical with those covered by the fourteen Applecopyrights. The variations that did exist were minor, consistingmerely of such things as deletion of reference to Apple or itscopyright notice.5 James Huston, an Apple systemsprogrammer, concluded that the Franklin programs were ``unquestionablycopied from Apple and could not have been independently created.'' Hereached this conclusion not only because it is ``almost impossible forso many lines of code'' to be identically written, but also because hisname, which he had embedded in one program (Master Create), and theword ``Applesoft'', which was embedded in another (DOS 3.3), appearedon the Franklin master disk. Apple estimated the ``works in suit''took 46 man-months to produce at a cost of over $740,000, notincluding the time or cost of creating or acquiring earlier versionsof the programs or the expense of marketing the programs. Franklin did not dispute that it copied the Apple programs. Its witness admitted copying each of the works in suit from the Apple programs. Its factual defense was directed to its contention that it was not feasible for Franklin to write its own operating system programs. David McWherter, now Franklin's vice-president of engineering, testified he spent 30-40 hours in November 1981 making a study to determine if it was feasible for Franklin to write its own Autostart ROM program and concluded it was not because ``there were just too many entry points in relationship to the number of instructions in the program.'' Entry points at specific locations in the program can be used by programmers to mesh their application programs with the operating system program. McWherter concluded that use of the identical signals was necessary in order to ensure 100% compatibility with application programs created to run on the Apple computer. He admitted that he never attempted to rewrite Autostart ROM and conceded that some of the works in suit (i.e. Copy, Copy A, Master Create, and Hello) probably could have been rewritten by Franklin. Franklin made no attempt to rewrite any of the programs prior to the lawsuit except for Copy, although McWherter testified that Franklin was ``in the process of redesigning'' some of the Apple programs and that ``[w]e had a fair degree of certainty that that would probably work.'' Apple introduced evidence that Franklin could have rewritten programs, including the Autostart ROM program, and that there are in existence operating programs written by third parties which are compatible with Apple II. Franklin's principal defense at the preliminary injunction hearing and before us is primarily a legal one, directed to its contention that the Apple operating system programs are not capable of copyright protection. The district court denied the motion for preliminary injunction by order andopinion dated July 30, 1982. Apple moved for reconsideration in light of this court's decision in Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Artic International, Inc., 685 F.2d 870 (3d Cir. 1982), which was decided August 2, 1982, three days after the district court decision. The district court denied the motion for reconsideration. We have jurisdiction of Apple's appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). III. THE DISTRICT COURT OPINION In its opinion, the district court referred to the four factors to be considered on request for a preliminary injunction: a reasonable probability of success on the merits; irreparable injury; the improbability of harm to other interested persons; and the public interest. 545 F. Supp. at 825; see Delaware River Port Authority v. Transamerican Trailer Transport, Inc., 501 F.2d 917, 919--20 (3d Cir. 1974). The court stated it based its denial of the motion on the first two factors. The court held Apple had not made the requisite showing of likelihood of success on the merits because it ``concluded that there is some doubt as to the copyrightability of the programs described in this litigation.'' 545 F. Supp. at 812. It also stated that ``Apple is better suited to withstand whatever injury it might sustain during litigation than is Franklin to withstand the effects of a preliminary injunction'' because an injunction would have a ``devastating effect'' on Franklin's business, id. at 825, apparently concluding on that basis that Apple had failed to show irreparable harm. It is difficult to discern precisely why the district court questioned the copyrightability of the programs at issue since there is no finding, statement, or holding on which we can focus which clearly sets forth the district court's view. Throughout the opinion the district court referred to the ``complexity of the question presented by the present case'', 545 F. Supp. at 824, and the ``baffling'' problem at issue. Id. at 822. The opinion expresses a series of generalized concerns which may have led the court to its ultimate conclusion, and which the parties and amici treat as holdings. The district court referred to the requirement under the Copyright Act of finding ``original works of authorship'', 17 U.S.C. § 102(a), and seems to have found that there was a sufficient ``modicum of creativity'' to satisfy the statutory requirement of an ``original work''. 545 F. Supp. at 820--21. The court was less clear as to whether the creation of a computer program by a programmer satisfied the requirement of ``works of authorship'', id., and whether an operating system program in ``binary code or one represented either in a ROM or by micro-switches'' was an ``expression'' which could be copyrighted as distinguished from an ``idea'' which could not be. Id. at 821. Again, although we cannot point to a specific holding, running throughout the district court opinion is the suggestion that programs in object code and ROMs may not be copyrightable. Thus, for example, in a series of discursive footnotes, the district court stated that it found ``persuasive'' a district court opinion ``holding that object code in ROM is not copyright protected'', 545 F. Supp. at 818 n.8 (referring to Data Cash Systems, Inc. v. JS&A Group, Inc., 480 F. Supp. 1063 (N.D.Ill. 1979), aff'd on other grounds, 628 F.2d 1038 (7th Cir. 1980)); described an opinion reaching a contrary conclusion as containing ``rather terse analysis [which] provides little guidance'', 545 F. Supp. at 818 n.8 (referring to GCA Corp. v. Chance, 217 U.S.P.Q. 718 (N.D.Cal. 1982), which followed the reasoning of Tandy Corp. v. Personal Micro Computers, Inc., 524 F. Supp. 171 (N.D.Cal. 1981)); and stated that ``Congressional intent regarding the copyrightability of object codes and ROMs is not clear'', 545 F. Supp. at 819 n.9, and that even among members of the industry it was not clear that the copyright law protects works ``like those in suit that are ROM-based,'' id. at 819 n.10. We read the district court opinion as presenting the following legal issues:(1) whether copyright can exist in a computer program expressed in object code,(2) whether copyright can exist in a computer program embedded on a ROM, (3) whether copyright can exist in an operating system program, and (4) whether independent irreparable harm must be shown for a preliminary injunction in copyright infringement actions. IV. DISCUSSION A. Copyrightability of a Computer Program Expressed in Object Code Certain statements by the district court suggest that programs expressed in object code, as distinguished from source code, may not be the proper subject of copyright. We find no basis in the statute for any such concern. Furthermore, our decision in Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Artic International, Inc., supra, laid to rest many of the doubts expressed by the district court. In 1976, after considerable study, Congress enacted a new copyright law to replace that which had governed since 1909. Act of October 19, 1976, Pub. L. No. 94--553, 90 Stat. 2541 (codified at 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq.). Under the law, two primary requirements must be satisfied in order for a work to constitute copyrightable subject matter---it must be an ``original wor[k] of authorship'' and must be ``fixed in [a] tangible medium of expression.'' 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). The statute provides: (a) Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. Id. The statute enumerates seven categories under ``works of authorship'' including ``literary works'', defined as follows: ``Literary works'' are works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied. 17 U.S.C. § 101.A work is ``fixed'' in a tangible medium of expression when: its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority of the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration. A work consisting of sounds, images, or both, that are being transmitted, is ``fixed'' for purposes of this title if a fixation of the work isbeing made simultaneously with its transmission. Id. Although section 102(a) does not expressly list computer programsas works of authorship, the legislative history suggests that programswere considered copyrightable as literary works. SeeH.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 54, reprinted in 1976U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 5659, 5667 (``literary works' ...includes ... computer programs''). Because a Commission on NewTechnological Uses (``CONTU'') had been created by Congress to study,inter alia, computer uses of copyrighted works, Pub. L. No.93--573, § 201, 88 Stat. 1873 (1974), Congress enacted a status quoprovision, section 117, in the 1976 Act concerning such computer usespending the CONTU report and recommendations.6 The CONTU Final Report recommended that the copyright law be amended, inter alia, ``to make it explicit that computer programs, to the extent that they embody an author's original creation, are proper subject matter of copyright.'' National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works, Final Report 1 (1979) [hereinafter CONTU Report]. CONTU recommended two changes relevant here: that section 117, the status quo provision, be repealed and replaced with a section limiting exclusive rights in computer programs so as ``to ensure that rightful possessors of copies of computer programs may use or adapt these copies for their use,'' id.; and that a definition of computer program be added to section 101. Id. at 12. Congress adopted both changes. Act of Dec. 12, 1980, Pub. L. No. 96--517, § 10, 94 Stat. 3015, 3028. The revisions embodied CONTU's recommendations to clarify the law of copyright of computer software. H.R. Rep. No. 1307, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 23, reprinted in 1980 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 6460, 6482. The 1980 amendments added a definition of a computer program: A ``computer program'' is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result. 17 U.S.C. § 101. The amendments also substituted a new section 117 which provides that ``it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program'' when necessary to ``the utilization of the computer program'' or ``for archival purposes only.'' 17 U.S.C. § 117. The parties agree that this section is not implicated in the instant lawsuit. The language of the provision, however, by carving out an exception to the normal proscriptions against copying, clearly indicates that programs are copyrightable and are otherwise afforded copyright protection. We considered the issue of copyright protection for a computer program in Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Artic International, Inc., and concluded that ``the copyrightability of computer programs is firmly established after the 1980 amendment to the Copyright Act.'' 685 F.2d at 875. At issue in Williams were not only two audiovisual copyrights to the ``attract'' and ``play'' modes of a video game, but also the computer program which was expressed in object code embodied in ROM and which controlled the sights and sounds of the game. Defendant there had argued ``that when the issue is the copyright on a computer program, a distinction must be drawn between the `source code' version of a computer program, which ... can be afforded copyright protection, and the ``object code'' stage, which ... cannot be so protected,'' an argument we rejected. Id. at 876. The district court here questioned whether copyright was to belimited to works ``designed to be ``read'' by a human reader [asdistinguished from] read by an expert with a microscope andpatience'', 545 F. Supp. at 821. The suggestion that copyrightabilitydepends on a communicative function to individuals stems from theearly decision of White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v.Apollo Co., 209 U.S. 1, 52 L. Ed. 655, 28 S. Ct. 319 (1908),which held a piano roll was not a copy of the musical compositionbecause it was not in a form others, except perhaps for a very expertfew, could perceive. See 1 Nimmer on Copyright§ 2.03[B][1] (1983). However, it is clear from the language of the1976 Act and its legislative history that it was intended toobliterate distinctions engendered by White-Smith.H.R. Rep. No. 1476, supra, at 52, reprinted in 1976U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News at 5665. Under the statute, copyright extends to works in any tangible means of expression ``from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.'' 17 U.S.C. § 102(a) (emphasis added). Further, the definition of ``computer program'' adopted by Congress in the 1980 amendments is ``sets of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.'' 17 U.S.C. § 101 (emphasis added). As source code instructions must be translated into object code before the computer can act upon them, only instructions expressed in object code can be used ``directly'' by the computer. See Midway Manufacturing Co. v. Strohon, 564 F. Supp. 741, 750 (N.D.Ill. 1983). This definition was adopted following the CONTU Report in which the majority clearly took the position that object codes are proper subjects of copyright. See CONTU Report at 21. The majority's conclusion was reached although confronted by a dissent based upon the theory that the ``machine-control phase'' of a program is not directed at a human audience. See CONTU Report at 28--30 (dissent of Commissioner Hersey). The defendant in Williams had also argued that a copyrightable work ``must be intelligible to human beings and must be intended as a medium of communication to human beings,'' id. at 876--77. We reiterate the statement we made in Williams when we rejected that argument: ``[t]he answer to defendant's contention is in the words of the statute itself.'' 685 F.2d at 877. The district court also expressed uncertainty as to whether a computer program in object code could be classified as a ``literary work.''7 However, the category of ``literary works'', one of the seven copyrightable categories, is not confined to literature in the nature of Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. The definition of ``literary works'' in section 101 includes expression not only in words but also ``numbers, or other . . . numerical symbols or indicia'', thereby expanding the common usage of ``literary works.'' Cf. Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc. v. Graphic Controls Corp., 329 F. Supp. 517, 523--24 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) (the symbols designating questions or response spaces on exam answer sheets held to be copyrightable ``writings'' under 1909 Act); Reiss v. National Quotation Bureau, Inc., 276 F. 717 (S.D.N.Y. 1921) (code book of coined words designed for cable use copyrightable). Thus a computer program, whether in object code or source code, is a ``literary work'' and is protected from unauthorized copying, whether from its object or source code version. Accord Midway Mfg. Co. v. Strohon, slip op. at 25--27; see also GCA Corp. v. Chance, 217 U.S.P.A. at 719--20. B. Copyrightability of a Computer Program Embedded on a ROM Just as the district court's suggestion of a distinction between source codeand object code was rejected by our opinion in Williams issued three days afterthe district court opinion, so also was its suggestion that embodiment of a computer program on a ROM, as distinguished from in a traditional writing, detracts from its copyrightability. In Williams we rejected the argument that ``a computer program is not infringed when the program is loaded into electronicmemory devices (ROMs) and used to control the activity of machines.'' 685 F.2d at 876. Defendant there had argued that there can be no copyright protection for the ROMs because they are utilitarian objects or machine parts. We held that the statutory requirement of ``fixation'', the manner in which the issue arises, is satisfied through the embodiment of the expression in the ROMdevices. Id. at 874, 876; see also Midway Mfg. Co. v. Strohon, slip op. at 27--30; Tandy Corp. v. Personal Micro Computers, Inc., 524 F. Supp. at 173; cf. Stern Electronics, Inc. v. Kaufman, 669 F.2d 852, 855--56 (2d Cir. 1982) (audiovisual display of video game ``fixed'' in ROM). Therefore we reaffirm that a computer program in object code embedded in a ROM chip is an appropriate subject of copyright. See also Note, Copyright Protection of Computer Program Object Code, 96 Harv. L.Rev. 1723 (1983); Note, Copyright Protection for Computer Programs in Read Only Memory Chips, 11 Hofstra L.Rev. 329 (1982). C. Copyrightability of Computer OperatingSystem Programs We turn to the heart of Franklin's position on appeal which is thatcomputer operating system programs, as distinguished from applicationprograms, are not the proper subject of copyright ``regardless of thelanguage or medium in which they are fixed.'' Brief of Appellee at 15(emphasis deleted). Apple suggests that this issue too is foreclosed byour Williams decision because some portion of the program atissue there was in effect an operating system program. Franklin iscorrect that this was not an issue raised by the parties inWilliams and it was not considered by the court. Thus weconsider it as a matter of first impression. Franklin contends that operating system programs are per se excluded from copyright protection under the express terms of section 102(b) of the Copyright Act, and under the precedent and underlying principles of Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 25 L. Ed. 841 (1879). These separate grounds have substantial analyticoverlap. In Baker v. Selden, plaintiff's testator held a copyright on a book explaining a bookkeeping system which included blank forms with ruled lines and headings designed for use with that system. Plaintiff sued for copyright infringement on the basis of defendant's publication of a book containing a different arrangement of the columns and different headings, but which used a similar plan so far as results were concerned. The Court, in reversing the decree for the plaintiff, concluded that blank account-books were not the subject of copyright and that ``the mere copyright of Selden's book did not confer upon him the exclusive right to make and use account-books, ruled and arranged as designated by him and described and illustrated in said book.'' Id. at 107. The Court stated that copyright of the books did not give the plaintiff the exclusive right to use the system explained in the books, noting, for example, that ``copyright of a work on mathematical science cannot give to the author an exclusive right to the methods of operation which he propounds.'' Id. at 103. Franklin reads Baker v. Selden as ``stand[ing] for several fundamental principles, each presenting ... insuperable obstacle to the copyrightability of Apple's operating systems.'' It states: First, Baker teaches that use of a system itself does not infringe a copyright on the description of the system. Second, Baker enunciates the rule that copyright does not extend to purely utilitarian works. Finally, Baker emphasizes that the copyright laws may not be used to obtain and hold a monopoly over an idea. In so doing, Baker highlights the principal difference between the copyright and patent laws---a difference that is highly pertinent in this case. Brief of Appellee at 22. Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act, the other ground on which Franklin relies, appeared first in the 1976 version, long after the decision in Baker v. Selden. It provides: In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work. It is apparent that section 102(b) codifies a substantial part of the holding and dictum of Baker v. Selden. See 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 2.18[D], at 2--207. We turn to consider the two principal points of Franklin's argument. 1. ``Process'', ``System'' or ``Method of Operation'' Franklin argues that an operating system program is either a``process'', ``system'', or ``method of operation'' and henceuncopyrightable.8 Franklin correctly notes that underlying section 102(b) andmany of the statements for which Baker v. Selden iscited is the distinction which must be made between property subjectto the patent law, which protects discoveries, and that subject tocopyright law, which protects the writings describing suchdiscoveries. However, Franklin's argument misapplies that distinctionin this case. Apple does not seek to copyright the method whichinstructs the computer to perform its operating functions but only theinstructions themselves. The method would be protected, if at all, bythe patent law, an issue as yet unresolved. See Diamond v.Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155, 101 S. Ct. 1048 (1981). Franklin's attack on operating system programs as ``methods'' or ``processes'' seems inconsistent with its concession that application programs are an appropriate subject of copyright. Both types of programs instruct the computer to do something. Therefore, it should make no difference for purposes of section 102(b) whether these instructions tell the computer to help prepare an income tax return (the task of an application program) or to translate a high level language program from source code into its binary language object code form (the task of an operating system program such as ``Applesoft'', see note 4 supra). Since it is only the instructions which are protected, a``process'' is no more involved because the instructions in an operating systemprogram may be used to activate the operation of the computer than it would beif instructions were written in ordinary English in a manual which described the necessary steps to activate an intricate complicated machine. There is, therefore, no reason to afford any less copyright protection to the instructions in an operating system program than to the instructions in an application program. Franklin's argument, receptively treated by the district court, that an operating system program is part of a machine mistakenly focuses on the physical characteristics of the instructions. But the medium is not the message. We have already considered and rejected aspects of this contention in the discussion of object code and ROM. The mere fact that the operating system program may be etched on a ROM does not make the program either a machine, part of a machine or its equivalent. Furthermore, as one of Franklin's witnesses testified, an operating system does not have to be permanently in the machine in ROM, but it may be on some other medium, such as a diskette or magnetic tape, where it could be readily transferred into the temporary memory space of the computer. In fact, some of the operating systems as issue were on diskette. As the CONTU majority stated, Programs should no more be considered machine parts than videotapes should be considered parts of projectors or phonorecords parts of sound reproduction equipment. . . . That the words of a program are used ultimately in the implementation of a process should in no way affect their copyrightability. CONTU Report at 21. Franklin also argues that the operating systems cannot be copyrighted because they are ``purely utilitarian works'' and that Apple is seeking to block the use of the art embodied in its operating systems. This argument stems from the following dictum in Baker v. Selden: The very object of publishing a book on science or the useful arts is to communicate to the world the useful knowledge which it contains. But this object would be frustrated if the knowledge could not be used without incurring the guilt of piracy of the book. And where the art it teaches cannot be used without employing the methods and diagrams used to illustrate the book, or such as are similar to them, such methods and diagrams are to be considered as necessary incidents to the art, and given therewith to the public; not given for the purpose of publication in other works explanatory of the art, but for the purpose of practical application. 101 U.S. at 103. We cannot accept the expansive reading given to this language by some courts, see, e.g., Taylor Instrument Companies v. Fawley-Brost Co., 139 F.2d 98 (7th Cir. 1943), cert. denied, 321 U.S. 785, 88 L. Ed. 1076, 64 S. Ct. 782 (1944). In this respect we agree with the views expressed by Professor Nimmer in his treatise. See 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 2.18[C]. Although a literal construction of this language could support Franklin's reading that precludes copyrightability if the copyright work is put to a utilitarian use, that interpretation has been rejected by a later Supreme Court decision. In Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 218, 98 L. Ed. 630, 74 S. Ct. 460 (1954), the Court stated: ``We find nothing in the copyright statute to support the argument that the intended use or use in industry of an article eligible for copyright bars or invalidates its registration. We do not read such a limitation into the copyright law.'' Id. at 218. The CONTU majority also rejected the expansive view some courts have given Baker v. Selden, and stated, ``That the words of a program are used ultimately in the implementation of a process should in no way affect their copyrightability.'' Id. at 21. It referred to ``copyright practice past and present, which recognizes copyright protection for a work of authorship regardless of the uses to which it may be put.'' Id. The Commission continued: ``The copyright status of the written rules for a game or a system for the operation of a machine is unaffected by the fact that those rules direct the actions of those who play the game or carry out the process.'' Id. (emphasis added). As we previously noted, we can consider the CONTU Report as accepted by Congress since Congress wrote into the law the majority's recommendations almost verbatim. See 18 Cong.Rec. H10767 (daily ed. Nov. 17, 1980) (Rep. Kastenmeier: Bill ``eliminates confusion about the legal status of computer software by enacting the recommendations of [CONTU] clarifying the law of copyright of computer software''); 18 Cong.Rec. S14766 (daily ed. Nov. 20, 1980) (Sen. Bayh: ``[t]his language reflects that proposed by [CONTU'']). Perhaps the most convincing item leading us to reject Franklin'sargument is that the statutory definition of a computer program is aset of instructions to be used in a computer in order to bring about acertain result, 17 U.S.C. § 101, makes no distinction betweenapplication programs and operating programs. Franklin can point to nodecision which adopts the distinction it seeks to make. In the oneother reported case to have considered it, Apple Computer,Inc. v. Formula International, Inc., 562 F. Supp. 775(C.D.Cal. 1983), the court reached the same conclusion which we do,i.e. that an operating system program is not per se precludedfrom copyright. It stated, ``There is nothing in any of the statutoryterms which suggest a different result for different types of computerprograms based upon the function they serve within the machine.''Id. at 780. Other courts have also upheld thecopyrightability of operating programs without discussion of thisissue. See Tandy Corp. v. Personal Micro Computers,Inc., 524 F. Supp. at 173 (input-output routine stored in ROM whichtranslated input into machine language in a similar fashion asApplesoft and Apple Integer Basic proper subject of copyright);GCA Corp. v. Chance, 217 U.S.P.Q. at 719--20 (objectcode version of registered source code version of operating programsis the same work and protected). 2. Idea/Expression Dichotomy Franklin's other challenge to copyright of operating system programs relies on the line which is drawn between ideas and their expression. Baker v. Selden remains a benchmark in the law of copyright for the reading given it in Mazer v. Stein, supra, where the Court stated, ``Unlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the idea---not the idea itself.'' 347 U.S. at 217 (footnote omitted). The expression/idea dichotomy is now expressly recognized insection 102(b) which precludes copyright for ``any idea.'' Thisprovision was not intended to enlarge or contract the scope of copyright protection but ``to restate ... the basic dichotomybetween expression and idea remains unchanges.'' H.R. Rep. No. 1476,supra, at 57, reprinted in 1976 U.S. Code Cong. &Ad. News at 5670. The legislative history indicates that section102(b) was intended ``to make clear that the expression adopted by theprogrammer is the copyrightable element in a computer program, andthat the actual processes or methods embodied in the program are notwithin the scope of the copyright law.'' Id. Many of the courts which have sought to draw the line between an idea and expression have found difficulty in articulating where it falls. See, e.g., Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp. 45 F.2d 119, 121 (2d Cir. 1930) (L. Hand, J.); see discussion in 3 Nimmer on Copyright § 13.03[A]. We believe that in the context before us, a program for an operating system, the line must be a pragmatic one, which also keeps in consideration ``the preservation of the balance between competition and protection reflected in the patent and copyright laws''. Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Kalpakian, 446 F.2d 738, 742 (9th Cir. 1971). As we stated in Franklin Mint Corp. v. National Wildlife Art Exchange, Inc., 575 F.2d 62, 64 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 880, 58 L. Ed. 2d 193, 99 S. Ct. 217 (1978), ``Unlike a patent, a copyright protects originality rather than novelty or invention.'' In that opinion, we quoted approvingly the following passage from Dymow v. Bolton, 11 F.2d 690, 691 (2d Cir. 1926): Just as a patent affords protection only to the means of reducing an inventive idea to practice, so the copyright law protects the means of expressing an idea; and it is as near the whole truth as generalization can usually reach that, if the same idea can be expressed in a plurality of totally different manners, a plurality of copyrights may result, and no infringement will exist. (emphasis added). We adopt the suggestion in the above language and thus focus on whether the idea is capable of various modes of expression. If other programs can be written or created which perform the same function as an Apple's operating system program, then that program is an expression of the idea and hence copyrightable. In essence, this inquiry is no different than that made to determine whether the expression and idea have merged, which has been stated to occur where there are no or few other ways of expressing a particular idea. See, e.g., Morrissey v. Procter & Gamble Co., 379 F.2d 675, 678--79 (1st Cir. 1967); Freedman v. Grolier Enterprises, Inc., 179 U.S.P.Q. 476, 478 (S.D.N.Y. 1973) (``[c]opyright protection will not be given to a form of expression necessarily dictated by the underlying subject matter''); CONTU Report at 20. The district court made no findings as to whether some or all of Apple's operating programs represent the only means of expression of the idea underlying them. Although there seems to be a concession by Franklin that at least some of the programs can be rewritten, we do not believe that the record on that issue is so clear that it can be decided at the appellate level. Therefore, if the issue is pressed on remand, the necessary finding can be made at that time. Franklin claims that whether or not the programs can be rewritten, there are a limited ``number of ways to arrange operating systems to enable a computer to run the vast body of Apple-compatible software'', Brief of Appellee at 20. This claim has no pertinence to either the idea/expression dichotomy or merger. The idea which may merge with the expression, thus making the copyright unavailable, is the idea which is the subject of the expression. The idea of one of the operating system programs is, for example, how to translate source code into object code. If other methods of expressing that idea are not foreclosed as a practical matter, then there is no merger. Franklin may wish to achieve total compatibility with independently developed application programs written for the Apple II, but that is a commercial and competitive objective which does not enter into the somewhat metaphysical issue of whether particular ideas and expressions have merged. In summary, Franklin's contentions that operating system programs are per se not copyrightable is unpersuasive. The other courts before whom this issue has been raised have rejected the distinction. Neither the CONTU majority nor Congress made a distinction between operating and application programs. We believe that the 1980 amendments reflect Congress' receptivity to new technology and its desire to encourage, through the copyright laws, continued imagination and creativity in computer programming. Since we believe that the district court's decision on the preliminary injunction was, to a large part, influenced by an erroneous view of the availability of copyright for operating system programs and unnecessary concerns about object code and ROMs, we must reverse the denial of the preliminary injunction and remand for reconsideration. D. Irreparable Harm The district court, without any extended discussion, found that Apple had not made the requisite showing of irreparable harm, stating ``Apple is better suited to withstand whatever injury it might sustain during litigation than is Franklin to withstand the effects of a preliminary injunction.'' 545 F. Supp. at 812, 825. In so ruling, the district court failed to consider the prevailing view that a showing of a prima facie case of copyright infringement or reasonable likelihood of success on the merits raises a presumption of irreparable harm. See, e.g., Atari, Inc. v. North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp., 672 F.2d 607, 620 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 880, 103 S. Ct. 176, 74 L. Ed. 2d 145 (1982); Wainwright Securities Inc. v. Wall Street Transcript Corp., 558 F.2d 91, 94 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1014, 54 L. Ed. 2d 759, 98 S. Ct. 730 (1978); Klitzner Industries, Inc. v. H.K. James Co., 535 F. Supp. 1249, 1259 (E.D.Pa. 1982); Custom Decor, Inc. v. Nautical Crafts, Inc., 502 F. Supp. 154, 157 (E.D.Pa. 1980). A copyright plaintiff who makes out a prima facie case of infringement is entitled to a preliminary injunction without a detailed showing of irreparable harm. See 3 Nimmer on Copyright § 14.06[A], at 14--50 & n.16 (collecting authorities). The CONTU Final Report recognized that ``[t]he cost of developing computer programs is far greater than the cost of their duplication.'' CONTU Report at 11. Apple introduced substantial evidence of the considerable time and money it had invested in the development of the computer programs in suit. Thus even without the presumption of irreparable harm generally applied in copyright infringement cases, the jeopardy to Apple's investment and competitive position caused by Franklin's wholesale copying of many of its key operating programs would satisfy the requirement of irreparable harm needed to support a preliminary injunction.See Atari, Inc. v. North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp., 672 F.2d at 620; Custom Decor, Inc. v. Nautical Crafts Inc., 502 F. Supp. 154, 157 (E.D.Tenn. 1980); Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp. v. Zale Corp., 323 F. Supp. 1234, 1238 (S.D.N.Y. 1971). In Kontes Glass Co. v. Lab Glass, inc., 373 F.2d 319, 320--21 (3d Cir. 1967), this court appeared to adopt an inverse relationship approach to the irreparable harm issue, suggesting that the strength of the required showing of irreparable injury varies inversely with the strength of plaintiff's showing of a likelihood of success on the merits. See Midway Mfg. Co. v. Bandai-America, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 125, 141--142 (D.N.J. 1982). In Kontes, we were not presented with a case in which copyrighted material central to the essence of plaintiff's operations was concededly copied, as we are here. We believe the Kontes approach is best suited to those cases where the injury from copying can be fairly considered minimal, limited or conjectural. In those circumstances it provides flexibility in applying the equitable remedy of preliminary injunctions through evaluation of the irreparable harm factor. Normally, however, the public interest underlying the copyright law requires a presumption of irreparable harm, as long as there is, as here, adequate evidence of the expenditure of significant time, effort and money directed to the production of the copyrighted material. Otherwise, the rationale for protecting copyright, that of encouraging creativity, would be undermined. As Judge Broderick stated in Klitzner Industries, Inc. v. H.K. James & Co., 535 F. Supp. at 1259--60: Since Congress has elected to grant certain exclusive rights to the owner of a copyright in a protected work, it is virtually axiomatic that the public interest can only be served by upholding copyright protections and, correspondingly, preventing the misappropriation of the skills, creative energies, and resources which are invested in the protected work. Nor can we accept the district court's explanation which stressedthe ``devastating effect'' of a preliminary injunction on Franklin'sbusiness. If that were the correct standard, then a knowing infringerwould be permitted to construct its business around its infringement,a result we cannot condone. See Atari, Inc. v. NorthAmerican Philips Consumer Electronics Corp., 672 F.2d at 620;cf. Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. v. Church & DwightCo., 560 F.2d 1325, 1333 (7th Cir. 1977) (trademark infringement),cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1070, 55 L. Ed. 2d 772, 98 S. Ct. 1252(1978). The size of the infringer should not be determinative of thecopyright holder's ability to get prompt judicial redress. E. Additional Issues Franklin has raised a number of issues concerning Apple's compliance with various statutory formalities such as registration, notice and deposit. It has challenged, in a pending motion to dismiss, the copyrights of the eleven works in suit which were deposited in object code format, and which were registered under the Copyright Office's ``rule of doubt.''9 Franklin challenges three programs, i.e. Apple Integer Basic, Autostart ROM and DOS 3.3, on the ground that they or their predecessors were published without the requisite notice. We do not reach these issue on appeal nor do we consider Franklin's claim that Apple's misuse of its copyrights bars their enforcement. The district court did not consider these claims in denying the motion for preliminary injunction. There are no factual findings with regard to them. On remand, they can be considered by the district court in the first instance who can also decide the extent to which they are relevant, if at all, to a preliminary injunction. V. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we will reverse thedenial of the preliminary injunction and remand to the district courtfor further proceedings in accordance herewith. Footnotes 1 Four amicus curiae briefs have been submitted; briefsfrom Digital Research Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Association of DataProcessing Service Organizations, Inc. (a trade association for thecomputer services industry), support the position of Apple, and a brieffrom Pro-log Corp. supports at least part of Franklin's position. 2 Useful nontechnical descriptions of computer operations appear in Note, Copyright Protection for Computer Programs In Read Only Memory Chips, 11 Hofstra L. Rev. 329 (1982), and Note, Copyright Protection of Computer Program Object Code, 96 Harv. L. Rev. 1723 (1983). 3 In contrast to the permanent memory devices a RAM (Random Access Memory) is a chip on which volatile internal memory is stored which is erased when the computer's power is turned off. 4 The fourteen programs at issue, briefly described, are: (1) Autostart ROM is sold as part of the Apple Computer and is embedded on a ROM chip. The program has also been published in source code as part of a copyrighted book, the Apple II manual. When the computer's power is turned on, Autostart ROM performs internal routines that turn on the circuits in the computer and make its physical parts (e.g. input/output devices, screen, and memory) ready for use. (2) Applesoft is Apple's version of the Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) language. The program is stored in ROM and is sold as part of the computer. Applesoft translates instructions written in the higher-level BASIC language into the lower-level machine code that the computer understands. (3) Floating-Point BASIC is the same program as Applesoft but is stored on disks rather than on ROMs. It is used in earlier versions of the Apple II computer that did not have the Applesoft program in ROM. (4) Apple Integer BASIC, another translator program, is stored on the DOS 3.3 Master Disk. This program used Apple's first version of BASIC for the Apple II computer. It implements a simpler version of the Applesoft program. (5) DOS 3.3, the disk operating system program, provides the instructions necessary to control the operation between the disk system (disk drive) and the computer itself. It controls the reading and writing functions of the disks and includes other routines which put all the data transfers in sequence. The DOS 3.3 Master Disk is sold separately from the computer, and includes several of the other operating programs referred to in this note. (6) Master Create is stored on a disk. When a disk is prepared for use the DOS 3.3 program is placed on that disk in a form that is dependent on the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) available. The Master Create program replaces the DOS 3.3 on the disk with a version that is independent of the amount of RAM available. (7) Copy, which is stored on a disk, enables the user to copy programs written in Apple Integer BASIC from one disk to another. (8) Copy A, also stored on a disk, enables the user to copy programs written in Applesoft from one disk to another. (9) Copy OBJO contains a file of subroutines used by the Copy and Copy A programs. (10) Chain, another disk stored program, allows data to be passed between different parts of a program when only one part of the program is in RAM at a given time. Thus, Chain preserves data already stored in RAM while another part of the program is being loaded into RAM. (11) Hello, also disk stored, is the first program executed after the power is turned on and a disk is ready for use. It determines how much RAM is in the computer and which version of BASIC needs to be loaded into the computer. (12) Boot 13 is stored on disk and sold on a Master Disk. It allows the user having a disk controller card that contains the Apple 16-Sector Boot ROM to use older versions of the Apple disk operating system. (13) Apple 13-Sector Boot ROM is stored in a ROM located on the disk controller card plugged into the Mother Board. By turning on numerous circuits on the card and in the Apple II computer, this program causes other parts of the disk operating system used for 13-Sector format disks to load. (14) Apple 16-Sector Boot ROM, stored in a ROM located on the disk controller card, turns on numerous circuits on the card and in the Apple II computer and causes other parts of the disk operating system used for 16-Sector format disks to load. It therefore enables the user to start or permit the running of another program or to prepare the computer to receive a program. The above descriptions represent an effort to translate the language used by computer experts into language reasonably intelligible to lay persons. They differ in some respects from the descriptions in the district court's opinion, 545 F. Supp. at 815-16, which were taken from the complaint. 5 For example, 8 bytes of memory were alteredin the Autostart ROM program so that when the computer is turned on``ACE 100'' appears on the screen rather than ``Apple II.'' TheFranklin DOS 3.3. program also had 16 bytes (out of 9000) that alloweduse of upper and lower case. 6 Section 117applied only to the scope of protection to be accorded copyrightedworks when used in conjunction with a computer and not to thecopyrightability of programs. H.R. Rep. No. 1476, at 116,reprinted in 1976 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News at 5731. 7 The district court stated that a programmer working directly in object code appears to think more as a mathematician or engineer, that the process of constructing a chip is less a work of authorship than the product of engineering knowledge, and that it may be more apt to describe an encoded ROM as a pictorial three-dimensional object than as a literary work. 545 F. Supp. at 821--22. The district court's remarks relied in part on a quotation about ``microcode'', see id. at 821 n.14; Apple introduced testimony that none of the works in suit contain ``microcode.'' Moreover, Apple does not seek to protect the ROM's architecture but only the program encoded upon it. 8 We are unpersuaded byFranklin's initial contention that Apple is bound to this positionbecause some of Apple's witnesses in the preliminary injunctionhearing used these terms in describing the works in suit. As theCONTU Report itself recognized, the distinction between copyrightablecomputer programs and uncopyrightable processes or methods ofoperation does not always seem to ``shimmer with clarity.'' CONTUReport at 18. The witnesses undoubtedly had the not uncommondifficulty of finding the precisely correct words of description inthis field. It would be both unreasonable and arbitrary to considerthe statements of non-lawyer witnesses without experience in usingstatutory language as words of art to be binding admissions againstApple. 9 Apparently the Registerof Copyrights utilizes its rule of doubt when the deposit of acomputer program is made in object code form because its examinerscannot interpret such code to determine if there has beencopyrightable authorship.WT01-B06-7IA044-000801-B015-256http://samsara.law.cwru.edu:80/comp_law/lotus.html 129.22.184.108 19970118135251 text/html 59891HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 18 Jan 1997 13:56:37 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 59719Last-modified: Tue, 22 Oct 1996 22:00:23 GMT Lotus v. Borland Lotus Development Corporation v.Borland International, Inc. United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit 49 F.3d 807 1995 (Aff'd per curiam by evenly divided Court, 116 S. Ct. 804 (1996)) Before Torruella, Chief Judge, Boudin andStahl, Circuit Judges. Stahl, Circuit Judge. This appeal requires us to decide whether a computer menu command hierarchy is copyrightable subject matter. In particular, we must decide whether, as the district court held, plaintiff-appellee Lotus Development Corporation's copyright in Lotus 1-2-3, a computer spreadsheet program, was infringed by defendant-appellant Borland International, Inc., when Borland copied the Lotus 1-2-3 menu command hierarchy into its Quattro and Quattro Pro computer spreadsheet programs. See Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 788 F.Supp. 78 (D.Mass.1992) (``Borland I''); Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 799 F.Supp. 203 (D.Mass.1992) (``Borland II''); Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 831 F.Supp. 202 (D.Mass.1993) (``Borland III''); Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 831 F.Supp. 223 (D.Mass.1993) (``Borland IV''). I. Background Lotus 1-2-3 is a spreadsheet program that enables users to perform accounting functions electronically on a computer. Users manipulate and control the program via a series of menu commands, such as ``Copy,'' ``Print,'' and ``Quit.'' Users choose commands either by highlighting them on the screen or by typing their first letter. In all, Lotus 1-2-3 has 469 commands arranged into more than 50 menus and submenus. Lotus 1-2-3, like many computer programs, allows users to write what are called ``macros.'' By writing a macro, a user can designate a series of command choices with a single macro keystroke. Then, to execute that series of commands in multiple parts of the spreadsheet, rather than typing the whole series each time, the user only needs to type the single pre-programmed macro keystroke, causing the program to recall and perform the designated series of commands automatically. Thus, Lotus 1-2-3 macros shorten the time needed to set up and operate the program. Borland released its first Quattro program to the public in 1987, after Borland's engineers had labored over its development for nearly three years. Borland's objective was to develop a spreadsheet program far superior to existing programs, including Lotus 1-2-3. In Borland's words, ``[f]rom the time of its initial release . . . Quattro included enormous innovations over competing spreadsheet products.'' The district court found, and Borland does not now contest, that Borland included in its Quattro and Quattro Pro version 1.0 programs ``a virtually identical copy of the entire 1-2-3 menu tree.'' Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 212 (emphasis in original). In so doing, Borland did not copy any of Lotus's underlying computer code; it copied only the words and structure of Lotus's menu command hierarchy. Borland included the Lotus menu command hierarchy in its programs to make them compatible with Lotus 1-2-3 so that spreadsheet users who were already familiar with Lotus 1-2-3 would be able to switch to the Borland programs without having to learn new commands or rewrite their Lotus macros. In its Quattro and Quattro Pro version 1.0 programs, Borland achieved compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3 by offering its users an alternate user interface, the ``Lotus Emulation Interface.'' By activating the Emulation Interface, Borland users would see the Lotus menu commands on their screens and could interact with Quattro or Quattro Pro as if using Lotus 1-2-3, albeit with a slightly different looking screen and with many Borland options not available on Lotus 1-2-3. In effect, Borland allowed users to choose how they wanted to communicate with Borland's spreadsheet programs: either by using menu commands designed by Borland, or by using the commands and command structure used in Lotus 1-2-3 augmented by Borland-added commands. Lotus filed this action against Borland in the District of Massachusetts on July 2, 1990, four days after a district court held that the Lotus 1-2-3 ``menu structure, taken as a whole--including the choice of command terms [and] the structure and order of those terms,'' was protected expression covered by Lotus's copyrights. Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Paperback Software Int'l, 740 F.Supp. 37, 68, 70 (D.Mass.1990) (``Paperback'').1 Three days earlier, on the morning after the Paperback decision, Borland had filed a declaratory judgment action against Lotus in the Northern District of California, seeking a declaration of non-infringement. On September 10, 1990, the district court in California dismissed Borland's declaratory judgment action in favor of this action. Lotus and Borland filed cross motions for summary judgment; the district court denied both motions on March 20, 1992, concluding that ``neither party's motion is supported by the record.'' Borland I, 788 F.Supp. at 80. The district court invited the parties to file renewed summary judgment motions that would ``focus their arguments more precisely'' in light of rulings it had made in conjunction with its denial of their summary judgment motions. Id. at 82. Both parties filed renewed motions for summary judgment on April 24, 1992. In its motion, Borland contended that the Lotus 1-2-3 menus were not copyrightable as a matter of law and that no reasonable trier of fact could find that the similarity between its products and Lotus 1-2-3 was sufficient to sustain a determination of infringement. Lotus contended in its motion that Borland had copied Lotus 1-2-3's entire user interface and had thereby infringed Lotus's copyrights. On July 31, 1992, the district court denied Borland's motion and granted Lotus's motion in part. The district court ruled that the Lotus menu command hierarchy was copyrightable expression because [a] very satisfactory spreadsheet menu tree can be constructed using different commands and a different command structure from those of Lotus 1-2- 3. In fact, Borland has constructed just such an alternate tree for use in Quattro Pro's native mode. Even if one holds the arrangement of menu commands constant, it is possible to generate literally millions of satisfactory menu trees by varying the menu commands employed. Borland II, 799 F.Supp. at 217. The district court demonstrated this by offering alternate command words for the ten commands that appear in Lotus's main menu. Id. For example, the district court stated that ``[t]he `Quit' command could be named `Exit' without any other modifications,'' and that ``[t]he `Copy' command could be called `Clone,' `Ditto,' `Duplicate,' `Imitate,' `Mimic,' `Replicate,' and `Reproduce,' among others.'' Id. Because so many variations were possible, the district court concluded that the Lotus developers' choice and arrangement of command terms, reflected in the Lotus menu command hierarchy, constituted copyrightable expression. In granting partial summary judgment to Lotus, the district court held that Borland had infringed Lotus's copyright in Lotus 1-2-3: [A]s a matter of law, Borland's Quattro products infringe the Lotus 1-2-3 copyright because of (1) the extent of copying of the ``menu commands'' and ``menu structure'' that is not genuinely disputed in this case, (2) the extent to which the copied elements of the ``menu commands'' and ``menu structure'' contain expressive aspects separable from the functions of the ``menu commands'' and ``menu structure,'' and (3) the scope of those copied expressive aspects as an integral part of Lotus 1-2-3. Borland II, 799 F.Supp. at 223 (emphasis in original). The court nevertheless concluded that while the Quattro and Quattro Pro programs infringed Lotus's copyright, Borland had not copied the entire Lotus 1-2-3 user interface, as Lotus had contended. Accordingly, the court concluded that a jury trial was necessary to determine the scope of Borland's infringement, including whether Borland copied the long prompts2 of Lotus 1-2-3, whether the long prompts contained expressive elements, and to what extent, if any, functional constraints limited the number of possible ways that the Lotus menu command hierarchy could have been arranged at the time of its creation. See Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 207. Additionally, the district court granted Lotus summary judgment on Borland's affirmative defense of waiver, but not on its affirmative defenses of laches and estoppel. Borland II, 799 F.Supp. at 222-23. Immediately following the district court's summary judgment decision, Borland removed the Lotus Emulation Interface from its products. Thereafter, Borland's spreadsheet programs no longer displayed the Lotus 1-2-3 menus to Borland users, and as a result Borland users could no longer communicate with Borland's programs as if they were using a more sophisticated version of Lotus 1-2-3. Nonetheless, Borland's programs continued to be partially compatible with Lotus 1-2-3, for Borland retained what it called the ``Key Reader'' in its Quattro Pro programs. Once turned on, the Key Reader allowed Borland's programs to understand and perform some Lotus 1-2-3 macros.3 With the Key Reader on, the Borland programs used Quattro Pro menus for display, interaction, and macro execution, except when they encountered a slash (``/'') key in a macro (the starting key for any Lotus 1-2-3 macro), in which case they interpreted the macro as having been written for Lotus 1-2-3. Accordingly, people who wrote or purchased macros to shorten the time needed to perform an operation in Lotus 1-2-3 could still use those macros in Borland's programs.4 The district court permitted Lotus to file a supplemental complaint alleging that the Key Reader infringed its copyright. The parties agreed to try the remaining liability issues without a jury. The district court held two trials, the Phase I trial covering all remaining issues raised in the original complaint (relating to the Emulation Interface) and the Phase II trial covering all issues raised in the supplemental complaint (relating to the Key Reader). At the Phase I trial, there were no live witnesses, although considerable testimony was presented in the form of affidavits and deposition excerpts. The district court ruled upon evidentiary objections counsel interposed. At the Phase II trial, there were two live witnesses, each of whom demonstrated the programs for the district court. After the close of the Phase I trial, the district court permitted Borland to amend its answer to include the affirmative defense of ``fair use.'' Because Borland had presented all of the evidence supporting its fair-use defense during the Phase I trial, but Lotus had not presented any evidence on fair use (as the defense had not been raised before the conclusion of the Phase I trial), the district court considered Lotus's motion for judgment on partial findings of fact. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c). The district court held that Borland had failed to show that its use of the Lotus 1-2-3 menu command hierarchy in its Emulation Interface was a fair use. See Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 208. In its Phase I-trial decision, the district court found that ``each of the Borland emulation interfaces contains a virtually identical copy of the 1-2-3 menu tree and that the 1-2-3 menu tree is capable of a wide variety of expression.'' Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 218. The district court also rejected Borland's affirmative defenses of laches and estoppel. Id. at 218-23. In its Phase II-trial decision, the district court found that Borland's Key Reader file included ``a virtually identical copy of the Lotus menu tree structure, but represented in a different form and with first letters of menu command names in place of the full menu command names.'' Borland IV, 831 F.Supp. at 228. In other words, Borland's programs no longer included the Lotus command terms, but only their first letters. The district court held that ``the Lotus menu structure, organization, and first letters of the command names . . . constitute part of the protectable expression found in [Lotus 1-2- 3].'' Id. at 233. Accordingly, the district court held that with its Key Reader, Borland had infringed Lotus's copyright. Id. at 245. The district court also rejected Borland's affirmative defenses of waiver, laches, estoppel, and fair use. Id. at 235-45. The district court then entered a permanent injunction against Borland, id. at 245, from which Borland appeals. This appeal concerns only Borland's copying of the Lotus menu command hierarchy into its Quattro programs and Borland's affirmative defenses to such copying. Lotus has not cross-appealed; in other words, Lotus does not contend on appeal that the district court erred in finding that Borland had not copied other elements of Lotus 1-2-3, such as its screen displays. II. Discussion On appeal, Borland does not dispute that it factually copied the words and arrangement of the Lotus menu command hierarchy. Rather, Borland argues that it ``lawfully copied the unprotectable menus of Lotus 1-2-3.'' Borland contends that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is not copyrightable because it is a system, method of operation, process, or procedure foreclosed from protection by 17 U.S.C. s 102(b). Borland also raises a number of affirmative defenses. A. Copyright Infringement Generally To establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff must prove ``(1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.'' Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 1296, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991); see also Data Gen. Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp. 36 F.3d 1147, 1160 n. 19 (1st Cir. 1994); Concrete Mach. Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., 843 F.2d 600, 605 (1st Cir. 1988). To show ownership of a valid copyright and therefore satisfy Feist's first prong, a plaintiff must prove that the work as a whole is original and that the plaintiff complied with applicable statutory formalities. See Engineering Dynamics, Inc. v. Structural Software, Inc., 26 F.3d 1335, 1340 (5th Cir. 1994). ``In judicial proceedings, a certificate of copyright registration constitutes prima facie evidence of copyrightability and shifts the burden to the defendant to demonstrate why the copyright is not valid.'' Bibbero Sys., Inc. v. Colwell Sys., Inc., 893 F.2d 1104, 1106 (9th Cir. 1990); see also 17 U.S.C. § 410(c); Folio Impressions, Inc. v. Byer California, 937 F.2d 759, 763 (2d Cir. 1991) (presumption of validity may be rebutted). To show actionable copying and therefore satisfy Feist's second prong, a plaintiff must first prove that the alleged infringer copied plaintiff's copyrighted work as a factual matter; to do this, he or she may either present direct evidence of factual copying or, if that is unavailable, evidence that the alleged infringer had access to the copyrighted work and that the offending and copyrighted works are so similar that the court may infer that there was factual copying (i.e., probative similarity). Engineering Dynamics, 26 F.3d at 1340; see also Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 606. The plaintiff must then prove that the copying of copyrighted material was so extensive that it rendered the offending and copyrighted works substantially similar. See Engineering Dynamics, 26 F.3d at 1341. In this appeal, we are faced only with whether the Lotus menu command hierarchy is copyrightable subject matter in the first instance, for Borland concedes that Lotus has a valid copyright in Lotus 1-2-3 as a whole5 and admits to factually copying the Lotus menu command hierarchy. As a result, this appeal is in a very different posture from most copyright-infringement cases, for copyright infringement generally turns on whether the defendant has copied protected expression as a factual matter. Because of this different posture, most copyright-infringement cases provide only limited help to us in deciding this appeal. This is true even with respect to those copyright- infringement cases that deal with computers and computer software. B. Matter of First Impression Whether a computer menu command hierarchy constitutes copyrightable subject matter is a matter of first impression in this court. While some other courts appear to have touched on it briefly in dicta, see, e.g., Autoskill, Inc. v. National Educ. Support Sys., Inc., 994 F.2d 1476, 1495 n. 23 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 307, 126 L.Ed.2d 254 (1993), we know of no cases that deal with the copyrightability of a menu command hierarchy standing on its own (i.e., without other elements of the user interface, such as screen displays, in issue). Thus we are navigating in uncharted waters. Borland vigorously argues, however, that the Supreme Court charted our course more than 100 years ago when it decided Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 25 L.Ed. 841 (1879). In Baker v. Selden, the Court held that Selden's copyright over the textbook in which he explained his new way to do accounting did not grant him a monopoly on the use of his accounting system.6 Borland argues: The facts of Baker v. Selden, and even the arguments advanced by the parties in that case, are identical to those in this case. The only difference is that the ``user interface'' of Selden's system was implemented by pen and paper rather than by computer. To demonstrate that Baker v. Selden and this appeal both involve accounting systems, Borland even supplied this court with a video that, with special effects, shows Selden's paper forms ``melting'' into a computer screen and transforming into Lotus 1-2-3. We do not think that Baker v. Selden is nearly as analogous to this appeal as Borland claims. Of course, Lotus 1-2-3 is a computer spreadsheet, and as such its grid of horizontal rows and vertical columns certainly resembles an accounting ledger or any other paper spreadsheet. Those grids, however, are not at issue in this appeal for, unlike Selden, Lotus does not claim to have a monopoly over its accounting system. Rather, this appeal involves Lotus's monopoly over the commands it uses to operate the computer. Accordingly, this appeal is not, as Borland contends, ``identical'' to Baker v. Selden. C. Altai Before we analyze whether the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a system, method of operation, process, or procedure, we first consider the applicability of the test the Second Circuit set forth in Computer Assoc. Int'l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693 (2d Cir. 1992).7 The Second Circuit designed its Altai test to deal with the fact that computer programs, copyrighted as ``literary works,'' can be infringed by what is known as ``nonliteral'' copying, which is copying that is paraphrased or loosely paraphrased rather than word for word. See id. at 701 (citing nonliteral-copying cases); see also 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 13.03[A][1] (1993). When faced with nonliteral-copying cases, courts must determine whether similarities are due merely to the fact that the two works share the same underlying idea or whether they instead indicate that the second author copied the first author's expression. The Second Circuit designed its Altai test to deal with this situation in the computer context, specifically with whether one computer program copied nonliteral expression from another program's code. The Altai test involves three steps: abstraction, filtration, and comparison. The abstraction step requires courts to ``dissect the allegedly copied program's structure and isolate each level of abstraction contained within it.'' Altai, 982 F.2d at 707. This step enables courts to identify the appropriate framework within which to separate protectable expression from unprotected ideas. Second, courts apply a ``filtration'' step in which they examine ``the structural components at each level of abstraction to determine whether their particular inclusion at that level was `idea' or was dictated by considerations of efficiency, so as to be necessarily incidental to that idea; required by factors external to the program itself; or taken from the public domain.'' Id. Finally, courts compare the protected elements of the infringed work (i.e., those that survived the filtration screening) to the corresponding elements of the allegedly infringing work to determine whether there was sufficient copying of protected material to constitute infringement. Id. at 710. In the instant appeal, we are not confronted with alleged nonliteral copying of computer code. Rather, we are faced with Borland's deliberate, literal copying of the Lotus menu command hierarchy. Thus, we must determine not whether nonliteral copying occurred in some amorphous sense, but rather whether the literal copying of the Lotus menu command hierarchy constitutes copyright infringement. While the Altai test may provide a useful framework for assessing the alleged nonliteral copying of computer code, we find it to be of little help in assessing whether the literal copying of a menu command hierarchy constitutes copyright infringement. In fact, we think that the Altai test in this context may actually be misleading because, in instructing courts to abstract the various levels, it seems to encourage them to find a base level that includes copyrightable subject matter that, if literally copied, would make the copier liable for copyright infringement.8 While that base (or literal) level would not be at issue in a nonliteral-copying case like Altai, it is precisely what is at issue in this appeal. We think that abstracting menu command hierarchies down to their individual word and menu levels and then filtering idea from expression at that stage, as both the Altai and the district court tests require, obscures the more fundamental question of whether a menu command hierarchy can be copyrighted at all. The initial inquiry should not be whether individual components of a menu command hierarchy are expressive, but rather whether the menu command hierarchy as a whole can be copyrighted. But see Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chem. Indus., Ltd., 9 F.3d 823 (10th Cir. 1993) (endorsing Altai's abstraction-filtration-comparison test as a way of determining whether ``menus and sorting criteria'' are copyrightable). D. The Lotus Menu Command Hierarchy: A ``Method of Operation'' Borland argues that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is uncopyrightable because it is a system, method of operation, process, or procedure foreclosed from copyright protection by 17 U.S.C. § 102(b). Section 102(b) states: ``In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.'' Because we conclude that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a method of operation, we do not consider whether it could also be a system, process, or procedure. We think that ``method of operation,'' as that term is used in § 102(b), refers to the means by which a person operates something, whether it be a car, a food processor, or a computer. Thus a text describing how to operate something would not extend copyright protection to the method of operation itself; other people would be free to employ that method and to describe it in their own words. Similarly, if a new method of operation is used rather than described, other people would still be free to employ or describe that method. We hold that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is an uncopyrightable ``method of operation.'' The Lotus menu command hierarchy provides the means by which users control and operate Lotus 1-2-3. If users wish to copy material, for example, they use the ``Copy'' command. If users wish to print material, they use the ``Print'' command. Users must use the command terms to tell the computer what to do. Without the menu command hierarchy, users would not be able to access and control, or indeed make use of, Lotus 1-2-3's functional capabilities. The Lotus menu command hierarchy does not merely explain and present Lotus 1- 2-3's functional capabilities to the user; it also serves as the method by which the program is operated and controlled. The Lotus menu command hierarchy is different from the Lotus long prompts, for the long prompts are not necessary to the operation of the program; users could operate Lotus 1-2-3 even if there were no long prompts.9 The Lotus menu command hierarchy is also different from the Lotus screen displays, for users need not ``use'' any expressive aspects of the screen displays in order to operate Lotus 1-2-3; because the way the screens look has little bearing on how users control the program, the screen displays are not part of Lotus 1-2-3's ``method of operation.''10 The Lotus menu command hierarchy is also different from the underlying computer code, because while code is necessary for the program to work, its precise formulation is not. In other words, to offer the same capabilities as Lotus 1-2-3, Borland did not have to copy Lotus's underlying code (and indeed it did not); to allow users to operate its programs in substantially the same way, however, Borland had to copy the Lotus menu command hierarchy. Thus the Lotus 1-2-3 code is not a uncopyrightable ``method of operation.''11 The district court held that the Lotus menu command hierarchy, with its specific choice and arrangement of command terms, constituted an ``expression'' of the ``idea'' of operating a computer program with commands arranged hierarchically into menus and submenus. Borland II, 799 F.Supp. at 216. Under the district court's reasoning, Lotus's decision to employ hierarchically arranged command terms to operate its program could not foreclose its competitors from also employing hierarchically arranged command terms to operate their programs, but it did foreclose them from employing the specific command terms and arrangement that Lotus had used. In effect, the district court limited Lotus 1-2-3's ``method of operation'' to an abstraction. Accepting the district court's finding that the Lotus developers made some expressive choices in choosing and arranging the Lotus command terms, we nonetheless hold that that expression is not copyrightable because it is part of Lotus 1-2-3's ``method of operation.'' We do not think that ``methods of operation'' are limited to abstractions; rather, they are the means by which a user operates something. If specific words are essential to operating something, then they are part of a ``method of operation'' and, as such, are unprotectable. This is so whether they must be highlighted, typed in, or even spoken, as computer programs no doubt will soon be controlled by spoken words. The fact that Lotus developers could have designed the Lotus menu command hierarchy differently is immaterial to the question of whether it is a ``method of operation.'' In other words, our initial inquiry is not whether the Lotus menu command hierarchy incorporates any expression.12 Rather, our initial inquiry is whether the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a ``method of operation.'' Concluding, as we do, that users operate Lotus 1-2-3 by using the Lotus menu command hierarchy, and that the entire Lotus menu command hierarchy is essential to operating Lotus 1-2-3, we do not inquire further whether that method of operation could have been designed differently. The ``expressive'' choices of what to name the command terms and how to arrange them do not magically change the uncopyrightable menu command hierarchy into copyrightable subject matter. Our holding that ``methods of operation'' are not limited to mere abstractions is bolstered by Baker v. Selden. In Baker, the Supreme Court explained that the teachings of science and the rules and methods of useful art have their final end in application and use; and this application and use are what the public derive from the publication of a book which teaches them. . . . The description of the art in a book, though entitled to the benefit of copyright, lays no foundation for an exclusive claim to the art itself. The object of the one is explanation; the object of the other is use. The former may be secured by copyright. The latter can only be secured, if it can be secured at all, by letters-patent. Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. at 104-05. Lotus wrote its menu command hierarchy so that people could learn it and use it. Accordingly, it falls squarely within the prohibition on copyright protection established in Baker v. Selden and codified by Congress in § 102(b). In many ways, the Lotus menu command hierarchy is like the buttons used to control, say, a video cassette recorder (``VCR''). A VCR is a machine that enables one to watch and record video tapes. Users operate VCRs by pressing a series of buttons that are typically labelled ``Record, Play, Reverse, Fast Forward, Pause, Stop/Eject.'' That the buttons are arranged and labeled does not make them a ``literary work,'' nor does it make them an ``expression'' of the abstract ``method of operating'' a VCR via a set of labeled buttons. Instead, the buttons are themselves the ``method of operating'' the VCR. When a Lotus 1-2-3 user chooses a command, either by highlighting it on the screen or by typing its first letter, he or she effectively pushes a button. Highlighting the ``Print'' command on the screen, or typing the letter ``P,'' is analogous to pressing a VCR button labeled ``Play.'' Just as one could not operate a buttonless VCR, it would be impossible to operate Lotus 1-2-3 without employing its menu command hierarchy. Thus the Lotus command terms are not equivalent to the labels on the VCR's buttons, but are instead equivalent to the buttons themselves. Unlike the labels on a VCR's buttons, which merely make operating a VCR easier by indicating the buttons' functions, the Lotus menu commands are essential to operating Lotus 1-2-3. Without the menu commands, there would be no way to ``push'' the Lotus buttons, as one could push unlabeled VCR buttons. While Lotus could probably have designed a user interface for which the command terms were mere labels, it did not do so here. Lotus 1-2-3 depends for its operation on use of the precise command terms that make up the Lotus menu command hierarchy. One might argue that the buttons for operating a VCR are not analogous to the commands for operating a computer program because VCRs are not copyrightable, whereas computer programs are. VCRs may not be copyrighted because they do not fit within any of the § 102(a) categories of copyrightable works; the closest they come is ``sculptural work.'' Sculptural works, however, are subject to a ``useful-article'' exception whereby ``the design of a useful article . . . shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.'' 17 U.S.C. § 101. A ``useful article'' is ``an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.'' Id. Whatever expression there may be in the arrangement of the parts of a VCR is not capable of existing separately from the VCR itself, so an ordinary VCR would not be copyrightable. Computer programs, unlike VCRs, are copyrightable as ``literary works.'' 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). Accordingly, one might argue, the ``buttons'' used to operate a computer program are not like the buttons used to operate a VCR, for they are not subject to a useful-article exception. The response, of course, is that the arrangement of buttons on a VCR would not be copyrightable even without a useful-article exception, because the buttons are an uncopyrightable ``method of operation.'' Similarly, the ``buttons'' of a computer program are also an uncopyrightable ``method of operation.'' That the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a ``method of operation'' becomes clearer when one considers program compatibility. Under Lotus's theory, if a user uses several different programs, he or she must learn how to perform the same operation in a different way for each program used. For example, if the user wanted the computer to print material, then the user would have to learn not just one method of operating the computer such that it prints, but many different methods. We find this absurd. The fact that there may be many different ways to operate a computer program, or even many different ways to operate a computer program using a set of hierarchically arranged command terms, does not make the actual method of operation chosen copyrightable; it still functions as a method for operating the computer and as such is uncopyrightable. Consider also that users employ the Lotus menu command hierarchy in writing macros. Under the district court's holding, if the user wrote a macro to shorten the time needed to perform a certain operation in Lotus 1-2-3, the user would be unable to use that macro to shorten the time needed to perform that same operation in another program. Rather, the user would have to rewrite his or her macro using that other program's menu command hierarchy. This is despite the fact that the macro is clearly the user's own work product. We think that forcing the user to cause the computer to perform the same operation in a different way ignores Congress's direction in § 102(b) that ``methods of operation'' are not copyrightable. That programs can offer users the ability to write macros in many different ways does not change the fact that, once written, the macro allows the user to perform an operation automatically. As the Lotus menu command hierarchy serves as the basis for Lotus 1-2-3 macros, the Lotus menu command hierarchy is a ``method of operation.'' In holding that expression that is part of a ``method of operation'' cannot be copyrighted, we do not understand ourselves to go against the Supreme Court's holding in Feist. In Feist, the Court explained: The primary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, but to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts. To this end, copyright assures authors the right to their original expression, but encourages others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work. Feist, 499 U.S. at 349-50, 111 S.Ct. at 1290 (quotations and citations omitted). We do not think that the Court's statement that ``copyright assures authors the right to their original expression'' indicates that all expression is necessarily copyrightable; while originaql expression is necessary for copyright protection, we do not think that it is alone sufficient. Courts must still inquire whether original expression falls within one of the categories foreclosed from copyright protection by § 102 102(b), such as being a ``method of operation.'' We also note that in most contexts, there is no need to ``build'' upon other people's expression, for the ideas conveyed by that expression can be conveyed by someone else without copying the first author's expression.13 In thecontext of methods of operation, however, ``building'' requires the use of the precise method of operation already employed; otherwise, ``building'' would require dismantling, too. Original developers are not the only people entitled to build on the methods of operation they create; anyone can. Thus, Borland may build on the method of operation that Lotus designed and may use the Lotus menu command hierarchy in doing so. Our holding that methods of operation are not limited to abstractions goes against Autoskill, 994 F.2d at 1495 n. 23, in which the Tenth Circuit rejected the defendant's argument that the keying procedure used in a computer program was an uncopyrightable ``procedure'' or ``method of operation'' under § 102(b). The program at issue, which was designed to test and train students with reading deficiencies, id. at 1481, required students to select responses to the program's queries ``by pressing the 1, 2, or 3 keys.'' Id. at 1495 n. 23. The Tenth Circuit held that, ``for purposes of the preliminary injunction, . . . the record showed that [this] keying procedure reflected at least a minimal degree of creativity,'' as required by Feist for copyright protection. Id. As an initial matter, we question whether a programmer's decision to have users select a response by pressing the 1, 2, or 3 keys is original. More importantly, however, we fail to see how ``a student select[ing] a response by pressing the 1, 2, or 3 keys,'' id., can be anything but an unprotectable method of operation.14 III. Conclusion Because we hold that the Lotus menu command hierarchy is uncopyrightable subject matter, we further hold that Borland did not infringe Lotus's copyright by copying it. Accordingly, we need not consider any of Borland's affirmative defenses. The judgment of the district court is Reversed. Boudin, Circuit Judge, concurring. The importance of this case, and a slightly different emphasis in my view of the underlying problem, prompt me to add a few words to the majority's tightly focused discussion. I. Most of the law of copyright and the ``tools'' of analysis have developed in the context of literary works such as novels, plays, and films. In this milieu, the principal problem--simply stated, if difficult to resolve--is to stimulate creative expression without unduly limiting access by others to the broader themes and concepts deployed by the author. The middle of the spectrum presents close cases; but a ``mistake'' in providing too much protection involves a small cost: subsequent authors treating the same themes must take a few more steps away from the original expression. The problem presented by computer programs is fundamentally different in one respect. The computer program is a means for causing something to happen; it has a mechanical utility, an instrumental role, in accomplishing the world's work. Granting protection, in other words, can have some of the consequences of patent protection in limiting other people's ability to perform a task in the most efficient manner. Utility does not bar copyright (dictionaries may be copyrighted), but it alters the calculus. Of course, the argument for protection is undiminished, perhaps even enhanced, by utility: if we want more of an intellectual product, a temporary monopoly for the creator provides incentives for others to create other, different items in this class. But the ``cost'' side of the equation may be different where one places a very high value on public access to a useful innovation that may be the most efficient means of performing a given task. Thus, the argument for extending protection may be the same; but the stakes on the other side are much higher. It is no accident that patent protection has preconditions that copyright protection does not--notably, the requirements of novelty and non-obviousness--and that patents are granted for a shorter period than copyrights. This problem of utility has sometimes manifested itself in copyright cases, such as Baker v. Selden, 101 U.S. 99, 25 L.Ed. 841 (1879), and been dealt with through various formulations that limit copyright or create limited rights to copy. But the case law and doctrine addressed to utility in copyright have been brief detours in the general march of copyright law. Requests for the protection of computer menus present the concern with fencing off access to the commons in an acute form. A new menu may be a creative work, but over time its importance may come to reside more in the investment that has been made by users in learning the menu and in building their own mini-programs--macros--in reliance upon the menu. Better typewriter keyboard layouts may exist, but the familiar QWERTY keyboard dominates the market because that is what everyone has learned to use. See P. David, CLIO and the Economics of QWERTY, 75 Am.Econ.Rev. 332 (1985). The QWERTY keyboard is nothing other than a menu of letters. Thus, to assume that computer programs are just one more new means of expression, like a filmed play, may be quite wrong. The ``form''--the written source code or the menu structure depicted on the screen--look hauntingly like the familiar stuff of copyright; but the ``substance'' probably has more to do with problems presented in patent law or, as already noted, in those rare cases where copyright law has confronted industrially useful expressions. Applying copyright law to computer programs is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces do not quite fit. All of this would make no difference if Congress had squarely confronted the issue, and given explicit directions as to what should be done. The Copyright Act of 1976 took a different course. While Congress said that computer programs might be subject to copyright protection, it said this in very general terms; and, especially in § 102(b), Congress adopted a string of exclusions that if taken literally might easily seem to exclude most computer programs from protection. The only detailed prescriptions for computers involve narrow issues (like back-up copies) of no relevance here. Of course, one could still read the statute as a congressional command that the familiar doctrines of copyright law be taken and applied to computer programs, in cookie cutter fashion, as if the programs were novels or play scripts. Some of the cases involving computer programs embody this approach. It seems to be mistaken on two different grounds: the tradition of copyright law, and the likely intent of Congress. The broad-brush conception of copyright protection, the time limits, and the formalities have long been prescribed by statute. But the heart of copyright doctrine--what may be protected and with what limitations and exceptions--has been developed by the courts through experience with individual cases. B. Kaplan, An Unhurried View of Copyright 40 (1967). Occasionally Congress addresses a problem in detail. For the most part the interstitial development of copyright through the courts is our tradition. Nothing in the language or legislative history of the 1976 Act, or at least nothing brought to our attention, suggests that Congress meant the courts to abandon this case-by-case approach. Indeed, by setting up § 102(b) as a counterpoint theme, Congress has arguably recognized the tension and left it for the courts to resolve through the development of case law. And case law development is adaptive: it allows new problems to be solved with help of earlier doctrine, but it does not preclude new doctrines to meet new situations. II. In this case, the raw facts are mostly, if not entirely, undisputed. Although the inferences to be drawn may be more debatable, it is very hard to see that Borland has shown any interest in the Lotus menu except as a fall-back option for those users already committed to it by prior experience or in order to run their own macros using 1-2-3 commands. At least for the amateur, accessing the Lotus menu in the Borland Quattro or Quattro Pro program takes some effort. Put differently, it is unlikely that users who value the Lotus menu for its own sake--independent of any investment they have made themselves in learning Lotus' commands or creating macros dependent upon them--would choose the Borland program in order to secure access to the Lotus menu. Borland's success is due primarily to other features. Its rationale for deploying the Lotus menu bears the ring of truth. Now, any use of the Lotus menu by Borland is a commercial use and deprives Lotus of a portion of its ``reward,'' in the sense that an infringement claim if allowed would increase Lotus' profits. But this is circular reasoning: broadly speaking, every limitation on copyright or privileged use diminishes the reward of the original creator. Yet not every writing is copyrightable or every use an infringement. The provision of reward is one concern of copyright law, but it is not the only one. If it were, copyrights would be perpetual and there would be no exceptions. The present case is an unattractive one for copyright protection of the menu. The menu commands (e.g., ``print,'' ``quit'') are largely for standard procedures that Lotus did not invent and are common words that Lotus cannot monopolize. What is left is the particular combination and sub-grouping of commands in a pattern devised by Lotus. This arrangement may have a more appealing logic and ease of use than some other configurations; but there is a certain arbitrariness to many of the choices. If Lotus is granted a monopoly on this pattern, users who have learned the command structure of Lotus 1-2-3 or devised their own macros are locked into Lotus, just as a typist who has learned the QWERTY keyboard would be the captive of anyone who had a monopoly on the production of such a keyboard. Apparently, for a period Lotus 1-2-3 has had such sway in the market that it has represented the de facto standard for electronic spreadsheet commands. So long as Lotus;is the superior spreadsheet--either in quality or in price--there may be nothing wrong with this advantage. But if a better spreadsheet comes along, it is hard to see why customers who have learned the Lotus menu and devised macros for it should remain captives of Lotus because of an investment in learning made by the users and not by Lotus. Lotus has already reaped a substantial reward for being first; assuming that the Borland program is now better, good reasons exist for freeing it to attract old Lotus customers: to enable the old customers to take advantage of a new advance, and to reward Borland in turn for making a better product. If Borland has not made a better product, then customers will remain with Lotus anyway. Thus, for me the question is not whether Borland should prevail but on what basis. Various avenues might be traveled, but the main choices are between holding that the menu is not protectable by copyright and devising a new doctrine that Borland's use is privileged. No solution is perfect and no intermediate appellate court can make the final choice. To call the menu a ``method of operation'' is, in the common use of those words, a defensible position. After all, the purpose of the menu is not to be admired as a work of literary or pictorial art. It is to transmit directions from the user to the computer, i.e., to operate the computer. The menu is also a ``method'' in the dictionary sense because it is a ``planned way of doing something,'' an ``order or system,'' and (aptly here) an ``orderly or systematic arrangement, sequence or the like.'' Random House Webster's CollegeDictionary 853 (1991). A different approach would be to say that Borland's use is privileged because, in the context already described, it is not seeking to appropriate the advances made by Lotus' menu; rather, having provided an arguably more attractive menu of its own, Borland is merely trying to give former Lotus users an option to exploit their own prior investment in learning or in macros. The difference is that such a privileged use approach would not automatically protect Borland if it had simply copied the Lotus menu (using different codes), contributed nothing of its own, and resold Lotus under the Borland label. The closest analogue in conventional copyright is the fair use doctrine. E.g., Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). Although invoked by Borland, it has largely been brushed aside in this case because the Supreme Court has said that it is ``presumptively'' unavailable where the use is a ``commercial'' one. See id. at 562, 105 S.Ct. at 2231-32. But see Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., ___ U.S. ___ , ___ , 114 S.Ct. 1164, 1174, 127 L.Ed.2d 500 (1994). In my view, this is something less than a definitive answer; ``presumptively'' does not mean ``always'' and, in any event, the doctrine of fair use was created by the courts and can be adapted to new purposes. But a privileged use doctrine would certainly involve problems of its own. It might more closely tailor the limits on copyright protection to the reasons for limiting that protection; but it would entail a host of administrative problems that would cause cost and delay, and would also reduce the ability of the industry to predict outcomes. Indeed, to the extent that Lotus' menu is an important standard in the industry, it might be argued that any use ought to be deemed privileged. In sum, the majority's result persuades me and its formulation is as good, if not better, than any other that occurs to me now as within the reach of courts. Some solutions (e.g., a very short copyright period for menus) are not options at all for courts but might be for Congress. In all events, the choices are important ones of policy, not linguistics, and they should be made with the underlying considerations in view. Footnotes 1 Judge Keeton presided over both the Paperback litigation and this case. 2 Lotus 1-2-3 utilizes a two-line menu; the top line lists the commands from which the user may choose, and the bottom line displays what Lotus calls its ``long prompts.'' The long prompts explain, as a sort of ``help text,'' what the highlighted menu command will do if entered. For example, the long prompt for the ``Worksheet'' command displays the submenu that the ``Worksheet'' command calls up; it reads ``Global, Insert, Delete, Column, Erase, Titles, Window, Status, Page.'' The long prompt for the ``Copy'' command explains what function the ``Copy'' command will perform: ``Copy a cell or range of cells.'' The long prompt for the ``Quit'' command reads, ``End 1-2-3 session (Have you saved your work?).'' Prior to trial, the parties agreed to exclude the copying of the long prompts from the case; Lotus agreed not to contend that Borland had copied the long prompts, Borland agreed not to argue that it had not copied the long prompts, and both sides agreed not to argue that the issue of whether Borland had copied the long prompts was material to any other issue in the case. See Borland III, 831 F.Supp. at 208. 3 Because Borland's programs could no longer display the Lotus menu command hierarchy to users, the Key Reader did not allow debugging or modification of macros, nor did it permit the execution of most interactive macros. 4 See Borland IV, 831 F.Supp. at 226-27, for a more detailed explanation of macros and the Key Reader. 5 Computer programs receive copyright protection as ``literary works.'' See 17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(1) (granting protection to ``literary works'') and 17 U.S.C. § 101 (defining ``literary works'' as ``works . . . expressed in words, numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied'' (emphasis added)); see also H.R.Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 54 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5667 (``The term `literary works' . . . includes computer data bases, and computer programs to the extent that they incorporate authorship in the programmer's expression of original ideas, as distinguished from the ideas themselves.''). 6 Selden's system of double-entry bookkeeping is the now almost-universal T-accounts system. 7 We consider the Altai test because both parties and many of the amici focus on it so heavily. Borland, in particular, is highly critical of the district court for not employing the Altai test. Borland does not, however, indicate how using that test would have been dispositive in Borland's favor. Interestingly, Borland appears to contradict its own reasoning at times by criticizing the applicability of the Altai test. 8 We recognize that Altai never states that every work contains a copyrightable ``nugget'' of protectable expression. Nonetheless, the implication is that for literal copying, ``it is not necessary to determine the level of abstraction at which similarity ceases to consist of an `expression of ideas,' because literal similarity by definition is always a similarity as to the expression of ideas.'' 3 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 13.03[A](2) (1993). 9 As the Lotus long prompts are not before us on appeal, we take no position on their copyrightability, although we do note that a strong argument could be made that the brief explanations they provide ``merge'' with the underlying idea of explaining such functions. See Morrissey v. Procter & Gamble Co., 379 F.2d 675, 678-79 (1st Cir. 1967) (when the possible ways to express an idea are limited, the expression ``merges'' with the idea and is therefore uncopyrightable; when merger occurs, identical copying is permitted). 10 As they are not before us on appeal, we take no position on whether the Lotus 1-2-3 screen displays constitute original expression capable of being copyrighted. 11 Because the Lotus 1-2-3 code is not before us on appeal, we take no position on whether it is copyrightable. We note, however, that original computer codes generally are protected by copyright. See, e.g., Altai, 982 F.2d at 702 (``It is now well settled that the literal elements of computer programs, i.e., their source and object codes, are the subject of copyright protection.'') (citing cases). 12 We think that the Altai test would contemplate this being the initial inquiry. 13 When there are a limited number of ways to express an idea, however, the expression ``merges'' with the idea and becomesuncopyrightable. Morrissey, 379 F.2d at 678-79. 14 The Ninth Circuit has also indicated in dicta that ``menus, and keystrokes'' may be copyrightable. Brown Bag Software v. Symantec Corp., 960 F.2d 1465, 1477 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, BB Asset Management, Inc. v. Symantec Corp., ___ U.S. ___ , 113 S.Ct. 198, 121 L.Ed.2d 141 (1992). In that case, however, the plaintiff did not show that the defendant had copied the plaintiff's menus or keystrokes, so the court was not directly faced with whether the menus or keystrokes constituted an unprotectable method of operation.

Zeidenberg in the District Court ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin 908 F. Supp. 640 1996 BARBARA B. CRABB, District Judge This is a civil action for injunctive and monetary relief brought pursuant to the federal Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 - 1010, the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act, Wis. Stat. § 943.70, and Wisconsin contract and tort law. The facts are not in dispute. Defendants Matthew Zeidenberg and Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., a one-person corporation formed by Zeidenberg, purchased copies of plaintiff's Select Phone TM CD-ROM software program, downloaded telephone listings stored on the CD-ROM discs to Zeidenberg's computer and made the listings available to Internet users by placing the data onto an Internet host computer. Plaintiff contends that defendants' actions constitute copyright infringement, breach of the express terms of the parties' software licensing agreement, a violation of Wisconsin's Computer Crimes Act, misappropriation and unfair competition. Defendants argue that the data they downloaded from plaintiff's Select Phone TM program were not protected by copyright, that defendants did not use Select Phone TM in a manner inconsistent with plaintiff's copyright, that they are not bound by the software licensing agreement and that plaintiff's state law claims are preempted by federal copyright law. The case is before the court on the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. Jurisdiction is present under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, because plaintiff's copyright claim arises under federal law, and under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, because there is complete diversity of citizenship among the parties and more than $ 50,000 is at issue. I conclude that defendants are entitled to summary judgment in their favor. First, defendants did not infringe plaintiff's copyright. Although the software plaintiff developed for its Select Phone TM program is protected by copyright, that protection does not extend to the telephone listings included on the CD-ROM discs. Second, defendants used the protected software for their own individual purposes, consistent with plaintiff's copyright, and distributed only unprotected data. Defendants never assented to the license agreement included in the Select Phone TM user guide and are not bound by it. Even if defendants had assented, the license agreement is preempted by federal copyright law to the extent plaintiff intended it to apply to uncopyrightable data. Finally, plaintiff's remaining state law claims are preempted by the Copyright Act because they are attempts to avoid federal copyright law. From the facts proposed by the parties, I find that the following facts are not in dispute. UNDISPUTED FACTS Plaintiff ProCD, Inc., is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Danvers, Massachusetts. Defendant Matthew Zeidenberg is a Wisconsin citizen residing in Madison, Wisconsin, and working on a Ph.D. in computer science. Defendant Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., is a Wisconsin corporation incorporated by defendant Zeidenberg on April 27, 1995, with himself as president and sole shareholder. Plaintiff spent millions of dollars creating a comprehensive, national directory of residential and business listings. Plaintiff compiled over 95,000,000 residential and commercial listings from approximately 3,000 publicly available telephone books. The listings include full names, street addresses, telephone numbers, zip codes and industry or "SIC" codes where appropriate. Plaintiff sells these listings on CD-ROM discs under the trademark "Select Phone TM," as well as under other trade names and trademarks. Each of plaintiff's CD-ROM discs contains both telephone listings and a software program used to access, retrieve and download the data. Plaintiff sells Select Phone TM in boxes containing a set of discs and a user guide. The user guide includes a series of terms entitled, "Single User License Agreement." The agreement states in its opening paragraph: Please read this license carefully before using the software or accessing the listings contained on the discs. By using the discs and the listings licensed to you, you agree to be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not agree to the terms of this License, promptly return all copies of the software, listings that may have been exported, the discs and the User Guide to the place where you obtained it. The license informs the user that plaintiff's software is copyrighted and that copying the software is authorized only for particular purposes and uses. Once the product is installed on the user's computer, the computer screens remind users that use of the product and the data is subject to the Single User License Agreement and that the products are licensed for authorized use only. Before a user can access the listings a field appears on the computer screen, stating: The listings contained within this product are subject to a License Agreement. Please refer to the Help menu or to the User Guide. In addition, most screens contain the following warning: The listings on this product are licensed for authorized users only. The user agreement provides that copying of the software and the data may be done only for individual or personal use and that distribution, sublicense or lease of the software or the data is prohibited. The agreement provides expressly that: You will not make the Software or the Listings in whole or in part available to any other user in any networked or time-shared environment, or transfer the Listings in whole or in part to any computer other than the computer used to access the Listings. The Select Phone TM box mentions the agreement in one place in small print. The box does not detail the specific terms of the license. In late 1994, defendant Zeidenberg purchased a copy of Select Phone TM at a local retail store. In February or March 1995, defendant Zeidenberg decided he could download data from Select Phone TM and make it available to third parties over the Internet for commercial purposes. Zeidenberg purchased an updated version of Select Phone TM in March 1995 and in April 1995, incorporated Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc. for the purpose of making a database of telephone listings available over the Internet. In April and May 1995, after incorporation, Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., began assembling its own telephone listings database, part of which contained data from Select Phone TM and part of which involved data from another company's product. Defendants were aware of the computer screen warning message notifying them that Select Phone TM was subject to the agreement contained in the user guide. Defendants disregarded the screen warnings because they did not believe the license to be binding. Defendant Zeidenberg is the sole shareholder, sole employee and sole officer of defendant Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc. Defendants compiled their database by installing Select Phone TM on Zeidenberg's personal computer, thereby making a copy of the software onto Zeidenberg's computer's hard drive. Defendants used the software on this hard disk copy to download data from the Select Phone TM discs to contribute to the corporation's own database. Every time defendants downloaded data from the discs, an additional copy of Select Phone TM software was copied into the random access memory (RAM) of Zeidenberg's computer. Defendant Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., wrote its own computer program to allow users to search its database. No person who accessed the Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc. home page used or copied plaintiff's Select Phone TM software. The software that defendants created permits searches based only on name or standard industrial code while plaintiff's software can search a number of "fields," such as name, address, telephone number, area code, zip code, or any combination of the above. In May 1995, defendants entered into a contract with Branch Information Systems pursuant to which Branch provided defendants with access to the Internet. Defendants uploaded their database onto Branch Information Systems' computer and provided access to the database to third parties via the Internet. Plaintiff discovered this activity and demanded that defendants discontinue their actions immediately. Zeidenberg wrote to plaintiff and admitted downloading listings from Select Phone TM and making some of those listings available over the Internet but explained that he would continue his project. After learning of plaintiff's displeasure, Branch Information Services stopped doing business with defendants. In August 1995, defendants entered into a contract with Ivory Tower Information Services for Internet access. The parties contemplated that plaintiff would complain and they provided in the contract that Ivory Tower Information Services was required to continue providing defendants Internet access until ordered by a court to stop. Pursuant to this contract, defendants made their database available over the Internet until this court issued a preliminary injunction on September 22, 1995. Prior to entry of the preliminary injunction, defendants' database was receiving approximately 20,000 "hits" per day on the Internet. (A hit occurs each time a new screen is displayed on a user's computer screen during a search of the database. Each search tends to generate multiple hits.) For each search of defendants' database, users are permitted to extract up to 1,000 listings. Because the public could access defendants' database for free, plaintiff believed its ability to sell Select Phone TM was jeopardized. OPINION Plaintiff commenced this law suit in September 1995 and immediately sought a preliminary injunction barring defendants from distributing Select Phone TM telephone listings over the Internet. At the hearing on its motion for a preliminary injunction, plaintiff's arguments for protection of its entrepreneurial effort were sufficiently compelling to secure the injunction. Nonetheless, it was dear then, as it is now, that plaintiff had no valid claim to federal copyright protection for the raw data contained on its Select Phone TM CD-ROM discs. Now, after the parties have briefed the issues more fully, it has become evident that plaintiff cannot prevail on its copyright claim even with respect to its protected software and that its state law claims are similarly unavailing. Plaintiff's arguments boil down to the proposition that it is unfair and commercially destructive to allow defendants to take the information plaintiff assembled with a significant investment of time, effort and money and use it for commercial purposes without paying any compensation to plaintiff. Although the proposition has substantial equitable appeal, it is one that the United States Supreme Court rejected specifically in a nearly identical context four years ago. In Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358, 111 S. Ct. 1282 (1991), the court held that telephone listings are not protected by copyright law and denied the claim of a telephone company that sought to prevent competitors from using the data it had compiled and published in its directories. If this result seems perverse, the remedy lies with Congress. See Maureen A. O'Rourke, 41 Fed. B. News & J. 511 (1994) (rapidly expanding Internet use will force Congress to address difficult question of appropriate level of protection for on-line fact-based databases); Jane C. Ginsburg, No "Sweat"? Copyright and Other Protection of Works of Information after Feist v. Rural Telephone, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 338 (suggesting a federal misappropriation statute to prevent commercial copying of non-copyrightable databases by other compilers if public access to information were assured through collective licensing). It is not surprising that the recent explosive growth of the Internet would give rise to lawsuits concerning the ownership of the data available through that system. See Jane C. Ginsburg, Putting Cars on the "Information Superhighway": Authors, Exploiters, and Copyright in Cyberspace, 95 Colum. L. Rev. 1466 (1995). Defendant Zeidenberg is not the first computer student to find himself involved in a legal dispute after downloading information and offering it over the Internet. In United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994), a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student set up a computer bulletin board and encouraged his correspondents to upload copyrighted software that other users could download for free. The United States charged the student with criminal copyright infringement under the federal wire fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343. The district court noted the impropriety of the defendant's actions but held that his conduct was not punishable under the wire fraud statute; copyright law provided the full range of penalties for criminal infringement actions and copyright law did not cover defendant's noncommercial activities. Id. at 544-45. The LaMacchia decision appears to have generated congressional interest. On August 4, 1995, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced a bill (S. 1122) to ensure better copyright protection for creative works available on line. Bill to Stiffen Criminal Penalties for Copyright Infringement Introduced, 7 Journal of Proprietary Rights 26 (1995). The executive branch is also well aware of these problems. A presidential study group formed in 1993 recently released a report entitled, "Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure." The report suggests that the Internet will not flourish if significant protection against theft and copyright abuse is not offered. Guy Alvarez, New Legal Issues on the Net, Am. Law. 28, 29 (Dec. Supp. 1995). Against this background, I will take up plaintiff's federal copyright claim. A. Copyright Infringement Select Phone TM is comprised of two elements: 1) the software that allows users to access and retrieve the data contained on the CD-ROM discs; and 2) the data itself. The difference between these two elements is critical. Plaintiff contends that defendants infringed plaintiff's copyright when they copied and used Select Phone TM for purposes of commercially distributing the listings on the Internet because copyright protection extends to both the telephone listings and to its software. Defendants argue that the Select Phone TM data is not copyrightable but acknowledge that plaintiff has a valid copyright in the Select Phone TM software. Nonetheless, defendants contend, copyright law permits them to make a copy of the program as long as it is essential to their personal use of the program and is not used in a manner inconsistent with plaintiff's copyright. 1. Select Phone TM data In Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co. Inc., 499 U.S. 340, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358, 111 S. Ct. 1282, the Supreme Court held that a telephone company's white pages were not entitled to copyright protection because the raw data contained in the listings were not arranged in an original manner and lacked the minimal degree of creativity necessary to constitute a copyrightable compilation of facts. Id. at 362. As the Court noted, Feist concerned "the interaction of two well-established propositions. The first is that facts are not copyrightable; the other, that compilations of facts generally are." Id. at 344. Even a modicum of originality may suffice to make a compilation of fact copyrightable, but the alphabetical listing of telephone subscriber addresses and telephone numbers does not achieve even this minimal degree of creativity. Id. at 345. To the argument that it was unfair for the publishing company to use the fruits of the telephone company's labor without compensating it, the Court gave short shrift. "The primary objective of copyright is not to reward the labor of authors, but 'to promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts.'" Id. at 349 (citing U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 8). In reaching this conclusion, the Court rejected a line of cases applying a "sweat of the brow" theory that offered copyright protection to factual compilations as a reward for the hard work that goes into compiling facts. Id. at 352. The Court explained that the 1976 Copyright Act overruled the "sweat of the brow" cases. Id. at 354-55. The Court's overruling of the sweat of the brow" theory can be viewed as implementation of Congressional intent with respect to federal copyright law. Plaintiff does not suggest that the phone listings contained in Select Phone are any different from those in Feist for purposes of copyright protection. As a collection of facts arranged in a commonplace, non-original fashion, the Select Phone TM listings themselves are not copyrightable. Without originality, time and effort do not factor into the copyright equation. Feist's result may well serve as a disincentive to companies considering the compilation of factual databases, see Philip H. Miller, Note, Life after Feist: Facts, the First Amendment and the Copyright Status of Automated Databases, 60 Fordham L. Rev. 507, 521-23 (1991) (Feist chills incentive to create databases), but Feist struck the "careful balance" between fact and expression in copyright law by allowing facts to be copied at will in order to advance the development of science and art. That disincentives might result was not considered important. 2. Select Phone TM software Although the Select Phone TM data are not protected by federal copyright law, the protection attaches to the software component, which does represent original expression and creativity. The question is whether defendants infringed this copyright by copying the Select Phone TM software to Zeidenberg's computer's hard drive for the purpose of offering the telephone listings over the Internet. If, as defendants argue, they copied the software only for personal use and never distributed the software to third parties, they may be entitled to the exception from infringement set out in 17 U.S.C. § 117. Section 501 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 501, proscribes any unauthorized copying of a copyrighted work. A claim for copyright infringement requires proof of 1) plaintiff's ownership of a valid copyright; and 2) defendant's copying of original elements of plaintiff's work. Wildlife Express Corp. v. Carol Wright Sales, Inc., 18 F.3d 502, 507 (7th Cir. 1994). Section 117 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 117, offers an important exception to restrictions on copying protected computer software. It provides, in relevant part: It is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer program to make. . . another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided: (1) that such new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner. Congress passed § 117 in 1980 in recognition of the fact that computer users might need to make copies of computer software in order to utilize that software. Apple Computer, Inc. v. Formula Int'l, Inc., 594 F. Supp. 617, 621 (C.D. Cal.), aff'd, 725 F.2d 521 (9th Cir. 1984). Although legislative history surrounding the passage of § 117 is sparse, it appears that Congress sought to implement the recommendations of CONTU, the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyright Works. Aymes v. Bonelli, 47 F.3d 23, 26 (2d Cir. 1995) (citing H.R. Rep. No. 1307, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., Pt. I, at 23 (1980), reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6460, 6482). CONTU suggested that: The intent of that section [117] is to provide a legitimate holder of a computer program with permission to do that copying of the program which is necessary for him to be able to use it in his computer without running afoul of possible infringement actions. Apple Computer, 594 F. Supp. at 621 (citing CONTU Meeting No. 19 at 98-99 (Jan. 1978)). The parties' dispute focuses on the scope and meaning of the term, "essential step." Plaintiff would interpret it as not extending to the copying of Select Phone TM onto a computer's hard drive. Plaintiff contends that making a copy of Select Phone TM on a hard drive was not "essential" to defendants' use of the program: they could have utilized the program by booting it into RAM memory every time they desired to use it. According to plaintiff, hard drive copies are not protected under § 117. RAM is an acronym for Random Access Memory and represents that part of a computer's memory in which data and computer programs can be recorded temporarily. When a computer is turned off, the information stored in RAM is lost. See Apple Computer, 594 F. Supp. at 622. A number of courts have determined that RAM copies of a computer program are copies for the purposes of § 117. See MAI Sys. Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511, 518 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 126 L. Ed. 2d 640, 114 S. Ct. 671 (1994); Advanced Computer Services of Michigan, Inc., v. MAI Sys. Corp., 845 F. Supp. 356, 363, 364 n.9 (E.D. Va. 1994) (collecting cases); Apple Computer, 594 F. Supp. at 622. However, none of these courts has held that hard drive copies made for an owner's individual use are not equally "essential" under the rubric of § 117. Plaintiff's logic would lead to the conclusion that any copying of a computer program onto the owner's hard drive would constitute copyright infringement unless the program developer gave the owner specific authorization to make a hard drive copy. This conclusion conflicts with both basic patterns of computer use in the 1990s and the spirit of § 117. The day has passed when it was necessary to insert a floppy disk in a disk drive any time a user wanted access to a particular program. Today, computer users store many of their programs on hard drives and access them from that part of the computer's permanent memory. Programs on CD-ROM can be used more efficiently by installing the program software on a hard drive and then using that hard drive copy in conjunction with a disc inserted in the CD-ROM disc drive. Limiting those copies that are considered "essential" under § 117 to RAM copies would limit the use of computer hard drive copies, flout the purposes of § 117 and diminish the sales appeal of any new program that took advantage of such protection. See Robert A. Kreiss, Section 117 of the Copyright Act, 1991 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 1497, 1524-26 (1991) (contending that position that hard drive copies are not "essential" for purposes of § 117 would create incredible frustration by requiring the continual swapping of floppy disks and should be rejected as "rather ridiculous"). Section 117 is intended to allow persons in rightful possession of copies of a program to use them freely without fear of exposure to copyright liability. Aymes, 47 F.3d at 26 (citing CONTU Final Report at 31 (1978)). If copyright law prevented computer users from making hard drive copies, they would not be able to use their purchased programs without fear of infringement. RAM copies may be essential copies of a computer program but hard drive copies are just as essential for the effective use of today's computer software. Copies permitted by § 117 must be made only for an owner's personal use, Aymes, 47 F.3d at 26. Odd as it may seem, given defendants' subsequent commercial use of the telephone data, the undisputed fact is that defendants made no copies of plaintiff's software except for their own personal use. Defendants did not use the software in an unauthorized fashion as suggested by plaintiffs' citations to Pinkham v. Sara Lee Corp., 983 F.2d 824 (8th Cir. 1992) and Major League Baseball Promotion Corp. v. Colour-Tex, Inc., 729 F. Supp. 1035 (D. N.J. 1990). They used the copyrightable software portion of the product only to access and download the telephone listings data. Defendants did not offer this software over the Internet. Instead, they created a new search program to allow Internet users to access the data. In distributing only the uncopyrightable data over the Internet, defendants did not disqualify themselves from the infringement exception contained in § 117. In reaching the conclusion that defendants did not misuse the copyrightable component of the Select Phone TM program, it is not necessary to adopt the broad proposition asserted by the defendant in Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd., 847 F.2d 255, 261 (5th Cir. 1988), that software purchasers are free under § 117 to make copies of copyrighted software for purposes not intended by the copyright owner. In Vault, the defendant used the plaintiff's software diskettes, designed to prevent the unauthorized duplication of programs placed on them, for the express purpose of devising a means to defeat the diskettes' protective function, rather than for their intended protective purposes. Id. The plaintiff asserted that the phrase "and that it is used in no other manner" in § 117 means that the statute's protection should not extend to copies made for purposes other than those for which the program was intended. Id. The court held that the defendant did not infringe the plaintiff's copyright, finding that § 117 contains no language to suggest that the copy it permits must be put to the use intended by the copyright owner and that no dear congressional intent existed to the contrary. Id. Here, defendants used Select Phone TM exactly as plaintiff intended: to access and download data. There is no obvious reason not to extend the § 117 exception to parties who copy a copyrighted software program for its intended purpose and use it in that manner. Although plaintiff acknowledges the distinction between the copyrighted and noncopyrighted portions of Select Phone TM, it disregards that distinction to some extent. For example, plaintiff argues that defendants' actions are tantamount to downloading all of Lexis's judicial opinions and offering them for free over the Internet. Plaintiff fails to recognize that although federal cases are not copyrightable, at least one court has held that legal database companies like Lexis may arrange those opinions in such a manner as to receive copyright protection. See West Publication Co. v. Mead Data Central, Inc., 799 F.2d 1219 (8th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1070, 93 L. Ed. 2d 1010, 107 S. Ct. 962 (1987) (West's arrangement of legal decisions entails enough intellectual labor and originality to receive copyright protection); but see Craig Joyce and L. Ray Patterson, Monopolizing the Law: The Scope of Copyright Protection for Law Reports and Statutory Compilations, 36 UCLA L. Rev. 719 (1989) (criticizing the West decision). Unlike West's arrangement of judicial opinions, plaintiff's arrangement of telephone listings lacks the minimal level of creativity necessary to gamer copyright protection. See Feist 499 U.S. at 362. Although plaintiff's software is protected by copyright law, its compiled data are not. Because defendants used the software only to download and access the data and did not further distribute this copyrightable information, their actions are protected by § 117. Defendants contend that the fair use doctrine of 17 U.S.C. § 107 provides them the right to make an intermediate copy of a protected work in order to get at the uncopyrighted parts of a work. See Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510, 1520 (9th Cir. 1992); Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 975 F.2d 832, 843 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The fair use doctrine establishes a defense to an otherwise valid copyright infringement claim. Sega, 977 F.2d at 1521. Because I have determined that defendants are protected from a copyright infringement claim by § 117, it is unnecessary to consider whether they should receive § 107 protection as well. B. Software License Agreement Before marketing Select Phone TM, plaintiff recognized the potential limitations of copyright law and included an agreement in the software package that sought to impose limitations concerning the distribution and use of the telephone listings. Plaintiff is not the first software producer to seek to protect itself in this fashion. Software companies have included such agreements, commonly known as "shrinkwrap licenses," with their products since the advent of mass market software. (The term "shrinkwrap" refers to the transparent plastic in which mass market software is encased. Mark A. Lemley, Intellectual Property and Shrinkwrap Licenses, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1239, 1241 (1995)). Shrinkwrap licenses are intended to take the place of any bargains or agreements between mass market software producers and users, because the typical software transaction does not involve bargained agreements concerning use limitations, but a purchase made by a computer user at a retail store or through the mail, with little discussion or bargaining between the producer and the user. In placing a shrinkwrap license provision on its software product, the producer seeks to 1) prohibit unauthorized copies; 2) prohibit software rental; 3) prohibit reverse engineering and modifications to the software; 4) limit the use of software to one central processing unit; 5) disclaim warranties; and 6) limit liability. Lloyd L. Rich, Mass Market Software and the Shrinkwrap License, 23 Colo. Law. 1321 (1994). The widespread use of shrinkwrap licenses has generated intense interest in academic and intellectual property fields, but surprisingly little litigation. See Step-Saver Data Sys., Inc. v. Wyse Technology, 939 F.2d 91 (3d Cir. 1991); Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd., 847 F.2d 255; Arizona Retail Sys., Inc. v. Software Link, Inc., 831 F. Supp. 759 (D. Ariz. 1993). Most commentators view shrinkwrap licenses as being of questionable validity, primarily because software users do not have an opportunity to bargain over their terms. See Lemley, supra, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev. at 1263 n. 107 (citing articles). In addition to raising issues of enforceability, shrinkwrap licenses also pose important questions about the extent to which individual contract provisions can supplement or expand federal copyright protection. It is important to analyze these licenses carefully, not only to determine their validity but also to ascertain whether they are preempted by the Copyright Act. 1. The user agreement In addressing shrinkwrap licenses, the starting point is how to treat a sale of software: as a sale of goods under Article II of the Uniform Commercial Code or as a "license" to the user. Most courts have chosen the first route and have applied the U.C.C. to mass market software transactions. Lemley, supra, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev. at 1244 n.23 (citing numerous federal and state law cases); but see Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Computers & Electronics, Inc., 846 F. Supp. 208 (E.D. N.Y. 1994). Commentators agree that the U.C.C. should apply to computer software transactions. See Bonna Lynn Horovitz, Note, Computer Software as a Good Under the Uniform Commercial Code: Taking a Byte out of the Intangibility Myth, 65 B.U.L. Rev. 129 (1985); Lemley, supra, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev. at 1244 n.23. I will not address this issue in detail but note only that there are sound reasons for treating a software transaction as a sale of goods under the U.C.C. rather than as a license: purchasers of mass market software do not make periodic payments but instead pay a single purchase price, the software company does not retain title for the purpose of a security interest and no set expiration date exists for the "licensed" right. See Gary W. Hamilton & Jeffrey C. Hood, The Shrink-Wrap License--Is It Really Necessary?, 10 Computer Law 16 (1993). Plaintiff cites only Microsoft Corp., 846 F. Supp. 208, in support of its characterization of the transaction as a license. The opinion is not persuasive. The court did not address the applicability of the U.C.C. in holding that Microsoft licenses rather than sells its products. Id. at 213. Plaintiff is no more convincing when it argues that the courts have applied the U.C.C. to software transactions only when a sale of hardware is involved. See, e.g., Advent Sys. Ltd. v. Unisys Corp., 925 F.2d 670, 676 (3d Cir. 1991)(". . . we hold that software is a "good" within the definition in the Code). In analyzing the parties' transaction, I will apply the U.C.C., as adopted by Wisconsin. (For ease of uniform reference, I will cite the relevant U.C.C. provisions, pointing out the specific Wisconsin statutory provisions where necessary.) Before examining the application of the U.C.C. to plaintiff's user agreement, I note two cases that plaintiff cites in support of its argument that its user agreement is binding on defendants. Barazzotto v. Intelligent Sys., Inc., 40 Ohio App. 3d 117, 532 N.E.2d 148 (1987); McCrimmon v. Tandy Corp., 202 Ga. App. 233, 414 S.E.2d 15 (1991), cert. denied, 1992 Ga. LEXIS 88 (Feb. 4, 1992). Barazzotto and McCrimmon deserve only passing mention because neither addresses the issues of this case directly. In Barazzotto, the court held that a manufacturer's disclaimer of liability appearing on software packaging was not binding as to the retail seller. Id. at 120, 532 N.E.2d at 151. The court did not address whether that disclaimer was valid as to the software manufacturer. In McCrimmon, the court enforced a limited warranty included by a retail seller on the back of a sales receipt when the warranty was available for customer inspection prior to purchase, noting that it was the customer's responsibility to read the receipt when it was tendered to him at the time of purchase. Id. at 236, 414 S.E.2d at 18. Defendants did not have the opportunity to inspect the user agreement before purchasing Select Phone TM because it was inside the packaging box and accordingly, they cannot be held to the same standards as those applied in McCrimmon. Plaintiff's argument that defendants had the opportunity to inspect the Select Phone TM user agreement after their first purchase and thus should be held to their knowledge of the agreement on their second and third purchases will be addressed later. The parties dispute how their transaction should be analyzed under Article II of the U.C.C. and suggest three possibilities. The agreement could be considered an offer subject to the right of inspection under § 2-206, a written confirmation of a previously established contract under § 2-207, or a proposed modification of a contract under § 2-209. Plaintiff argues that § 2-206 should apply, contending that acceptance did not occur at the moment of payment but was subject to defendants' right of inspection and revocation that they did not exercise. In defendants' view, the contract for the sale of Select Phone TM was completed at the time of sale and the license represents additional terms to which they cannot be bound under either § 2-207 or § 2-209. a. Section 2-206 Section 2-206, Wis. Stat. § 402.206, sets forth basic notions of offer and acceptance. Under § 2-206, the placement of a product such as Select Phone on a store shelf constitutes an offer. See, e.g., Barker v. Allied Supermarket, 596 P.2d 870 (Okla. 1979). Acceptance occurs in any manner reasonable under the circumstances. § 2-206(1)(a). Defendants accepted plaintiff's offer to sell Select Phone TM in a reasonable manner at the moment they purchased the product by exchanging money for the program. Peeters v. State, 154 Wis. 111, 142 N.W. 181 (1913) (sales contract results when customer pays purchase price and departs with item). Paying for a software program is a reasonable manner of accepting the offer implicit in the program's display on a store shelf. Defendants' payment for the program constitutes conduct sufficient to create a contract under § 2-204, Wis. Stat. § 402.204, the U.C.C. provision governing initial contract formation, which states that: A contract for the sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract. Plaintiff cannot reasonably expect that further action from defendants would be required to make that sales contract binding. The purchase of the product was sufficient to show agreement between the parties. Plaintiff argues that defendants' acceptance of the software was contingent upon their rights of inspection, rejection or revocation, but §§ 2-204 and 2-206 do not mention any such rights. Sections 2-602 and 2-608, Wis. Stat. §§ 402.602 and 402.608, offer such rights, yet these sections do not apply in this context. Section 2-602 grants buyers receiving a tender or delivery of goods an opportunity to inspect the goods before accepting. It guarantees that buyers will not be saddled with goods that have been damaged or are otherwise unsatisfactory upon arrival, but it does not create a right to inspect additional written contractual terms. Inspection of new contractual terms is covered under other sections of the U.C.C. See U.C.C. §§ 2-207 and 2-209. Section 2-608 allows a purchaser to revoke his acceptance when the goods' nonconformity with the contract substantially impairs their value. H.B. Fuller Co. v. Kinetic Sys., Inc., 932 F.2d 681 (7th Cir. 1991). Again, the provision exists to offer buyers some form of protection when purchased items do not serve their intended purpose. Defendants do not contend that the Select Phone TM product failed to work as they thought it would. Rather, their dispute concerns the manner in which the contract limits their use of the product and, as such, is more appropriately viewed under § 2-207 or § 2-209. Plaintiff cites one case in support of its argument that § 2-206 should apply, Sherkate Sahami Khass Rapol v. Henry R. Jahn & Son, Inc., 531 F. Supp. 1048, 1054-1055 (S.D. N.Y. 1982), rev'd on other grounds, 701 F.2d 1049 (2d Cir. 1983), but the case does not bolster its argument. Sherkate only reiterates the language of the U.C.C. as it applies to shipments of goods and does not suggest that these provisions should apply to the inspection of contractual terms. b. Sections 2-207 and 2-209 The application of sections 2-207 and 2-209, Wis. Stat. §§ 402.207 and 402.209, is best analyzed by examining Step-Saver Data Sys., Inc., 939 F.2d 91, and Arizona Retail Sys., Inc., 831 F. Supp. 759, the two leading cases on the enforceability of shrinkwrap licenses. Neither case involved the type of transaction between a computer user and a software producer that took place in this case when defendants purchased mass market software at a retail outlet. Nonetheless, in both cases, the courts reached the conclusion that the shrinkwrap licenses at issue should be invalidated. The cases provide insight into the application of the U.C.C. to the Select Phone TM user agreement. The facts of Step-Saver and Arizona Retail are quite similar. Each case involved a series of transactions between retail computer stores and a software company named The Software Link, Inc. In Step-Saver, 939 F.2d 91, the retail store telephoned The Software Link and offered to purchase a specific software program. The Software Link accepted the offers over the telephone and agreed to ship copies of the program. During these discussions, The Software Link never mentioned any additional terms of the sales contract beyond the agreement to ship the software in exchange for monetary consideration. Id. at 96. However, when the software packages arrived they were wrapped in shrinkwrap plastic upon which was affixed a box-top license setting out a number of terms purporting to disclaim warranties and limit remedies. Problems arose with the program and Step-Saver sued to recover damages. The factual background of Arizona Retail, 831 F. Supp. 759, differs only in the initial transaction between the retail store, Arizona Retail, and The Software Link. After Arizona Retail first telephoned to inquire about a specific software program, The Software Link sent two copies of the software, an evaluative copy and a "live" copy. Arizona Retail spent two hours using the evaluative copy, determined it wanted to purchase the program, and then opened the live copy upon which was attached the box-top license. Id. at 761. Subsequently, Arizona Retail purchased additional copies of the software through telephone transactions virtually identical to those in Step Saver. The court considered the initial transaction separately from the subsequent transactions, explaining that the initial offer took place when The Software Link sent a live copy of the software with the evaluation diskette. Id. at 764. The live copy was sealed in an envelope upon which was added the statement that a user acknowledges "acceptance of this product, and [consents] to all the provisions [of] the Limited Use License Agreement" by opening the envelope. The court held that Arizona Retail had accepted The Software Link's offer and a contract was formed when it opened the envelope. Id. The terms of the box-top license were incorporated into that contract because they were visible on the outside of the envelope and Arizona Retail had been exposed to them before the contract was formed. Id. at 763. The court distinguished this situation from the subsequent transactions in that case and from the transactions in Step-Saver, 939 F.2d 91, in all of which a contract was formed and complete at the moment the parties agreed to order and ship goods. In the subsequent transactions, the agreement was formed before Arizona Retail became aware of The Software Link's insistence on the terms of the box-top license and thus those terms could not be considered part of the initial offer. 831 F. Supp. at 763-66. Even though Arizona Retail knew that The Software Link had imposed box-top license provisions in the first sale, the court held that the store did not know that The Software Link would impose box-top license provisions when it placed subsequent orders because The Software Link did not mention any such terms in the parties' telephone conversations. Id. at 764. The court's holding accorded with the holding of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Step-Saver, 939 F.2d at 105-06, that the box-top license terms could not be considered part of The Software Link's initial offer because Step-Saver was not apprised of those terms before the agreement to order and ship software. Because the box-top licenses were not part of the agreements to order and ship software, both the Arizona Retail and Step-Saver courts considered other methods of analyzing the application of the licenses' terms to the parties' contracts. In Step-Saver, the court analyzed the terms under § 2-207, id. at 98 in Arizona Retail, 831 F. Supp. 759, the court determined that § 2-209 was a better fit. Id. at 765. Step-Saver and Arizona Retail suggest two possibilities for analyzing the alleged contract between plaintiff and defendants. One view is that the terms of the user agreement were incorporated into plaintiff's sales offer by the reference on the outside of the Select Phone TM package. If this is the case, then defendants are bound to the terms of the agreement because they opened and used the product, just as Arizona Retail was bound initially to the terms of The Software Link's box-top license. The other view is that the user agreement was not included in plaintiff's sales offer and represents either a proposed modification to the sales agreement under § 2-209 or a written confirmation of a previously established contract under § 2-207. Section 2-207 governs situations in which parties have reached a general agreement but have yet to agree on specific terms desired by one of the parties. Arizona Retail, 831 F. Supp. at 763. Section 2-209 controls the modification of contracts after their formation. Id. In Arizona Retail, 831 F. Supp. 759, the court considered the terms of the box-top license binding on Arizona Retail in the initial transaction because those terms were visible to Arizona Retail before it opened the software envelope. It is evident from the court's citation to McCrimmon v. Tandy Corporation, 202 Ga. App. 233, 414 S.E.2d 15, in which a purchaser was held to a warranty disclaimer he had the opportunity to read before making his purchase, that the court believed that the terms must be made apparent before contract formation. 831 F. Supp. at 764, 765 n.3 (warranty disclaimers in McCrimmon made apparent to buyer at time of acceptance rather than afterwards). In Step-Saver, 939 F.2d 91, the court acknowledged the importance of exposure to specific terms when it noted the "well-established distinction between conspicuous disclaimers made available before the contract is formed and disclaimers made available only after the contract is formed." Id. at 104-105, n. 45. The terms of the Select Phone TM user agreement were not presented to defendants at the time of sale. The sole reference to the user agreement was a disclosure in small print at the bottom of the package, stating that defendants were subject to the terms and conditions of the enclosed license agreement. Defendants did not receive the Opportunity to inspect or consider those terms. Mere reference to the terms at the time of initial contract formation does not present buyers an adequate opportunity to decide whether they are acceptable. They must be able to read and consider the terms in their entirety. The potential incorporation of the terms can occur only after the purchaser opens the package and has a reasonable opportunity to inspect the user agreement. Sections 2-207 or 2-209 control that incorporation. Plaintiff argues that even if the user agreement was not incorporated into its initial sales offer, defendants should have known about the user agreement after the initial purchase and should be subject to its terms in subsequent purchases. In Step-Saver, 939 F.2d at 104, the court rejected this argument, recognizing that exposure to proposed terms in previous transactions did not change the fact that these terms were not agreed to at the time of subsequent contract formations. The court explained that it would be unjust to allow a seller that failed in its attempt to incorporate certain terms into an initial contract to hold the buyer to the same terms in subsequent transactions without first receiving the buyer's express assent. The court held that it was reasonable for Step-Saver to believe from The Software Link's shipment of software without any mention of terms that the manufacturer had agreed to do business without the box-top license terms. Id. Surprisingly, in Arizona Retail, 831 F. Supp. 759, the court did not confront the significance of Arizona Retail's knowledge of the box-top license terms as applied to the subsequent software transactions although it had drawn a distinction between the initial and subsequent transactions. Nonetheless, the court's opinion makes apparent its belief that express assent is required to terms that are not specifically made part of an agreement. Id. at 766. The decision on this issue is a dose call. Defendants may have known the exact terms of the user agreement at the time of their second and third purchases of Select Phone TM. In that case, I would not find it inherently "unjust," as did the court in Step-Saver, to hold a party to the terms a seller incorporates into a standard form contract. However, I would agree with that court that it is unwise to hold a buyer to those terms when software companies are free to change the terms of their shrinkwrap licenses between initial and later versions of their products. Like any other parties to a contract, computer users should be given the opportunity to review the terms to which they will be bound each and every time they contract. Although not all users will read the terms anew each time under such circumstances, it does not follow that they should not be given this opportunity. Defendants cannot be held to the user agreement included with the second and third copies of Select Phone TM they purchased merely because they were aware of the terms included with the initial version. Each software purchase creates a new contract. Computer users should be given a fresh opportunity to review any terms to which those contracts will bind them. It is unnecessary to consider in detail the distinctions between §§ 2-207 and 2-209 because the terms of the user agreement are not binding on defendants regardless which section is applied. See Arizona Retail, 831 F. Supp. at 766 (Arizona Retail not bound by license agreement under either § 2-207 or § 2-209). The court determined that the license agreement was best seen as a proposed modification of the parties' sales contract under § 2-209 and ruled that the terms of that agreement were not effective because Arizona Retail had never assented to them. Id. at 765. Section 2-209 requires the express assent of a party to any proposed contractual modifications. Assent cannot be inferred from a party's conduct in continuing with an agreement. Id. at 759; Step-Saver, 939 F.2d at 98-99. In this case, defendants did not assent expressly to the terms of the user agreement. Their continued use of the Select Phone TM product has no bearing on whether they accepted the user agreement. Under these circumstances, § 2-209 does not warrant the incorporation of the user agreement into the parties' initial sales agreement. In Step-Saver, 939 F.2d 91, the court discussed at length the application of § 2-207 to the software transactions between Step-Saver and The Software Link, noting that § 2-207 was intended to end a "battle of forms" between merchants that took place under common law because a party was bound to the terms of the last sent form if it proceeded to perform the contract after receiving that form. Id. at 99. Under § 2-207(2), the terms proposed in such forms are to be considered proposals for addition to the contract. These terms become binding on merchants unless certain important conditions are met. Section 2-207 is silent on how additional terms should be construed in a transaction between a merchant and a consumer. Keeping in mind the legislative goal behind § 2-207, it is improbable to think that the drafters wanted consumers to be held to additional proposed terms in situations in which merchants were given protection. Because § 2-207 is concerned primarily with contract wars between merchants, it is preferable to analyze the Select Phone TM user agreement under § 2-209. Nonetheless, applying § 2-207 to the consumer transaction in this case still leads to the conclusion that the user agreement was not binding on defendants because they never agreed to it expressly and it never became part of the agreement between the parties. I conclude that because defendants did not have the opportunity to bargain or object to the proposed user agreement or even review it before purchase and they did not assent to the terms explicitly after they learned of them, they are not bound by the user agreement. c. Draft section 2-2203 The American Law Institute, drafters of proposed new U.C.C. provisions, has suggested a provision, § 2-2203, that would make standard form licenses enforceable if: (a) . . . prior to or within a reasonable time after beginning to use the intangible pursuant to an agreement, the party (1) signs or otherwise by its behavior manifests assent to a standard form license; and (2) had an opportunity to review the terms of the license before manifesting assent, whether or not it actually reviewed the terms. Lemley, supra, 68 S. Cal. L. Rev. at 1293. This proposal is evidence that the American Law Institute views current law as insufficient to guarantee the enforcement of standard form contracts such as shrinkwrap licenses. The draft provision appears to introduce a § 2-206 type of inspection, rejection and revocation element into shrinkwrap contracts and thereby place significant responsibility on buyers to actively reject those terms by returning the goods if they find the terms unacceptable. Louisiana and Illinois enacted similar legislative schemes in the 1980s but they are no longer in effect. David A. Rice, Public Goods, Private Contract and Public Policy: Federal Preemption of Software License Prohibitions Against Reverse Engineering, 53 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 543, 565 (1992). The Louisiana statute was partially invalidated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on federal preemption grounds, Vault Corp., 847 F.2d at 270, and Illinois repealed its law. Id. If the draft provision gains substantial acceptance among the states, the application of the U.C.C. to shrinkwrap licenses may no longer require detailed consideration. In that event, federal preemption concerns will become even more prominent. I turn next to that issue. C. Preemption of State Law Claims Section 301 governs preemption of state law claims that conflict with the federal copyright policies embedded in the federal Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C. § 301. It comes into play only if both of two conditions are satisfied: 1) the work in which the state law right is asserted comes within the "subject matter" of copyright, as specified in 17 U.S.C. §§ 102 or 103; and 2) the state law right asserted is equivalent to any of the rights specified in 17 U.S.C. § 106. Baltimore Orioles v. Major League Baseball Players, 805 F.2d 663, 674 (7th Cir. 1986). 1. Subject matter of copyright Plaintiff begins with the proposition that if defendants are correct in arguing that the Select Phone TM data compilation cannot be copyrighted, it follows as a matter of course that the data are outside the subject matter of the federal copyright law. The line is not so clear as plaintiff would draw it. Section 102 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 102, extends copyright protection to original works of authorship including literary, musical, dramatic and a number of other types of works. Factual compilations are included within the subject matter of copyright by 17 U.S.C. § 103 and are defined elsewhere in the act as a collection of data or materials arranged in such a way as to constitute an original work of authorship. 17 U.S.C. § 101. The law in this circuit is that the "subject matter of copyright" includes works that fit within the general subject matter of §§ 102 and 103, whether or not the works qualify for actual protection. See Baltimore Orioles v. Major League Baseball Players. 805 F.2d 663. The question in the Baltimore Orioles case was whether major league baseball clubs owned exclusive rights to the televised performances of the players during major league baseball games. Id. at 665. The players argued that they had a state law right of publicity in their performances; the clubs contended that federal copyright law preempted this state law right. The court rejected the players' argument that because their performances lacked sufficient creativity and were not copyrightable, they fell outside the subject matter of copyright. In concluding that a work can fall within the subject matter of copyright even if it lacks any creativity or originality, the court relied on a House of Representatives report: "As long as a work fits within one of the general subject matter categories of section 102 and 103,. . . [section 301(a)] prevents the States from protecting it even if it fails to achieve Federal copyright because it is too minimal or lacking in originality to qualify." Id. at 676 (citing H.R.Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 51 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5747). Other courts have ruled similarly. See Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 723 F.2d 195, 201 (2d Cir. 1983), rev'd on other grounds, 471 U.S. 539, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588, 105 S. Ct. 2218 (1985) (accepting opposite position would allow states to "expand the perimeters of copyright protection to their own liking" and would "run directly afoul of one of the Copyright Act's central purposes, to 'avoid the development of any vague borderline areas between State and Federal protection.'" (citing H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5746)); Ehat v. Tanner, 780 F.2d 876, 877 (10th Cir. 1985), cert. denied 479 U.S. 820, 93 L. Ed. 2d 39, 107 S. Ct. 86 (1986) (Congress stated expressly that § 301 is intended to prevent "the States from protecting . . . [a work] even if it fails to achieve Federal statutory copyright because it is too minimal or lacking in originality to qualify") (citing H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5747). See also Nash v. CBS, Inc., 704 F. Supp. 823, 832 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (state law claims do not avoid preemption simply because they are based upon improper use of uncopyrightable material contained in works properly subject to copyright). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit touched on this issue in United States Trotting Ass'n v. Chicago Downs Ass'n, Inc., 665 F.2d 781 (7th Cir. 1981). The court held that a misappropriation claim was not preempted because it did not fall within the realm of federal copyright law. Id. at 786 n.6. Although the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit did not mention United States Trotting Ass'n in Baltimore Orioles, its decision in the latter case seems to overrule any suggestion in United States Trotting Ass'n that uncopyrightable material cannot fall within the subject matter of copyright law. In Baltimore Orioles, 805 F.2d 663, the court muted the full impact of its holding by noting that regardless of the originality of the players' performances, the recordings of the games were original enough to come within the scope of copyright law because of the creative contributions of the announcers. Id. at 676. Plaintiff would like this court to believe that by hedging its decision in this manner, the court left open the question whether uncopyrightable material can fall within the subject matter of copyright. Its argument is unpersuasive in light of the court's reliance on explicit congressional intent and the holdings of the other circuits. Plaintiff notes that the Nimmer treatise criticizes the court's holding in Baltimore Orioles on this issue, proposing that it was confused over which works fall within the subject matter of copyright. David Nimmer & Melville B. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright, § 1.01[B] at 1-24, n.101 (1995). The Nimmers' views notwithstanding, Baltimore Orioles is still good case law in this circuit and I am bound to apply it. The telephone listings on the Select Phone TM CD-ROM discs are a compilation of facts that would qualify for copyright protection under § 103 if they were sufficiently original; that they lack the necessary originality does not affect their status as coming within the subject matter of copyright. Baltimore Orioles compels the conclusion that plaintiff's uncopyrightable compilation of telephone data satisfies the first prong of the preemption test. 2. Equivalency of asserted rights to rights specified in § 106 A right is equivalent to one of the rights set forth in § 106 if it "is infringed by the mere act of reproduction, performance, distribution or display." Baltimore Orioles, 805 F.2d at 677 (citing Nimmer, supra, § 1.01[B][1]). To avoid preemption, a cause of action defined by state law must incorporate an "extra element" beyond those necessary to prove copyright infringement. Trandes Corp. v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., 996 F.2d 655, 659 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 126 L. Ed. 2d 377, 114 S. Ct. 443 (1993). Section 106 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 106, grants the owner of a copyright exclusive rights of reproduction and distribution. The causes of action on which plaintiff's state law claims are based are designed to protect these same reproduction and distribution rights. As such, plaintiff's asserted state law rights are equivalent to rights provided by § 106 and its state law claims are preempted under § 301. a. Contract claim Several federal courts have held that breach of contract claims are not preempted by § 301 of the Copyright Act because breach of contract is not a cause of action "equivalent" to a copyright infringement claim. National Car Rental Sys., Inc. v. Computer Associates Int'l Inc., 991 F.2d 426, 433 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 126 L. Ed. 2d 136, 114 S. Ct. 176 (1993); Taquino v. Teledyne Monarch Rubber, 893 F.2d 1488, 1501 (5th Cir. 1990); Acorn Structures, Inc. v. Swantz, 846 F.2d 923, 926 (4th Cir. 1988); Trenton v. Infinity Broadcasting Corp., 865 F. Supp. 1416, 1429 (C.D. Cal. 1994). Plaintiff argues that the contractual restriction imposed in its user agreement established an "extra element" that makes its breach of contract claim different from its copyright infringement claim but, in reality, its breach of contract claim is nothing more than an effort to prevent defendants from copying and distributing its data, exactly what it sought to bar defendants from doing under copyright law. See Ehat, 780 F.2d at 878. The "extra element" test used to determine whether a state law right is equivalent to a right protected by copyright law requires more than the mere existence of an extra element in the state law claim. It requires an extra element that makes the state law claim qualitatively different from the underlying copyright claim. See Data General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36 F.3d 1147, 1164 (1st Car. 1994) ("Not every 'extra element' of a state claim will establish a qualitative variance between the rights protected by federal copyright law and those protected by state law"); Harper & Row Publishers, 723 F.2d at 201 (additional elements did not establish a fundamental nonequivalence between state and federal rights implicated); Rice, supra, 53 U. Pitt. L. Rev. at 616 (Section 301 concerned with effects, not form). Each of the breach of contract cases plaintiff cites involved the assertion of rights significantly different from the reproduction and distribution rights protected under copyright law. In National Car Rental, 991 F.2d 426, the plaintiff licensed the defendant to use its software for internal operations and for the processing of the defendant's data. When the defendant used the software to process the data of a third party, the plaintiff sued, contending that the defendant used the software in a manner outside the bounds of the contract. Id. at 428. The court found that the agreement created a right that did not exist under copyright law, an "extra element" that made the breach of contract claim qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim. Id. at 433. The plaintiff did not claim that the defendant had improperly reproduced, distributed or displayed the software, all of which would be claims that would have to brought under federal copyright law. Taquino, 893 F.2d 1488, and Trenton, 865 F. Supp. 1416, contain reasoning similar to that in National Car Rental. In Taquino, the court held that the provisions in a covenant not to compete were valid and that the rights the plaintiff sought to protect by enforcing the contract were sufficiently distinct from reproduction and distribution rights as not to be preempted by the federal Copyright Act. 893 F.2d at 1501. In Trenton, the court found a breach of contract claim not preempted by federal copyright law because "the contract-based causes of action do allege more than the unauthorized use of a copyrighted work. They also claim that there has been a breach of an underlying contract. . ." Trenton, 865 F. Supp. at 1429. The court did not elaborate further on its reasoning. In Acorn, 846 F.2d 923, a Suit brought by an architect against a prospective customer who used the architect's plans to build his house without fulfilling his obligation to pay for them, the court viewed the architect's contract claim as a separate and distinct cause of action that did not arise out of the subject matter of copyright. Id. at 926. To the extent that National Car Rental, Taquino, Trenton and Acorn support the proposition that a copyright infringement claim is not equivalent to a contract claim merely because the contract claim requires a plaintiff to show the additional element of breach, I disagree respectfully with their conclusions. Contracts that seek to protect reproduction and distribution rights step into territory already covered by copyright law. It would alter the "delicate balance" of copyright law to allow parties to avoid copyright law by contracting around it. National Car Rental, Taquino, Trenton, and Acorn do show that contract claims are not preempted automatically by federal copyright law. Contracts that are consistent with the copyright law's goals of self-protection should be upheld. Rightful owners should be able to define the limits of permissible copying or modification of their works. Thomas Lee Hazen, Contract Principles as a Guide for Protecting Intellectual Property Rights in Computer Software: The Limits of Copyright Protection, the Evolving Concept of Derivative Works, and the Proper Limits of Licensing Arrangements, 20 U.C. Davis. L. Rev. 105, 142 (1986). It is only when a contract erects a barrier on access to information that under copyright law should be accessible that § 301 Operates to protect copyright law from individually crafted evasions of that law. See Rice, supra, 53 U. Pitt. L. Rev. at 614 ("The far-reaching public policy Section 301 implements clearly requires preemption of contract-based protection of expression as expression where the effect is to secure rights in that expression which are greater than, equal to, or supplemental of those which Section 106 secures); Hazen, supra, 20 U.C. Davis L. Rev. at 129 ("Courts should invalidate contracts attempting to expand the intellectual property's protection too far beyond the parameters of copyright law on the grounds of statutory preemption, or as against public policy"); Christopher Celentino et al., Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.: Invalidating Shrink-Wrap Licenses?, 2 J.L. & Tech. 151, 162 (1987) (Vault opinion has merit if it means that contracts providing rights greater than or equivalent to those under copyright law are preempted). Plaintiff's license agreement is an attempt to avoid the confines of copyright law and of Feist, 499 U.S. 340, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358, 111 S. Ct. 1282. Its prohibition on the distribution of public information cannot be squared with the purposes of copyright law or with plaintiff's own compilation of data. Had each of the compilers of the 3,000 directories that plaintiff used to put together its database attached a set of terms prohibiting further distribution of the information included in its directories, plaintiff would not have been able to create Select Phone TM without negotiating with and compensating each compiler for use of its data. The Supreme Court's decision in Feist allowed plaintiff to avoid these problems and create its database without any fear of copyright infringement. It is ironic that after plaintiff has attained the benefits of copyright law, it wants to prevent others from receiving that same protection. Unfortunately for plaintiff, the rules of the game have not changed. Just as plaintiff had public access to the telephone listings, so do defendants. Plaintiff cannot use a standard form contract to make an end run around copyright law. Its contract claim is preempted by § 301. b. Misappropriation claim I note first that plaintfff set forth an unfair competition claim in its complaint but did not develop the claim in its summary judgment briefs. Because of the close relationship between the torts of unfair competition and misappropriation, I will treat plaintiff's unfair competition claim as part and parcel of its misappropriation claim. At an early stage, the House of Representatives bill that eventually became § 301 included misappropriation in a list of torts that were considered not equivalent to copyright infringement. Baltimore Orioles, 805 F.2d at 676-77 n.25. That list was deleted from the bill shortly before passage. As enacted, 301 of the Copyright Act does not provide any explicit guidance on the preemption of misappropriation claims by copyright law. Plaintiff cites extensive language from the House Report detailing why misappropriation is not necessarily synonymous with copyright infringement: ". . . [A] cause of action labeled as 'misappropriation' is not preempted if it is in fact based neither on a right within the general scope of copyright as specified by Section 106 nor on a right equivalent thereto. For example, state law should have the flexibility to afford a remedy (under traditional principles of equity) against a consistent pattern of unauthorized appropriation by a competitor of the facts (i.e., not the literary expression) constituting 'hot' news, whether in the traditional mold of International News Serv. v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215, 63 L. Ed. 211, 39 S. Ct. 68 (1918), or in the newer form of updates from scientific, business or other financial databases. Likewise, a person having no trust or other relationship with the proprietor of a computerized database should not be immunized from sanctions against electronically or cryptographically breaching the proprietor's security arrangements and accessing the proprietor's data . . ." H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5748. I hesitate to place too much weight on these statements because the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has determined that the deletion of the list from the bill should be given little weight in determining whether a particular right is equivalent to copyright, stating, "almost any interpretation of the concept of equivalent rights can be inferred from the legislative history." Baltimore Orioles, 805 F.2d at 676-77 n.25; see also Nimmer, supra, § 1.01[B] at 1-30 (in view of ambiguous legislative history, it is best to ignore the significance of the earlier explicit mention and later deletion of the word "misappropriation"). In addition, the discussion of misappropriation in the House Report seems to run counter to the discussion elsewhere in the report that "in the clearest and most unequivocal language possible. . ." § 301 is intended to "avoid the development of any vague borderline areas between State and Federal Protection." H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5746. The majority of federal courts addressing this issue have found misappropriation claims preempted. See Nimmer, supra, § 1.01[B] at 1-35 n. 156 ("misappropriation is but another label for reproduction and as such, is a preempted right 'within the general scope of copyright' under Section 301(a)") (collecting approximately twenty appellate and district court cases holding misappropriation claims preempted); Universal City Studios v. T-Shirt Gallery, Ltd., 634 F. Supp. 1468, 1476 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (New York's misappropriation tort preempted); Mayer v. Josiah Wedgwood & Sons, Ltd., 601 F. Supp. 1523, 1535 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (New York's misappropriation tort preempted); Videotronics, Inc. v. Bend Elecs., 564 F. Supp. 1471 (D. Nev. 1983) (where intellectual property subject to copyright law, applying state doctrine of misappropriation to protect it would create an unacceptable conflict with federal policy). Courts reaching the opposite conclusion have analyzed misappropriation claims different in nature from the one at hand and have looked more to the "extra element" that must be proven under the state law claims in finding that Congress did not intend to preempt the cause of action at issue. The cases plaintiff cites make this apparent. Data General Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36 F.3d 1147; Princess Fabrics, Inc. v. CHF, Inc., 922 F.2d 99 (2d Cir. 1990); Wilson v. Mr. Tee's, 855 F. Supp. 679 (D. N.J. 1994); CSM Investors Inc. v. Everest Development, Ltd., 840 F. Supp. 1304 (D. Minn. 1994); Rubin v. Brooks/Cole Pub. Co., 836 F. Supp. 909 (D. Mass. 1993). None of these cases involved a misappropriation claim based solely on improper copying and distribution. Rather, the cases involved trade secrets claims requiring plaintiff to show a breach of confidentiality, Data General, 36 F.3d at 1165, or "palming off" claims necessitating a showing that the public is misled about the origin of the product. Princess Fabrics, 922 F.2d at 104 (misappropriation claim is preempted but states may still prohibit palming off); Wilson, 855 F. Supp. at 684 (palming off claims not preempted); CSM Investors, 840 F. Supp. at 1314 (neither unfair competition involving palming off nor unjust enrichment claims involving illegal benefit from another are preempted); Rubin, 836 F. Supp. at 924 (extra elements of misrepresentation and deceit qualitatively different from reproduction). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has not addressed the preemption issue as it relates to misappropriation claims, although it affirmed a district court holding to that effect. See Nash v. CBS, Inc., 899 F.2d 1537 (7th Cir. 1990), aff'g on other grounds 704 F. Supp. 823, 835 (N.D. Ill. 1989). In Nash, 704 F. Supp. at 834, the district court noted that, "The goal underlying copyright law is the same as that driving the tort of misappropriation: balancing the need to provide economic incentives for authorship against the preservation of the freedom to imitate." However, the district court did not go so far as to hold that § 301 always preempts the tort of misappropriation. It found that the statements in the House Judiciary Committee Report on the 1976 Amendments to the Copyright Act reflected a legislative intent to keep available certain misappropriation claims. Id. The elements of the tort of misappropriation in Wisconsin are "(1) time, labor and money expended in the creation of the thing misappropriated; (2) competition; and (3) commercial damage to the plaintiff." Mercury Record Productions, Inc., v. Economic Consultants, Inc., 64 Wis. 2d 163, 174, 218 N.W.2d 705, 709 (1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 914, 43 L. Ed. 2d 386, 95 S. Ct. 1107 (1975). At first blush, the second and third factors of the Mercury Record test appear to constitute extra elements that would exempt Wisconsin's misappropriation tort from preemption. However, as discussed above, the mere presence of extra elements does not indicate that the underlying right is not equivalent to rights protected under § 106 of the Copyright Act. When the purposes of copyright and misappropriation law are compared with respect to plaintiff's claim, it is evident that misappropriation does not serve any qualitatively different purposes from copyright law. Copyright law seeks to encourage individuals to create new works by offering them the security that those works will be rewarded with a limited monopoly. Baltimore Orioles, 805 F.2d at 678. Thus it protects authors from those who seek to usurp the copyright owner's creative efforts by copying. The tort of misappropriation offers the same type of protection. Adding competition and commercial damage does not differentiate the underlying protected right. In fact, these elements are subsumed in a party's decision to bring a copyright infringement claim. Without some form of competition and commercial damage, a party would not have the financial incentive to sue for copyright infringement. I conclude that because plaintiff's misappropriation claim is not qualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim, the underlying rights plaintiff seeks to vindicate are equivalent to federal rights and are preempted by the Copyright Act. c. Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act claim The Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act makes it unlawful to modify, destroy, access, take, or copy computer data willfully, knowingly and without authorization. Wis. Stat. § 943.70(2)(a). Under the statute, "data" are property and include representations of information, knowledge or facts prepared in formalized manners and intended to be processed in a computer system. Wis. Stat § 943.70(1)(f). Under the act, the Select Phone TM telephone listings qualify as data and defendants' distribution of that data is made unlawful. Again, the question is whether federal copyright law preempts the statute as it applies to defendants' actions. Plaintiff points to a recent Wisconsin appellate court decision in which the court held that the law was not preempted by the Copyright Act. In State v. Corcoran, 186 Wis. 2d 616, 522 N.W.2d 226 (Ct. App.), review denied, 527 N.W.2d 335 (1994), the Wisconsin Court of Appeals upheld a conviction under the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act of a computer software programmer who destroyed data stored on the computer of his former employer by inserting "booby traps into programs he had written for the employer. Id. at 620, 522 N.W.2d at 228. The court explained that it did not need to consider the defendant's argument that federal copyright law preempted the Wisconsin act because the data the defendant was accused of destroying could not be protected by copyright. Id. at 628, 522 N.W.2d at 231 ("Therefore, we need not decide if the federal Copyrights [sic] Act preempts the enforcement of the WCCA; Corcoran was properly convicted of destroying facts that cannot be protected by copyright"). The court said that "If [it] were to address the question of. . .preemption," it would apply the "extra element" test. Id. at 628 n.11, 522 N.W.2d at 231 n11. Plaintiff argues that the court reached its holding in Corcoran because the destroyed data were not copyrightable and therefore did not meet the first requirement of the preemption test, that the material fall within the subject matter of copyright. This is a reasonable interpretation of the court's holding, but not the only one. The court of appeals did not hold explicitly that such data does not "fall within the subject matter of copyright["] for purposes of preemption analysis. In fact, the court's footnote seems to indicate that the court's understanding of the preemption test focused solely on the second, or "extra element prong["] of the analysis. See 186 Wis. 2d at 628 n.11, 522 N.W.2d at 231 n.11 ("The analysis applied by the federal courts requires a determination if the state-created cause of action contains an 'extra element' in addition to the acts of reproduction or distribution"). The court's discussion of the issue lacks specific mention of the subject matter test. As seen in Baltimore Orioles, 805 F.2d 663, an inquiry into the subject matter of copyright requires more than just determining whether given material is a proper recipient of copyright protection. It is unlikely that the court's single sentence mention of subject matter in Corcoran was meant to foreclose future application of a more comprehensive subject matter test. Applying the preemption test to plaintiff's claim that defendants violated the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act, it becomes evident that the claim should be preempted for the same reasons as plaintiff's breach of contract and misappropriation claims. The first prong is satisfied because the telephone listings fall within the subject matter of copyright and the second is met because plaintiff seeks merely to prohibit the copying and distribution that it could not prevent under federal copyright law. In reaching this conclusion that federal law preempts plaintiff's claim under the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act, I do not hold or intend to imply that the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act is preempted in all instances. Preemption would not occur in a Corcoran-like situation when an individual destroys another's data purposefully. In those situations, the right sought to be enforced differs greatly from the copying and distribution rights covered by copyright law. What this conclusion does mean is that plaintiff cannot succeed on its underlying copyright claim by dressing it in other clothing. Plaintiff's efforts to establish a right under the Wisconsin Computer Crimes Act conflicts directly with the federal copyright law's directive to keep unoriginal factual compilations in the public domain. It would undermine the public access to facts and ideas if states could block such access with their own legislation. IT IS ORDERED that the motion for summary judgment of defendants Matthew Zeidenberg and Silken Mountain Web Services, Inc., is GRANTED and that the motion for summary judgment of plaintiff ProCD, Inc. is DENIED.

Beech Soffer v. Beech Supreme Court of Pennsylvania 487 Pa. 255, 409 A.2d 337 1979 Before Eagen, C. J., and O'Brien, Roberts, Nix,Manderino, Larsen, and Flaherty, JJ. Roberts, Justice At common law a lessee who had never entered into possession of hisleasehold was prohibited from bringing an action in ejectment to gainpossession. The issue before us is the continued validity of thisrule. We are satisfied by considerations of reason and fairness andby the weight of modern case law that the ancient rule now serves nouseful purpose, and, accordingly, we refuse to permit its continueduse. I On August 15, 1951, George and Mary Beech leased property they owned inAllegheny County to appellee Sun Oil Company for a term of fifteen years withtwo additional five-year options. The lease was recorded. In 1956 George andMary Beech conveyed the property to appellee James Beech. The lease to Sun Oilwas not affected. On September 17, 1962, appellee James Beech and his wife leased thesame property to appellants Joseph and Violet Soffer for a fifty-yearterm.1 This lease specifically recited that it was``subject to'' the prior lease to Sun Oil. 2 This lease was also recorded. In July of 1974, as Sun Oil's term was approaching an end, JamesBeech and Sun Oil executed what they styled an ``amendment andratification'' to the original 1951 lease. This ``amendment andratification'' would allow Sun Oil, at its option, to remain inpossession until at least 1997.3 In March of 1976, the Soffers sent written notice to Sun Oil oftheir intention to take possession on October 1, 1976, the expirationdate of Sun Oil's original fifteen year lease plus the originaloptions. Sun Oil replied that it would remain in possession under theprovisions of the 1974 ``amendment and ratification.'' The Soffers then filed this ejectment action against Sun Oil andJames Beech in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. Thecomplaint asserted that the ``amendment and ratification'' constituteda cancellation of the existing 1951 lease and that the Soffers wereentitled to possession of the property and damages of $ 240 a monthfrom January 1, 1975, the effective date of cancellation. Sun Oil responded by raising a single preliminary objection, whichis the subject of this appeal.4 Sun Oil assertedthat the Soffers' complaint failed to state a cause of action inejectment because it did not allege that the Soffers had ever enteredinto possession of the property and were thereafter ousted. Sun Oilclaimed that the complaint could not be amended to include such anallegation and, therefore, that the complaint should be dismissedwithout leave to amend. The trial court sustained Sun Oil's objectionand dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmedwithout opinion. This Court then granted allowance of appeal. II It has never been doubted that a tenant who has been in possessionof his leasehold but who is subsequently ousted may bring an action inejectment to regain possession for the duration of his term. He maydo so whether the wrongful possessor is his landlord or a third party.13 Stnd.Pa.Prac. Ch. 67, § 35 (1957). Indeed, ejectment wasoriginally developed as a remedy for tenants wrongfully dispossessedof their estates. Dice v. Reese, 342 Pa. 379, 385, 21A.2d 89, 92 (1941); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries * 199. We arefaced today only with the question of whether a lessee who has neverbeen in possession but who is entitled to immediate possession, shouldbe permitted the same remedy.5 The common law originally denied ejectment to the lessee who hadnever been in possession. And a handful of cases in thisCommonwealth, most of them now musty with age, have acknowledged thisrestriction. The trial court, in dismissing the Soffers' complaint,relied on the two most recent of these cases, Barnsdall v.Bradford Gas Co., 225 Pa. 338, 74 A. 207 (1909) and Dime Bankand Trust Company of Pittston v. Walsh, 143 Pa.Super. 189, 17A.2d 728 (1940). In Barnsdall this Court noted the existence of therule that a lessee could not maintain ejectment prior to entry.Barnsdall, however, distinguished the rule and upheld an ejectmentaction by a lessee of mineral rights who had never entered intopossession. In Dime Bank the Superior Court followed the rule andelaborated on its history: ``The court below . . . held, and in our opinion correctly,that as plaintiff had only a leasehold interest in the lot of land,and had never entered into possession, it could not bring ejectment toobtain possession. The history of the action of ejectment given inBlackstone's Commentaries (Book III, pp. 199-206) shows that a tenantfor years must have been in possession under his lease and been oustedbefore he can bring ejectment. In fact, a lessee did not become atenant for years, until after he entered `by force of the lease':Littleton's Tenures (Edited by Wambaugh), Book I, chap. VII, p. 26.'' 143 Pa.Super. at 195, 17 A.2d at 731 (emphasis in original). We donot question the Superior Court's recitation of the early history ofthe rule. But the mere recitation of the rule's history does notexplain its present use nor does it justify its continued application.Indeed, a review of the historical development of the action ofejectment indicates that the common law rule requiring prior entry bya lessee is inconsistent with the modern scope of the writ and withour modern conception of landlord and tenant relations. III The legal action of ejectment began not as a real property action,but as an action in trespass. Seitzinger v. Ridgway, 9Watts 496 (1840). Ejectment originally rested on a claim of actual orconstructive ouster of the plaintiff. 13 Stnd.Pa.Prac. Ch. 67, § 1(1957). Entry by the lessee and subsequent ouster by the defendantwere essential to the claim of trespass. The writ of ejectment, however, has changed dramatically in thecenturies since its narrow origin. Today, the right to possession isthe central element of the action---not the claim of ouster. The writof ejectment has long been the general method for obtaining possessionof real property. Dice v. Reese, 342 Pa. 379, 384-86,21 A.2d 89, 92-93 (1941); Irwin v. Hoffman, 319 Pa. 8,16-17, 179 A. 41, 45 (1935). The writ has expanded from a tenant'sremedy and has long since been available to fee claimants and allothers who assert the right to possession of estates in real property.See Gilberton Coal Co. v. Schuster, 403 Pa. 226, 228,169 A.2d 44, 45 (1961).6 Yet it hasnever been suggested that a fee claimant need allege entry and ousterin order to succeed in ejectment. Rather, our cases involving feeclaimants speak only of the right to possession by one not presentlyin possession. See e. g., Brennan v. Shore Bros.,Inc., 380 Pa. 283, 285, 110 A.2d 401, 402 (1955); Bruker v.Carlisle Borough, 376 Pa. 330, 334-35, 102 A.2d 418, 420(1954). Nevertheless, the growth of ejectment to provide a general remedyfor the recovery of estates in realty did not extend to lessees whohad never been in possession. In all likelihood this was because atcommon law a lessee who had not entered into possession was notthought to have an estate in land. Rather, such a lessee was said tohave an ``interesse termini,'' or an interest in a term.Coke. Litt. 46b; 2 Blackstone, Commentaries * 144. Whatever theoriginal usefulness of this distinction may have been, we see noreason why it should continue to prevent a lessee from maintaining anaction in ejectment.7 Even fifty years ago the rule requiring prior entry was correctlyviewed as a remnant of an earlier age. Speaking of precisely the rulewe review today, one federal court of appeals then observed: ``These things relate to a far-distant past. They are strangers tothe jurisprudence of the United States. The modern tendency ofjurisprudence is to look through shadows to substance---to eliminatetechnicalities in the interest of substantial justice. It is nolonger necessary to go upon land as in the days of old and receive atwig or a clod of dirt as a token of changed possession. . . . In themore modern doctrine of ejectment, entry is not a prerequisite to theaction, and if the lessee has such interest in the property as gives apresent right of possession, it is immaterial whether he has entered into possession before bringing the action. The right ofentry, not the entry itself---the right of possession, notactual possession---are the essentials of an action in ejectment.'' Ewert v. Robinson, 289 F. 740, 750-51 (8th Cir. 1923). The notion that prior possession by a lessee is necessary to triggerthe right of possession is a legal fiction unrelated to our moremodern view of a lessee's contractual rights. See Pugh v.Holmes, 486 Pa. 272, 405 A.2d 897 (1979) (opinion by Larsen,J.); id., 486 Pa. at 298-299, 405 A.2d at 910 (Roberts, J.,joined by Nix and Manderino, JJ., concurring) (holding landlord andtenant's obligations mutually dependent); see also AlbertM. Greenfield & Co., Inc. v. Kolea, 475 Pa. 351, 380 A.2d758 (1977) (relieving tenant of obligation to pay rent when premisesdestroyed by fire). We refuse to afford a lessee entitled topossession by virtue of his lease lesser protection than that given afee claimant seeking possession. IV By making ejectment available to lessees before entry, we adopt theview of modern authority. As stated in 49 Am. Jur.2d Landlordand Tenant § 220 (1970): ``It seems now generallyagreed that ejectment will lie in favor of the lessee against thethird person, even before entry on the demised premises by thelessee.'' Accord, Tiffany, 1 The Law of Real Property§ 86 (3d ed. 1939) (and cases cited); 51C C.J.S. Landlord andTenant § 314 (1968) (and cases cited). This is also the resultreached by modern decision, see, e. g., Leader v.Joyce, 271 Minn. 9, 135 N.W.2d 34 (1965); Wright v. IrvingTrust Co., 70 F.2d 245, 246 (2d Cir. 1934) (L. Hand,J.).8 We should not hesitate, in any event, to abolish a rule of lawwhen its basis has disappeared. Holmes, The Path of the Law,10 Harv. L. Rev. 457 (1897); Cardozo, The Nature of the JudicialProcess 150-51 (1921).9 In recenttimes this Court has been alert to reject other out-dated rules whichwere no longer in accord with contemporary experience and policy.Ayala v. Phila. Board of Public Education, 453 Pa. 584, 603-606, 305 A.2d 877, 886-88 (1973) (abrogating governmentalimmunity) (and cases cited); see, e. g., Commonwealth v.McCusker, 448 Pa. 382, 292 A.2d 286 (1972) (rejecting rule thatpsychiatric evidence is inadmissible in murder prosecution forpurposes of determining whether defendant had acted in heat ofpassion); Falco v. Pados, 444 Pa. 372, 282 A.2d 351(1971) (abrogating parental immunity); Reitmeyer v.Sprecher, 431 Pa. 284, 243 A.2d 395 (1968) (rejecting priorlimitation on landlord's liability for defective conditions);Flagiello v. Pennsylvania Hospital, 417 Pa. 486, 208 A.2d 193 (1965) (abrogating charitable immunity). Indeed, as this Court observed long ago in the specific contextof enlarging the scope of the writ of ejectment: ``Manyother alterations have taken place; and the same authority whichbrought it thus far, may certainly carry it to a higher degree ofperfection, as experience happen to show inconveniences, or defects.'' Boyd v. Cowan, 4 Dall. 138, 140 (1794). Weare convinced that the rule we review today does not meet currentsocietal and jurisprudential needs. The common law rule now stands asan unfair barrier to justice and we therefore abolish it. We holdthat a lessee entitled to present possession of his leasehold maybring ejectment regardless of whether he has previously entered intopossession. The order of the Superior Court is reversed, the order of the Courtof Common Pleas of Allegheny County is vacated and this case isremanded to the court of common pleas for proceedings consistent withthis opinion. Manderino, J., did not participate in the decision of this case. {center} Footnotes 1 The 1962 agreement leased the property to the Soffersand another couple. The other couple has since assigned theirinterest to appellants. 2 The relevantparagraph of this lease provided: ``This lease is subject to a prior lease given on the said premises byGeorge V. Beech and Mary J. Beech, his wife, to the Sun Oil Company,dated August 15, 1951, for a period of fifteen (15) years, plus rightin the lessee, to two five-year extensions, which said lease has beenassigned by George V. Beech to James L. Beech. It is understood andagreed that the lease herein made is subject to all the terms andprovisions of the said lease of August 15, 1951, and that during theterm of the said lease of August 15, 1951, and any extensions thereof,rentals shall be payable by the Sun Oil Company directly to the saidJames L. Beech. In such case the second parties shall be relieved ofany obligation under the within lease until the expiration of the saidSun Oil Company lease.'' 3 This instrument declared thatthe 1951 lease was ``in full force and effect,'' and then provided forsix automatic five-year renewal periods, any of which Sun Oil couldcancel on 180 days written notice. At the conclusion of theserenewals the lease was to continue from year to year, with 120 dayswritten notice required of either party in order to terminate. 4 Appellee James Beech filed ananswer denying that his 1962 agreement with the Soffers, styled``LEASE,'' was in fact a lease, and denying that the Soffers wereentitled to either possession or damages. These issues are not beforeus on this appeal, and we express no view on them. 5 As recited above, appellants'complaint alleges that the ``amendment and ratification'' agreementbetween James Beech and Sun Oil worked a cancellation of the priorlease, and, therefore, that appellants became entitled to immediatepossession on January 1, 1975. Sun Oil has not challenged this claimand the issue is not before us. For purposes of this appeal weassume, without deciding, that appellants were entitled to immediatepossession at the time they filed their complaint. 6 The statutory basis for ejectment inforce at the time this case arose declared in sweeping language thatthe writ ``shall issue in all cases where lands, tenements orhereditaments are claimed . . .'' Act of April 13, 1807, P.L. 296,§ 1, 12 P.S. § 1514. This section has subsequently been repealed byAct of April 28, 1978, P.L. 202, § 2(a), effective June 27, 1978 andwas replaced by 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 1722(a)(1) which gives this Courtauthority to prescribe and modify general rules governing practice andprocedure. Because the writ of ejectment was not a real property action, butoriginally was an action in trespass, it was not subject to thehypertechnical pleading rules which surrounded the common law realactions. This in part was responsible for the growth and popularityof ejectment. See generally Holdsworth, 7 History of English Law 4-10(1926). Fee claimants seeking to take advantage of this simple meansof determining title to realty, soon developed methods for using thewrit. By a series of paper leases and fictitious claims they wereable to frame their dispute to fit within the original pattern of theousted tenant's cause of action. As Blackstone characterized it, themethod ``entirely depends upon a string of legal fictions; no actuallease is made, no actual entry by the plaintiff, no actual ouster bythe defendant; but all are merely ideal, for the sole purpose oftrying the title.'' 3 Blackstone, Commentaries * 203. By theseventeenth century this procedure had become so common that theEnglish courts instituted reforms calculated to allow these claimswithout such contrivances. This was the beginning of the writ ofejectment as it exists today. It is ironic indeed that courts, intheir willingness to determine title to property, have knowinglyaccepted wholly fictitious claims of lease, entry and ouster, but havebeen unwilling to provide a remedy to actual lessees, such as theSoffers, who do not make these fictitious claims. We note that our rules of civil procedure have abandoned thehistoric system of pleading in ejectment in favor of the morestraight-forward assumpsit rules, Pa.R.C.P. 1051-1058. 7 In St. Vincent's Roman CatholicCong. of Plymouth v. Kingston Coal Co., 221 Pa. 349, 70A. 838 (1908) this Court held that a lease for twenty-one years ormore, if properly recorded, vests an estate for years in the lesseeand not simply an interesse termini. This result was based on theCourt's construction of certain provisions of our recording act, stillin effect today, Act of May 28, 1715, 1 Sm.L. 94, § 5, 21 P.S. § 471(1955 and Supp.1979). We note that the Soffers' complaint alleges alease for more than twenty-one years and proper recording. This wouldvest the Soffers with an estate for years and not an interessetermini. But whatever this distinction may mean in other contexts, weexpressly refuse to make the availability of ejectment turn on suchniceties. There is little to explain even the original usefulness ofthe common law distinction between an estate for years and aninteresse termini; it has been rejected by text-writers who havecalled it ``difficult to comprehend,'' Tiffany, 1 The Law of RealProperty 132 (3d ed. 1939), and it has been abolished by statute inEngland, Law of Property Act of 1925 § 149(1). We refuse to use theconcept now to create an artificial barrier to the remedy ofejectment. 8 The Restatement (Second) of Property, Landlord andTenant § 6.1 (1976) is intended to apply to situations where a tenantis deprived of possession or use of his leasehold by the landlord orby action attributable to him. This section allows the tenant toterminate his lease or continue the lease and recover damages, abaterent, use rent to eliminate the interference or withhold rent andplace it in escrow. Comment b to this section makes it clear,however, that other relief may also be available: ``b. Unauthorized possession or conduct. An unauthorizedpossession of all or any part of the leased property by the landlord,or someone whose conduct is attributable to him, is an eviction of thetenant that could be cured by the tenant himself. The rule of thissection does not require him to take legal steps available to him toeliminate the eviction, although that option is open to him.'' Companion section 6.2, applicable when the tenant is deprived ofpossession by a third party, expressly adopts the view that a ``tenantmay recover the possession of the leased property from the third partyimproperly in possession.'' The Illustrations to both of these sections make clear that the rules of theRestatement are not limited to situations where the tenant previously has beenousted. See, e. g., § 6.1, Comment c, Illustration 7; § 6.2, Comment b,Illustration 2. 9 In The Path of the Law, 10 Harv.L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897), Justice Holmes remarked: ``It is revoltingto have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laiddown in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if thegrounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and therule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.''WT01-B06-11IA044-000801-B016-16http://samsara.law.cwru.edu:80/comp_law/ann/111396b.html 129.22.184.108 19970118135617 text/html 412HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 18 Jan 1997 14:00:07 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 242Last-modified: Tue, 26 Nov 1996 16:39:46 GMT Computers and the Law: 2nd Anouncement: 11/13/96 ANNOUNCEMENT: 11/13/96 A new handout is available containing the beginning of Chapters 3 and4.

Palaetiology: The Historical Sciences Palaetiology: ``The term `palaetiology' was coined in 1837 byEnglish philosopher, historian, and educator William Whewell (1794-1866)to refer to those sciences which have as their object the reconstructionof the past based on the evidence of the present. Whewell's twoexemplary palaetiological sciences were geology and comparativephilology, but he recognized that many different disciplines hadpalaetiological divisions.'' [Robert J. O'Hara, Palaetiology on theDarwin-L Web Server.] I am convinced, for reasons which I hope will eventually be made clear on this web server and elsewhere, that law, like language, can only be understood by taking a palaetiological approach--that law, and especiallyour Common Law, can only be understood by studying how it has evolvedover the centuries. We can only understand the past by studying the "evidence of the present" and we can only understand the present by understanding how we came to be where we are right now. I am convinced that we can only understand the present by understanding the past.

They are as follows: Artificial insemination (AI): The surrogate is artificially inseminated with the sperm from the husband of the couple. The child is genetically related to the surrogate. The wife of the couple adopts the child via a step-parent adoption. In vitro fertilization/Embryo transfer (IVF/ET): An egg (or eggs) is retrieved from the wife of the couple, combined with her husband's sperm, and the resulting embryo(s) is implanted in the surrogate. The child is not genetically related to the surrogate, and the couple's names go on the original birth certificate. Egg Donor (ED): The "surrogate" donates an egg (or eggs) which is fertilized with the husband's sperm, and the embryo is then transferred to his wife. The child is genetically related to the surrogate, but because the wife delivers the child, she does not need to adopt it. This is sort of a reverse surrogacy. Artificial Insemination by Donor (AID): The surrogate is artificially inseminated with donor sperm, because both the husband and the wife of the couple are infertile. The child is genetically related to the surrogate, and both the husband and wife must adopt it. --- Comparison of Options Available --- For more detailed answers to your questions, to speak to Steven Litz, an attorney and the director of SMI, contact us at: Toll free: 1-888-SURROGATE (317) 996-2000 scl@surrogatemothers.com Surrogate Mothers, Inc.

What types of women become surrogates? A. In SMI's program, a surrogate must be between 18-35 and have previously had a child. The typical surrogate is 28, married, employed, and solidly middle class. The single characteristic describing all of our surrogates is altruism. The women in our program are generous, caring, healthy women. They become surrogates to help people have families. Unlike other programs which look for poor women (based on the mistaken belief that a poor woman is less likely to keep the child), our surrogates are never motivated by financial need. Their fee, which generally is around $13,000, is a factor, but never the main reason for their participation. Q. What do couples look for in a surrogate? A. Couples base their decision on many factors. Some couples select a woman because of her location or physical similarity. Others want a surrogate who is intelligent. All couples, however, look for a woman who is healthy, has no significant medical/psychological difficulties, is emotionally and mentally stable, conceives easily, and who is responsible and mature enough to realize that the couple is placing an enormous amount of trust in her to carry their child. Q. Is the surrogate screened? A. Absolutely. The surrogates go through a variety of different screening processes. References are checked, medical records from prior pregnancies are obtained, a criminal history check is done, and the surrogate (and her husband if married) are then given a complete psychological exam. The couple gets a copy of the psyc report, and they make a final decision if the surrogate is acceptable. Approximately 1% - 2% of all women who initially contact SMI actually end up being accepted into the program. Q. What happens if the surrogate refuses to give up the child? A. Of the 2000 or so births to surrogates in the country, a woman has refused to relinquish the child less than 1% of the time. SMI has never had this happen. In every case where it has, the surrogate either was not screened at all, or the couple was not made aware of the psychological findings. When surrogacy is done right, it works. Q. What are the success rates? A. "Success" should only mean one thing: the percentage of couples/individuals who actually end up with a child. In the AI program, your success rate depends on the male's sperm count and the surrogate's ability to conceive. 85% of all of SMI's clients in the AI program end up with a child. On the average, it takes our surrogates 3 cycles to conceive. Some take longer. Many get pregnant on the first try. In the IVF/ET program, the success rates are much lower, primarily because the wives of the couples are much older. In that program, the success rate is about 20%-25%. SMI will work with you as long as you wish. There are additional legal fees if you switch surrogates. Q. Will the couple and the surrogate meet? A. SMI encourages "open surrogacy." The reason for this is simple: because our surrogates are not doing this for the money, they want (and have every right) to know the types of people for whom they are doing this. Meeting the surrogate allows both sides to make sure that the arrangement will work. Most of our couples stay in contact with their surrogate frequently during the pregnancy. Even after the birth, many couples still stay in touch with their surrogates (X-mas cards, birthday cards, etc.), although for most couples and surrogates the relationship ends after the baby is born.

If legal work is necessary outside of Indiana, we may need an attorney in that state also represent you, in which case there might be additional legal fees. Medical Expenses $500 - $5,000 This includes physical exams and sperm count of the father; physical exam, HSG test (if necessary), insemination/embryo transfer, prenatal, delivery, post-partum care for the surrogate. Medical costs will vary greatly depending on how comprehensive the surrogate's health insurance policy is, or if she even has one. If she does not, you must purchase a policy for her. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY EXPENSES NOT COVERED BY HER INSURANCE. Advertising/Accounting Expenses $1,500 $2000 is about what SMI pays per woman made available to you. If for some reason you need to select a second surrogate, you are charged a second ad fee. If your surrogate does not pass the psychological testing and you select someone else, no additional fee is charged. Your account is also charged a one time fee of $500 which covers all phone calls (our toll free number is provided), regular mailings, faxes, etc. Psychological Fees $1000 These are the costs for the psychological evaluation and testing that the surrogate will undergo once she is selected. Also included is consultation during and after the pregnancy, if necessary. Miscellaneous Surrogate Benefits $750 - $2,000 This includes a $500 maternity clothing allowance; a $100,000 term life insurance policy which must be taken out on the surrogate (costs about $150); travel expenses to/from Indianapolis and/or Lexington, KY, for the AI program, or one of several different cities if in the IVF/ET program; a $100 daily allowance to compensate the surrogate for such things as lost wages, child care, meals, etc.; and attorney's fees for the surrogate's attorney ($300-$500). Surrogate's Fee $0 - $20,000 Total approximate expenses, then, will be as little as about $15,000 (if the surrogate is not charging any fee and has insurance, which is very unlikely), or as much as $40,000 (is she is asking for $20,000 and does not have insurance, which also is unlikely). The average total cost, including everything above, is around $35,000. As a general guide, you can figure on at least $18,000 in expenses (includes everything except the surrogate's fee, and assumes a successful pregnancy after the first procedure). If you are participating in the IVF/ET program, the medical expenses will be significantly higher. Your insurance might cover some of these expenses, as well as some of my fees. These costs are intended as a guideline only. The actual costs may or may not exceed these figures. The legal fees, advertising costs, and psychological expenses are guaranteed not to increase once you have signed a contract, and if you withdraw from the program for any reason prior to a contract being signed with your surrogate, the legal fees are refunded in full.

Five have actually seen fit to criminalize surrogacy. They are AZ, MI, NY, UT, WA, as well as D.C. The other states have laws which say surrogate contracts are invalid, which set up elaborate mechanisms to approve contracts, or which regulate the payment of fees to surrogates. In the AI program, SMI goes to court before the child is born and obtains a court order saying that the husband (or single man) is the father of the child, and directing that his name go on the original birth certificate. After the child is born, the surrogate signs consent forms which either terminate her parental rights, leaving the man with sole custody of the child, or which allow the wife of the couple to adopt. That step-parent adoption generally takes place in the couple's state, unless they reside in one of the states where surrogacy is illegal. In that case, that adoption can occur in another state. In the embryo transfer program, a similar pre-birth court order is obtained, except that this order says that the couple are the child's biological parents, and their names go directly on the original birth certificate. No adoption is necessary since they are the biological parents. In either case, the couple (or individual) will take the child directly from the hospital back home with them.

Total actual fees depend, of course, on the location of your surrogate, how many tries it takes before she conceives, her fee, etc. At whatever point you select a surrogate, you make an initial $15,000 into SMI's escrow account. Additional deposits, if necessary, are made when you receive your monthly accounting statement. ** The legal fees, as explained in the accompanying information, are divided into 2 parts. The first part is the initial withdrawal; the second is the withdrawal that occurs only after a pregnancy has been achieved. *** Most surrogates ask for around $13,000, although we are beginning to see somewhat higher fees. If you select a surrogate who is charging more than $13,000, you would add the difference to the total cost of the program. You will know this information prior to selecting her. Your surrogate's fee is deposited with SMI within 5 days after she conceives. **** AID surrogacy is generally difficult to do unless you and your surrogate are from the same state. If you are, then the procedures are treated the same as any other traditional adoption.

AAII achieves this aim through publications, nationwide seminars, home study texts, educational videos, and local chapters that focus on investing and investment techniques. Current membership is 170,000. The AAII Journal is the primary benefit of membership. It is published 10 times a year. The focus is on providing information and how-to articles that help the individual learn investment fundamentals.

In addition, each March every member receives a new edition of "The Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds," a reference book providing data on over 800 no-load and low-load mutual funds. The Guide includes tables of funds categorized by investment objective and ranked by return for various investment periods. An extensive summary of each fund includes performance data and fund descriptions. AAII also holds seminars across the country taught by university finance professors on the topics of stock analysis, financial planning, retirement and estate planning, bonds, mutual funds, portfolio management and the fundamentals of investing. AAII sponsors over 60 local chapters throughout the U.S. AAII members organize presentations given by investment professionals. AAII members who are interested in attending these meetings also benefit from talking to like-minded members. Membership in AAII is $49 a year and includes a subscription to the AAII Journal, "The Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds," a yearly tax planning guide (published in mid-November), and reduced fees for its seminars and educational publications.

Recent topics include: how you can reduce risk; how to evaluate investment newsletters; how a living trust can help with your estate planning; the characteristics of stock market winners; comparing insurance products objectively. The "Points of View" section interviews leading professional money managers and examines their approaches to managing investments--stocks, high yield bonds, muni bonds, real estate, convertibles. Articles in the Journal always focus on how you can improve your results. While some articles cover the latest findings of academic research, there are also articles by experienced practitioners such as Peter Lynch, John Bogle, T. Boone Pickens, Robert Stovall, Ken Gregory and Mark Hulbert. #2 Shadow Stock Coverage (free to members) -- A special section of the Journal provides the results of screens that many investors use to select stocks (P/E ratio, debt/equity, book value, earnings growth, etc.). These screens can save you considerable time in your search for undervalued stocks. They emphasize the "Shadow Stocks"--stocks ignored by institutions because of size and not covered much by analysts . . . but solid and profitable. #3 The "Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds" (free to members) -- Mailed to you in March each year, this book provides in-depth analysis of over 800 funds and discusses how to select the best funds for you. Awarded the only four star (top) rating by Kiplinger's Personal Finance, this widely acclaimed book sells to the general public for $24.95, but as an AAII member it is yours free. Barron's calls it "...one of the best books around on the subject." Most of our members use mutual funds for at least part of their portfolio and this book represents only part of our coverage of this important topic. #4 Local Chapter Membership -- There are over 60 chapters now operating in metropolitan areas and more are being added. Chapters offer the opportunity to meet with fellow members and to hear experts discuss a variety of investment topics. The similarity of interests has led to close personal relationships among members and the development of many SIGS (special interest subgroups) in such areas as computers, real estate investment, mutual funds and stock screening approaches. As a member you can participate with no additional dues. #5 AAII Year-End Tax Strategy Guide (free to members) -- Each year at the end of November members receive an extensive guide to the tax planning aspects of investment. The guide is based on the latest laws and rulings. #6 AAII Quoteline (free to members) -- AAII Quoteline permits you to use your phone to obtain real time (not delayed) quotes on stocks, options, and mutual funds. You may also establish a theoretical portfolio with a number of shares and receive the current value of each stock and the entire portfolio at any time. #7 Investment Seminars (at reduced cost) -- Over 50 seminars are conducted in cities throughout the United States each year -- from introductory to advanced in a variety of subjects. We also have seminars on video. Each seminar is designed to provide practical ways to improve your investment results. #8 Study Programs (at reduced cost) -- AAII offers a wide variety of home study materials to its members. These materials are constantly being expanded and revised and are designed to take individual investors as far as they want to go--from basics to the concepts of a graduate course in investment theory. #9 Computer Users Newsletter -- Because a growing number of members are using computers in their investment decision making, AAII publishes an optional bimonthly newsletter. This publication, Computerized Investing, evaluates software and explores a variety of ways to make the computer a more effective investment tool. The price of Computerized Investing is $40/year to the public, but only $30/year to members. #10 The "Individual Investor's Guide to Computerized Investing" -- Subscribers to Computerized Investing also receive our annual 200+ page guide to investment software and databases at no additional cost. #11 AAII "Stock Investor" -- For computer users this is our newest optional service -- quarterly disks providing well over 100 items of the latest information from the Market Guide database. This service covers 6000 stocks and has powerful screening capabilities. Available to members at a fraction of the cost of comparable products. #12 Dividend Reinvestment Plans -- Hundreds of major corporations allow you to buy additional stock with your dividends, without commissions and often at a below market price. AAII members receive a free listing of these companies each June with "how to" information. The information is also on the "Stock Investor" computer program. #13 Stock Brokerage Survey -- Each January you receive free our survey of the charges and services of brokerage firms. This free coverage also provides an analysis to help you choose the pricing system and service package that best suits your individual needs. #14 "A Lifetime Strategy for Investing in Common Stocks" -- This booklet described at the end of this letter is yours free. #15 Publication Discounts -- Substantial discounts are available on investment software and investment publications (i.e., Money, Investor's Business Daily, Business Week, Financial World). And through Standard & Poor's Corporation we have arranged for members to receive S&P reports for a number of corporations at no cost. #16 Special Credit Card -- Members are eligible to apply for a special AAII Gold Visa Card with no annual fees, with very special privileges, and a very competitive interest rate (prime plus 6.9%). #17 The "Best of Both Worlds" Money Market -- Members can also participate in a special AAII money market bank account--a bank money market account that guarantees a yield above the average of all money market mutual funds and provides the FDIC insurance of a bank. The best of both worlds. This single benefit could earn you much more than the membership dues. #18 Quarterly Low-Load Mutual Fund Update -- This new optional service provides information quarterly on all the funds covered in our Low-Load Guide. It is available in print or on computer disk. #19 Research - The Hidden Benefit -- The value of the AAII Journal, our seminars and all of our materials is enhanced by the internal research of our staff. In addition, we screen current academic research (often before publication) to find insights into improving investment performance. We not only report on that research, but we sponsor much of it by awards to university faculty and doctoral students. #20 AAII Website - You're already taking advantage of the interactive forum we provide to distribute and communicate with our members. That's who we are, what we do, and our specific programs. AAII is a totally independent non-profit association. We don't even accept advertising in our Journal. And we grow and change to meet the needs of our members. We will continue to do so with, we hope, your participation and insight. There is no other source for this combination of help and support. Our dues are only $49 per year. A single insight gained from our Journal, a seminar or other AAII program will repay the membership cost many times over. In fact, the publication discounts and other special benefits alone may exceed the dues. As Forbes says, "The $49 a year it costs to belong is a bargain." And Benefit #21 You risk nothing by joining ....Because we cannot fully explain AAII in a letter online, we make this promise: If you decide at any time during the year after joining that AAII is not contributing to your investment skills, we will refund your annual membership dues in full -- no questions. We offer this unusual assurance because not only do most of our members renew each year, but over 30% have become Lifetime Members. This policy also applies to Computerized Investing. We are not offering any magic formula for overnight riches. The key to successful management of your assets requires self-discipline and a reasonable investment of time and effort.

Home to 250,000 people and the world's foremost ceramic manufacturers, Stoke-on-Trent is a unique city made up of six separate towns - Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton - affectionately known as The Potteries. THE CITY OF STOKE-ON-TRENT Resources on and under the very ground of Stoke-on-Trent have shaped itsindustrial development - clay, coal and ironstone form the backbone of thearea's economy. The name of Stoke-on-Trent will forever be associated withworld-class ceramic products. Indeed, with names such as Wedgwood, Spode andRoyal Doulton it's not surprising that other local business activities may beoverlooked. This association with ceramics disguises the real depth of theCity's economic character - Michelin, the world's leading tyre manufacturer, isjust one major company which has made Stoke-on-Trent its UK manufacturingheadquarters.

But the City�s ceramic heritage goes back even further with evidence of pottery dating from 2000BC.The City Museum and Art Gallery is home to the City�s heritage and includes the finest collection of Staffordshire ceramics in the world. THE CITY'S HERITAGE Stoke-on-Trent is also known for its famous names, which include Josiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) the �Father of the English Potters� who was born in Burslem. A master potter, Wedgwood was a remarkable man of whom the Prime Minister of his times, William Gladstone said "He was the greatest man who ever, in any age or country, applied himself to the important work of unifying art with industry" Captain E J Smith (1850-1912) was the distinguished captain of the White Star Line with his first captaincy at the age of 24. He was Captain of the "unsinkable" SS Titanic which, on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, struck an iceberg and sank. His last recorded act was to swim to a lifeboat with a child in his arms and his last words were said to be "Be British". Reginald Mitchell (1895-1937) the designer of the Supermarine Spitfire lived and was educated in the City. His famous airplane can be seen at the City Museum and Art Gallery. Arnold Bennett (1867-1931) the novelist was born in what is now the City Centre. His best remembered novels "Anna of the Five Towns" and "The Old Wives Tale" are set in The Potteries of his youth. Susie Cooper (1902-1995)was the first woman to be honoured as the Royal Designer for Industry in 1940 and was made an OBE for her "contribution to the maintenance of excellence in industrial ceramic design in 1979". Sir Stanley Matthews ( 1915-) began his football career at Stoke City at the age of 16. He played for England 54 times and was voted Footballer of the Year in 1948 and again - 15 years later! - in 1963. Knighted in 1965, Sir Stan now lives in the City where he started his amazing career.

The reclamation of 1,000 hectares of derelict land hastransformed the City into a network of greenways and open spaces and the processof environmental renewal remains a firm local commitment. ENVIRONMENT Some of the finest Victorian parks in England - the product of an earlierregeneration programme - are just icing on the cake of a location set deep in theStaffordshire countryside. Rugged moorlands frame the north and eastern parts ofthe City and contrast starkly with gentle undulating plains laying to the southand west.

According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the highway death toll topped 40,000 in 1994 for the second straight year with a two percent increase in motor-vehicle deaths from 1993 to 1994. The following information provides the facts on driving fatalities: Research from the National Safety Council concluded that although motor-vehicle deaths occur more often in collisions between motor vehicles than any other type of accident, this type represents only about 45 percent of the total. Collisions between a motor vehicle and a fixed object were the next most common type, with about 29 percent of the deaths. Passenger cars comprised 74 percent of the registered vehicles and were involved in less than their share of the fatal accidents (59 percent) Light trucks represent about 20 percent of all motor-vehicle registrations but about 24 percent of vehicles involved in fatal accidents. The Federal Highway Administration reports about half of all motor-vehicle deaths occur during the day and half occur at night. Death rates based on mileage, however, are about 4 times higher at night than during the day. Motor-vehicle deaths in 1994 were at their lowest levels in January and February and increased to their highest level in August. More fatal accidents occurred on Friday than any other day of the week in 1994, according to reports from state traffic authorities. For all accidents, Saturday had the highest percentage. Of the estimated 175,128,000 licensed drivers in 1994, about 89,000,000 (51 percent) were males and 86,128,000 (49 percent) were females.Males have a higher involvement rate in fatal accidents - the rate per one billion miles driven was 25 for males and 17 for females.Exceeding the posted speed limit or driving at an unsafe speed was the most common error in fatal accidents Home Page To contact us send email to Trans Union/DATEQ.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety is an independent,nonprofit, scientific and educational organization dedicated toreducing the losses resulting from crashes on the nation's highway.The following facts are a result of a study they conducted in1994. These statistics reflect the seriousness of the teenagemotor vehicle crash problem. In 1993, 5413 teenagers died in the U.S. from motor vehiclecrash injuries. The motor vehicle death rate per 100,000 people is especiallyhigh among 16-24 year olds.The insurance injury claim frequencies and overall collisionlosses for cars insured for teenagers to drive are more than double those of cars insured for adults. Eighty-two percent of 16-year-old drivers in fatal crashesduring 1993 made at least one driving error that contributed tothe crashes. Police reports indicate that 37 percent of all 16-year-olddrivers in fatal crashes during 1993 were reportedly speeding. Forty-four percent of the 16-year-old drivers were in fatalcrashes that involved only the teen's vehicle. Only 5 percent of all 16-year-old drivers killed in 1993 accidentshad blood alcohol concentrations of 0.10 or more. Many of the 16-year-olds who die in crashes aren't using seatbelts. Two out of every three teens who died as passengers in 1993crashes were traveling in vehicles driven by other teens. Insurance injury claim frequencies and overall collision lossesfor cars insured for teenagers to drive are more than double thoseof cars insured for use by adults only. Collision losses for teenagers are highest for small and midsizesports models. The vast majority of fatal crashes with a 16 year-old at thewheel involved a driver leaving the roadway and overturning orstriking a fixed object or overturning on the roadway.

In an effort to reduce the number of young people injuredand killed in traffic accidents and to control costs of insuringyouthful drivers, the graduated licensing system is becoming moreand more commonplace. Graduated licensing is a progressive approachby which 16-year-olds may earn the privilege of unrestricted driving.A model bill proposed by the National Association of IndependentInsurers (NAII) is being examined by several states. The billcalls for stricter education and examination procedures, automaticsuspensions for major traffic offenses, zero tolerance for bloodalcohol content, and provisional licenses that limit driving tothe hours of midnight to 6 am. Although no states have passed a complete graduated licensinglaw, numerous states have enacted elements of the law. Since January1995, Delaware, Maine and Washington instituted zero alcohol tolerancefor drivers under 21. Iowa, Montana and Rhode Island's law providesfor reduction of the minimum blood alcohol level to .02 for driversunder 21. North Carolina passed a law with limited license provisionsand zero alcohol tolerance. California and Louisiana made seatbeltenforcement primary. In addition, Arkansas, Connecticut, Indiana,Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee,Texas, Virginia and Wyoming legislatures have graduated licensingbills pending.

The research was conducted in 1994. Alcohol involvement is highest in nighttime single-vehiclecrashes, in which 66 percent of fatally injured passenger vehicledrivers in 1994 had BACs of 0.10 percent or more. Crashes involving men are much more likely to be alcohol-relatedthan those involving women. Among fatally injured male driversof passenger cars, 42 percent had BACs of 0.10 percent or morein 1994. The percentage for women was 21. Traffic fatalities in alcohol-related crashes dropped by 2percent from 1992 to 1993 and by 26 percent from 1983 to 1993.In 1983, alcohol-related fatalities accounted for 56 percent ofall traffic deaths. More than 1.6 million drivers were arrested in 1992 for drivingunder the influence of alcohol or narcotics. About 2 in every 5 Americans will be involved in an alcohol-relatedtraffic accident at some time in their lives. In 1993, 24.8 percent of all drivers killed in traffic accidentson weekdays were intoxicated, compared to 44.4 percent on weekends. From 1983 to 1993, intoxication rates decreased for driversof all age groups. The greatest decrease was for 16-to-20-year-olddrivers. An estimated total of 13,968 lives have been saved by21-year-old minimum drinking age laws since 1975.

While a charge of impaired driving is an offence under federal law, in most cases there are provincial consequences of this offence which come into effect upon conviction. For example, in Ontario, the consequence of a first conviction is a minimum licence suspension of one year concurrent with the three months driving prohibition within the federal penalties. Listed below are the references to the sections of the Federal Criminal Code which relate to impaired driving and related offences. Your local library will likely have the most current edition of the Revised Statutes of Canada in the Reference Section. You may obtain a copythrough your local bookstore, or a pocket edition of the Criminal Code such as the Pocket Criminal Code printed by Carswell Publishing (ISBN 0-459-36211-9).

Appearance of accused in Court. If the accused pleads guilty, sentence is passed. If the accused pleads not guilty, a preliminary inquiry decidesif there is enough evidence to hold a trial. Not enough evidence for trial Charges dismissed. Accused free Enough evidence for trial Trial Witnesses for the crown Witnesses for the defence Not Guilty verdict Charges dismissed. Accused free Guilty verdict pre-sentence report prison term probation community service fine licence suspension accused may launch an appeal of the verdict and/or sentence Documenting Information You may generally assume that the investigating officers have collected all the evidence they need. However, it is wise to document everything about the crash at the time it comes to your attention. You think you�ll remember all the facts, but documentation will ensure a good recollection of all details. In some cases, you will hear that additional witnesses want to come forward who have not been interviewed previously by the police. If so, refer them to the officer or the Crown who will take their statement. Photographs have probably been taken at the crash scene and perhaps at the hospital or the coroner�s office. It is possible, however, that other pictures would be useful in both the criminal and civil cases. You may be able to take photos of the recovery process of the injured victim which investigators cannot because their time is limited. If you take pictures that you think may be helpful, have someone witness your taking the photographs. You and the witness should sign and date the photos on the back, and then take them to the Crown Attorney. Ask for the return of any personal effects and/or clothing which will not be required as evidence in the court case. Keep all bills and receipts resulting from the crash. Begin a day-by-day record of all financial expenditures or losses which you would not have had if the crash had not happened. You should keep track of your telephone conversations with anyone associated with the case. Note the date, time and the key subject of the conversation for future reference. The Crown Attorney Once the policing agency has laid charges, the case is referred to the crown attorney�s office. This office is usually located inside the courthouse where the case will be heard. Do not hesitate to ask the police for the location and telephone number of the crown attorney�s office. Phone the crown attorney�s office and ask if a crown attorney has been assigned to the case. Please remember that the case is filed under the name and date of birth of the accused.If you are told that a crown has not been assigned to the case, ask when it is expected that a crown attorney will be assigned. If it is getting very close to a court date and you discover thata crown attorney has not been assigned, ask to speak to the Chief Crown Attorney. Inform the Chief Crown Attorney who you are and indicate your concern. Once a crown attorney is assigned, phone and make an appointment with him. Prepare a list of questions before the meeting to ensure you do not forget issues which you want to discuss. It is important during this meeting to make your feelings known about plea bargaining, and your interest in submitting a Victim Impact Statement to the court. A recent picture of the victim before the injury or death may be taken with you to the crown attorney�s office. As much as possible, you will want to reinforce that this crime was committed against a person and that your loved one was cared about by many people. You can also talk about how things have changed since the crash. In an effort to be kept informed of any changes in the status of the case, you should: mail a follow-up letter to the crown attorney which outlines generally your discussion and your wish to be informed. inform the investigating officer and the court clerk at the courthouse. Many jurisdictions in the country have some type of victim/witness programme to which you may be referred. The purpose of these government funded programmes is to prepare a victim or witness for the upcoming proceedings. This may involve a tour of a typical courtroom and orientation to the trial process. Plea Bargaining This term refers to negotiations which take place between the crown attorney and the defense lawyer. These negotiations may result in a guilty plea to a lesser charge or a guilty plea in exchange for a reduced sentence. These bargains seem distasteful to victim families who feel that to cut a deal is to diminish the significance of the crime. Crown attorneys and judges are eager to execute plea bargains because they do not have the time nor resources to take every case to trial. MADD Canada does not support plea bargaining and believes that all cases of the accused pleading not guilty should go to trial unless it is obvious that there is insufficient evidence to win a conviction. Going to Trial If the defendant persists in pleading not guilty, the case will be set for trial. He has a right to choose whether he wants his case to be decided by a judge alone or by a judge and jury. Be prepared for more delays after a trial date has been set. If the defendant chooses a jury trial, jury selection may take some time. Most injured victims and surviving families want to attend the trial although they know it will be an emotionally draining experience. You may be surprised to learn that the defense may try to preventyou from attending the trial. The defense lawyer�s goal is to minimize the victim sympathy factor during the trial. The defense wants any sympathy to be focused on the defendant and not the victim. Typically, the defense lawyer will request a publication ban on the evidence presented in the trial and on the name of the accused. Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that very few publication bans are indeed necessary in order to protect the rights of those involved. This may lead to a more open court process in all cases. Courtroom Guidelines Do not discuss the case in the halls or restrooms. Your behaviour out of the courtroom is as important as your behaviour in it. You should remind any supporters who will be attending the proceedings that any disruption may result in a clearing of the courtroom of any spectators including the victim family as well as the possibility of a mistrial. Never speak to the judge or a juror - even if you encounter them in the hall or at lunch. They must remain bias-free as they hear the evidence. Be prepared for the emotional impact of hearing the defendant say not guilty. Even though you know there would not be a trial unless he was pleading not guilty, many victims report a jarring emotional response when they actually hear the words. In many cases, these are the first words the victim or the victim family has heard the defendant speak. Expect to hear upsetting testimony. You may hear gruesome details for the first time. You may see photos you have never been shown before. You may also hear the defense lawyer attempt to show that you or your loved one were responsible for the crash. He has an ethical responsibility to do all he can to represent his client�s legal interests. Therefore, much of what is so important to you may seem like gamesmanship of players who try to outskill each other in courtroom drama. It is up to the judge or jury to determine the truth. If you feel you may lose control of your emotions during the trial, leave the courtroom. Your presence or demeanor in the courtroom must not be intended to influence the judge or jury. If you have questions or concerns during the trial, write them down and give them to the crown attorney or victim advocate. Remember throughout the trial process that the burden of proof in the case is the responsibility of the crown and that the defense need only create an element of doubt for the case to be lost. The Verdict Hearing the announcement of the verdict is the climax of the trial and usually a very emotional time for the victim and/or victim family. You must be aware that a legal verdict and the truth are, unfortunately, not always the same thing. While a defendant may not, in truth, be innocent, he may be proven not guilty. Judges and juries are the best way our society knows to determine legal justice. Judges and juries are also susceptible to human error. All of this must be kept in perspective. The standard of proof in criminal cases is beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest burden of proof required in any trial proceeding. If any doubt based on reason exists as to any element of the offense as charged, the verdict of the judge and/or judge and jury must be not guilty. Evidence must establish the facts so clearly, positively, and explicitly that there can be no reasonable doubt that the case was proven. Young Offenders Act Young people under the age of 18 years of age accused of offences contrary to any law are subject to the provision of the Young Offenders Act. This law was intended to provide young people with an opportunity to avoid the stigma of a criminal record for minor transgressions which could occur due to inexperience or a momentary lack of judgment. This Act has become the source of controversy because of a tremendous increase in youth crime, recitivism and in particular, the increase in the frequency of violent crimes such as impaired driving committed by those under 18 years of age. If the accused is a young offender, you as the victim have to request access to any records on the specific crime for which he is accused. Section 44.1 (5) states in part, "Any record that is kept ... may, on request, be made available for inspection to the victim of the offence to which the record relates." Sentencing, relating to impaired driving cases, has caused many victims to feel that the young person has not been held truly accountable for their behaviour especially when the young person has accepted an adult responsibility such as driving. In some cases, victims feel that they understand the need for the young offender tohave future opportunities which could be limited through extended incarceration, but also feel that the death or injury of their loved one should not be minimized. In these circumstances, some victims advocate for the judge to impose a significant period of licence revocation in addition to a community service order for the young offender. What Can You Do? The Crash Report The crash report, or accident report as it is sometimes called, is prepared by the law enforcement agency which investigated the crash. It is usually the municipal police service if the crash occurred within the city limits. In other areas, the investigation and reporting may be done by the Provincial Police or the R.C.M.P. In most circumstances, you may obtain a copy of the report through the investigating officer who is assigned to the case. The investigating officer will often ensure that any nominal fee which may usually be charged for the document preparation is waived. If a fee is charged, keep the receipt in case you may be reimbursed at a later date. If you are having difficulty obtaining a copy of the report, call the appropriate agency, give the date and location of the crash, and ask how and when you may obtain copies of the initial report and any supplementary reports. Sometimes the investigating officer will give you a reference number of the report at the scene, at the hospital, or at the death notification. Make note of the officer's name, as well as the police agency affiliation and telephone number. Ask as many questions as you require in order to get the information that you need. At a time such as this, there are no stupid questions. When you get the report, which is considered public information under the Freedom of Information Act, look it over closely for the following data: Do you see any errors or omissions in the report? If so, report them immediately to the investigating officer whose name appears on the report. Even if they seem minor, they can be crucial to court cases. Are there any indications on the report that the accused had been drinking or using other drugs? If so, see if a Blood Alcohol Content (B.A.C.) level is indicated. B.A.C. is usually determined by breath or blood testing shortly after the crime was committed. If the tests were not performed, you should ask why they were not.Tests should be given following crashes in which alcohol or other drug use is suspected. All too often, however, testing is not done or procedures are not followed properly. Victim Impact Statements The Criminal Code of Canada (S. 735) provides that victims may submit a written statement to the court about the impact of the crime on their lives. These statements are used in the sentencing phase of the proceedings. Each province provides a format to be followed for the submission of these statements to the court. Ask the crown attorney, court clerk or the MADD Canada National Office for this information. In preparing statements, be sure your information is accurate. Write from the heart about your pain, but do not make bitter or negative remarks about the offender. The judgment of the defendant belongs to the court. We have enclosed a sample of a Victim Impact Statement to help you. Your local Chapter of MADD Canada can assist you in preparing your statement and give you additional samples which have been written. Sample Victim Impact Statement Your Honour, It has been 18 months since Debbie was killed, but to us it seems like it was just yesterday. Our lives started new and we were filled with pain from that day on. For each day that we have to live without her we feel cheated, never being able to touch her, see her, hear her talk or laugh. Debbie was the spark in our small family of three. She loved life and people, had many interests, found excitement in almost everything she did, and loved to share it with us. There is so much that I would like to tell you about Debbie: how she loved music, loved to sing and dance, volunteered at the senior�s home, how she loved to watch football with her father, was fascinated with magic tricks and loved animals. She hoped to be a vet some day to care for little furry creatures. She always brought home a stray cat or dog and made sure that the owner was found. Flashbacks from the crash fill my thoughts each night. She did not have a chance. Her life contrasted her death in so many ways. No one�s life should end that way. The day we buried our Deb, the sun was shining and the sky was clear. The air, however, was crisp and the wind ruffled through the flowers laying on her casket. We loved Debbie so much and saw she had a bright future. She would have been 17 years old today. I hope and pray that no other family suffers this type of loss although I know it is all too common. Our family wants justice and for a strong message to be sent to those who would even consider getting behind the wheel of their cars after drinking. Sincerely, Mark & Dianne Webster. Questions & Answers Will I need a lawyer? For the criminal proceedings, the crown attorney is the lawyer who will prepare the case. It is wise, however, to consult a lawyer regarding matters such as insurance claims, estates and if personal injuries were involved. A consultation with a lawyer is usually free. Call the law society in your telephone book for referrals to lawyers in your area. Can the drinking establishment be held liable? The drinking establishment may he held responsible in a civil case for serving the driver to the point of intoxication. Both financial judgments and revocation of their permit to serve alcoholic beverages can result from irresponsible service. I understand that the maximum sentence for impaired driving causing death is 14 years in prison, but what can we expect to happen? In the early 1980�s, it was common for an impaired driver convicted of killing someone to receive a $50. fine and a 3 month licence suspension. In 1995, the typical sentence for this offence may range from 2 - 3 years. An offender serves a fraction of this sentence before beginning parole. Exceptional cases have resulted in higher sentences as the judges become more aware of the violent nature of this crime and the number of repeat offenders who eventually kill. Is there any cost for MADD Canada services for victims? All of our victim services are organized by volunteers who donate their time to help. Many of these volunteers have lost a loved one due to impaired driving and they want to help others. In addition, information and referral services are provided at no cost. Can someone from MADD Canada come to court with me? In many cases a volunteer will be available to accompany you to court to provide support and information. Do I have to be a mother to be involved? MADD Canada involves the combined efforts of men and women of all ages who want to eliminate impaired driving and to help victims of this violent crime. All of our victim services are open equally to everyone. How can I find out more about MADD Canada? Write to: MADD Canada, 6507C Mississauga Road, Mississauga, Ontario.

Is driving under the influence a big problem in Canada? Is impaired driving a crime? What is MADD Canada doing about drinking and driving? What specific legislation does MADD Canada support that would help eliminate the impaired driving problem? What is MADD Canada doing to prevent young people from drinking and driving? Are people responding to MADD Canada's public awareness campaign? I know that some victims of impaired driving crashes suffer terrible emotional trauma. What is MADD Canada doing to help them? I don't drinkand drive. Am I still at risk? Is there anything I can do to help? What is MADD Canada? MADD Canada is a national network of concerned citizens committedto stopping the crime of impaired driving. Based on the successof Mothers Against Drunk Driving in the United States, MADD Canada is working to heighten awareness about the dangersof impaired driving, offer aid and counseling to its victims, and save lives. Is driving under the influence a big problem in Canada? Definitely. The impaired driving problem is as bad as ever -or worse. In fact, it's the single largest criminal cause of death in our country. To put it in perspective: in 1992, there were 732 homicides in Canada. By contrast, there are about 2,500 fatalitiesresulting from impaired driving each year. The death rate fromimpaired driving is thus three to four times the nationalmurder rate. It is a crime of epidemic proportions. Is impaired driving a crime? Yes. And if you have any doubts about the seriousnessof this criminal act, think about this: a first-time impaired driving offense is punishable in Canada by up to five yearsin prison. If the impaired driver is found guilty of causingbodily harm or death, he can be punished by serving tenor more years behind bars. But for every impaired driverwho is arrested and charged, there are countless morewho get away with their crime. What is MADD Canada doing about drinking and driving? MADD Canada is working to prevent impaired driving and help itsvictims through: Legislative Initiatives. Tougher laws do discourage thosewho might drink and drive; and fewer impaired drivers on theroad translates to fewer crashes and more saved lives. Teenage Outreach. Young people are still involved in a tragically high number of impaired driving crashes. MADD Canadais working to reduce this toll by educating our young peopleand spreading the message about the dangers of impaireddriving. Public Awareness Campaigns. Many people do not understand how dangerous it is to drink and drive. They also may not realizehow much they can do to help eliminate the problem. We're helpingmore people understand that even one drink can impair a person'sability to driver safely. Victim Assistance Programs. MADD Canada offers support tovictims and their families during the grieving and healing process.We also help them understand how the justice system works and what their rights are. What specific legislation doex MADD Canadasupport that would help eliminate the impaired driving problem National Minimum Legal Drinking Age. Achieving a nationalminimum drinking age of 21 in canada is one of our firstreform goals. Underage impaired driving deaths dropped over 40% in the U.S. when the drinking age was raised to21. When this minimum drinking age legislation is implemented, it will begin saving lives almost immediately. Administrative Licence Suspension (ALS). This measure givespolice officers the authority to confiscate and impaired driver'slicencd at the time of arrest, thereby preventing him fromcommitting more impaired driving crimes before his case isheatd in court. ALS will reduce this threat on our highways. The Graduated Driver's Licence System. Under considerationin several provinces, this process allows new drivers to eatntheir licences gradually, as they prove that they have theskills and maturity to be responsible drivers. Call or write to your provincial and federal legislators. Tell themthat you support tougher laws to stop deaths and injuriesresulting from impaired driving. What is MADD Canada doing to preventyoung people from drinking and driving? MADD Canada goes where teenagers are-the schools. Our"Close to Home" presentation, teaches high school studentsabout the dangers of driving while impaired by alcohol andother drugs. "Close to Home" hers MADD Canada's messageacross in a multi-media format that combines video and rockmusic with victim presenters who till their stories. Are people responding to MADD Canada'spublic awareness campaign? Yes, through these and other programs: Project Red Ribbon gives a different, safer meaning to the phrase"tie one on." Supporters display the ribbons on car antennas,mirrors, and door handles. Originally intended as a reminderto drive safe and sober during the holiday season, red ribbonsare now displayed throughout the year. Candlelight Vigils bring together victims of impaired drivingcrashes to share their grief and comfort each other. TheCandlelight Vigils are also a visible reminder to everyonethat drimking and driving must stop. Many MADD Canadachapters hold such candlelight vigils each December. I know that some victims of impaired drivingcrashes suffer terrible emotional trauma. What is MADD Canada doingto help them? A big part of MADD Canada's mission is to help andsupport victins of impaired driving crimes. We helpvictims and their families in a number of ways: Support Services: MADD Canada provides telephonesupport and information to assist victims. Understanding the Legal System: We provide informationabout the judicial process and clarify victims'rights. MADD Canada chapter members accompanyvictims to court and follow up with them on thesentencing of the offender. Victim Impact Statements: Prepared by victims or theirsurviving family members with the help of MADDDCanada, these statements explain how the crime of impaired driving has shattered their lives. VictimImpact Statements can lead to tougher sentencingof offenders. I don't drink and drive. Am I still at risk Yes. Impaired drivers can strike anyone at any time, like a straybullet hurtling along our nation's roadways. As long as there areimpaired drivers on our roads, no one is ever completely safefrom this crime. Is there anything I can do to help? Yes.

While a charge of impaired driving is an offence under federal law, in most cases there are provincial consequences of this offence which come into effect upon conviction. For example, in Ontario, the consequence of a first conviction is a minimum licence suspension of one year concurrent with the three months driving prohibition within the federal penalties. Listed below are the references to the sections of the Federal Criminal Code which relate to impaired driving and related offences. Your local library will likely have the most current edition of the Revised Statutes of Canada in the Reference Section. You may obtain a copythrough your local bookstore, or a pocket edition of the Criminal Code such as the Pocket Criminal Code printed by Carswell Publishing (ISBN 0-459-36211-9).

Accused free Guilty verdict pre-sentence report prison term probation community service fine licence suspension accused may launch an appeal of the verdict and/or sentence Documenting Information You may generally assume that the investigating officers have collected all the evidence they need. However, it is wise to document everything about the crash at the time it comes to your attention. You think you�ll remember all the facts, but documentation will ensure a good recollection of all details. In some cases, you will hear that additional witnesses want to come forward who have not been interviewed previously by the police. If so, refer them to the officer or the Crown who will take their statement. Photographs have probably been taken at the crash scene and perhaps at the hospital or the coroner�s office. It is possible, however, that other pictures would be useful in both the criminal and civil cases. You may be able to take photos of the recovery process of the injured victim which investigators cannot because their time is limited. If you take pictures that you think may be helpful, have someone witness your taking the photographs. You and the witness should sign and date the photos on the back, and then take them to the Crown Attorney. Ask for the return of any personal effects and/or clothing which will not be required as evidence in the court case. Keep all bills and receipts resulting from the crash. Begin a day-by-day record of all financial expenditures or losses which you would not have had if the crash had not happened. You should keep track of your telephone conversations with anyone associated with the case. Note the date, time and the key subject of the conversation for future reference. The Crown Attorney Once the policing agency has laid charges, the case is referred to the crown attorney�s office. This office is usually located inside the courthouse where the case will be heard. Do not hesitate to ask the police for the location and telephone number of the crown attorney�s office. Phone the crown attorney�s office and ask if a crown attorney has been assigned to the case. Please remember that the case is filed under the name and date of birth of the accused.If you are told that a crown has not been assigned to the case, ask when it is expected that a crown attorney will be assigned. If it is getting very close to a court date and you discover thata crown attorney has not been assigned, ask to speak to the Chief Crown Attorney. Inform the Chief Crown Attorney who you are and indicate your concern. Once a crown attorney is assigned, phone and make an appointment with him. Prepare a list of questions before the meeting to ensure you do not forget issues which you want to discuss. It is important during this meeting to make your feelings known about plea bargaining, and your interest in submitting a Victim Impact Statement to the court. A recent picture of the victim before the injury or death may be taken with you to the crown attorney�s office. As much as possible, you will want to reinforce that this crime was committed against a person and that your loved one was cared about by many people. You can also talk about how things have changed since the crash. In an effort to be kept informed of any changes in the status of the case, you should: mail a follow-up letter to the crown attorney which outlines generally your discussion and your wish to be informed. inform the investigating officer and the court clerk at the courthouse. Many jurisdictions in the country have some type of victim/witness programme to which you may be referred. The purpose of these government funded programmes is to prepare a victim or witness for the upcoming proceedings. This may involve a tour of a typical courtroom and orientation to the trial process. Plea Bargaining This term refers to negotiations which take place between the crown attorney and the defense lawyer. These negotiations may result in a guilty plea to a lesser charge or a guilty plea in exchange for a reduced sentence. These bargains seem distasteful to victim families who feel that to cut a deal is to diminish the significance of the crime. Crown attorneys and judges are eager to execute plea bargains because they do not have the time nor resources to take every case to trial. MADD Canada does not support plea bargaining and believes that all cases of the accused pleading not guilty should go to trial unless it is obvious that there is insufficient evidence to win a conviction. Going to Trial If the defendant persists in pleading not guilty, the case will be set for trial. He has a right to choose whether he wants his case to be decided by a judge alone or by a judge and jury. Be prepared for more delays after a trial date has been set. If the defendant chooses a jury trial, jury selection may take some time. Most injured victims and surviving families want to attend the trial although they know it will be an emotionally draining experience. You may be surprised to learn that the defense may try to preventyou from attending the trial. The defense lawyer�s goal is to minimize the victim sympathy factor during the trial. The defense wants any sympathy to be focused on the defendant and not the victim. Typically, the defense lawyer will request a publication ban on the evidence presented in the trial and on the name of the accused. Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that very few publication bans are indeed necessary in order to protect the rights of those involved. This may lead to a more open court process in all cases. Courtroom Guidelines Do not discuss the case in the halls or restrooms. Your behaviour out of the courtroom is as important as your behaviour in it. You should remind any supporters who will be attending the proceedings that any disruption may result in a clearing of the courtroom of any spectators including the victim family as well as the possibility of a mistrial. Never speak to the judge or a juror - even if you encounter them in the hall or at lunch. They must remain bias-free as they hear the evidence. Be prepared for the emotional impact of hearing the defendant say not guilty. Even though you know there would not be a trial unless he was pleading not guilty, many victims report a jarring emotional response when they actually hear the words. In many cases, these are the first words the victim or the victim family has heard the defendant speak. Expect to hear upsetting testimony. You may hear gruesome details for the first time. You may see photos you have never been shown before. You may also hear the defense lawyer attempt to show that you or your loved one were responsible for the crash. He has an ethical responsibility to do all he can to represent his client�s legal interests. Therefore, much of what is so important to you may seem like gamesmanship of players who try to outskill each other in courtroom drama. It is up to the judge or jury to determine the truth. If you feel you may lose control of your emotions during the trial, leave the courtroom. Your presence or demeanor in the courtroom must not be intended to influence the judge or jury. If you have questions or concerns during the trial, write them down and give them to the crown attorney or victim advocate. Remember throughout the trial process that the burden of proof in the case is the responsibility of the crown and that the defense need only create an element of doubt for the case to be lost. The Verdict Hearing the announcement of the verdict is the climax of the trial and usually a very emotional time for the victim and/or victim family. You must be aware that a legal verdict and the truth are, unfortunately, not always the same thing. While a defendant may not, in truth, be innocent, he may be proven not guilty. Judges and juries are the best way our society knows to determine legal justice. Judges and juries are also susceptible to human error. All of this must be kept in perspective. The standard of proof in criminal cases is beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest burden of proof required in any trial proceeding. If any doubt based on reason exists as to any element of the offense as charged, the verdict of the judge and/or judge and jury must be not guilty. Evidence must establish the facts so clearly, positively, and explicitly that there can be no reasonable doubt that the case was proven. Young Offenders Act Young people under the age of 18 years of age accused of offences contrary to any law are subject to the provision of the Young Offenders Act. This law was intended to provide young people with an opportunity to avoid the stigma of a criminal record for minor transgressions which could occur due to inexperience or a momentary lack of judgment. This Act has become the source of controversy because of a tremendous increase in youth crime, recitivism and in particular, the increase in the frequency of violent crimes such as impaired driving committed by those under 18 years of age. If the accused is a young offender, you as the victim have to request access to any records on the specific crime for which he is accused. Section 44.1 (5) states in part, "Any record that is kept ... may, on request, be made available for inspection to the victim of the offence to which the record relates." Sentencing, relating to impaired driving cases, has caused many victims to feel that the young person has not been held truly accountable for their behaviour especially when the young person has accepted an adult responsibility such as driving. In some cases, victims feel that they understand the need for the young offender tohave future opportunities which could be limited through extended incarceration, but also feel that the death or injury of their loved one should not be minimized. In these circumstances, some victims advocate for the judge to impose a significant period of licence revocation in addition to a community service order for the young offender. What Can You Do? The Crash Report The crash report, or accident report as it is sometimes called, is prepared by the law enforcement agency which investigated the crash. It is usually the municipal police service if the crash occurred within the city limits. In other areas, the investigation and reporting may be done by the Provincial Police or the R.C.M.P. In most circumstances, you may obtain a copy of the report through the investigating officer who is assigned to the case. The investigating officer will often ensure that any nominal fee which may usually be charged for the document preparation is waived. If a fee is charged, keep the receipt in case you may be reimbursed at a later date. If you are having difficulty obtaining a copy of the report, call the appropriate agency, give the date and location of the crash, and ask how and when you may obtain copies of the initial report and any supplementary reports. Sometimes the investigating officer will give you a reference number of the report at the scene, at the hospital, or at the death notification. Make note of the officer's name, as well as the police agency affiliation and telephone number. Ask as many questions as you require in order to get the information that you need. At a time such as this, there are no stupid questions. When you get the report, which is considered public information under the Freedom of Information Act, look it over closely for the following data: Do you see any errors or omissions in the report? If so, report them immediately to the investigating officer whose name appears on the report. Even if they seem minor, they can be crucial to court cases. Are there any indications on the report that the accused had been drinking or using other drugs? If so, see if a Blood Alcohol Content (B.A.C.) level is indicated. B.A.C. is usually determined by breath or blood testing shortly after the crime was committed. If the tests were not performed, you should ask why they were not.Tests should be given following crashes in which alcohol or other drug use is suspected. All too often, however, testing is not done or procedures are not followed properly. Victim Impact Statements The Criminal Code of Canada (S. 735) provides that victims may submit a written statement to the court about the impact of the crime on their lives. These statements are used in the sentencing phase of the proceedings. Each province provides a format to be followed for the submission of these statements to the court. Ask the crown attorney, court clerk or the MADD Canada National Office for this information. In preparing statements, be sure your information is accurate. Write from the heart about your pain, but do not make bitter or negative remarks about the offender. The judgment of the defendant belongs to the court. We have enclosed a sample of a Victim Impact Statement to help you. Your local Chapter of MADD Canada can assist you in preparing your statement and give you additional samples which have been written. Sample Victim Impact Statement Your Honour, It has been 18 months since Debbie was killed, but to us it seems like it was just yesterday. Our lives started new and we were filled with pain from that day on. For each day that we have to live without her we feel cheated, never being able to touch her, see her, hear her talk or laugh. Debbie was the spark in our small family of three. She loved life and people, had many interests, found excitement in almost everything she did, and loved to share it with us. There is so much that I would like to tell you about Debbie: how she loved music, loved to sing and dance, volunteered at the senior�s home, how she loved to watch football with her father, was fascinated with magic tricks and loved animals. She hoped to be a vet some day to care for little furry creatures. She always brought home a stray cat or dog and made sure that the owner was found. Flashbacks from the crash fill my thoughts each night. She did not have a chance. Her life contrasted her death in so many ways. No one�s life should end that way. The day we buried our Deb, the sun was shining and the sky was clear. The air, however, was crisp and the wind ruffled through the flowers laying on her casket. We loved Debbie so much and saw she had a bright future. She would have been 17 years old today. I hope and pray that no other family suffers this type of loss although I know it is all too common. Our family wants justice and for a strong message to be sent to those who would even consider getting behind the wheel of their cars after drinking. Sincerely, Mark & Dianne Webster. Questions & Answers Will I need a lawyer? For the criminal proceedings, the crown attorney is the lawyer who will prepare the case. It is wise, however, to consult a lawyer regarding matters such as insurance claims, estates and if personal injuries were involved. A consultation with a lawyer is usually free. Call the law society in your telephone book for referrals to lawyers in your area. Can the drinking establishment be held liable? The drinking establishment may he held responsible in a civil case for serving the driver to the point of intoxication. Both financial judgments and revocation of their permit to serve alcoholic beverages can result from irresponsible service. I understand that the maximum sentence for impaired driving causing death is 14 years in prison, but what can we expect to happen? In the early 1980�s, it was common for an impaired driver convicted of killing someone to receive a $50. fine and a 3 month licence suspension. In 1995, the typical sentence for this offence may range from 2 - 3 years. An offender serves a fraction of this sentence before beginning parole. Exceptional cases have resulted in higher sentences as the judges become more aware of the violent nature of this crime and the number of repeat offenders who eventually kill. Is there any cost for MADD Canada services for victims? All of our victim services are organized by volunteers who donate their time to help. Many of these volunteers have lost a loved one due to impaired driving and they want to help others. In addition, information and referral services are provided at no cost. Can someone from MADD Canada come to court with me? In many cases a volunteer will be available to accompany you to court to provide support and information. Do I have to be a mother to be involved? MADD Canada involves the combined efforts of men and women of all ages who want to eliminate impaired driving and to help victims of this violent crime. All of our victim services are open equally to everyone. How can I find out more about MADD Canada? Write to: MADD Canada, 6507C Mississauga Road, Mississauga, Ontario.

Jacobs, first Director Office of Alternative Medicine, National Institutes of Health A Guide to Alternative Medicine, an Isis Interactive Library CD-ROM, provides the opportunity to explore the fascinating and rapidly growing world of Alternative Medicine. It is estimated that Alternative Medicine is a $14 billion industry in the U.S. alone. It is also reliably estimated that fully one-third of the U.S. population has explored alternatives to mainstream medicine for both prevention and therapy. "Alternative Medicine" is mainstream medicine for more than 80 percent of the world's population. Thirty-four of the country's 125 medical schools -- including Harvard, Yale and Johns Hopkins -- now offer courses in alternative medicine. In 1995, the American Medical Association passed a resolution suggesting that its 300,000 members "become better informed regarding the practices and techniques of alternative or unconventional medicine." Many of the U.S.'s leading news magazines -- including Time, Newsweek and Life -- have recently devoted cover stories to various alternative medical treatments. In 1991, the U.S. Congress established the Office of Alternative Medicine within the National Institutes of Health. The first Director of the Office was Dr. Joseph J. Jacobs, a respected and experienced mainstream physician whose Mohawk Indian heritage exposed him early in his life to treatments practiced historically among the Mohawk Indians. Dr. Jacobs brings a physician's dedication to scientific methods, skepticism of the unproven, but an open attitude to treatments that are not yet considered mainstream therapies. Dr. Jacobs leads the user through seven alternative medical topics: Mind-Body interventions Botanical Medicine Pharmacological and Biological treatments Manual healing methods Bioelectromagnetics Vitamins and Minerals Traditional Alternative Systems Each topic is packed with information, easily accessible to the user in a variety of forms: Video segments with experts in their fields Concise audio and written explanations of the topic A direct link to the NIH report Expanding Medical Horizons, offering hundreds of pages of authoritative information and documentation The user can develop his or her own "notebook" of information of individual interest. For example, if you are concerned about asthma, you can record information from various therapies and assemble it all together in your own notebook about alternative medical treatments available for asthma--and then Print the notebook. The disc also has a print function that will allow you to capture and print any information that the user may believe will be helpful. The Disc Index permits the user to search by topic and to go directly to the topic of immediate interest. There is also a Glossary accessible at all times. And to keep current with developments, the disc permits you to click directly onto the Isis medical site on the Internet, where you will find information updates and links to other sites that offer extensive information on Alternative Medicine. A Guide to Alternative Medicine is the most thorough and extensive work yet published on this topic in the CD-ROM format. Listed below are the many subjects included on the disc: Alternative Systems of Medical Practice includes segments on Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Latin American medicine, American Indian medicine, Acupuncture, and Naturopathy. Diet and Nutrition includes segments on Vitamins and Supplements, Regional Diets, Diets for Heart Disease, and Foods for Healthy Living. Botanical Medicine includes segments on General Herbal Medicine and traditional uses such as Chinese Botanicals, Ayurvedic Botanicals, Middle Eastern Botanicals, European Botanicals, American Indian Botanicals, Latin American Botanicals, and Pharmaceutical Botanical Uses. Manual Healing includes segments on Massage Therapy, Pressure Point therapies such as Reflexology and Shiatsu, Therapeutic Touch, Structural Integration, Postural Reeducation, and Body Manipulation such as Chiropractic, Osteopathy and Cranio-Sacral therapy. Mind-Body Interventions includes segments on Art Therapy, Biofeedback, Hypnotherapy, Guided Imagery, Dance Therapy, Movement therapies such as exercise and Tai Chi, Music Therapy, Prayer and Relaxation therapies such as Yoga, Meditation and Relaxation Response exercises.

This product is being produced in cooperation with the Solgar Nutritional Research Center in Berlin, MD. The market for vitamins, minerals, and supplements is enormous. It is estimated that the yearly expenditure in the U.S. is over $13 per person ($4.2 billion), followed closely by Germany, France, and Great Britain. The success of vitamins and supplements has stemmed from consumer interest in assuring good health and longevity. Also helping in the expansion of the dietary supplement market is the increase in product niche marketing to children, athletes, males, females, menopausal women and senior citizens. Responding to this growing demand, manufacturers have stepped up advertising campaigns in print, radio and television. Nearly every medicine cabinet in the western world contains some sort of vitamins or supplements. Many are never used because purchasers do not know what or how much they need of a given substance. This product will answers those questions and more. Over 100 vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and supplements are identified on the disc.

Tyler, Lily Distinguished Professor of Pharmacognosy, Purdue University School of Pharmacy Holly Shimizu, Chief Horticulturist, U. S. Botanic Gardens, Washington, D.C. Katy Moran, Executive Director, The Healing Forest Conservancy Although herbs have been used for centuries to cure various ailments, healing in the 20th century has focused more on pharmaceuticals than on traditional herbal cures. However, during the past decade, medicinal herbs have experienced a renaissance in the United States. Today, herbal compounds are found in the pharmacy sections of large drugstore chains and supermarkets, direct mail catalogs, and natural products stores. Many people have been attracted to herbal medicines due to the low health risk of treatments and their new found accessibility. Media has focused on this rebirth in combination with the rise in alternative and complementary medical treatments. Sales of medicinal herbs were estimated to be about $1.56 billion in 1995 and are projected to grow about 18 percent per year. These products are sold as extracts, tinctures, ointments, syrups, lozenges, bulk items, teas or as supplements, either as individual herbs or in combination formulas. A Guide to Botanical Medicine provides a multimedia exploration of the history, culturally diverse uses and medicinal properties of botanic matter, as well as providing information about the propagation of herbs for personal use. The disc will contain an Internet connection pointing specifically to an Isis site to provide the user with updated information and with a list of additional complementary sites. Video segments are included featuring interviews with subject matter experts, materials on the rainforest destruction, shamans at work, and herbal gardening. Topics include: The Global Perspective This section provides the user with the historical and cultural uses of botanics focusing on Asian/Chinese herbology, Ayurvedic herbology, Mediterranean/European herbology, African traditional herbology, and homeopathy. In addition, substantial materials are included on the current state of botanical research. Identifying Botanicals The user will learn the anatomy of the plant, naming conventions including the Latin botanical name (genus and species) and popular names. Materials on the medicinal parts and properties of plants will be presented. Being an Informed Consumer How does the consumer decide where it is safe to purchase botanicals? Why are they so popular?

Oocyte donation gives these women the opportunity to get pregnant.Women who may benefit from this procedure are women born without ovaries, womenwhose ovaries have been removed due to endometriosis/tumors or damaged byradiation/ chemotherapy, women whose ovaries do not function properly becauseof age or chromosomal abnormalities, and women whose eggs did not fertilizeafter in vitro fertilization (IVF). In the past several years, oocyte donation has become more and more popularbecause it is so successful. At the end of 1993, more than 2500 babies hadbeen born by oocyte donation. The success rate of this procedure can be up to50 percent, which is higher than any other method available. The uterus doesnot "age" as quickly as as the ovaries, and that is why even menopausal womenhave been able to get pregnant with this technique. The oocyte donation procedure starts with the use of medications to synchronizethe donor and recipient menstrual cycles. Once they are synchronized, thedonor receives injections of fertility medications that produce a number ofeggs in her ovaries. When the eggs have developed to the right stage, the eggsare removed with a small needle inserted through the vagina. The eggs arefertilized in the laboratory with the partner's (or donor) sperm. Thefertilized eggs develop into embryos, which are placed into the uterus of therecipient two days later. At the time the donor starts her fertilitymedications, the recipient also starts hormonal therapy in order to get thelining of her uterus ready for the embryos. After the embryos are transferred,the recipient continues hormonal therapy for a few months. Donor selection can be arranged privately, such as using a sister or friend, orit can be provided through a recruitment agency. Recruitment agencies havetheir own fee schedules, but typically charge about $5,000 to recruit andcompensate the donor. All egg donors are screened for any family history ofbirth defects or hereditary diseases. They also undergo psychological andmedical screening, and they are tested for infectious diseases. The bestdonors are usually women under 35 who have been pregnant previously, but donorsup to the age of 40 can be suitable in certain circumstances. The major risks of being an egg donor recipient are the risks associated withpregnancy, (e.g. miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, premature labor, cesareansection). Other risks can result from medications or a transmitted infection.The medications used to synchronize the menstrual cycles can cause annoyingsymptoms, such as hot flushes, mood swings, and headaches. And, even thoughthe donors are screened for infectious diseases, it is not possible tocompletely eliminate the risk of infection. Finally, there is the possibilitythat the donor may not respond appropriately to the medicine, that her eggs maynot fertilize, or that the recipient may not get pregnant.

Table of Contents: An Overview of the Gerson TherapyPhysician Training Program Phase I ProgramDescription Registration and TuitionInformationfor the Phase I Training, February 2-8, 1997, San Marcos,CA Gerson Therapy PhysicianTraining Program For many physicians, managing the care of patients with chronicdebilitating illness can be a time-consuming and unfulfilling task.Conventional protocols in treatment of degenerative diesases canoften offer limited benefit to the patient and can severelycompromise the quality of life during and after the treatmentperiod. The Gerson (tm) Therapy providesan answer to the physician who seeks a holistic, scientificallyproven treatment for life-threatening illness. Originally developedin the 1930s by Max Gerson, M.D., thetherapy offers the health care professional a safe, viable andpractical method of treating many degenerative diseases. The Gerson Therapy is an integratedholistic protocol developed by Max Gerson, M.D. for standalone andadjunctive use in the treatment of degenerative diseases. Over 200 articles in the peer reviewed medicalliterature document its effectiveness, and provide furtherunderstanding of the tissue damage syndrome (intracellular edema),supplementing nutritional deficiencies through the use of fresh,organic fruit and vegetable juices. Providing an intensive, nutritionbased, high-fluid, micronutrient, salt and water management, theGerson Therapy is rich in phytochemicals, supplements potassium, andrestricts dietary fat, protien, and sodium. Extensive mechanicaldetoxification through enemas combined with stimulation ofglutathione production systems dramatically improve elimination ofcell wastes. Because of the non-specific nature of the protocol, it is ofteneffective in treatment of a wide range of cancers, autoimmune,collagen, and degenerative diesases. The Gerson Therapy has beenshown in the medical literature to be extraordinarily effective inachieving long-term remission in Stage I-IV melanomas, exceedingsurvival rates achieved with conventional managements by as much as40%. [This study is available for viewing here.] Dramatic long-term recoveries havebeen observed with lymphoma, Duke's-C colorectal cancer, ovariancancer, and oat cell and adenocarcinomas of the lung. Biopsy-verifiedfull remissions have been observed in astrocytoma and cancers of thebreast, liver, pancreas and prostate, including some cases withextensive metastases. Full remission of symptoms has been documentedin a number of cases of systematic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoidarthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Relatively unique about the Gerson management is that it does notuse any proprietary medications. All medications and supplements areclassed as biologicals, and are supplied in therapeutic amounts. Allare approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. All of theprocedures, medications, and techniques used in the protocol havebeen fully tested and effectively used for many years, and arecompletely safe when used according to the protocol. Why The Gerson Therapy is a Sensible Choice for yourPractice There are many paths to wellness, and many different philosophiesabout appropriate treatment of life-threatening degenerativediseases. Why choose the Gerson Therapy over the many othertreatments available? We believe the answer lies in the combination of results, patientsatisfaction, scientific approach, and our philosophy of coordinationand partnership with practitioners and treatment centers. We believe the Gerson protocol itself to be the most complete,all-encompassing approach to wellness available anyhwere. The GersonTherapy incorporates dietary and lifestyle modification,sophisticated biochemical managements, intensive, multi-faceteddetoxification, psychological and mind/body approaches, and attentionto symptomatic relief through non-toxic means. When appropriate, theGerson protocol is combined with other proven managements to providethe most complete, powerful approach to cancer and other degenerativediseases available anywhere. We constantly review the medicalliterature, seeking new ways of reaching even the most advanced casesof cancer and disease. The Gerson Institute approaches modificationsand additions carefully, with great consideration, and sound testingbefore inclusion in the Gerson protocol, ensuring both thepractitioner and patient of the safest, most efficacious treatmentavailable. Adding the Gerson protocol to your practice will give you thesatisfaction of seeing rapid improvement in health and outlook inotherwise "terminal" patients. Since patients are activelyinvolved in restoring and maintaining their own health, they tend todevelop self-reliance, decreasing "emergency" and paniccalls, and increasing satisfaction with their medical treatment. As acertified Gerson practitioner, you will participate in case reviewwith the Gerson Institute, providing us with valuable statisticaldata, and ensuring that you have appropriate expertise available forthe treatment of difficult or unusual cases. Financially, working with Gerson patients is rewarding, aspatients will require consultations and follow-up care on a regularbasis for twenty-four months or longer. Also, since they become verydedicated to their treatment, patients often discuss their treatmentwith friends, co-workers, family, and others, resulting inword-of-mouth referrals, the most effective form of advertising. As a certified Gerson practitioner participating in our referralprogram, you will benefit from our national advertising, outreach, andeducation efforts. Patients seeking outpatient treatment in your areawill be referred to your practice. The Gerson Institute will alsocoordinate with you and endeavor to schedule educational seminars andlectures with Gerson Institute staff in your area, further helping tobuild your clientele of Gerson Therapy patients. Training Patients in the GersonProtocol The responsibilities of the physician managing a patient on theGerson Therapy will vary with the condition of the patient anddiagnosis, but typically includes the regular monitoring of patientstatus and disease staging through interpretation of pathology andother appropriate means. Modifications in diet, medications, and other protocols must beprescribed based on both traditional and non-traditional indications.The physician must also be prepared to assist the patient in managingacute healing reactions with dietary and/or medication modifications,and emotional support. We have found that the psychological aspect oftreatment is important, particularly during this reaction period.Access to the treating physician is vital, as many of the healingresponses are unfamiliar, and can therefore be frightening to thepatient and his or her family members or care providers. In addition to the medical interventions required, it should beunderstood that the Gerson protocol is a complex combination ofdietary restrictions, medication and enema administration, andlifestyle and environmental changes. We recommend that practitionersprovide patients with complete instruction and followup in thespecifics of the treatment, either through the distribution of GersonInstitute publications and videos, or through individualized patienttraining and ongoing consultation. Gerson Therapy Certification: A Partnership forSuccess The new era of managed care, limited resources, and tight costcontrols in medical treatment have opened the door for broadacceptance of treatment such as the Gerson protocol. Gerson carecosts are significantly lower than conventional cancer managements,benefiting insurance providers. Practitioners benefit by establishinga health partnership with their patients, improving thedoctor/patient relationship, and reducing the likelihood ofdissatisfaction that can lead to costly legal actions. Patientsbenefit by developing self-confidence, improving their outlook, andtaking responsibility for their well-being. Public demand for the scientifically proven Gerson Therapytreatment is skyrocketing. In 1995, in response to the increasingdemand for Gerson Therapy treatment, the Gerson Institute began todevelop medical education and certification programs to increaseaccess to the Gerson Therapy, and to protect the reputation forexcellence and high quality care that the Gerson name has come torepresent. Practitioners seeking to use the Gerson Therapy intheir practices achieve certification through a four-phase process.Completion of the Level I training described below is the first phase.The second phase is completion of a two-week internship at a Gersoninpatient treatment center. Intern practitioners will work directlywith patients and experienced Gerson physicians. In phase three,practitioners will treat patients in their own practice,with assistance and supervision from Gerson Institute staff andGerson-trained physicians. The last phase is a three-day training,review, and skill-assessment program. To maintain certification,practitioners must maintain a high standard of patient care andappropriate treatment, follow Gerson Institute guidelines regardingpatient management and treatment, provide data tothe Gerson Institutefor research, case management, and statistical purposes, and completeapproved continuing education units. We anticipate thatpractitioners who work diligently will be able to complete thecertification process in twelve to eighteen months. A complete,detailed description of the certification program will be available inearly 1997. The certified practitioner will be eligible for anumber of benefits, including the following: Ongoingconsultation and support from Gerson Institute staff andGerson-trained physicians Access to a network of other Gersonpractitioners Gerson Institute patient referrals seekingtreatment and long-term follow-up Permission to use theGerson name in connection with treatment of patients and marketing fornew patients Support with local publicity and outreach todevelop your practice We invite you to work with us. Through the efforts of ourorganization and a group of talented, dedicated medicalpractitioners, we can achieve our vision of making this safe,effective treatment available to patients worldwide. Treating Degenerative Diseaseswith the Gerson Therapy: Phase I Training Program Thisprogram is designed to introduce the health care practitioner to thepractice of the Gerson protocol as originally described in Gerson'sMonograph, "A CancerTherapy" (Historic Edition, Gerson Institute, 1996), withcurrent enhancements and additions. The six day intensive trainingwill offer direct instruction from Charlotte Gerson, experiencedGerson-trained physicians, and other senior Gerson Institutestaff. Practitioners attending the program will gain afundamental understanding of the Gerson Therapy treatment,assessment, follow-up and monitoring protocols, and will have accessto resources for ongoing training, support, and consultation from theGerson Institute.

Three full vegetarian meals, freshly prepared from organically grownvegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Individual medications including:     a.  potassium compound,    b.  thyroid hormone,    c.  Lugol's Solution    d.  injectable crude liver extract with B-12,    e.  pancreatic enzymes,    f.  enemas of coffee and/or chamomile tea,    g.  castor oil The Gerson Therapy is an intensive, nutrition-based, medicaltreatment. It works closely with nature to help the sick body to riditself of disease through the supportive effects of simple foods,juices, and non-toxic medication. The main features of the diet are:     1) sodium restriction,    2) potassium supplementation,    3) extreme fat restriction,    4) periodic (temporary) protein restriction,    5) high vitamin,    6) high mineral,    7) fluid rich,    8) high micronutrient. Although the diet allows for some cooked foods, emphasis is placed onthe consumption of unaltered foods. Fresh, raw fruits and vegetablesare the source materials of all micronutrients in their pristineorganic composition. Beyond supplying adequate quantities of allknown nutrients, the use of specific raw fruits and vegetables andtheir juices ensures that patients receive even those healthpromoting factors not yet appreciated by science. Medications used in the Gerson Therapy are classed as biologicals,materials of organic origin which are found in the body and aresupplied in therapeutic amounts. An important treatment employed as part of the Gerson Therapy isfrequent detoxification of tissues and blood by coffee enemas whichcause stimulation of enzyme systems of the gut wall and liver andpromote excretion of toxic bile.

Heattended the Universities of Breslau, Wuerzburg, Berlin and Freiburg.He was the director of a special department of tuberculosis at theMunich University Hospital under the sponsorship of Dr. FerdinandSauerbruch, a world famous thoracic surgeon and tuberculosisauthority. As a young German medical student, Gerson suffered from severemigraine headaches. He had been told that they were untreatable, andthat he would have to learn to live with them. To his joy, Gersonfound that by restricting his diet, by avoiding salt, fats, pickledand smoked foods, and by eating fresh fruits and vegetables, he couldcontrol them. Soon, he was sharing this new "migraine diet" with hispatients. One of Gerson's patients insisted that the migraine diet had cured hisskin tuberculosis. Gerson listened, carefully weighing thepossibility that the diet might somehow be enhancing immunity. Hedecided that it might be true, and set out to validate it. In theprocess, his work came to the attention of Sauerbruch. A new era inmedicine was born. In 1929, Sauerbruch announced Gerson's dietarytherapy as a cure for skin TB, publishing simultaneously in a dozen ofthe world's leading peer-reviewed scientific journals. Sauerbruch toldof a clinical trial of Gerson's dietary treatment in which 446 of 450TB patients achieved lasting cures (also mentioned in Sauerbruch'sautobiography, "Master Surgeon"). Gerson lectured in the principalcities of Europe until the pre-war political climate forced him toemigrate in 1933. During this time, Gerson attracted the friendship of Nobel Prizewinner Albert Schweitzer, M. D., by curing his wife of lungtuberculosis after she had failed to respond to all conventionalmanagements. 1934 saw the publication of "Diet Therapy for LungTuberculosis" (pub. Franz Deuticke, Leipzig and Vienna) in whichMrs. Schweitzer is documented case 45. Gerson and Schweitzer remainedfriends for life, and maintained a regular correspondence. Schweitzerfollowed Gerson's progress as the diet therapy was appliedsuccessfully to a wide variety of pathologies, including heart andkidney failure, and finally cancer. Schweitzer's own adult onsetdiabetes responded to Gerson's dietary treatment. In 1946, Gerson demonstrated recovered cancer patients before thePepper-Neely Congressional Sub-Committee, during hearings on S. 1875,a bill to authorize the President to wage war on cancer. Although onlya few peer-reviewed journals were receptive to his revolutionaryideas, Gerson continued to publish in the U. S. and abroad. Gerson died in 1959. He was eulogized by Albert Schweitzer: "I see in him one of the most eminent geniuses in the history ofmedicine. Many of his basic ideas have been adopted without havinghis name connected with them. Yet he has achieved more than seemedpossible under adverse conditions. He leaves a legacy which commandsattention and, which will assure him his due place. Those whom hecured will now attest to the truth of his ideas." The Gerson Therapy Copyright 1994,1995 (c) The Gerson Institute, All rights reserved.

Ignoring boththe empirical dietary wisdom that pervaded western medicine from thepre-Christian Hippocratic era until the late nineteenth century and apersuasive body of modern research in nutritional biochemistry, thepolitically minded spokesmen of organized medicine in the U.S. remained long committed to surgery and radiation as the sole acceptable treatments forcancer. This commitment persisted, even after sound epidemiological datashowed that early detection and removal of malignant tumors did not "cure"most kinds of cancer (Crile, 1956; updated by Cairns, 1985). The historical record shows that progress lagged especially in cancerimmunotherapy - including nutrition and hyperthermia - because power overprofessional affiliation and publication (and hence over practice andresearch) rested with men who were neither scholars nor practitioners norresearchers themselves, and who were often unequipped to grasp the rapidlyevolving complexities of the sciences underlying mid-twentieth-centurymedicine. Nowhere is this maladaption of professional structure to medicine's changingscientific context more tragically illustrated than in the American experienceof Max B. Gerson (1881- 1959), founder of the best-known nutritional treatmentfor cancer of the pre-macrobiotic era. A scholar's scholar and a superlativeobserver of clinical phenomena, Gerson was a product of the German medicaleducation which Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries consideredso superior to our own that all who could afford it went to Germany to perfecttheir training (Bonner, 1963). As a medical graduate of the University ofFreiburg in 1909, Gerson imbibed all of the latest in scientific medicine,with the emphasis on specificity which bacteriology had brought into westernmedical thought in the preceding decades. Gerson subsequently worked withleading German specialists in internal medicine, in physiological chemistry,and in neurology (U.S. Congress, 1946, 98). The historical record does nottell us whether his medical education in Germany (where much of the early workin nutritional chemistry took place) included a study of diet, a subjectneglected in American medical schools after the germ theory gained acceptance. We do know that by 1919, when Gerson set up a practice in internal and nervousdiseases in Bielefeld, he had devised an effective dietary treatment for themigraine headaches which frequently disabled him, despite the best efforts ofhis colleagues. In 1920, while treating migraine patients by this salt-freevegetarian diet, he discovered that it was also effective in lupus vulgaris(tuberculosis of the skin, then considered incurable) and, later, in arthritisas well (U.S. Congress, 1946, 98). Trained in the theories of specific disease causation and treatment that beganto dominate western medicine - for the first time in history - asbacteriological discoveries multiplied in the late nineteenth century, Gersonwas at first uneasy about using a single therapy in such seemingly disparateconditions. But he was committed to the primacy of clinical evidence, whichhe liked to express in Kussmaul's dictum: "The result at the sick-bed isdecisive" (quoted in Gerson, 1958, 212). In later years, after research beganto provide explanations for Gerson's clinical observations, he quotedChurchill on the mistaken course of action he had thus avoided: "Menoccasionally stumble over the truth, but most pick themselves up and hurry offas if nothing had happened" (Gerson, 1958, 212). Gerson persisted. In 1924his success in treating tuberculosis of the skin brought an invitation fromthe noted thoracic surgeon, Ferdinand Sauerbruch, to test Gerson's diet in aspecial lupus clinic to be provided by the Bavarian government at theUniversity of Munich. As Sauerbruch recounts it in his autobiography, 446patients out of 450 recovered - once he had discovered and put an end to thesmuggling of sausages, cream and beer to the patients in the late afternoons (Sauerbruch, 1953, 167- 171 ). Later extended to pulmonary tuberculosis aswell, this Gerson-Sauerbruch-Hermannsdorfer diet was widely used in Germanyand became the subject of Gerson's first book in 1934 (Gerson, 1934;Hildenbrand, 1987 communication). During the late twenties and early thirties Gerson had several experienceswhich informed his later thinking on diet and degenerative disease. As amember of the State Board of Health, appointed by the Prussian government, hewas given extraordinary laboratory support for a clinical trial of diet inpulmonary tuberculosis. Besides the physiological parameters customarilymonitored in such work, Gerson was able to track minute fluctuations in thepatients' mineral metabolism and also in the chemical composition of the foodshe prescribed (Gerson, 1958, 183). At this same period he served as consultantto the Prussian Ministry of Health on the best ways to restore to agriculturalusefulness the exhausted soil around several major German cities (Gerson,1958, 183). When he learned that modern farming methods often rob plant foodsof their natural mineral and vitamin riches, while increasing their sodiumcontent, he began to think of the earth's well-being as central to our own.Eventually he began to refer to the soil, which nourishes the food we eat, asour "external metabolism" (Gerson 1958, 175). It was in 1928 that Gerson first used his diet in cancer, at the insistence ofa woman who had jaundice, high fever and two small liver metastases afterunsuccessful surgery for cancer of the bile duct (Gerson, 1958, 31). On thestrength of reports she had heard of Gerson's work with tuberculosis, thiswoman insisted that he write out a diet for the treatment of her cancer.Gerson reluctantly agreed - after he obtained her signed statement that shewould not hold him responsible for the outcome! As he recalled it many yearslater, this same patient had him read aloud to her a chapter called "TheHealing of Cancer" from a big book of about 1200 pages on folk medicine, "edited by three schoolteachers and one physician, none of them practitioners.It was from this source that Gerson first learned of the special soup whichHippocrates supposedly gave to cancer patients and which Gerson made a fixtureof his cancer Therapy (Gerson, 1958, 31, 403-404; Gerson, 1978, 449-450).Having taken up this challenge against his will, with no hope of success,Gerson was astounded when his patient seemed fully recovered within six months(Gerson, 1958, 405). In quick succession he had the same good results with twopatients with inoperable stomach cancer, both referred by this first patient.Late in life he continues to marvel at these apparent recoveries under hisdiet treatment (Gerson, 1958, 404- 405). (These notable histories, whichGerson recounted in some detail, have prompted one recent researcher tosuggest the possible involvement of aldoslerone as the mechanism ofmineral-corticoid sensitivity in gastrointestinal tumors. See McCarty, 1981). In Vienna, where he lived for a time after the rise of Hitler, Gerson'streatment failed in all seven patients he attempted to treat in this manner -a failure which, in later years, he attributed to inadequate dietaryprovisions in the sanitarium where he then worked (Gerson, 1958, 31-32, 405).In Paris, where he lived in 1935-36, the diet produced good results in threeout of seven cases (Gerson, 1958, 32, 405; Gerson, 1978, 451), inspiring himto pursue such treatment further after he emigrated to the United States in1938. Gerson constantly sought explanations for his observations in the scientificliterature, where he read widely in several languages (Gerson, 1958). In 1954,in "Cancer, a Problem of Metabolism," he credited J. Maisin (1923) and B.Fischer-Wasels (1929) with advancing physiological explanations of generalpredisposition toward tumor formation and abandoning the theory of cancercausation by local irritation. For the next few decades (according toGerson's account of the evolution of cancer concepts) there was a tendency tointerpret cancer in terms of constitution and diathesis, as was done withdiabetes, gout and tuberculosis. It was Caspari (Nutrition and Cancer, 1938)who turned to metabolic explanation of the kind Gerson ultimately favored(Gerson, 1954, 1). He devoted an entire chapter of his book to a review ofefforts, largely by German researchers, to alter metabolism by diet (Gerson,1958, 89-104). He found special appeal in Otto Warburg, The Metabolism ofTumors, (London, 1930), in G. von Bergmann's Funktionelle Pathologie (Berlin,1932), and in Frederick Hoffman's massive compilation, Cancer and Diet(Baltimore, 1937). Gradually, out of his bedside experience and his reading,he formed a unitary theory of degenerative disease (including cancer) whichrested on one of the oldest and most pervasive concepts in the history ofmedicine: the vis medicatrix naturae or healing power of nature (Neuburger,1926 and 1944; Warner, 1978). Endlessly seeking out the latest researches andtheories in physiology, biochemistry, and - increasingly - immunology, Gersonrapidly integrated these massive bodies of new detail into the largerframework of what he called "the physician within", that is, the natural powers of resistance,which we today call the immune system. Gerson believed that cancer changes the body's normal sodium/potassiumbalance, already disturbed by modern diet. Thus his therapy used foods low insodium (no salt added), high in potassium, and rich in vitamins A and C andoxidizing enzymes. He excluded fats and dairy products for the first four tosix weeks, considering them dangerously burdensome to the digestion in theextremely sick patients who usually came to him only after having exhaustedconventional measures. Above all it was essential for patients to eliminateexcess sodium, which Gerson believed responsible for altering cellularelectrochemistry in favor of cancerous growth. There is now a great deal of research suggesting possible mechanisms for theefficacy of Gerson's high potassium/low sodium diet. As he suspected and wenow know, hypokalemia often accompanies cancer of the colon, and alterationsin electrical and mineral states occur often in cancer patients (Newell, 1981,87). Cone has furnished experimental proof of a correlation between the levelof electrical potential across somatic cell membranes and the intensity ofmitotic activity (Cone, 1971 ), a finding supported by Zs.-Nagy and hiscolleagues in studies so human thyroid cancer (Zs. -Nagy, 1983) . Ling'sassociation/induction hypothesis is based on laboratory studies which showthat damaged cells partially return to their normal configuration in highpotassium/low sodium environments (Ling, 1943), perhaps explaining theremarkable tissue repair which Gerson sometimes saw in his formerlydebilitated patients (Cope, 1978). Lai has suggested that intracellular sodiumand potassium levels may furnish the mechanism for regulating cellulardifferentiation and transformation (Lai, 1985) . To supply active oxidation enzymes and potassium-rich minerals, Gerson'spatients drank hourly glasses of freshly prepared vegetable and fruit juices.As early as 1933-34, while living in Vienna, Gerson had begun givinginjections of liver extract, as another means of stimulating the patient'sliver (Gerson, 1958, 31 -32). In later years he had patients drink two tothree glasses daily of the juice of calves' liver pressed with carrots. Inaddition to beta-carotene/vitamin A, this would supply iron and copper, bothof which affect peripheral T cell functions and other peripheral lymphocytesubpopulations (Keusch, 1983, 345- 347). Although the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry labeled as a "false notion"the idea that diet can affect cancer, recent researchers have found that"nutritional status plays a critical role in immunological defense mechanismsat a number of important levels" (Keusch, 1983, 345) and that nutritionalfactors "can have profound influences on ... the development andmanifestations of cancers" as well as other diseases (Good, 1982, 85). In "TheCancerostatic Effect of Vegetarian Diets" ( 1983), Siguel describes as theideal way to strengthen bodily defenses against neoplastic cells a dietsimilar to Gerson's: high in carbohydrates and vegetables, low in protein. Like von Bergmann, Gerson believed that "every defense and healing power ofthe body depends on the capacity of the body to produce a so-called 'allergicinflammation'"- a truth long recognized by surgeons, but somehow forgotten bymedicine during the heyday of microbiology. To Gerson this capacity toproduce inflammation was "the decisive part of the body's 'weapon of healingpower'" (Gerson, 1958, 127-28). Noting that fluid from a normal inflammation metabolism kills cancer cells,but that blood serum does not, von Bergmann concluded that a cancer metabolismoccurs when the body can no longer produce this healing inflammatory reaction(Gerson, 1958, 120- 121 ). Gerson agreed, but in contrast to von Bergmann andmost of his contemporaries, Gerson believed it was often possible for thephysician to help restore the vital power of inflammation, even in anergicpatients with advanced cancer. If cancer was a degenerative disease caused bythe cumulative effect of inadequate nutrition with foods grown in soilsdepleted by artificial fertilizers and poisoned by toxic insecticides andherbicides, doctors must respond by replenishing the entire human organism.For a condition that represented an ultimate failure of equilibrium in apoisoned metabolism, removal of tumors by surgery or radiation was merelysuperficial, symptomatic treatment. "Medicine," Gerson said, "must be able toadapt its therapeutic methods to the damages of the processes of our moderncivilization" (Gerson, 1958, 199). Gerson set about doing this by altering the basic diet he had used earlier inother conditions. Through meticulous observation of his patients in New York(where he passed state boards in 1939), he perfected a regimen of detoxicationand diet requiring a high degree of compliance by the patient, heroic devotionby the patient's family, and close attention and frequent adjustment by thephysician. His therapy aimed to detoxify the body and restore its healingapparatus, especially the liver, the visceral nervous system, and thereticulo-mesenchymal system. Gerson first encountered the idea of detoxication in cancer in the version ofHippocratic regimen which he read with his first cancer patient in Bielefeldin 1928 (Gerson, 1958, 404). After losing several cancer patients to hepaticcoma rather than to direct effects of the disease (Gerson, 1958, 191 ), herealized that "The digestive tract is very much poisoned in cancer'. Theliver and pancreas failed to function: "nothing is active" (Gerson, 1958,407). To stimulate the liver, he began to use coffee enemas, which 0.A. Meyerof Goettingen had found effective in opening the bile ducts in animals andwhich American surgeons in that period were using in acute adrenalinsufficiency and in shock from postoperative hemorrhage and bleeding pepticulcer (Beeson, 1980, 90, 96; Rothstein, 1987, 124). As he watched the progressof his patients, he found that he could accelerate detoxication by givingcoffee enemas more frequently, with the addition of castor oil, by mouth andby rectum (Gerson, 1958, 81). Although Gerson used caffeine enemas primarily to facilitate excretion oftoxic wastes, especially from necrosing tumors, we now realize that theseenemas also promoted the absorption of vitamin A, a process requiring theaction of bile acids (Simone, 1943, 64). Thus the enemas that brought ridiculefrom Gerson's enemies actually enabled his patients to use the enormousamounts of vitamin A which his diet provided (recently estimated at about100,000 IU daily: see Seifter, 1988). Vitamin A, in turn, plays a vital rolein immune function, perhaps by causing the helper cells to induce theproduction of interleukin-2, or by causing killer cell precursors to activatecytotoxic mechanisms, or by causing suppressor T cells to eliminate downregulation (Keusch, 1983, 330-331 ). Gerson also found that caffeine enemas greatly reduce pain, a particular boonin his regimen, which avoids the use of opiates and other painkilling drugsthat might overtax the liver at a time when its limited capacity is needed forimmune functions and for eliminating the toxic products of tumor breakdown. Although the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry labeled as a "false notion"the idea that diet can affect cancer, recent researchers have found that"nutritional status plays a critical role in immunological defense mechanismsat a number of important levels" (Keusch, 1983, 345) and that nutritionalfactors "can have profound influences on ... the development andmanifestations of cancers" as well as other diseases (Good, 1982, 85). In "TheCancerostatic Effect of Vegetarian Diets" ( 1983), Siguel describes as theideal way to strengthen bodily defenses against neoplastic cells a dietsimilar to Gerson's: high in carbohydrates and vegetables, low in protein. Gerson gradually added a few medications to his diet. One of these wasniacin, which he believed would help restore proper intracellular potential,raise depleted liver stores of glycogen and potassium, and aid in proteinmetabolism (Gerson, 1958, 32, 99- 100, 209). Another was iodine, which Gersoninitially used only in cases of low metabolic rates. When he found that "Thebest range of healing power" was a BMR of +6 to +8 (monitored by organiciodine in blood serum), and that iodine seemed to counteract the neoplasticeffect of hormones, he incorporated iodine into the basic regimen, at first inthe form of thyroid extract, later as inorganic Lugol's solution (iodine pluspotassium iodide) (Gerson, 1958, 32, 409; U.S. Congress, 1946, 114). Severalresearchers have showed that thyroid raises natural resistance to infection byaugmenting the power of reticuloendothelial cells and by increasing antibodyformation - thus supporting Gerson's hunch that iodine was a decisive factorin the normal differentiation of cells (Lurie, 1960; Thorbecke, 1962). Despite the fact that he had no inpatient facility until 1946, when he openeda clinic in Nanuet, New York, Gerson managed, through his thriving Park Avenuepractice and an affiliation at Gotham Hospital, to amass enough data topublish a preliminary report in 1945. He presented his rather remarkable casehistories modestly, concluding that he did not yet have enough evidence to saywhether diet could either influence the origin of cancer or alter the courseof an established tumor. He claimed only that the diet, which he described inconsiderable detail, could favorably affect the patient's general condition,staving off the consequences of malignancy and making further treatmentpossible (Gerson, 1945). Gerson may have struck an Establishment nerve with his statement that manyphysicians use surgery and/or radiation "without systematic treatment of thepatient as a whole" (Gerson, 1945, 419). But it seems more likely that it washis growing success in practice, or perhaps even his opposition to tobacco,that first drew the wrath of organized medicine. ( Philip Morris was thenJAMA's major source of advertising revenue: see Rorty, 1939, 182 - 194). In any case the AMA did not openly attack Gerson until November 1946, a fewmonths after he testified in support of a Senate bill to appropriate $100million to bring together the world's outstanding cancer experts in order tocoordinate a search for the prevention and cure of cancer. At hearings beforeSenator Claude Pepper's sub-committee in July 1946, Gerson demonstratedrecovered patients who had come to him after conventional methods could nolonger help. Dr. George Miley, medical director of the 85-bed GothamHospital, where Gerson had treated patients since January, 1946, gave strongsupporting medical testimony (U.S. Congress, 1946). In a surly editorial response, JAMA said it was "fortunate" that this Senateappearance received little newspaper publicity; the AMA was clearly outragedthat Gerson's appearance had become the subject of a favorable radiocommentary, broadcast nationwide by ABC's Raymond Gram Swing (U.S. Congress,1946, 31-35; JAMA, 1946). The JAMA editorial focused on Gerson, even though itwas not Gerson but a lay witness, immune to AMA retaliation, who had calledGerson's successes "miracles" and urged the Senators to secure their futurecancer commission against control by any existing medical organization (U.S.Congress, 1946, 96,97). It was not Gerson, but Dr. Miley, who told the Senators that a long-termsurvey by a well-known and respected physician showed that those who receivedno cancer treatment lived longer than those who received surgery, radiation orX-ray (U.S. Congress, 1946, 117). Perhaps because Miley was a Northwesternmedical graduate, an established physician licensed in four states, and afellow of the AMA and state and county societies of Pennsylvania and New York,Morris Fishbein did not attack him personally. Instead, he limited himself tointimations of fiscal impropriety in the Robinson Foundation, which ownedMiley's Gotham Hospital, and to the scandalous revelation that the director ofthe section on health education of this Foundation (which was promoting "anunestablished, somewhat questionable method of treating cancer") was not anM.D. at all, but a Yale University professor of economics! Compared to Miley's testimony, Gerson's was innocent, concentrating on thehistories of the patients he brought with him and on the likely mechanismswhereby his diet caused tumor regression and healing. Only under pressurefrom Senator Pepper did Gerson state that about 30% of those he treated showeda favorable response ( U.S. Congress, 1946, 115). Nonetheless, JAMA devotedtwo pages to undermining Gerson's integrity (JAMA, 1946). Showing no restraintwhere Gerson was concerned, Fishbein, contrary to fact, alleged that successeswith the Gerson-Sauerbruch-Hermannsdorfer diet "were apparently notsusceptible of duplication by most other observers. " He also falsely claimedthat Gerson had several times refused to supply the AMA with details of thediet. (Fishbein said he could provide them in this editorial only because"there has come to hand through a prospective patient" of Gerson a dietschedule for his treatment.) Fishbein emphasized, without comment, Gerson'scaution about the use of other medications, especially anesthetics, becausethey produced dangerously strong reactions in the heightened allergic state ofhis most responsive patients. Fishbein attempted to tie together this strange patchwork of slurs againstGerson and against research supported by lay-dominated industrial corporationswith his accustomed mastery of innuendo: "The entire performance, includingthe financial backing, the promotion and the scientific reports, has apeculiar effluvium which, to say the least, is distasteful and, at its worst,creates doubt and suspicion" (JAMA, 1946, 646). Through no fault of his own, Gerson was again portrayed favorably in the newsin 1947, when John Gunther, in Death Be Not Proud, credited Gerson withextending the life of Gunther's son during the boy's ultimately unsuccessfulstruggle with brain cancer. Beginning that same year the New York CountyMedical Society staged five "investigations" of Gerson and eventuallysuspended him for "advertising" his "secret" methods. At this point Gerson's life took on a nightmare quality. The Pepper-Neely billmet defeat and, with it, the hope for coordinated cancer research free ofprior restraints against investigations of anything other than "established"methods. In 1949 the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, in a reportentitled "Cancer and the Need for Facts", rehashed material from the earliereditorial, adding that the Gerson diet was "lacking in essential protein andfat" and that Gerson's concern about the dangers of anesthesia was "whollyunfounded and apparently designed to appeal to the cancer victim alreadyfearful of a surgical operation which might offer the only effective means foreradication of the disease". Without benefit of either a literature search ornew clinical or laboratory research, the Council labeled as a "false notion"the idea that "diet has any specific influence on the origin or progress ofcancer". They concluded that "There is no scientific evidence whatsoever toindicate that modifications in the dietary intake of food or other nutritionalessentials are of any specific value in the control of cancer" (Council onPharmacy and Chemistry, 1949, 96). Gerson lost his hospital affiliation andfound that young doctors who wanted to assist him and learn from him could notdo so, for fear of incurring Society discipline. He was denied malpracticeinsurance, because his therapy was not "accepted practice" (Moss, 1980, 178;Natenberg, 1959, 136). In the early fifties Gerson submitted five case histories to the NCI,requesting an official investigation. He was told that they would need 25cases, which he promptly supplied, with full documentation. More than a yearlater the NCI demanded 125 case histories, saying that the 25 they hadpreviously requested were insufficient to justify investigation. According to a 1981 publication of the Gerson Institute, headed by hisdaughter, Charlotte Gerson, a manuscript for a book he was writing about histherapy disappeared from his files in 1956 (Healing, 1981, 19) At the age of75, isolated from medical colleagues and unable to find assistants, Gersonundertook the work of rewriting the entire manuscript in order to show "thatthere is an effective treatment of cancer, even in advanced cases" (Gerson,1958, 3). It was published in 1958, as A Cancer Therapy: Results of FiftyCases. Gerson died of pneumonia the following year, before finishing a secondvolume. His ideas have gained wide distribution through subsequent editions ofhis book (1975, 1977, and 1986); through a 1962 publication called Has Dr. MaxGerson a True Cancer Cure?, which had reportedly sold more than 250,000 copiesby 1980 (Moss, 1980, 178); and through the publications and physician-trainingprograms of the Gerson Institute in Bonita, California, and the Hospital deBaja California. In 1980 a reformed JAMA carried a commentary called "The 'Grand Conspiracy'Against the Cancer Cure" by William Regelson of the Department of Medicine ofthe Medical College of Virginia. Surveying a series of "inappropriatejudgments [that] have resulted in injury to good observations," Regelson said,"We may shortly have to ask if Gerson's low-sodium diet, with its bizarrecoffee enemas and thyroid supplementation, was an approach that altered themitotic regulating effect of intracellular sodium for occasional clinicalvalidity in those patients with the stamina to survive it" (Regelson, 1980,338). Disregarding such suggestions and resting its case instead on the claim thatthe NCI had "found no convincing evidence of effectiveness" during a review often Gerson cases some forty years earlier, the American Cancer Society in 1987stated that "The Gerson method of cancer treatment is not considered a provenmeans of cancer treatment, and on the basis of available information, theInstitute does not believe that further evaluation of this therapy is calledfor at this time" (American Cancer Society, February 5, 1987). Testing is underway, however, outside of the U.S. Since 1984 a modified formof Gerson's therapy has been in use at the Second Department of Surgery of theKrankenhaus in Graz, Austria. Omitting liver juice and niacin, using thyroidonly in hypothyroid patients, and limiting caffeine enemas to two per day,Peter Lechner and his colleagues, all of them surgeons, have been testing theGerson method as an adjunct, often with chemotherapy or radiation, in 60post-operative cancer patients, male and female, ranging in age from 23 to 74,and representing many different forms of cancer. By pairing each patient whowas willing to use the Gerson method (GP) with one of similar age andcondition who chose not to try it (NGP) and observing the comparative progressof the disease in the two groups over a four-year period, Lechner and hiscolleagues have approximated a controlled study of admittedly imperfectstructure (Lechner, 198 7). Their findings show that the Gerson therapy made a notable difference inseveral forms of cancer. Although GPs with bone metastases had no bettersurvival or tumor response than NGPs, their relief from pain and absence ofhypercalcemia made for a better quality of life. GPs with lung metastasesrequired fewer procedures to relieve pleural effusion. GPs with brainmetastases experienced decreased edema and lived four months longer than theirpaired NGPs. Premenopausal and perimenopausal breast cancer GPs toleratedconventional treatments better, with fewer side effects; showed better liverand kidney function and blood counts; and had fewer local recurrences and nometastases. Breast cancer GPs with liver metastases tolerated chemotherapybetter, and one of three has been in a steady state for more than a year,while the remaining five have died. GPs with colorectal carcinoma seemed togain weight and recover better after surgery, but showed no significantdifference in incidence of secondaries or local recurrence. The bestresponders to date are GPs with liver metastases, with two GPs showingimproved hepatic enzyme profiles compared to two NGPs; in four other pairs,although profiles remained similar, the GPs lived twice as long as the NGPs(Lechner, 1987). It is an irony of both history and geography that the first comparative studyof Max Gerson's therapy should take place at the hands of surgeons, in thatpart of the world which Gerson fled as a Jewish refugee half a century ago andthat the results, while not so outstanding as those he seemed able to produce,are most encouraging in patients with severe damage to the liver, the organ heconsidered central to recovery.

It worksclosely with nature to help the sick body to rid itself of disease through the supportive effects ofsimple foods, juices, and non-toxic medication.  Its successes in curing the dread diseases of ourtimes for the past 75 years have no parallel in the conventional medical context. The Gerson Institute is a non-profit organization dedicated to the holistic treatment of degenerative diseases. We strive to educate the public on the benefits of holistic healing through worldwide lectures and seminars, publication and distribution of literature on the Gerson Therapy, Training programs for Physicians, Healthcare practitioners, and home care assistants, and through establishing ties to approved clinics and treatment centers.

FIVE YEAR SURVIVAL RATES OF MELANOMA PATIENTS TREATED BY DIET THERAPY AFTER THE MANNER OF GERSON: A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW Objective - Compare 5-year melanoma survival rates to rates in medical literature Design - Retrospective. Setting - Hospital in Tijuana, Mexico. Patients - White adult patients (N=153) with superficial spreading and nodular melanoma, aged 25-72 years. Intervention - Gerson's diet therapy: lactovegetarian; low sodium, fat and (temporarily) protein; high potassium, fluid, and nutrients (hourly raw vegetable/fruit juices). Metabolism increased by thyroid; calorie supply limited to 2600-3200 calories per day. Coffee enemas as needed for pain and appetite. Main Outcome Measure - 5-year survival rates by stage at admission. Results - Of 14 patients with stages I and II (localized) melanoma, 100% survived for 5 years, compared with 79% of 15,798 reported by Balch. Of 17 with stage IIIA (regionally metastasized)melanoma, 82% were alive at 5 years, in contrast to 39% of 103 from Fachklinik Hornheide. Of 33 with combined stages IIIA + IIIB (regionally metastasized) melanoma, 70% lived 5 years, compared with41% of 130 from Fachklinik Hornheide. We propose a new stage division: IVA (distant lymph, skin, and subcutaneous tissue metastases), and IVB (visceral metastases). Of 18 with stage IVA melanoma, 39% were alive at 5 years, compared with only 6% of 194 from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Survival impact was not assessed for stage IVB. Male and female survival rates were identical for stages I-IIIB, but stage IVA women had a strong survival advantage. Conclusions - The 5-year survival rates reported here are considerably higher than those reported elsewhere. Stage IIIA/B males had exceptionally high survival rates compared with those reported by other centers. (Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine. 1995;1(4):29-37) This article summarizes the clinical outcomes of melanoma patients treated with the nutrition-based cancer therapy proposed by the German physician Gerson[1] (who conducted research at the Universityof Munich in the 1930s) and contrasts them with rates reported in the literature. To our knowledge, this report is the most thorough retrospective analysis to date of the potential survival benefit of this, or any other, well-known alternative method of cancer management. The genesis of this inquiry occurred during a landmark study by the US Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)[2] to which one of us (GH) was an advisor. In its report, OTA put forward a protocol for best-case reviews based on the premise that, no matter how many patients failed, as few as 10 or 12 cases with objective evidence of tumor response would be enough to propel an investigation by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Because we had proposed the original best-case review protocol to OTA, we were eager to construct such a review. However, we found OTA's (and later NCI's) protocol to have a serious shortcoming when used retrospectively: its focus on tumor regression only. Adequate documentation of tumor regression is unlikely to be collected in most alternative medical practices. We abandoned the best-case review for the more informative retrospective review. In contrast to the best-case review, the retrospective review describes all patients, including nonresponders, giving a more adequate impression of the outcomes of treatment. Our efforts to complete a best-case review, however, were not without some rewards. Practitioners at Centro Hospitalario Internacional del Pacifico, SA (CHIPSA) in Playas de Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico suggested cases with different types of cancer they believed had unusually positive outcomes. Of the 27 cases cataloged, 33% were long-term melanoma survivors, which underscored the need to do a more complete evaluation of melanoma per se. In the process, we determined that the institutions at which the patients were originally diagnosed were reliable. We requested histological specimens for the above 27 cases, and forwarded the numbered slides, without clinical histories, to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). AFIP pathologists' findings agreed with those reported by the original institutions with the exception of one specimen, which had been destroyed by improper handling and storage. In a related exercise, original diagnostic scans were read by contemporary UCLA physicians, whose interpretations were in virtually complete agreement with those of the original readers. METHODS Over 15 years, from 1975 through July 1990, 249 patients presented for treatment of melanoma; however, 53 (21%) were lost to follow-up. Survival outcomes were learned for the other 196, but 14were excluded because they did not have verified nodular or superficial spreading melanoma. Of the remaining 182, 29 (19%) charts could not be assessed for stage at admission. Therefore, this paper is based on the outcomes of 153 adult melanoma patients treated with Gerson's nutrition-based cancer therapy. All assessable patients were white. Almost all were hospitalized by CHIPSA physicians, but several were treated by physicians in private practice. Medical charts supplied by CHIPSA were consolidated from three predecessor facilities, Hospital la Gloria, Hospital Jardines la Mesa, andHospital del Sol, all from the Tijuana metropolitan area. Gerson is credited with the introduction and development of therapeutic sodium (Na+) restriction[3] in the context of a high potassium (K+) diet, which was first broadly tested in refractory cutaneous tuberculosis (lupus vulgaris)[4] According to eminent dermatologist Erich Urbach[5], the majority of authors of note investigated and approved Gerson's diet therapy for lupus. Emerson[6] was the first US author to refer to the diet as a metabolic therapy. Gerson's tuberculosis diet became the basis of a number of quite different dietotherapies he developed for conditions as diverse as pulmonary tuberculosis and cardiorenal insufficiency. The cancer management employed by CHIPSA was developed empirically by Gerson over the course of 30 years of clinical experimentation[7]. Gradually, by trial and error, Gerson evolved an integrated set of medical treatments, which he last published in a 1958 monograph along with 50 cases presented in clinical detail[8]. Although Gerson's method was published several times in US[9] and German[10-12] refereed journals, it is not well known by most practitioners and researchers. Therefore, a brief description of the development and nature of the therapy may be useful. During the 1930s, Gerson's research at the University of Munich was afforded extraordinary laboratory support through funding provided by both the Bavarian and Prussian federal governments[13]. Gerson focused on the experimental use of diet and medications to improve tissue edema occurring in a variety of pathologies. Edema is characterized by salt and water changes that Cope[14] has defined as tissue damage syndrome--decreased cell K+, increased cell Na+, and increased cell water (cell swelling) --changes that are also observed after death[15]. Nutritional treatment to provide cells with a high K+, low Na+ environment improved edema and led to enhanced tissue resistance and immunities, and therefore better outcomes[16]. This rationale can be traced through all of Gerson's subsequent efforts in cancer management. [8(pp164, 166, 184, 197)] The cancer diet is individualized to meet the needs of every patient, but it does have uniform components. For most patients, it is restricted in salt, fat, and (temporarily) protein. It supplies very high quantities of many nutrients and phytochemicals while at the same time forcing fluids through 13 hourly feedings of raw fruit and vegetable juices daily. About half of the melanoma subjects in this study received 24 ounces daily of raw veal liver and carrot juice (each glass contained the pressings of 1/2 pound of liver and 3/4 pound of carrots). Following numerous disruptions in supplies that began in late 1985, raw veal liver was formally discontinued in 1987 because of repeated instances of bacterial contamination (Campylobacter fetus s. fetus). Comparisons of patients from different time frames indicate that those receiving liver juice experienced better survival outcomes overall[15]. Gerson restricted calories while simultaneously increasing metabolism in an effort to emulate the antitumor effect of calorie restriction per se, first demonstrated by Moreschi[18] and Rous[19]. Enhanced caloric utilization rates (metabolism) can alter tumor growth, whether metabolism is accelerated by iodine medications[20] (Gerson used thyroid and Lugol's iodine solution) or exercise[21]. The caloric supply is limited to 2600-3200 calories per day by the low-fat, lactovegetarian diet served in three generous daily meals. Niacin, potassium salts (acetate, gluconate, and monophosphate), and crude liver extract with vitamin B12 injectable, were given to support accelerated cellular energy production. In the University of Munich experiments, Gerson found that temporary protein restriction aided edema absorption[22] and favored improvement in his patients. In Gerson's cancer diet, protein repletion with nonfat cultured dairy products occurs after at least 6 weeks in most cases. Shorter periods of protein restriction are recommended for children and elderly patients. Castor oil, a cathartic with no known clinical side effects, was administered every other day for many weeks. Retention enemas medicated with boiled coffee were taken as needed, as frequently as every 4 hours throughout the day and night, for their observed ability to alleviate pain and to improve nutritional condition. Peter Lechner observed statistically significant cancer pain relief from coffee enemas in a prospective matched control trial at the University Hospital of Graz, Austria[23]. Although the mechanism of pain relief is not known, Cope[7] suggested it may be the result of a crude sort of dialysis across the gut wall for tumor breakdown products such as polyamines, toxic bound nitrogen, and ammonia. Lechner and Kronberger[24] have also observed improved tolerance of aggressive conventional treatments in patients who employed Gerson's therapy at the same time. At CHIPSA, the therapy was prescribed for 18 to 36 months, subject to the physician's judgment and pati!ent response. This study, because of its retrospective nature, makes no attempt to adjust for variables such as mind-body treatments or adjuvant botanical or homeopathic materials (although it is our impression that such treatments were commonly used). We know of only two cases in which nonsurgical conventional treatments were employed concurrently with the Gerson treatment: 2 stage IVA patients, both 5-year survivors, added adjuvant biological response modifiers (One employed interferon for 6 months, and the other used levamisole). Several patients whose disease had escaped surgical management beforeadmission to the Gerson program required one or more surgeries during treatment. DATA COLLECTION To begin, we reviewed all records, files, and lists at our disposal from Hospitals La Gloria, La Mesa, Del Sol, CHIPSA, and the Gerson Institute in San Diego. In cases for which original patient phone and address records were no longer valid, we went to stored financial charts in which were found records of collect telephone calls placed by patients to friends and relatives. We used those additional numbers with considerable success to locate living patients and to learn the fate of the deceased. We were also able to extend our search by employing the epidemiological services of Equifax Credit Information Services. In 1993 the Gerson Research Organization began publishing a free newsletter for current and past patients, who were invited to join a support network. They were encouraged to share with all patients, even if they had not been treated by CHIPSA physicians. Through this route, several independently treated patients were discovered, contacts were established with !their physicians, and data were collected and used in this study. LEVELS OF DOCUMENTATION Because ours is a groundbreaking effort among various alternative forms of cancer management, we believe that explanation of our documentation process is warranted. Two standards of documentationwere applied: one for survivors and one for deceased patients. Forty-five survivor charts were meticulously cataloged to include independent histological verification, previous physicians' notes, surgical summaries, and radiological interpretations. In addition, our own physician notes, extended care consultation records, periodic laboratory reports, roentgenograms and scans as well as medication purchase records and other evidence of compliance, were included. Charts for 5 survivors could not be sufficiently cataloged to assess staging at admission, even though they did contain adequate evidence of the presence of melanoma. For purposes of this evaluation, we operated under two assumptions regarding deceased patients: (1) the majority probably achieved some measure of compliance with the Gerson treatment, and (2) the cause of death for the majority was probably melanoma. Mortality data are being assembled to address these assumptions if possible. In staging the deceased, we allowed less stringent documentation to suffice, with the understanding that the negative outcomes were probably due to melanoma. Fifty-seven charts of deceased patients contained independent confirmation of staging by their previous physicians, the standard of evidence required for all survivor charts in this study. In contrast, 44 were staged by relying on the admitting physician's oral history and physical examination. Beyond this, questionnaire responses and correspondence were considered to provide adequate information for 7 patients whose charts could not be located. Such lower-level documentation (admission oral history and physical examinations, and the questionnaire responses) was considered acceptable only for charts of deceased patients whose disease had apparently progressed. If we have erred in this judgment, it was on the side of caution. Because physicians administering the Gerson cancer therapy did not make exhaustive staging efforts on admission for any of their melanoma patients, the possibility certainly exists that deceased patients may have developed undetected distant and internal metastases before admission; in fact, this possibility cannot be ruled out for the survivors. With these criteria, 108 charts of the deceased were assessable for stage atadmission. Twenty-four charts were missing, presumably destroyed in the La Gloria Hospital fire of 1985 in which approximately 900 charts of all different pathologies were lost. Two cases for which outcomes had been documented (Both were noted deceased in a Gerson Institute file index) were identified by initials only, with no gender markers. Survival outcomes are known for 72 women and 81 men; 42 (58%) women and 69 (85%) men are deceased, a finding consistent with the female survival advantage widely reported in the melanoma literature. Two deceased men and 1 deceased woman (all stage III) lived 5 or more years and are reflected in this report as 5-year survivors. STATISTICAL METHODS Charts of 153 patients were assessable for both outcome and stage at admission. Five-year survival rates for each stage were compared with rates previously published by Balch[25], Drepper et al (the American Cancer Society)[26], Ryan et al (the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group)[27], and Fawzy[28]. For most comparisons, we used the chi-square test; when comparing small samples, we employed Fisher's Exact Test. For the above tests, we employed a computer program, SigmaStat, by Jandel Scientific Software. Programs were created (by SC) to generate Kaplan- Meier survival functions. Survival curves were plotted using Harvard Graphics. Cox regressions and log-rank tests for homogeneity of survival curves were used for comparison of data. Table 1 Staging system used for this report STAGING USED IN THIS REPORT Because so many different staging systems exist for nodular and superficial spreading malignant melanoma, we have provided a breakdown of the staging criteria we used in Table 1. We borrowed from current international standards of the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) system for melanoma as published by the American Joint Committee on Cancer[29] as well as the more precise staging divisions for micrometastases as published by the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC), or International Union Against Cancer[30]. Both of these methods incorporate Clark levels (tissue invasion) and the Breslow index (tumor thickness). The recent reclassification of melanoma staging emphasizes micrometastases and has, therefore, caused considerable stage migration. Many melanoma tumors that would previously have been categorized as stage IIB have moved to stage III. Stage III has been expanded and divided into stages IIIA and IIIB. The net effect of this reclassification, from our point of view, is an amplification of the survival benefit of lifestyle management as represented by the Gerson cancer treatment. In this paper, we have presented our findings with a proposed new division of stage IV into two parts. We believe that our findings support this proposal. RESULTS The primary purpose of our study was to assess survival outcomes as measured by 5-year survival rates by stage, which are summarized in Table 2. Of 249 potential melanoma patients identified from lists and files of the above mentioned organizations, survival outcomes were learned for 196 (79%), whereas 53 (21%) were lost to follow-up. Stage at admission was assessable in 167 cases (85%), whereas in 29 (15%) it was not. Table 2 5-year survival rates by most clinically important disease (TNM) Of 14 patients (8%) who were excluded, 3 did not have malignant melanoma (2 had melanoma in situ, and 1 had a history of melanoma). One case of pediatric melanoma was excluded because of its uniquenature. Ten cases of ocular melanoma (2 surviving, a deceased), which has different staging criteria and is not directly comparable to either nodular melanoma or the superficial spreading type, were also excluded. Superficial and nodular melanoma become comparable with the use of Clark levels and the Breslow index[24]. After exclusions, a total of 153 patients were included in this review; 45 (29%) lived at least 5 years (41 of whom were alive at this writing), and 108 (71%) were known to be deceased. Survival rates within the Gerson system are clearly stage-related (Table 3). A log-rank test for homogeneity of Kaplan-Meier survival curves for early (localized) versus late (regionally or distantly metastasized) disease (Figure 1) revealed that the difference was statistically significant (P=.007). However, as will be seen below, survival rates for men and women do not differ until distant (beyond the primary lymphatic drainage system- stage IV) metastases have presented. Table 3 Survival rates by stage (percent) STAGES I AND II Of the 153 patients assessable for stage at admission 14 (9%) entered the Gerson program with early (stage I or II) melanoma. At admission 4 patients were stage IA, 7 were IB, and 3 were stage II. None suffered progression of melanoma after admission; all remained free from melanoma for up to 17 years- 13 were alive at this writing; and I was deceased of other causes. All of the stage I and II patients reviewed were admitted to the Gerson program before May 1987 and were, therefore, included in the assessment of the 5-year survival rate. All of the 14 early stage melanoma patients remained disease-free for a mini- mum of 7 1/2 years and a maximum of 17 years. No deaths due to melanoma had occurred in this group as of this writing (although a 74-year-old, 15-year stage II survivor died of prostate cancer). When contrasted with a meta-analysis of 15,798 stage I and II melanoma patients from reporting centers worldwide in which Balch[25] found an overall average 5-year survival rate of 79%, the sample size in the Gerson treatment system was too small for statistical significance (chi-squared=2.56, P=.11). The sample would have to in the context of this study's unusually positive findings for stages III and IVA, these data hint that aggressive lifestyle intervention (e.g., Gerson's therapy) may hold a potential to reduce the world- wide 5!-year mortality rate for early-stage, localized melanoma. Of the early stage patients in Balch's meta-analysis, 21% (more than 3300) were deceased at 5 years. It is also of interest that stage I and II patients comprised approximately 88% (15,798 of 17,914) of the melanoma cases reported by centers worldwide, whereas physicians offering the Gerson cancer treatment saw only 9% (14 out of 153) at such an early and hopeful stage. STAGE III In all, 35 (23%) of the assessable cases were admitted at stage III. The 5-year survival rate for 35 assessable stage III melanoma patients treated with the Gerson diet therapy is 71%, with 10 deceased before the 5-year mark and 25 cancer-free for at least 5 years. The American Cancer Society has reported a 39% 5-year survival rate for stage III melanoma. Other reported 5-year survival rates[25] range from 27% in Brisbane to 42% at Duke University. Interestingly, no center included in Balch's meta-analysis[25], other than Duke University, reported a 5-year survival rate higher than 37%. Drepper et al[26], from the Fachklinik Hornheide, reported a 39% 5-year survival rate (n=103) for patients with stage IIIA (N1 only) melanoma. A comparable group from the Gerson system (n=17) achieved an 82% 5-year rate. The comparison (0.43 difference in means), which reveals a 110% greater survival advantage for patients in the Gerson system, is statistically significant (chi-squared=9.48 with 1 df, P=.002, power=.887). The Fachklinik Hornheide also documented a 41% 5-year survival rate for all (n=134) its stage IIIA (T4b and N1) and stage IIIB (N2 patients). Same-stage patients in the Gerson system (n=33) achieved a 5-year survival rate of 70%. The difference in means (.29) is statistically significant (chi-squared=7.62 with 1 df, P<.006, power=.802). STAGE IVA Of the assessable patients, 104 (68%) had a stage tumor at admission. All stage IV survivors in the Gerson program were admitted presenting only superficial metastatic disease (limited to skin, subcutaneous, and lymph involvement) with no internal metastases. We believe that these patients represent a responsive subgroup within stage IV, and suggest categorizing such patients separately as stage IVA. According to Balch, 23% of stage IV patients reported worldwide present first metastases confined to lymph, skin, and subcutaneous tissue (any T, any N, M1). He reports that this group has a median survival of 7.2 months and a 1-year survival rate of 25% worldwide. Of the stage IV patients admitted to the Gerson program, 18 (17%) were classified M1 (stage IVA); 7 (39%) of 18 were alive at this writing, with a survival range of 5 to 19 years. Therefore, the 5-year survival rate for 18 melanoma patients admitted to the Gerson program at stage IVA was 39%. Ryan et al[27] of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) published an outcomes analysis of 635 advanced-stage melanoma patients in which they offered a breakdown of survival by most significant sites. ECOG showed 11 of 194 patients fitting our stage IVA criteria to have lived 5 years, for a 5-year survival rate of 6%27. In contrast, the 5-year survival rate for 7 of 18 stage IVA melanoma patients in the Gerson system was 39% (550%) greater (0.33 difference in mean). This comparison is statistically significant (chi-squared=19.3 with 1 df, P<.0001, power=.997). STAGE IVB We have made no attempt to assess the survival impact of Gerson's cancer therapy in stage IVB. Because there were no exclusion criteria at any of the Gerson treating facilities, we were unable to find a single comparable treatment group moving through any other reporting treatment system. Of the 86 patients (56% of the assessable group) admitted to the Gerson program at stage IVB, most had gravely advanced disease. All are deceased, 6 of the deceased were not able to start the Gerson treatment, 6 died in the hospital, 1 presented with both melanoma and AIDS, and 14 are known to have had lactate dehydrogenase readings 300% or more above normal at admission. The highest recorded was 3776, or more than 2400% above normal. Major metastases were distributed as follows: 26% had brain involvement, 30% had liver tumors, 18% had tumors in abdominal viscera other than the liver, 40% had lung disease, 21% had melanoma in the bone, and 25% exhibited skin tumors. Only one patient, a female registered nurse originally admitted at stage III, had documented objective radiological evidence of progression to internal (bone) disease (M2, stage IVB) and subsequent complete remission of those lesions. She had been alive and well for 8 years at this writing. INFLUENCE OF GENDER ON SURVIVAL A female survival advantage has been reported widely in the melanoma literature. Although a female survival advantage is seen in the Gerson system (Table 4), male and female 5-year survival rates are not significantly different until stage IVA (distant metastases to skin, subcutaneous tissue, and lymph). Male and female survival rates are substantially the same for patients with stage I and II (completely local disease) as well as those with stages IIIA and IIIB (regionally metastasized disease). Table 4 Survival rates by gender (percent) Twelve women and 2 men were admitted with early (stage I and II) melanoma. This shows an unexplained female recruitment bias (6:1) in early-stage patients, which did not occur with any other stage. Of 35 patients assessed for stage IIIA and IIIB (all primary T4a, primary T4b, N1, and N2) 5-year survival rates, 18 (51%) were male and 17 (49%) were female, a distribution similar to that reported by the Fachklinik Hornheide[26], which had 49% male and 51% female patients. Of those who were cancer-free at 5 years or beyond, 12 were male and 13 were female. Of the deceased, 6 were male and 4 were female. Comparison of the 67% 5-year survival rate for all stage III men in the Gerson system with the 76% rate for women (0.09 difference in mean) is not statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test, P=.71). Two of the 12 male 5-year survivors had recurrence of tumors after the 5th year and are deceased. One female 15-year survivor had recurrence of tumors and is deceased. Even at 10 years, although the survival rate for females (63%, n=8) is considerably higher than that for males (50%, n=12), the difference in means (0.13) is not statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test, P=.49). Of 18 patients admitted for treatment of stage IVA melanoma, 9 were women and 9 were men. This recruitment pattern, half and half, is consistent with the melanoma literature. Of 7 who survived 5 years, 6 (86%) were female, whereas only 1 (14%) was male. Although the samples are tiny, the female 5-year survival rate of 67% is statistically significant compared with the male rate of 11% (Fisher's Exact Test, P=.05). When IVA survival and mortality data are included with data for stages I through IIIB, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for stage I-IVA male versus female patients (Figure 2) are significantly different (P=.004) when log-rank tested for homogeneity over 5 years. LIMITATIONS It has been repeatedly suggested that patients who use alternative cancer treatments may be different from patients who employ only conventional treatments. Several differences have been reported by Cassileth et al[31], who found that alternative treatment users tended to be white and better educated than those who used only conventional treatments. It remains to be seen whether these or any other influences yet to be discovered can account for the survival advantage observed in the Gerson system. However, at present, we can cite no convincing evidence that patients treated in the Gerson system differed from the comparison groups according to any meaningful prognostic variables. This report has not accounted for variables such as the role and influence of individual components and various sets of components within the Gerson system. Subsequent to the completion of this report, we have shown two major variables, complementary use of surgery and the use of raw veal liver/carrot juice, to besignificantly associated with improved melanoma survival outcomes[17]. Studies of the rationales for modifications made by Gerson over the 30-year course of development of his treatment have led to contemporary modifications[17], creating still more challenges for thorough analysis. This study is a retrospective analysis and therefore lacks the luster of a randomized clinical trial. However, the authors have made every attempt to verify adherence to therapy (especially by the survivors), to contrast these data with existing data banks, and to clearly present the comparisons here. DISCUSSION No clearly defined mechanism has been identified to account for the survival advantage demonstrated above. Gerson believed that oxidizing enzymes supplied by the raw juices of his diet therapy improved host functions sufficiently to disadvantage malignant cells, which he believed produced their energy through fermentative metabolism. This belief was based on the long popular, but now disproven, cancer generalization of Otto Warburg discussed by Ling[32]. The clinical findings of the present study neither validate Gerson's Warburg-based rationale nor disprove Gerson's idea of host enhancement to challenge malignancy. Gerson also believed, after Tannenbaum[33], that calorie restriction, increased calorie utilization rate, and micronutrient hyperalimentation could favor the tumor-bearing host and suppress development of both primary tumors and metastases. In principle, this belief may have withstood the test of time and advances in research[31]. A huge general category of micronutrients, phytochemicals, has become the focus of a great deal of basic cancer and chemo-prevention research. Clearly, Gerson's treatment provides high, and in some cases extraordinary, doses of thousands of phytochemicals. However, the literature does not yield practical knowledge of the effects of either individual or combined phytochemicals on human cancers. Cope[39] wrote that Gerson's salt-and-water management for cancer was an approach that probably led to correction of tissue damage syndrome, or cellular edema caused by poisoning, starvation, hypoxia, or physical trauma. He believed that Gerson's sometimes extraordinary outcomes might have been due, at least in part, to this mechanism. Although it has been suggested[40] that any benefits conferred by Gerson's cancer therapy may result in greatest part from its psychosocial impact, this question has never been investigated. It is reasonable that observers assume a mind/body effect, due to the treatment's obvious self-help components and the CHIPSA medical team's active encouragement of family involvement, even during the patient's hospitalization. Provisions have been made at CHIPSA for inexpensive room and board for companions. Spouses and close relatives are often able to stay with the patient in a private room. This accommodation results in a very high level of family and support-community involvement. Fawzy et al[28] recently provided findings demonstrating the positive impact of psychiatric intervention on the 6-year disease-free survival rate of stage I melanoma patients in his treatment system. In his study 13 of 34 stage I control subjects had melanoma recurrences (10 had died at the time of his report), whereas only 7 of 34 test patients had recurrences (3 had died). Therefore, the 6-year disease-free survival rate for Fawzy's control subjects was 62%, whereas for his test patients it was 79%, a rate similar to the one cited by Balch[25]. Comparison with the 100% 6-year disease-free survival of 14 early stage (localized) melanoma patients in the Gerson treatment system shows a 27% greater survival benefit (0.21 difference in mean). However, due to the small sample size for Gerson patients, a log-rank test for continuity of survival curves (Figure 3) over the entire study time is below statistical significance, with only 93% confidence (P=.07). Still, especially w!hen seen in the light of stage IIIA, IIIB and IVA melanoma patients in the Gerson system, the complete absence of recurrence in the Gerson patients supports the possibility of a potent physiological effect from Gerson's therapy, in addition to its probable beneficial psychosocial effect. During peer review of this paper, a question arose regarding the potential difference between patients we were able to locate and assess versus those who remained lost to follow-up. How might lost-to-follow-up patients have affected the rates? To address this issue, we compared the current findings with those tabulated[34] in September 1993, at the beginning of our retrospective study. After updating its staging system to match the current report, we found that the 1993 analysis included 44 patients in stages I-IVA assessable for 5-year survival. The 5-year rates were as follows: Stages I and II = 100% (n=12); Stages IIIA and IIIB = 68% (n=25); Stage IVA = 57% (n=7). The average 5-year survival rate for the entire group was 75%. Fourteen patients who had been lost to follow-up in 1993 were located and assessed during the last 2 years. Adding those 14 cases, bringing the number of assessable patients to 58, the rates remained substantially the same (with the exception of IVA, in which the initial sample size was quite small). The 5-year survival rates including those 14 cases are: Stages I and II = 100% (n=14); Stages IIIA and IIIB = 67% (n=30); Stage IVA = 36% (n=14). The average 5-year survival rate of the enlarged group was 67%. An additional 9 patients who were admitted after August 1988 but before August 1990 became assessable for 5-year survival. With inclusion of those cases, bringing the number of patients to 67, therates remained similar: Stages I and II = 100% (n=14); Stages IIIA and IIIB = 71% (n=35); Stage IVA = 39% (n=18). With recently recruited patients, the group's average 5-year survival rate was 69%. There were no statistically significant differences among the average rates (chi-squared=0.786, power=.109). We believe that the continuity of findings at various stages of the investigation suggests that the current rates are probably reliable, and that discovery or recruitment of additional patients, barring the recruitment of substantially greater numbers of stage I and II patients, will probably not alter the average survival rate significantly. We were unable to assess a potential survival benefit for stage IVB melanoma patients in this treatment system. While the Gerson treatment provides many clinical benefits to stage IVB melanoma patients with internal metastases who are able to practice it, these benefits must be measured with validated "quality-of-life" instruments. Such measurements can be accomplished only through prospective data collection, which is ongoing and will be the subject of future reports. Data on exact date and cause of death are beingpursued by application to the National Center for Health Statistics for use of the National Death Index. We will report findings as they become available. Clearly, the search for meaningful biological response modifiers, vaccines, and other means of host stimulation may be paramount for the management of advanced melanoma tumors that are internallymetastasized. In fact, any means of relatively safe tumor debulking must be given serious consideration. This retrospective study is our first (but not our last) effort at assessment of the outcomes of cancer patients moving through the Gerson treatment system.The longest-surviving melanoma patient in this study has been disease-free for 20 years. Four patients who were alive and disease-free at 5 years (reported alive in this assessment) have died. Three stage III patients died of recurrent melanoma after the fifth year (one of them after 16 years). One stage IB patient died after 15 years, of prostate cancer, at age 74. And 41 patients are alive and free from disease. Although retrospective reviews cannot account for many influences, they clearly can be used to describe aggregate outcomes that can stand on their own for purposes of comparison with other groups and treatment systems, and to further the discussion regarding appropriate methods of cancer management. We encourage those involved with other alternative and complementary methods of cancer management to pursue this route. References Gerson M.

We find another of Dr.Gerson's patients by Charlotte Gerson At the end of September, 1996, I had the great pleasureof visiting the New York Chiropractic College. I was invitedto address the faculty and students, discussing the GersonTherapy. The following day, I did the usual lecture andworkshop for the public.I received a warm reception, andthank the students and faculty for their help. I was deeplyimpressed by the magnificent campus, set among rolling greenhills, studded with beautiful, majestic trees. The light,airy buildings are situated along one of New York's extensivefinger lakes. There is a feeling of peace and beauty, veryconducive to study and meditation. I received great joy from the testimonial of one of themembers of the audience. This gentleman introduced himself asthe nephew of one of the 50 cases (Case #18) Dr. Gersondescribed in A Cancer Therapy. William Schickel. at age 32 was astruggling artist with a young family, three small children,the youngest a baby, and a 22 year old wife. He had beendiagnosed with inoperable, widespread retroperitoneallymphoma. Radiation was not an option, and he was literallysent home with perhaps two months to live. Bill's wife, Mary,found an article in a magazine on organic gardening in whichshe read that Dr. Gerson was curing cancer by diet. Followinga pilgrimage to the shrine of the Blessed PhilippineDuschene, their decision was made: they would go to see Dr.Gerson in New York City. They arrived in the spring of 1950 from their home inLoveland, Ohio. After numerous tests, Dr. Gerson felt thatBill had perhaps a 30% chance of recovery on the nutritionaltherapy. Bill was surprised that, in spite of the quietelegance of a Park Avenue office, Dr. Gerson's fees were"very modest". Gerson also told Bill that he wouldnot cure him but that his reactivated defenses, his bodywould work to heal him. Struggling physically and financially to follow thisdemanding treatment, but with nothing to lose, Bill reportsthat he felt better within a few weeks. He received no othertreatment.Bill writes that in 1983 he looked back on "33years, eight children, twelve grandchildren, and a wonderfulproductive life". In September, 1996 (46 years after hisprognosis of 'two months'), Bill and his wife Mary beam fromthe cover of St. Anthony's Messenger, inside of whichis the inspiring story of Bills activities. He is a famousartist, designs and builds churches, church art and stainedglass windows, assisted by his sons and daughter Martha inhis art studio. Bill won national honors for his interiordesign and artwork for the new St. Mary's Church in St.Clairsville, Ohio. Some years ago, he also had an art show inSan Diego which I was proud to visit. Now 77, Bill works fulltime with his family in his studio. When I spoke to him toask permission to publish this story, I could hear the energyand enthusiasm in his strong voice. His story is copyrightedand he expects to publish it sometime in the future. We are grateful to Dr. Gerson for having given thiscreative, prolific and talented artist the chance to live along, healthy and productive life, and make his quitesignificant contribution to the world.

Are Soy Products Dangerous? by Charlotte Gerson, with portions reprinted bypermission of Newlife Magazine A considerable percentage of the world's population isundernourished or outright starving. For many years,proteins, preferably from animal sources, have beenconsidered to be the best and most acceptable source ofnutrients. However, we also know that it takes some 16 poundsof grains, fed to cows, to produce one pound of meat. In hisbook Diet for a New America, author John Robbinspoints out that we could easily feed the whole world ifeveryone were to become vegetarian. This is an unlikelyscenario in the affluent Western world. So, in order to tryto feed the hungry, we are always looking for new sources of"good" protein. Much attention has been focused on the soy bean, a widelygrown legume that fulfills both the requirement for a highprotein food and a widely publicized health advantage: it islow in fat and devoid of cholesterol! This should make it anideal food, but is it safe? An extensive discussion on the subject written by SallyW. Fallon, M.A., and Mary G. Enig, Ph.D. appeared in the May1966 edition of Newlife magazine. Since we have oftenbeen asked by a number of our Gerson HealingNewsletter readers why Dr. Gerson prohibited soyproducts, we should like to report on this thoroughlyresearched material. The authors trace the origin of the soy bean to theOrient, where it was apparently used during the Chou Dynasty(1134-246 BCE) as a crop rotation material, for its capacityof fixing nitrogen in the soil. Soy products did not serve asfood until fermentation techniques were developed. When amethod was developed to make soy into a curd by precipitatingit with calcium sulfate or magnesium sulfate, the use of soyproducts started to spread. Fermented soy products, such asmiso and tamari sauce, are apparently less harmful than theprecipitated ones, such as tofu or bean curd. But tofuaccounts for about 90% of the processed soybeans in Asiatoday, say the authors. It seems that bean curds as a sourceof protein did not come into use until about 700 A.D. Fallon and Enig state that the "Chinese did not eatthe soybean as they did other legumes, such as lentils,because the soybean contains large quantities of a number ofharmful substances." Did the Chinese know this? Perhapsthey did, possibly they observed that disease symptomsappeared after eating tofu or other cooked soy products.Among the harmful substances, the authors name "potentenzyme inhibitors, which block the action of trypsin andother enzymes needed for protein digestion." Apparently,cooking does not deactivate these enzyme inhibitors, and theycan produce serious digestive problems such as reducedprotein digestion, chronic deficiencies in amino acid uptake,enlargement of the pancreas (in animals) and cancer. Soy products also contain another chemical, hemaglutininwhich promotes clumping of red blood cells. These clumped redcells are unable to fully take up oxygen and carry it in theblood stream to all tissues. Hemaglutinin has also beenobserved to act as a growth depressant. Fermentationdeactivates these enzyme inhibitors, or at least reduces theamounts present. Soybeans are also high in phytic acids which is presentin the bran of hulls of all seeds. This material blocks theuptake of essential minerals in the intestinal tract,including such important ones as calcium, magnesium, iron andespecially zinc. Again, only the process of fermentation willsignificantly reduce the phytate content of soy products.Soybeans have a higher content of phytates than any otherlegumes, making them of questionable safety and nutritionalvalue. Bearing the above in mind, the authors feel that soyproducts consumed with meat have a reduced mineral blockingeffect; however they warn particularly that vegetarians whoeat tofu with the idea that it may act as a proteinsubstitute, risk severe mineral deficiencies. They also feelthat most people appreciate the problems of calcium,magnesium and iron deficiencies, but that zinc deficiencyproduces some especially serious problems: zinc is needed foroptimal development and function of the brain and nervoussystem, aside from its role in the immune system. The profit motive. The average American has not adopted soy products (tofu,tempeh, miso) as a principal food. Soy sauce may be theexception to this rule, even though soy oil is also quitewidely used. About 140 billion pounds of soy beans per yearare grown in the US since the end of W.W.II, and the industryis looking for new markets. At this time, the major use forthe bean is animal feed, and soy oil is used for hydrogenatedfats, margarine and shortening. New soy products are beingmarketed to the growing "health product" consumers:soy milk, soy baby formula, soy yogurt, soy ice cream, soycheese, soy flour for baking, and soy protein as a meatsubstitute for the vegetarians. During the production of soy milk, in order to remove asmuch of the trypsin inhibitor as possible, the puréedbeans are soaked in an alkaline solution, then heated toabout 115º C. in a pressure cooker. Unfortunately, eventhough most (but not all) of the antinutrients are destroyed,this processing also denatures the proteins, so the remainingsoy protein is very difficult to digest. The phytate contentremains in soy milk to block the uptake of essentialminerals. Worse, the alkaline soaking solution produces acarcinogen, lysinealine, and reduces the cystine (an aminoacid) content in the soybean. Without cystine, the proteincomplex is virtually useless unless the diet is fortifiedwith meat, eggs or dairy products, an unlikely situation forvegetarians. These problems arising from soy production are notmentioned on labels, and the public is not aware ofthem."Soy based infant formulas, along with trypsininhibitors, contain a high phytate level. Use of soy formulahas caused zinc deficiency in infants. Aluminum content ofsoy formula is ten times greater than milk-based formula and100 times greater than unprocessed milk." While soy milkis tried on infants with milk allergies, allergy to soyproducts is almost as common. The lack of cholesterol in soyinfant formula could inhibit brain development sincecholesterol is essential for the brain and nervous system.Chemical additives to soy based foods further add to theproblems. Soy products are widely distributed in third worldcountries, presumably to overcome a protein deficiency in thediets of starving people. They are also used extensively inschool lunch programs, commercial baked goods, diet beveragesand fast food products. New publicity promotes soy productsfor their "cancer preventing properties". Whiletraditionally fermented soy products may contain a cancerpreventing chemical, these are contained in an altered statein non-fermented soy products and have no anti-carcinogeniceffect. On the contrary, it has been suggested that the rapidincrease of liver and pancreatic cancer in Africa is due tothe increased use of soy products."...to remove oil fromthe soy bean, particularly high pressures and temperaturesare required, since this is an unusually difficult process.Furthermore, hexane or other solvents are always used toextract oil from soy beans, and traces remain in thecommercial product. But the high temperatures destroy some ofthe possible beneficial fatty acid fractions of the soy oil:the Omega-3's, which are especially susceptible to ranciditywhen subjected to high pressures and temperatures." "Claims that the fermented soy products can berelied on as a source of B12 have not been supported byscientific research." Nor do they supply the essentialfat soluble vitamins D and A, needed for the absorption ofall minerals. Unfortunately, soy products increase therequirements for vitamin B12 and D. The authors summarize all the above, and possiblearguments that soy products have been used for many centuriesin the Orient, as follows: "traditional fermented soyproducts have a long history of use that is generallybeneficial when combined with other elements of the Orientaldiet including rice, sea foods, fish broth and fermentedvegetables. Precipitated (Western) soy products can causeserious problems, especially when they form the major sourceof protein in the diet."

Revenge of the CannibalCows The Approaching Era of BSE ... Revenge of the CannibalCows by Howard Straus, Editor There have been many cries of apocalyptic doom overthe last decade, from the hole in the ozone to the globalspread of AIDS, the rising cancer rate or global warming.Many of these have generated controversies, each side of thecontroversy having either a palpable agenda, or a vestedeconomic interest in the status quo. Meanwhile, governments,in league with agribusiness have been fashioning a real,present and current disease through cynicism, incompetence,lies and shortsighted economic expedience. The result couldsoon spell an epidemic that would dwarf cancer, heart diseaseand AIDS. In 1981, the British government relaxed agriculturalregulations regarding what could be fed to livestock,allowing processed slaughterhouse waste to be fed tolivestock as high protein supplements. That meant thatvarious parts of sheep, chicken and cows, including brains,eyes and bones, could be processed, flavored and mixed withother feeds to cheaply increase the productivity of cattlefarms. Brains of sheep with a disease called scrapie wereincluded in the list of permitted contents of cattle feed, aswere, incredibly, chicken droppings. The fact that thispractice would turn normally vegetarian animals intocarnivores, even cannibals, was simply ignored, despitewarnings from various concerned scientists, and a RoyalCommission, who were roundly ignored and effectivelypooh-poohed. The practice was widely adopted in the British cattleindustry, and subsequently led to cheaper beef, a highlydesirable result for the growers, and one that enabled theBritish to compete well with the Continental beef producersin France and Holland. Suddenly, in 1986, the honeymoon ended. The first case ofa new cattle disease had been diagnosed. It was a bovine formof the sheep disease scrapie, and was called bovinespongiform encephalopathy, or BSE for short. Its better-knownname, by now, is Mad Cow Disease, because the cows thatcontract the disease become aggressive, disoriented, andgenerally appear to have gone "mad". The diseasedestroys and kills by literally turning the animals' brainsinto sponges by boring holes in brain and nerve tissue.Though the new disease was reported to the appropriateauthorities in the British government, they did nothing toalert the general population to the situation for at leasteleven months, when they finally published the finding in anobscure veterinary journal, unlikely to be seen or noticed bythe general public. Certainly, nothing was done to change thepractice of feeding slaughterhouse offal to cows, sheep,chickens or pigs. When the press got a hold of the story, and began raisingquestions about the safety of British beef, the organs ofgovernment churned into high gear. Every possible seniorofficial who had anything to do with public opinion, from thePrime Minister to the Minister of Food and Farming, assuringthe world that British beef was sound, safe, and that thisdisease, which had already made the jump from sheep tocattle, could not possibly make the jump from cattle tohumans. This despite the fact that virtually nothing wasknown for certain about BSE. Any researcher or governmentofficial who did not hue to the party line was rapidly andeffectively silenced and/or "made redundant", i.e.: fired. In 1989, two cases of an atypical strain ofCreutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD) were diagnosed, a strainwhich was alarmingly similar in effect and area of the brainattacked to BSE. Rare instances of this disease had beenrecorded as far back as 1965. Britain's trading partnersbegan making noises about quarantining British beef, as theEuropean Economic Community (EEC) had already done toAmerican beef (antibiotic residues are so high that Americanbeef is considered "tainted" by the EEC). Stillknowing nothing about the cause of the disease, and having no"scientific" proof one way or another, the Britishgovernment continued its public relations campaign toconvince the world that British beef was sound. How couldthey guarantee the health of every cow in the British Isles?Advertising and governmental gobbledegook would have to dothe trick. The idea that someone might actually have to beheld accountable for an incipient and deadly epidemic wassimply unthinkable. Still, nothing was done to halt thepractice of feeding cows to cows. The epidemic started to grow. At first, only older peoplewere affected. Many cases of CJD were probably misdiagnosed,since the symptoms in humans are very similar to those ofAlzheimer's' Disease. In fact, at least one victim's wife,convinced that her husband had died of CJD rather than thediagnosed Alzheimer's, repeatedly demanded an autopsy beforeher husband's body was cremated. She was unable to preventthe cremation, and the autopsy was never done. Anothervictim's mother, going public to save other mothers the agonyof watching their own teenagers sicken and die, was told tothink of the economic havoc she was causing. It appeared thatCJD had an incubation period of between ten and twenty years,and nobody could prove that it was transmitted via cows andthe consumption of animal flesh. Experiments done by theBritish government themselves showed that, contrary to theauthorities' statements, monkeys, and by extension, probablyhumans were capable of contracting the disease from cattle.Yet, the spin doctors managed to turn even these experimentsinto encouraging news! Not until 1988 were any limits putonto the amounts, types and health of the offal going intocattle feed, and then they were inadequate and sloppilyenforced by a government far more responsive (as usual) tothe short-term economic interests of the farmers and commercethan to the health and survival of its individual citizens.It was a further two years before controls were put onfeeding infected offal to poultry, whose droppings, remember,were still being fed to the cattle. Only on March 20, 1996,after teenagers, some as young as 15 and 16 years old, beganto die of a much faster moving strain of the disease, onewith an incubation time of five to ten years, did thegovernment finally admit that BSE was the "mostlikely" cause of the recent outbreak of CJD, publiclyeating their own words. On March 26, 1996, the rest of Continental Europe, led byGermany, put a quarantine on all British beef and beefproducts. Russia even embargoed British milk and leather. TheBritish government has very belatedly instituted a program ofcattle destruction, hoping to limit the damage and restoreconfidence in farming practices and the health of the Britishcattle herd, numbering in the millions of animals. Thepractice of feeding infected offal to the remaining animalshas been discontinued. But the death toll from the new strainof CJD continues to rise, and the victims are otherwisehealthy teenagers and young adults. The problems, of course, are very complex. In Iceland,when the related sheep disease scrapie was found to beinfecting a large proportion of the sheep, every sheep inIceland was slaughtered and disposed of, and the entire herdwas replaced by importing healthy animals from abroad. Withina few years, however, the new herd was infected again. Theonly possible means of transmission of the disease from thesheep that no longer existed to the new, healthy sheep, wasthat the ground was infected, and the new sheep could beinfected from the urine and droppings of the old sheep. Thelatest understanding of this disease is that it is nottransmitted by a virus or microbe, but by a tiny proteinfraction (called a prion) that is virtually indestructible bysterilization, acids, heat or burial in soil. This haschilling implications for the British, who, until recently,have been burying large numbers of slaughtered, infected cowsand sheep in farms and landfills, many near rivers andmunicipal water sources. There is no way to remove thesesources of infection from the ground, as the products ofdecay have, by now, spread far and wide, both from urine andcattle droppings, and from the buried animals. The diseasecauses no immune response, and there is no known treatmentfor it, much less cure. Often, when a farmer begins to see the first symptoms ofa BSE-infected animal, economics dictate that he is betteroff to kill and bury the animal on his farm than to admitthat his farm is no longer BSE-free, or even better, send theanimal to the slaughterhouse before the animal becomesclinically ill and has to be destroyed. Although thegovernment will pay him to destroy and incinerate thecarcass, animals from "BSE-free" farms fetch higherprices than those from farms admitting the problem.Unfortunately, this gives farmers large economic incentive tomisrepresent the status of their farms. Some farmers havealready been fined for falsely representing their farms asBSE-free, others have, most likely, escaped detection. By May, 1990, a quarter of the population of GreatBritain refused to eat beef. In six months, beef pricesdropped 10-25%, devastating the cattle industry. Cats and zooanimals are now dying regularly from their own variants ofspongiform encephalopathy; over 160,000 British cattle havealready succumbed to it. To date, there is still nowell-defined, strictly implemented program for keepinginfected offal from infecting healthy meat in GreatBritain. That's England, though, isn't it? "What does this have to do with the UnitedStates?" you may be asking. "We have been assuredthat there is no BSE problem here. We don't import Britishbeef, do we?" Well, no, we don't, and haven't since1989. But what we do continue here is the practice, nowbanned in Great Britain, of feeding processed slaughterhousewaste to cows, chickens and pigs as low cost, high-proteinfeed supplementation. This is the very practice that got theBritish cattle industry in such bad trouble so very quickly adecade and a half ago: feeding cows to cows. In 1991, theUSDA considered a mandatory ban on the practice. Butaccording to an internal USDA document, the agency dismissedthe ban because, "the cost to the livestock andrendering industries would be substantial." (Sound likeBritain's initial response?) We certainly have the problem of scrapie in America, andit is known to have jumped the species barrier from sheep tothe cattle herd. Scrapie manifests itself in cattle as theanimal falling down, and being unable to rise again. There isthe possibility, even the likelihood of an outbreak of BSEand its associated human form, CJD occurring in the UnitedStates. It may already have arrived here, and been missed inthe background noise of the enormous human tragedy of ourepidemic of Alzheimer's disease. It is quite possible thatmany cases of CJD have been misdiagnosed here as Alzheimer's,disguising the onset of the epidemic by not recognizing itfor what it is, and giving us a false sense of security. Infact, there is good evidence that BSE has been in the UnitedStates since the mid-'70s. What is even worse is that it is not just beef that isaffected. By now, slaughterhouse workers, farmers and foodpreparation workers have died of CJD, possibly from theconstant contact with animal blood and offal. The ground onwhich the cattle have been urinating and defecating iscertainly infected, and we know that the vector survives inthe ground for long periods of time. We know little about theeffects of the disease or its vectors on other animals fedinfected offal, such as chickens and pigs. And we must assumethat milk and other animal products, like gelatin and dairyproducts, and anything that contains them, are possiblyinfectious. Think about that, for a moment. Substitute themore familiar but less likely disease "AIDS", andimagine being at risk for infection from a milk chocolate baror a cold remedy in a gelatin capsule, the egg, butter ormilk in a piece of birthday cake, a cup of nonfat yogurt orcottage cheese, and you will begin to understand how deeplythe malpractice of the food-animal industry has endangeredyour life and the lives of your family. "The critical uncertainty," to quote an articlefrom the Internet by Michael Greger, "is, how small adose is necessary to pass the disease along? Theoretically,it doesn't matter if BSE can infect humans if we never eatenough meat within a lifetime. Last year, calculations weremade to determine how many people will have consumed apotentially infectious dose by 1997. The conservativeestimate runs upwards of 34 million people. In other words,virtually a whole generation of people may die. And we arenot talking about a quick and simple death, either. If weassume the disease runs a course similar to CJD, these peoplewill wake up one morning twitching and deteriorate weeklyinto blindness and epilepsy, while their brain perforatesinto a sponge. If they're lucky, they will be dead withinthree months; if not, it may take up to five years." This disease has the potential to be far more widespreadand deadly than AIDS or cancer, than heart disease or stroke.And we don't know we have it until it is far, far too late todo anything about, not to mention the fact that there is, atthe moment, nothing we can do about it. Americans' trust inour own government has already fallen to such a low levelthat we rarely believe its self-serving, exculpatorystatements. We must now, however, find a way to let thegovernment know, in no uncertain terms, that we are outragedat the suicidal behavior of the factory farming industry andof the U. S. Department of Agriculture, which is charged withthe often contradictory tasks of regulating and promotingAmerican agriculture. Though we, as Gerson Persons, are basically vegetarians,the practice of making vegetarian animals into cannibals putsus all at risk from the most apparently innocuous substances,and from contaminated water that cannot be purified short ofexpensive steam distillation. We must force our governmentalorgans to be responsive to our health and safety, and soon,if we are not to fall victims en masse to the same fate as somany Britons have already. We must fight for our survivalagainst our own food suppliers, and against our owngovernment, against the very institutions we want to believeare protecting us. We know the results of trusting the FDAand the NCI to help us. This one, however, is a battle we cannot afford to lose.

Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment, Krupp and Chatton,1993 says that lung cancer patients, in general, have an 8% chance ofsurviving 5 years. However, the small cell anaplastic (oat cell)types have the worst prognosis. "It metastasizes early and widely,and is not amenable to surgery." In his monograph Chemotherapy ofAdvanced Epithelial Cancer, physician and biostatistician Dr. UlrichAbel wrote that "small cell lung cancer is the only carcinoma forwhich good direct evidence of a survival improvement by chemotherapyexists." But this improvement amounts to a matter of three months! In late February of 1993, William Hetzler, then 55 years old, arrivedat the hospital. He had been diagnosed and biopsied at theLong Beach Hospital on Long Island, (New York). He subsequentlyconsulted a pulmonary specialist at the North Shore Hospital, also onLong Island, for a second opinion . He was advised to transferimmediately to the oncology department for chemotherapy. He was toldthat without chemotherapy, he might have 3-4 months survival. A cousin of his in Oregon where he runs an organic farm told him tocall the Gerson Institute for information on nutritional healing.Given some hope, he came to Mexico. He now admits that he was deeplydepressed and had periods of crying while at the hospital.However, by the time he left, he had become hopeful. In August of 1993, while we were at a Convention in New York, Williamattended, mostly in order to testify about his experience. At thattime, only about 6 months after he arrived at the hospital in "terminal"condition, he reported that his latest chest X-ray showed his lungsto be clear of cancer. He carried on with the strict Gerson Therapyfor two years. It is now over two years and he is well, planning abusiness trip to Europe. He says that he now "sleeps to heal," andremains on the modified Gerson Therapy. He told me that he tookshark cartilage all through his therapy. He doesn't want to go backto his original oncologist. "All the sick people there depress me,"he said.

He especially needed to record the details of hiswork with advanced and terminal cancer patients. For thesepatients he had to fine-tune his therapy to the ultimatedegree, to obtain the best foods and juice extraction, themost carefully adjusted medications, and the most thoroughdetoxification. He did this with very specific directions:how to do the enemas, how best to extract the juices, and soforth. Over the years, various authors have proposed theirown ideas in the above areas, often differing from Dr.Gerson's. This has naturally raised questions for patientsusing the Therapy, as well as others interested in the theoryand practice of the Gerson Therapy. I would like to explainsome of the reasons underlying Dr. Gerson's detailedinstructions in these areas. Juicers The juicing is so tedious, with all the grinding andpressing. Isn't there an easier and faster way, or a cheaperjuicer that I could use? Dr. Gerson said in his address to a group assembled inEscondido, California in 1956 (Appendix II, p. 406, A Cancer Therapy): "At first I thought thatliquefiers would be the most wonderful thing. All thematerial was there, nothing was lost. But it didn'twork." The rotating blade gives rise to a "dynamoeffect", causing electricity to be generated, andkilling enzymes. The same is true for centrifugal juicers.Juices must be made by grinding the vegetables first, mixingthem, and then pressing them in a press. We have recentlycome across cancer patients who tried to heal themselves onthe Gerson Therapy using a centrifugal juicer. Theyexperienced no improvement. When they tried the Therapy withChampion juicers, they did well. The more seriously illpatients still need the grinding plus pressing type of juicerarrangement to properly heal. In response to a question from a patient about the twostep juicing process, Dr. Gerson wrote that "the malicacid (contained in the apples) mixed with the ground carrotshelps to release the minerals from the carrots." Inother words, it is necessary to first grind the apples andcarrots together into a bowl, using a grinder. The Norwalk,K&K or Champion juicers can be used as grinders, but theChampion cannot be used as a press. The ground materials aremixed in the bowl, the mixture is placed in a press cloth andput under pressure in the Norwalk or K&K press. Thisprocess produces the best extraction, richest in minerals,and the tastiest juice. Juice produced by the Champion juiceralone separates into a transparent liquid at the bottom andmush on top after a very short time. This juice is harder forthe patient to drink because of the particles, and is not asrich and homogeneous in nutrients. Recently the Green Power juicer was introduced. It does abetter job of extraction than the Champion alone used as ajuicer. But it offers no way (as the Champion does) to blockthe juicing action. It is impossible to use the Green Powerjuicer as a grinder only, it grinds and juices in oneoperation. While it extracts juice quite efficiently, it doesnot fulfill Dr. Gerson's requirement of mixing the groundapples and carrots thoroughly before pressing. Enemas I thought that high colonics cleaned out the entirecolon. Why shouldn't one do high colonics? Aren't we tryingto clear out the colon? Anyone who is at all familiar with the Gerson Therapy iswell aware of the utmost importance of the coffee enemas.(Gerson Healing Newsletter #13, May, 1986). But questionsarise from Dr. Gerson's instructions, specifically hiswarning: NO HIGH COLONICS. High colonics don't accomplishwhat coffee enemas do, namely, open the liver/bile ducts toallow the liver to release toxins. They also interfere withbasic colonic functions: reabsorption of nutrients, vitaminsand fluids, especially when used regularly. Let us first examine the basics. Dr. Gerson found thatthe underlying problems of all cancer patients are toxicityand deficiency. He had to overcome both these difficulties.He found that one of the important features of his therapyhad to be the hourly administration of fresh vegetablejuices. These supply ample nutrients, as well as fluids tohelp flush out the kidneys. When the high levels of nutrientsre-enter tissues, toxins accumulated over many years areforced into the blood stream. The toxins are then filteredout by the liver. The liver is easily overburdened by thecontinuous release of toxins and is unable to release theload. This can cause liver damage, even liver coma -- unlessthe liver is helped to release the overload. Dr. Gerson foundthat he could provide help to the liver by the caffeine incoffee, absorbed from the colon via the hemorrhoidal vein,which carries the caffeine to the portal system and then tothe liver. The caffeine stimulates the liver/bile ducts toopen, releasing the poisons into the intestinal tract forexcretion. High colonics are usually not done with coffee, andtherefore do not benefit the liver. Even if coffee were to beused, a high colonic forces it high into the transverse andascending colon, where it is not absorbed into the portalsystem. With the constant administration of vegetable juices ofthe Gerson Therapy, a flood of toxins is steadily releasedfrom the poisoned cells in the body. Four to five coffeeenemas daily are needed to help continuously unburden theliver, and deal with the toxins. It would be impossible, evendangerous, to do five high colonics daily. Colonics have another undesirable effect. The colon is avery important recycling organ which reabsorbs fluids,enzymes and minerals. It also produces some vitamins with thehelp of friendly bacteria. Regular high colonics disturb thisactivity, flushing out essential minerals, enzymes andfriendly bacteria along with the waste materials. This couldlead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (washing outtoo many of the minerals the body needs). If a patient wishes to use one or two high colonics priorto starting the Gerson Therapy, we have no objection. But theoften-suggested course of 15 or 30 colonics should not beundertaken. In addition, it is possible to stretch the colonand lose some of its normal muscle function. Most doctors and nurses are taught to have the patientlie on the left side to take their enemas. Dr. Gerson wantedthe patient to lie on his right side. With the patient inthis position, gravity will help the coffee flow past thedescending colon, just around the "corner" of thesplenic flexure, and into the transverse colon for higherpenetration and better release of toxic feces. One more important note: When using the castor oil enema,it is necessary to add some soap to the coffee/castor oilsolution so the oil does not float to the top. Do not gratesoap into the solution. Too much soap will irritate andinflame the colon. Just rub a cake of soap for a few momentswith your hand immersed in the (liquid) coffee. This willrelease enough soap to do the job. Flax Seed Oil Dr. Gerson strongly prohibited any fats or oils, yet A Cancer Therapy says to use flax seed oil. What is thesource of this contradiction? Dr. Gerson was very much aware that patients require theintake of essential fatty acids. He experimented with varioussubstances, including sunflower, safflower, olive and otheroils to try to satisfy this need. He even tried fresh,unsalted butter. In all cases, fats administered to patients,even after they were already free of tumor tissue, caused theregrowth of cancers. Therefore, Dr. Gerson stated repeatedlyand emphatically when describing the practice of the Therapy"NO OILS, NO FATS." In 1958, after his book had been published, Gerson foundthe work of Dr. Johanna Budwig. Dr. Budwig described hersuccessful use of flax seed oil (linseed oil) in cancerpatients. Dr. Gerson tried this substance and found it verybeneficial. It supplies the essential fatty acids, helps tocarry Vitamin A through the blood stream and supplieslinoleic and linolenic acids. In a letter to his long-time friend, Dr. AlbertSchweitzer, Gerson described his protocol for the use of FlaxSeed Oil: two tablespoons a day for the first month on theGerson Therapy; one tablespoon thereafter. This prescriptionseems to be in conflict with Dr. Gerson's injunction of NOOILS, NO FATS. In the charts on pp. 235 and 236 of A Cancer Therapy, the reader will find that the use offlax seed oil is described. The reason for the"contradiction" is that, on the basis of Dr.Gerson's research in the last year of his practice, we addedthe flax seed oil prescription. We did not change the text inthe book prohibiting all fats and oils, because we wanted tokeep Dr. Gerson's original words as intact as possible. Wehope that this explains any apparent contradictions thereader may find. Flax seed oil is made from organic flax seed, coldpressed, bottled in a light-tight container, and sealed inthe presence of inert gas, not air. This careful handlingkeeps the oil from oxidizing, and becoming rancid. It mustnever be heated, and should never be used to cook, bake orfry anything. Unopened bottles may be stored in a freezer forup to six months; in a refrigerator for up to three months.Once opened and exposed to air, still refrigerated, the oilis only usable for three weeks. Patients should use the golden, filtered oil , not the brownish and viscousmaterial that includes lignins. The lignins come from part ofthe fiber of the seed, which also contains certainundesirable proteins. These should be avoided. Also, whenused by patients, only the oil should be taken, not freshlyground flax seeds, for the same reason. Some patients havebeen told by well-meaning friends that lignins or flax powdercan be used and added to cakes. That is totally out of thequestion. "Medical Hell" At the end of May, 1995, a patient was admitted to thetherapy hospital suffering from pancreatic cancer. Patients arerequested to bring their medical records with them, and thispatient brought his doctor's consultation and operation(biopsy) report along. This young man is only 38 years old,and has a fairly healthy lifestyle. I do not understand whyhe has such a serious problem at this early age. He gave me acopy of his medical report and, I must admit, I read it inamazement and disbelief. Since it is so incredible, I amquoting two paragraphs here exactly as they appear on thereport. "I have explained to the patient the absence ofsurgical resolution of the problem [inoperable] and he willbe seen by the Cancer Clinic and we'll discuss the role ornon-role of chemo and radiotherapy in this condition. Thegravity of his illness was explained to him. At the moment,he's in a state of denial and shock, but certainly his father[who is an MD] and wife are well aware of the seriousness ofthe situation. "This man was informed of the diagnosis in theabsence of all involved regular physicians by one of thefamily physicians covering for Dr. D. D. in Campbell River.This at least prepared him for the descent into hell ofhaving the diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas that he is nowembarked upon ..." We have seen a number of patients showing totalrecoveries from pancreatic cancer, even when it has spread tothe bile duct, spleen, or further. We are often accused ofquackery and "giving desperately ill people falsehope." Even if our patients do not all recover, we dogive them hope, not false hope, rather than despair. Is theabove medical report an example of compassionate "healthcare" providers?

Root Canal Cover-Up Are your teeth killing you? by Charlotte Gerson Many of our patients and readers are well-informed about the dangersof "silver-amalgam" fillings. These commonly-used fillings consistof more than 51% mercury mixed with silver and some other metals.The problem, of course, is mercury - a highly toxic heavy metalwith a powerful effect on the nervous system. Once installed inteeth, some of the mercury leaches out into the system and intocirculation. Some people, admittedly, are a great deal moresensitive to this circulating mercury than others. Mercury has beenshown to even cause multiple sclerosis in some patients. When the"silver fillings" were removed, the patients recovered. Other peoplehave silver fillings in their teeth for many years with no apparentproblems. What is less well-known is the condition that occurs when the root ofa tooth becomes abscessed. In order to treat the infection, thedentist first removes any loose or diseased material from the canalthat houses the nerve. When the nerve is removed, the tooth dies.Root Canal Cover-Up by Dr. George E. Meinig, D.D.S., F.A.C.D. in 1993documents the extensive and detailed research done by Dr. Weston A.Price, D.D.S., F.A.C.D., in the first few decades of this century.Dr. Meinig founded, and for many years headed The Association of RootCanal Specialists, a group of dentists engaged in performing rootcanal procedures. He admits to doing many hundreds himself.However, when he discovered the research done by Dr. Price detailingthe dangers inherent in this treatment, he resigned his position andnow spends his time and energies in making the public, as well asprofessionals, aware of the research. Dr. Price's first indication of health problems due to root canalscame from a patient who was bedfast and virtually paralyzed byrheumatoid arthritis. For some reason, her root canal filled toothwas removed, although it looked healthy and normal on X-rays. Withina few weeks the patient was able to get up; after some months, shewas able to walk and her health was totally restored. Intrigued, Dr.Price took the extracted tooth, sterilized it thoroughly, andimplanted it under the skin of a rabbit. Within five days, therabbit developed severe rheumatoid arthritis; in ten days it died ofthe disease. Dr. Price subsequently repeated the experiment with many otherpatients who had root canal filled teeth extracted, some sufferingfrom kidney disease, others from heart disease, and many more witharthritis. In virtually all cases, the patients showed considerableimprovement, and some even total recovery after the offending teethwere removed. Often, Dr. Price implanted the extracted andsterilized teeth under the skin of rabbits. In each case, a toothremoved from the patient caused the patient's disease in the rabbit.Dr. Price went even further to try to clear the apparently infectiousmaterial from the extracted teeth: he autoclaved them (sterilized bysteam pressure, usually at 250 degrees F. or 121 degrees C.).Sterilization made no difference: the rabbits with the sterilizedteeth implanted still developed the diseases and died, usually withinten days. As a control, Dr. Price implanted a healthy tooth underthe skin of a rabbit. This rabbit lived without showing any signs ofdisease for its normal life span of about 15 years. The underlying problem is very interesting: when the nerve is removedfrom a tooth, the tooth is dead, and is no longer supplied withnutrients. The normal structure of a tooth includes tiny "canules"(similar to capillaries in all human tissue) that carry nutrients tothe living tooth. The tooth's constant circulation is alsoinstrumental in clearing potentially infectious material from thetooth. Once the tooth is dead, however, nutrients stop circulatingthrough these canules, and the tooth loses its ability to clearitself of infection. Instead the canules become infested with germsand viruses. Additionally, the filling of the nerve canal shrinks alittle bit over time, allowing still more bacteria and viruses tolodge in the gap between the filling and the tooth. None of this isvisible on X-rays. A dead tooth is thus a potent source of bacterialand viral toxins and infections that can spread throughout thesystem. Inability of sterilization under extreme conditions to clearthe infectious material should prove that, no matter how good one'sdental hygiene is, it is simply impossible to remove the danger. People with good immune systems and powerful defenses can often livewith this constant trouble source without developing symptoms. Yet,careful X-rays eventually show "cavitation" (hollowing out of thesurrounding jawbone) around the root canal treated teeth. As thehitherto resistant patient ages or is weakened by accidents, coldsand flus or severe stress, his ability to overcome this "focalinfection" is reduced. The infection is then able to cause orcontribute to the development of severe chronic disease. In view of the above, it will not come as a surprise that we urgentlysuggest that patients remove any teeth with root canal fillings. In the 1950's, German physician Dr. Josef Issels heard a lecture byDr. Gerson, and subsequently successfully used alternative treatmentsin helping many cancer patients. Dr. Issels himself spent some timeat the CHIPSA hospital, and, while there, pointed out the severedamage caused by root canal fillings. He said that he refused totreat any cancer patient who did not allow all "devitalized" (dead)teeth to be removed, as he found that he could not obtain goodresults without this procedure. Infected tonsils also cause problems We had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Issels again recently, at aconvention in Orlando that we were both attending. In the course ofour discussion, he returned to the question of "devitalized" teeth,and described a simple, infrared machine that is capable of detectingthe infections. He told us that the detector is also capable offinding infected tonsils. Dr. Issels estimated that approximately 90% of cancer patients haveundetected infections in their tonsils that cannot be found duringroutine examinations. He told us of the case of a patient whosetonsils Issels insisted needed to be removed. The surgeon wasdoubtful about the necessity of the procedure, because he could notfind any reason for the tonsillectomy. After the tonsil was out, thesurgeon wanted to prove to Issels that the removed tonsil wasperfectly sound, and cut into it. He was shocked to have the pusvirtually squirt out into his face. Dr. Issels was making the following point: it is difficult todetermine that teeth and/or tonsils are infected and aresignificantly contributing to the patient's illness. Every effortshould be made to clear these foci of infection by removing rootcanal filled teeth and damaged tonsils, to ensure the maximum chanceof recovery. Root Canal Cover-Up by Dr. George E.

Due to its causes, age onset diabetes isrelatively simple and easy to overcome with the GersonTherapy. It has been shown that many patients with age onsetdiabetes actually produce adequate amounts of insulin, as isevidenced in their blood. Yet they are not able to properlyassimilate and burn sugar at the cellular level to produceenergy. Instead, diabetics often excrete sugar in the urine,are thirsty and drink excessive amounts of water, and lackenergy. Since these patients have insulin in their blood, whyare they diabetic? The problem is that the available insulinin the bloodstream is not being used by the body tometabolize the sugar. In order to perform its function,insulin must enter the individual cell and reach the cell'sinsulin receptors. In diabetics, insulin receptors areblocked or clogged with cholesterol, so the insulin is unableto do its job. So age-onset diabetes is really a cholesterolproblem, not one of sugar, or even malfunction of thepancreas (which produces insulin in the Islets ofLangerhans). Since no animal products are used, the Gerson Therapy istotally devoid of cholesterol. At the hospital facility where the Gerson Therapy isadministered, we have seen blood cholesterol levels dropdramatically, in some patients, up to 100 points in just oneweek on the therapy without cholesterol-reducing drugs. Ifthe uptake of insulin is blocked by cholesterol, then itcould be expected that this dramatic reduction in serumcholesterol levels would result in an almost immediatereduction of the requirement for insulin supplementation. Infact, it does. One patient, who also suffered frommetastasized melanoma in the liver, had a fasting blood sugarlevel of 177 on entering the Gerson hospital (the normal level is 120 or below). Intwo days, this level dropped to 120 - without insulin. In oneparticularly dramatic case, we saw a diabetic patient, age46, with sugar levels in his bloodstream of over 200, thatwere uncontrollable with insulin and drugs. This problemcompletely cleared in five weeks. At that time, he was ableto take all the juices of the full Gerson Therapy (carrotjuices contain large amounts of complex carbohydrates)without any further need of insulin. His blood sugar levelreturned to a normal 120, and remained stable. Juvenile Diabetes Juvenile diabetes presents entirely different problems.In juvenile diabetes, as opposed to age-onset diabetes, weare dealing with true insulin deficiency, damage to theIslets of Langerhans (the gland clusters in the pancreas thatproduce insulin). According to an article some years ago, inScientific American, juvenile diabetes is most commonlydiagnosed in children after a severe, long lasting 'flu' thatdoesn't seem to yield to normal treatment. This, it turnsout, was not a flu, but pancreatitis; an infection andinflammation of the pancreas, resulting in damage to theIslets of Langerhans, and the subsequent diabetes. A few daysago, I had a call from a distraught parent who is trying todeal with two children, girls aged 6 and 10, both afflictedwith juvenile diabetes. He did not comprehend the true causeof his children's disease and the progression of theirproblems, starting in early infancy, that led to diabetes. Ihave talked to many parents and can usually reconstruct whathappened. The children are immune deficient from birth. Thisdeficiency is aggravated by immunizations, but it is alsodue, in large part, to the mother's poor nutrition, onelacking in essential nutrients. These already deficient babies are generally notbreast-fed, but instead receive artificial canned, jarred,and processed milk and baby foods. The resulting lack ofnutrients adds to the original immune deficiency, andmanifests as a progression of infections, colds and flu. Thechild is now plied with drugs, including antibiotics andvarious flu medicines. Drugs will temporarily suppress theinfections (in the above case, constant ear infections) butwill not strengthen the immune system. On the contrary, allantibiotics are toxic to some extent and suppress the immunesystem further. So the infections become more frequent andmore severe - until, one day, they become a full fledgedpancreatitis. Not long after that, the child is diagnosedwith juvenile diabetes. We need to consider another point: the liver and thepancreas, since they are such extremely important organs,have their own immune systems, the reticulo-endothelialsystem. If hepatitis or pancreatitis occurs, this aloneproves that the affected organ's immune system is severelydamaged. The weakening of the immune system is causedpartially by frequent doses of antibiotics and/or othermedical drugs - all of which are more or less liver toxic.But once a child develops diabetes and begins taking insulin,this does not overcome the immune weakness. On the contrary,the infections continue and require more and more drugsuppression. Insulin does not produce healing! For many people who have never dealt with the problem,diabetes seems like a mild illness, easily overcome withinsulin injections. That is unfortunately not true. Juvenilediabetes often results in kidney damage, with resulting needfor kidney dialysis. Many of the children afflicted with thisdisease, as they go into early adulthood, are subject toretinal damage which can result in blindness. Young adultswhose kidneys no longer function require kidney dialysis andeventually kidney transplants - which are only good for a fewyears and then fail with deplorable results. In age-onset diabetics, the doctor's suggestion to avoidstarches and sugars and eat more proteins produces otherserious problems. As we have seen above, this disease islargely due to excess cholesterol. But the recommendation of"a high protein diet" is understood by mostpatients to mean that they should eat largely animalproducts. Meat, chicken, fish, cheese, eggs and milk are veryhigh in cholesterol, the very cause of the problem. Theresult for most of these patients is that more seriouscholesterol problems develop: deposits in the arteriesleading to high blood pressure, heart disease and heartattacks; poor circulation with resulting gangrene. Gangrenoustoes, feet and legs often must be amputated. Retinaldetachment problems lead to blindness. Most of the problem is the excess cholesterol as well asexcess animal protein that causes much of the overload on thekidneys and their eventual failure. Few people realize thatdiabetes is the third most frequent cause of death in theUnited States (after cardiovascular disease and cancer) butit is rather easy to overcome with the Gerson Therapy. Sincethe Therapy deals easily and quickly with the cholesteroloverload, the patient's body becomes able to break down andeliminate the arteriosclerosis, the kidney and eye problems,as well as the overload on the heart. We have even seenpainful toes, already cold and white due to lack ofcirculation from arteriosclerosis, turn warm and pink againin a week or two on the Gerson Therapy. Admittedly, it is much easier to deal with age-onsetdiabetes, since it is mostly a cholesterol problem with theresulting arteriosclerosis and kidney damage. When it comesto juvenile diabetes, we must remember that we are dealingwith true pancreatic dysfunction with resultant poor insulinproduction. We have seen some children with juvenile diabetesimprove eyesight, overcome high blood pressure and kidneydamage. But, since the Islets of Langerhans cannot berestored to full function, these people have to stay close tothe Gerson Therapy for the rest of their lives. In childrenand youngsters that is a tall order. On the other hand, wehave seen one patient, who started on the Gerson Therapy with"40% irreversible damage to his eyesight" accordingto his ophthalmologist, with high blood pressure that wasuncontrollable at over 220; with constant kidney pain andsevere edema - be cleared of all these problems using theGerson Therapy . But, after some time, at age 22, he wastired of adhering to this strict diet and felt he could dowell enough without it. He went back to his former ways, thestandard American diet (SAD), and after a few years, wentblind, went on kidney dialysis and eventually died. This terrible scenario is not only curable butpreventable. However, prevention is one of the most difficultapproaches to "sell" to the public. People usuallyfeel that, as long as they are well, nothing can happen tothem, and diseases are for other people. Also, they have astrong resistance to changing their diet and lifestyle.Prevention of juvenile diabetes starts with the mother. Evenprior to conception, her diet matters. The typical high fat,high salt, and high protein American diet is unfortunatelynot conducive to good health. The mother's diet shouldconsist largely of fresh (organic, whenever possible) fruitand vegetables, raw salads and juices and a little non-fatunsalted protein food, such as non-fat yogurt or cottagecheese. Also stimulants and drugs should be omitted: coffee,alcohol and especially cigarettes, not to speak of street orphysician-administered drugs, tranquilizers, sleeping pillsand pain killers. Please note: on a vegetarian, salt-free,low animal protein diet, people will naturally be free ofpain, sleep well, have no colds and flu and require no drugs. The next area of prevention for the mother is, of course,during her pregnancy. She again needs large amounts of freshfruit and vegetables, raw salads, etc. and fresh vegetablejuices. The usual admonition: "take a lot of proteins,drink plenty of milk" is completely wrong and could evenbe dangerous, as it tends to overload the kidneys and producetoxemia. A properly nourished mother will have a baby strongin immune response, free of infections and, if the baby isbreast fed, also free of colic. An easy, relatively painlessbirth is an extra bonus. One of the important preventive reasons why breastfeeding is so essential is the very first fluid which entersthe breast. This is not actual milk, but a transparent fluid,called colostrum. It is nature's gift to this wonderful newlife and helps to build the baby's immune system, thefriendly bacteria in the intestinal tract, etc. It isunfortunate that some pediatricians feel that they knowbetter than nature and tell mothers to discard this firstfluid "since it is not milk" and wait until the"real milk" comes in before breast feeding is tobegin. The next important preventive step, of course, is theactual nutrition of the baby. If the baby is fed good, freshlive foods, first mother's milk, then fresh vegetables,mashed bananas, apples and fresh oatmeal rather than boxed'Pablum' or other artificial cereals, the baby will remainwell with good defenses. One of the first additions to thechild's diet, as early as the second or third month, and evenbefore oatmeal, should be freshly pressed carrot juice, madefrom organic carrots. As the child grows, one must keep itemssuch as ice cream, cookies, cakes, etc., to the barestminimum, only for special occasions. In an earlier HealingNewsletter (Vol. 9, No. 3), we published the devastatingeffects on children of hot dogs and other spiced sausagemeats. It is also most important to avoid bottled softdrinks, especially those containing stimulants, such as thecola drinks. Again, fresh fruit and vegetable juices (carrotand apple, for instance) are best. Adult Diabetes Prevention We now go on to the adult prevention program. Obviously,since age-onset diabetes is caused largely by excesscholesterol, we have to come to the same conclusions: a lowanimal protein and low fat diet, no deep fried foods, minimumsalt and sweet bottled drinks as well as avoidance ofalcohol, cigarettes, and other stimulants. To keep the body'sdefenses at a peak level, with high enzyme function, we mustagain have the best, fresh, organic fruit and vegetables,avoid salt, stimulants and drugs, but use fresh vegetablejuices with only occasional 'treats'. Dr. Gerson wrote about prevention in his book A Cancer Therapy: Results of 50 Cases . He felt that adiet consisting of 75% building and highly nutritiousmaterial, and 25% of "your choice" would beadequate. That was 40 years ago. In the intervening years,technology has damaged the air, water, soil and foods muchmore, with the predictable result that most people'sresistance is much lower. Therefore, I would propose a dietof 90% building and defensive foods (fresh, organic fruit andvegetables) with at most 10% "at liberty" forprevention of disease.

I refer tothem as "modern diseases". Some, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),are also known as "Yuppy Diseases", after Young Upwardly-mobileProfessionals, those most commonly affected. The victims of thesediseases are most often middle-class whites, two thirds of them women. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome The volume Health Conditions, p. 616, describes Chronic Fatigue Syndromeas "a mysterious infectious illness" that supposedly existed and wasdescribed in the past as "the vapors", and, after World War I, as"soldier's heart". Researchers have failed to find a single cause, butsuspect it to be related to the Epstein-Barr virus infection, withcandidiasis and herpes thrown in. It is almost certainly caused byinfectious agents, whether one or more is relatively immaterial when wetreat it with the Gerson Therapy. According to Dr. Murray R. Susser ofSanta Monica, California, symptoms can include deep fatigue, joint pain orweakness, headache, memory loss, mental confusion, digestive problems,allergies and depression. These can also include anxiety, night sweatsand even irregular heartbeat. A young man (age 28) seen at the hospital had all of these problemsso severely that he had been bedfast for many months, unable to engage inany activity. The doctors accused him of laziness and/or psychiatricproblems and put him into the psychiatric ward. Drugs administered thereworsened his depression so badly he became suicidal. At the hospital, with the intensive Gerson Therapy and detoxification, he was upin a little more than a week, in great good spirits and dancing with hismother! In The Gerson Healing Newsletter, Vol. 9 No. 4, (Nov./Dec.1994), we described another chronic fatigue patient who recoveredcompletely on the Gerson Therapy. He had suffered from almost all of theabove described symptoms. Health Conditions further quotes Dr. Susser, saying that he firmlybelieves that CFS results from "several ongoing, simultaneous infectionsthat weaken the immune system." I believe that it is probably the otherway around: it is a weakened immune system (due to previous infections,antibiotic and other drug treatments, toxicity from foods and theenvironment) that allows various organisms to take up residence in thebody. Once these have damaged the body, it is much easier for otheropportunistic viruses or germs to add to the problem. Dr. Susser adds that in CFS "we often get hidden, concomitant parasite,yeast and viral infections that are the result of a weakened immunesystem." Here is our cue that CFS is not a simple problem but a combination ofimmune deficiency diseases, including candida and possible parasites. Candidiasis Candidiasis, a fungal invasion, has become extremely common. Candida iscommonly found in many body areas, particularly in the gut and vagina.Candidiasis regularly develops in people who have undergone severe orlong-term treatments with antibiotics. The mechanism is quite simple:since candida commonly inhabits the colon, it shares the availablenutrients with friendly bacteria as well as other organisms. Whenpatients are treated with antibiotics, these bacteria are killed off - butthe yeast (Candida) survives and is now no longer deprived of nutrients byother organisms, it has the area and the nutrients to itself. It isimportant to note that patients who receive antibiotic treatments arealready suffering from some infection and are therefore immunecompromised. The weakened immune system is then subject to a massiveinvasion by candida that was unaffected by antibiotics and against whichthe body has no defenses. Candida really becomes a problem when it invades other tissues,particularly the nervous system. The drugs available for treatment, likeall drugs, are often temporarily effective to control the candida - butthey do not heal. On the contrary, all drugs are toxic and further damageand weaken the immune system. The result is that the candida recurs ifand when the drugs have to be discontinued due to toxic liver damage. Since cancer chemotherapy also severely damages the immune system,virtually all cancer patients who were treated with chemo also suffer fromcandidiasis. Furthermore, even those who have not been treated withcytotoxic (chemo) drugs suffer from a damaged immune system: they couldnot have cancer if their immune system were fully functioning. We cantherefore assume that they, too, have some degree of candida infection. Herpes Herpes, or fever sores, have been around for a long time. Genital herpes,on the other hand, is a relatively new sexually transmitted disease (STD).Before the advent of AIDS, it was one of the more serious genitallytransmitted diseases and caused much distress in young people. It, too,defies treatment Herpes simplex is described as an acute viral infection;while genital herpes is known to be caused by Herpes Virus 2. This, too,is clearly an immune deficiency disease and has been overcome by theGerson Therapy. Another form of Herpes, Herpes Zoster or shingles, is also on the rise.Not only does it cause extreme pain which is difficult to control, but itgenerally does not go away. The severity of the attack will subside, butconstant and recurring problems, including pain, may persist. There is noreally effective treatment to overcome and cure this herpes infectionexcept with the intensive Gerson Therapy. Lyme Disease Lyme Disease was first observed and described in Lyme, Connecticut. Itseems to be caused by an infectious agent, transmitted by a tick, andcauses various problems, including in some cases arthritis, erythema(reddening of skin), Bell's palsy, brain and possible heart abnormalities.It has been improved by the administration of penicillin, however manycases persist and develop into serious paralyses, nerve and braindisorders. We have seen only one patient who suffered from this problem.She was in a wheelchair, unable to move or control her limbs, was severelydepressed and her condition was deteriorating. In only a few days on theGerson Therapy her overall problems improved considerably. I have nofollow-up in this case and am unable to report further progress. Salmonella This is a topic that has to be treated separately, and is not really a"modern" disease. It has several forms ranging from mild to severegastro-intestinal inflammation all the way to serious food poisoning.Other species of salmonella are the causative agents of paratyphoid andtyphoid fever. The reason salmonella must be included under "modern" infections is thatin its food poisoning action, it is now killing an increasingly largenumber of people in the U.S. annually. The number of salmonella casesreported in Los Angeles last year, for instance, increased ten times (fromjust over 100, to just over 1,000) over the previous year. The culprit, to a large extent, is the chicken industry. We talked about"The Case Against Chicken" in the Gerson Healing Newsletter, Vol. 9, No.1, (May/June 1994), but this discussion did not include any of the manyinfectious agents found in chicken due to current automated, high-volume,profit-oriented processing. Surely many of our readers saw the article inTime Magazine (Oct. 17, 1994) titled "Something Smells Fowl", anddescribing the horrendous and unsanitary conditions found in today'schicken processing plants. Aside from salmonella, chicken are generallyinfected with Camphylobacter, E. coli or other micro-organisms, accordingto the Time article. "Each year at least 6.5 million and possibly as manyas 80 million people get sick from chicken, and some 1,000 people die,according to conservative estimates". Although cooking the meat properlywill generally kill the infectious bacteria, any kitchen surface orimplement that the infected meat touches can also become contaminated andpotentially dangerous. In discussing the damage done by consuming chicken, neither our ownMay/June issue, nor the Time Magazine article touched on the treatment ofthe animals while they are alive. The incubated eggs are injected beforethey hatch, since they would otherwise not even produce live chicks.Chickens are heavily treated with hormones and antibiotics to keep themalive - and they must generally be slaughtered at a very early age (forchickens) - or they die of disease. Yet, with intensive advertising, theimmense (7 billion chickens are slaughtered in the United States annually)and profitable chicken industry has convinced much of the American publicthat eating this septic, decaying, sick and chemical-laced meat ishealthier and preferable to eating red meat because of its lower fat andcholesterol content. I am by no means advocating the consumption of redmeat, pork or veal - none of which are the slightest bit healthful. I aminstead pointing out that eating chicken is not a reasonable choice for aperson wishing to maintain good health. The above material is presented to give the reader background informationon the increasing dangers of "modern" sources of infection. But, in myopinion, all these modern diseases are really only symptoms of theseriously decreased resistance and damaged immune systems of our currentpopulation. In all these cases, infections are involved, and in many ofthem (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Candidiasis, Genital Herpes, LymeDisease), there is no cure by drugs or other orthodox methods. Yet theGerson Therapy has been shown to help people overcome these diseases.This shows that the Gerson Therapy strengthens and restores the immunesystem and thus helps the body to overcome these "incurable" ailments. Legionnaires' Disease Among "modern diseases," Legionnaire's Disease should also be mentioned,especially in connection with impaired immune systems. This "mysteriousnew disease" was first described in a number of cases which afflictedmembers of the American Legion who were attending a convention inPhiladelphia in 1976. The disease is a serious type of pneumonia, yet isoften carried without producing disease. According to the text CurrentMedical Diagnosis, Legionnaires' Disease is caused by an opportunisticgerm (meaning that it attacks weakened or defenseless persons) andgenerally affects the elderly, smokers and people on dialysis or who havebeen given organ transplants. The latter, of course, must be treated withimmune suppressant agents or their bodies would reject the transplants.In other words, their immune systems are severely and intentionallydepressed, and they become susceptible to opportunistic infections. AIDS No discussion of "modern diseases" would be complete without mentioningAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. This, as the nameindicates, is the ultimate failure of the immune system. It stands toreason, then, that since the Gerson Therapy restores the immune system, itcould well overcome this problem, too. At present, it is difficult for meto claim that the Gerson Therapy will cure AIDS. Due to restrictionsimposed by the Mexican health authorities, we are not allowed to acceptAIDS patients. As a result, we have not been able to follow AIDS patientsto observe results. We have seen good recoveries in two cases of patientswho were treated for HIV infections on an out-patient basis. I feeluncomfortable making any curative claims for the Gerson Therapy on thebasis of such a small sample. Yet, one cannot help but assume that, withthe improved immune response produced by the Gerson Therapy as with somany other diseases, AIDS should respond very well. Dr. Gerson was aware very early in his career that his Therapy was able toimprove and restore the immune system - since he was able to curetuberculosis of all types well before the advent of antibiotics. I evenremember a case of infantile paralysis in New York that was reversedalmost immediately with the Gerson Therapy. Obviously the immune systemplays an extremely important role in the treatment of cancer. Therestored immune response is largely credited with helping the body breakdown and dissolve tumor tissue. Conversely, since all the above diseasesare on the rise, we also have to understand that, due to modernagricultural methods, food processing methods, damage to our bodies withtoxins, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, with medical drug treatments, etc., ourimmune systems are more and more seriously damaged or paralyzed. In orderto heal anything we have to work to restore the whole body, and with it,the immune system. And since the Gerson Therapy does just that, it hasbeen able to heal both 'ancient' and 'modern' diseases.

The reason wasthe general disillusion with the results of surgery andradiation in the treatment of cancer patients. Thechemotherapeutic drugs were supposed to stop the fastreproduction of tumor cells - and thus stop cancer.Originally, these highly toxic agents were based on themustard gas of warfare of which there was a huge remainingsupply after the end of World War II. When these drugs soonwere found to be too toxic and at best only temporarilyeffective, new combinations were compounded all supposedlystopping or slowing the multiplication of fast growingtissue. But since there are various tissues in the human bodywhich must multiply rapidly (bone marrow producing red andwhite blood corpuscles which constitute a large part of theimmune system) other very serious side-effects were alwayspresent with the chemotherapy treatments: damage to bonemarrow; poisoning of the liver and often destruction of thekidneys, not to speak of damage also to the heart. In spite of over 30 years of use of chemotherapy in thetreatment of cancer patients, and in spite of its status as a'proven' cancer treatment, these drugs have never beenofficially accepted nor do they have the full approval ofFDA. Chemotherapy is still an "experimental"treatment, largely because it has never undergone 'doubleblind' studies. Why not? Chemotherapy was just being introduced toward the end ofDr. Gerson's practice in New York, shortly before hedied. He talks about his experience with Johnny Gunther inAppendix II of A Cancer Therapy Results of 50 Cases, p. 415.(See also John Gunther's book, Death Be Not Proud) Johnny waspossibly the only patient Dr. Gerson treated after he had been given chemotherapy.The book describes the terrible response, the swollen arm,the severe bone marrow depression and the doctor'sexpectation that Johnny would quickly die. Nobody suspectedthat Dr. Gerson could reverse some of the damage. But Dr. Gerson could not have known what the Gerson doctorsin Mexico have discovered after years of working with cancerpatients who had previously been given chemotherapy, namelythat these heavy drugs are released back into the system andcause the prior poisoning symptoms to show up once more. Thisgenerally happens after some six months on the GersonTherapy. That was also Dr. Gerson's experience with JohnnyGunther - but he did not know that it was due to the priorchemotherapy treatment. He took the blame for Johnny's death,assuming that the only cause was the treatment with hormoneswhich he had applied. Oncologists using chemotherapy drugs in the treatment oftheir cancer patients are told that the body, in time,excretes these drugs, and that the damage is thus overcome.It is true that many patients grow hair again after they havelost it; that their blood count comes back up to near normaland their mucous membranes heal after breaking down withulcers due to the chemotherapy treatments. They overcome theterrible nausea and vomiting caused by the toxic drugs, theweakness and depression, etc. (Of course if they suffer alsothe loss of kidney function due to the chemotherapeuticdrugs, this does not reverse. The kidneys, once destroyed, donot recover.) But overcoming the immediate toxicity does notprove that all the toxic materials have left the body. On thecontrary, the Gerson doctors' experience with patients whohave had prior treatment with chemotherapy gives an entirelydifferent picture. When the first Gerson Therapy treatment facility inMexico (La Gloria) was started in 1977, we went as closely aspossible by Dr. Gerson's directions in his book, A Cancer Therapy . But since Dr. Gerson didn't have any experience with chemotherapypatients, his book contains no special directions regardingsuch patients. No special adjustments were made by the Gersondoctors for such patients. Our first serious shock came when,at almost the same time, two patients with previouschemotherapy treatments were admitted and started on theTherapy. They received the full intensive treatment,including the starting medications, five coffee enemas a day,and the castor oil treatment every other day. As the bodiesof these two patients detoxified intensively, they had allthe symptoms of a chemotherapy overdose. Of course the Gersonphysicians had given none of these drugs. So the onlyconclusion was that the drugs still remaining in the bodyfrom treatments many months earlier, were being releasedrapidly, in large amounts, poisoning these patients a secondtime! They landed in intensive care, they were so ill. TheGerson doctors were shocked into the realization thatchemotherapy patients could not be treated with the sameprotocols as those who had received none of these toxicdrugs. It must also be understood that patients treated withchemotherapeutic agents often had recurrences which causedthem to seek alternative therapies. At one point, the results of the Gerson Therapy inpatients with previous chemotherapy treatments were so poorthat we refused to accept such patients. However, in time,some patients begged to be allowed to come. Others, afterchemotherapy, felt that the Gerson Therapy was so logical andbasic that they tried the Gerson Therapy at home on their ownand, to our great surprise, succeeded! So, it became clearthat it could be done. With this empirical evidence in hand, the Gerson Therapyphysicians began to treat patients who had received priorchemotherapy. These patients were given less intensivemedications; they were given only two or three coffee enemasdaily instead of the regular five. They were not given castoroil treatments, in order to avoid sudden and intensivedetoxification and they improved. It was now a questionwhether this less intensive treatment would work fast enoughand well enough to stop the advance of the cancer, yet not sofast as to cause an overdose of the chemotherapeuticchemicals being pushed out of their systems. In many cases,it worked. Admittedly, the results in cases where patientshad received prior chemotherapy were sharply reduced comparedto those who received no such toxic drugs. But, in manycases, we were still able to obtain recoveries. We did find out, however, that certain cancers do notrespond after chemotherapy. Pancreatic cancer, which showsexcellent results on the Gerson Therapy, does not respondafter the patient had received chemotherapy. The same goesfor cancers that have extensively metastasized (spread) intothe liver. Leukemias, after heavy chemotherapy, are alsodifficult to reverse with the Gerson Therapy. Brain tumorsfall into the same category. Melanomas, which usually respondexceptionally well to the Gerson Therapy, do relativelypoorly after chemotherapy. All types of lymphomas dorelatively well on the Gerson Therapy despite chemotherapy;the same goes for ovarian cancers. Of course, all types ofcancer respond much better with no prior toxic drugtreatments. According to various sources, after the administration ofchemotherapy, the patient's body excretes somewhere between35% and 50% of the drugs given. The problem for a researcheris to prove this statement. Unfortunately, there are no truetests for toxicity in the system. I personally feel that theremaining toxic drugs could be lodged in the connective orfatty tissues. They cannot possibly remain in the liver; thisessential organ would be poisoned beyond function. But alldrug tests are performed on serum or blood samples, not solidtissues. Fluids do not show positive for these agents simplybecause the drugs are not circulating, but are lodged in sometissue. The reason we feel so certain that poisons remain in thebody after chemotherapy treatments, even up to two yearslater, is that we see the patients excreting them. In thecourse of the Gerson Therapy, patients typically go throughhealing crises, or "Flare-Ups," described by Dr. Gerson in A Cancer Therapy , pp. 201-203. During these flare-upswe see that the patient's body excretes many accumulatedtoxins. Often, these toxins are readily identifiable by theirodors. When patients who had prior chemo go through thesedetoxifying 'flare-up' days, they experience the samesymptoms they originally felt while they were receiving thechemotherapeutic agents: they feel nauseous, taste thechemicals, smell the drugs in their stool, have some loss ofhair, mouth ulcers, and temporarily depressed red and whiteblood cell counts. Since we have learned to treat anddetoxify these patients cautiously, we find that the heavychemotherapy drug releases can happen at about six monthsinto the Gerson Therapy. At that time the patient eitherrecovers or goes into decline. Since our experience with patients who have had priorchemotherapy is always questionable, we have often refused toadmit patients who had received a "bone marrowtransplant." These patients are treated extremelyheavily with chemotherapeutic chemicals, after their bonemarrow is removed. The marrow is then returned, on the theorythat since it has remained free of the toxic drugs, it willcontinue to function. In fact, that does not happen, sincethe drugs continue to circulate in the body and, of course,soon contaminate the 'clean' bone marrow. One patient, suffering from ovarian cancer, and showingpoor results after several courses of chemotherapy, was givena bone marrow transplant at a cost upward of $150,000.00.This treatment did not control her cancer, which continued tospread. She then called us and wished to be admitted to thehospital for the Gerson Therapy. However, while sheadmitted to being heavily treated with chemotherapy, she didnot tell the Gerson physicians about receiving a bone marrowtransplant. So, with a warning that chemotherapy patients donot respond as well as those who have not been pretreated,she was accepted for the Gerson Therapy. She was given theless intensive therapy, developed specifically for patientswho have had prior chemotherapy, and responded quite well.Her symptoms and blood counts improved. However, as expected,after six months from the start of the Gerson Therapy, shewent into a heavy 'healing reaction'. In her case, thisconsisted of abscesses breaking out all over her body. Theseboils released pus, and, of course, she was veryuncomfortable during a few weeks. Nevertheless, she workedthrough it - and after it was over, was much better. We haveto assume that, in her case, much of the heavy poisoning wasexcreted through the skin. There are more and more reports by establishmentoncologists doubting the value of chemotherapy, even to thepoint of rejecting it outright. One of these, cancerbiostatistician Dr. Ulrich Abel, of Heidelberg, Germany,issued a monograph titled Chemotherapy of Advanced EpithelialCancer in 1990. (See Healing Journal, No. 1-2, Vol.7 of theGerson Institute.) Epithelial cancers comprise the mostcommon forms of adenocarcinoma: lung, breast, prostate,colon, etc. After ten years as a statistician in clinicaloncology, Abel became increasingly uneasy. "A sober andunprejudiced analysis of the literature," he wrote,"has rarely revealed any therapeutic success by theregimens in question in treating advanced epithelialcancer." While chemotherapy is being used more and moreextensively, more than a million people die worldwide ofthese cancers annually - and a majority have received someform of chemotherapy before dying. Abel further concluded,after polling hundreds of cancer doctors, "The personalview of many oncologists seems to be in striking contrast tocommunications intended for the public." Abel citedstudies that have shown "that many oncologists would nottake chemotherapy themselves if they had cancer." (TheCancer Chronicles, December, 1990.) "Even though toxicdrugs often do effect a response, a partial or completeshrinkage of the tumor, this reduction does not prolongexpected survival," Abel finds. "Sometimes, infact, the cancer returns more aggressively than before, sincethe chemo fosters the growth of resistant cell lines."Besides, the chemo has severely damaged the body's owndefenses, the immune system and often the kidneys as well asthe liver. In an especially dramatic table, Dr. Abel displays theresults of chemotherapy in patients with various types ofcancers, as the improvement of survival rates, compared tountreated patients. This table shows: In colorectal cancer: no evidence survival isimproved. Gastric cancer: no clear evidence. Pancreatic cancer: Study completely negative. Longersurvival in control (untreated) group. Bladder: no clinical trial done. Breast cancer: No direct evidence that chemotherapyprolongs survival; its use is "ethicallyquestionable." (That is particularly newsworthy, sinceall breast cancer patients, before or after surgery, aregiven chemotherapy drugs.) Ovarian cancer: no direct evidence. Cervix and uterus: No improved survival. Head and neck: no survival benefit but occasionalshrinkage of tumors. More recently, the Nov. 17, 1994 Wall Street Journal, ina front page article on political pressure being exerted forinsurance companies to pay for bone marrow transplants inadvanced breast cancer, experts give a totally negativereport on this approach. The procedure, called ABMT(Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant) involves temporarilyremoving some of the patient's bone marrow, applying apotentially lethal dose of chemotherapy, then returning themarrow to the patient's body. The cost of this procedure isin excess of $100,000.00 . The University of Colorado's Dr. Jones, continues theJournal, claims that, with conventional chemotherapy, notmore than 2% of patients with spreading breast cancer get apositive response. A non-profit independent technologyassessment agency, the Emergency Care Research Institute(ECRI), says that for the average woman with the mostadvanced form of breast cancer, the high dose ABMT procedureis not only worthless, but also likely to shorten her life.This report by the ECRI is based on an analysis of 40 studiesof ABMT and similar procedures involving a total of 1,017patients, and 61 studies covering 4,852 patients who hadconventional chemotherapy. Dr. Nelson Erlick, the project'slead analyst, concluded that "many patients are led tobelieve that this (ABMT) is a successful therapy. We found noevidence whatsoever that it provides any benefit." Since the Gerson Therapy is often described by orthodoxoncologists as 'quackery', we'd like our readers to considerthis: If quackery describes an expensive treatment that thetechnician knows ahead of time to be ineffective (or evenharmful), what is ABMT (bone marrow transplant)? Yet healthplan providers are being ordered to pay for it by the Officeof Personnel Management, a federal agency.

Of coursedepression is not new; it has been plaguing people for centuries.However, recently it has been accepted as a disease syndrome and asbeing 'treatable'. This means that it can be drug treated. It isdepressing just to read the symptoms given: (Current MedicalDiagnosis & Treatment, Krupp & Chatton)o Lowered mood, sadness to intense feelings of guilt and hopelessnesso Difficulty in thinking, inability to concentrate, inability to make decisionso Loss of interest, less involvement with work and recreationo Headache, disrupted sleep, change in appetite, decreased sexual driveo Anxietyo Suicidal tendencies As the disease progresses, the symptoms become more severe. In allorthodox approaches to disease, the symptoms are treated, not theunderlying problems. The present drugs of choice are the moodaltering medications, one example of which is imipramine. Years ago, we saw a patient who had been treated with imipramine forsome 15 years. Her depression and anxiety were still present, buthad been more or less controlled by the drug. The side effects,however, were almost unbearable: she was virtually blind, could justidentify her own hand held in front of her eyes; and she was stilldepressed. But the patient's worst symptom was the constant feelingof worms crawling under her skin and out of all her body openings.Her symptoms intensified if she didn't take the drug. In only a fewdays on the Gerson Therapy, her vision had improved to near normaland her mood was a great deal better. The 'crawling' sensations,however, took longer to relieve. More recently, we had a patient whowas being treated for lymphoma. She had been on the Gerson Therapyfor some time, but came back to the hospital for hyperbaricoxygen treatments. She mentioned, one day, that she was experiencinga crawling sensation under her skin. I asked her if she had everbeen treated for depression with antidepressant drugs. She thought amoment and then replied, yes, some 35 years ago, after the birth ofher daughter. These drugs were still lodged in her system and onlyjust being excreted in the course of a healing reaction on the GersonTherapy. When they reentered the bloodstream, she re-experienced thesame symptoms she felt when the drug was first administered. Sincedrugs do not overcome the underlying problems, they are oftenadministered for years, yet never clear the disease. Brain dysfunctions are generally referred to as mental diseases. Tomany, this classification implies genetic problems, and carries thestigma of being crazy or demented. Often, in fact, these diseasesare metabolic disorders, and therefore curable by healing themetabolism. The brain is an incredibly delicate and finely balanced instrument..It also requires substantially more oxygen than other tissues. Whileit only constitutes only about 6-8% of total body mass, it isbelieved to require as much as 20% of the system's total oxygenintake. As in all chronic diseases, the underlying problems in brainmalfunction are toxicity and deficiency. The Standard American Diet(SAD) is generally at fault. Ross Horne, in his book, The Health Revolution, has reproduced twointeresting photomicrographs from Dr. Ronald Glasser's The Body isthe Hero. In it, we see the effect of a high-fat meal on red bloodcorpuscles (cells). In order to properly fulfill their oxygentransport function, red blood corpuscles should float freely andindependently in the bloodstream, exposing the maximum surface areato adsorb, carry and release oxygen. However, after a high-fat meal,the cells that should float freely (see Figure 2) become stucktogether and clumped into rolls, much like the rolls of coins onegets at the bank, see Figure 1. These rolls are called rouleaux.The photomicrograph shows that a large proportion of red bloodcorpuscles are still forming rouleaux six hours after a high fatmeal. When they are glued together, blood cells have a much reducedtotal surface area, thus can carry much less oxygen. Furthermore,these rouleaux are too large and inflexible to travel through thetiny capillaries (hair vessels) and deliver their life-supportingoxygen to the most remote cells in the circulatory system. With thebrain's high oxygen requirement, it cannot function properly underconditions of oxygen starvation. This explains why people experiencesleepiness and lack of energy after a heavy meal. They often try toovercome the 'depression' by the use of stimulants: coffee, alcoholor cigarettes. It takes some six to ten hours for the body to clearthe fat from the bloodstream and "unclump" the red blood cells.Within six hours, however, most people will have consumed anotherfatty meal: breakfast with eggs and bacon or sausage; lunch with ahamburger or hot-dog; dinner with meat, chicken, cheese, milk,butter, or other high-fat substances. The result is that we live ina constant state of oxygen starvation when we eat diets high in fatcontent. Yet this describes the SAD diet precisely. 40% or more ofthe calories the average American consumes come from the fat contentof our food. Our brains and other vital organs are being slowlystrangled, deprived of their life-giving oxygen. In addition to fat and cholesterol, the SAD diet contains manychemical additives: dyes, preservatives, emulsifiers, flavorenhancers, plus residual pesticides, hormones, and antibiotics fromanimal products. Some 10,000 chemicals are accepted as foodadditives, certified safe by our Food and Drug Administration (FDA).In our opinion, no chemical food additives are safe for dailyingestion! It has been amply demonstrated that hyperactive childrenbecome perfectly normal when they are placed on a diet free of foodadditives. Instead of using this approach, however, orthodox doctorsuse drugs such as phenobarbital to calm these children. Butpsychoactive drugs, used over a period of time, can themselves causebrain damage! All toxic substances, including food additives, areenzyme inhibitors, further depressing the normal functions of braincells. Is it surprising that people become depressed, hyperactive,aggressive, and suicidal? (Suicide is one of the leading causes ofdeath among teenagers.) I must admit that I am always impressed withthe fact that so many people function as well as they do, as long asthey do, given what they eat. But are we really functioning fully? Nathan Pritikin describes how"children whose diets are changed from the typical Western high-fatdiet to a diet low in fat, can perform simple mental tasks 20% fasterand with greater accuracy once their blood is clear of fat."Pritikin asks, "Does our entire population struggle along at about75% of their mental capacity? Is this why our television programsare so infantile?" But what if we go further than eliminating fatsfrom the children's diet? What if we also eliminate food additivesand other toxins and sugar? What if we give our children the besthigh-micronutrient diet, such as a less intensive Gerson Therapy,could we increase their mental capacity by much more than 20%? Andwould this not also hold true for the rest of us? In conclusion, clinical depression is not just treatable (by drugs),it is curable. The answer to chronic disease is always the same:once you understand the underlying problems, deficiency and toxicity,and solve those, the body is capable of healing. Detoxifying andflooding the body with a high nutrient diet, the Gerson Therapy, isthe total approach to healing.

We felt this to be a very important development. Our members and other friends will surely find it encouraging that "old remedies" (the true healing of herbs, nutrition, acupuncture, homeopathy, etc.), according to this article, are once again finding acceptance. Since orthodox doctors, too, are spokesmen, we would like to report in some detail on this front-page news article. The article"s subtitle reads: "No longer dismissed as fringe ideas, such "traditional" therapies as acupuncture and herbs are going mainstream. Once-wary doctors are using them to complement conventional medicine." The article was written by Marlene Cimons, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer. The article opens with a report on a patient suffering cruelly from one of the most violent pains known: trigeminal neuralgia. The pain is caused by a nerve inflammation in the cheek. Narcotics and nerve blocks gave this patient only little relief, and had severe side effects: the patient was unable to sleep, couldn't concentrate and suffered from depression. The physician who was finally consulted, Dr. Brian Berman in Baltimore used homeopathic remedies, derived from herbs. Within six months, the pain receded by two-thirds. The patient continues to use these remedies, and is able to keep the pain under control. The author continues: "Now many other doctors are beginning to do the same thing. They have discovered that integrating the unconventional with the mainstream not only can provide relief but also can do so with fewer side effects and without more invasive procedures, such as surgery." More and more scientific evidence is strengthening approaches once considered radical or alternative, that are now being considered "complementary". The article claims that many physicians, "even those most resistant to alternative medicine," are now taking a second look. The article quotes Dr. Nancy Dickey, a family practice physician, chair of the board of trustees of the American Medical Association, a most conservative even reactionary organization. Dr. Dickey admitted that "if I had a patient who said, "I quit using codeine since I started doing acupuncture", I'd say, "Terrific"." Since these so-called "alternative" methods are, in fact, the ancient and original approaches to treatment of illness, they are actually "traditional" medicine. Outside of the United States, they are referred to as such. According to the World Health Organization of the United Nations, 65% to 80% of the world�s health care services are what we would call alternative. Dr. Wayne B. Jonas, director of the National Institutes of Health Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), is quoted as saying that "These become complementary, alternative or unconventional when used in Western countries. Even in countries where modern Western biomedicine dominates, the public makes extensive use of unconventional practices." A 1990 study showed that one in three Americans saw an alternative health care practitioner that year. More than 80% used alternatives in conjunction with conventional medicine, according to the NIH. However, an item in The Cancer Chronicles, published by People Against Cancer, discusses a summer 1993 convention of the AMA, in the course of which delegates proposed a resolution condemning "recognition and endorsement of non-scientific alternative medical care paltriness". This was done in the name of "freedom and patient's rights"! According to the logic of B. J. Kennedy, MD, a delegate from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, "Use of these therapies interferes with patients' access to regular medical care." According to a report under the heading of "Abstracts" in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, January 1996, Vol. 2, No. 1, "A survey by David Eisenberg and colleagues indicated that in 1990, consumers made an estimated 425 million visits to providers of alternative therapies (they also made 388 million visits to primary care physicians) and spent $13.7 billion , mostly out-of-pocket (they spent $12.8 billion out-of-pocket for all hospitalizations during the same period). It was estimated that one of three Americans used alternative therapies in 1990, and most did not tell their physicians they were using these therapies." After the results were in from a carefully designed questionnaire, the journal continues, "180 physicians returned completed questionnaires; 70% to 90% considered many alternative therapies to be legitimate and a majority had referred patients to nonphysicians or used these therapies in their own practice. Of the respondents, 70% expressed interest in training in multiple areas of alternative medicine." Medical schools are beginning to add training in alternative therapies to their curricula. "Insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other health plans have begun to cover alternative treatments in part," the author continues, "because they often cost less than standard procedures, and also because customers want them." A most interesting item follows: it seems that physicians themselves have become "consumers of alternative medicine" says Dr. James Gordon, chairman of the program advisory council of the NIH�s OAM. "I've certainly seen physicians change because they had a health problem that was not helped by conventional therapy." Dr. Gordon had injured his back and obtained no relief from "orthodox" remedies, but was apparently helped by an osteopath. "The NIH's Jonas points out that a new drug's average "half-life" or period of peak use is about 20 years. Homeopathy has been around, unchanged, for almost 200 years, acupuncture for more than 2,000 years, prayer and spiritualism for at least 20,000 years. And if one believes reports of monkeys using plant products to regulate their menstrual cycles, herbalism, probably the oldest, has been around for greater than 200,000 years." Homeopathy was originally introduced from Europe by Dr. Hahnemann and is based on the idea of "like cures like". Homeopathy consists of treating a disease by giving highly diluted preparations of substances that, in larger doses, actually cause the same symptoms. The author of the article quotes several success stories with alternative medicine, including that of the wife of a physician, herself a nurse, who could not stand the side effects of the painkillers she was taking to treat fibromyalgia. She was highly skeptical but, with acupuncture, homeopathy and herbs, she could wean herself off drugs. [The wife of a patient at the Gerson Treatment Center, who was suffering from fibromyalgia, was cleared of her pain in three days by simply eating the organic vegetarian, unsalted foods served at the hospital.] Many doctors are still resistant to alternative medicine, partly because they feel that there is not enough scientific evidence demonstrating its effectiveness, and that most of what evidence there is, though striking, is "anecdotal". Dr. Berman predicts that it will take another decade for society to undergo a major transformation in its acceptance of alternative therapies. He feels it will only happen when there is enough "scientific" evidence to prove these therapies effective. The author also admits that even though doctors are more and more willing to turn to alternative medicine, the medical establishment in the United States is so strong that it is still able to define what "health care" should be. Physicians are still being taught that alternatives are mostly folk medicine, supposedly a "less evolved" form of medicine. The fact remains, however, that the public is becoming demonstrably more disenchanted with the ineffective treatments of allopathic, technological medicine, especially for degenerative diseases, and is "voting with their feet" by their patronage of alternative practitioners, for the ancient methods that still work.

We sometimes getphone calls and information from some of these cured peoplewith wonderful stories that we need to share with ourreaders. We should also like to stress that we love to hearfrom you people out there after you have been well for sometime. Don't for a moment think that we are no longerinterested in your recovery. On the contrary, the longer youare well, the more important and dramatic the story! Pleasekeep in touch and let us know. One such wonderful success story is that of Nora K. ofNorth Liberty, Indiana. Just weeks from her 10th birthday,she started to suffer from headaches, then vomiting. Hermother took her for a CAT scan and a brain tumor wasdiscovered. She then was taken to the Riley Children'sHospital in Indianapolis and was scheduled for surgery. Thesurgeon removed what he could, but some of the tumor was tooclose to a blood vessel and was only cauterized. This, ofcourse, left the door open to more tumor growth.Subsequently, Nora went for yearly check-ups. When she was13, an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) showed a recurrence.The doctor said that at this point, he couldn't do anything,"the tumor wasn't big enough to operate". Nora'smother, Mary, felt that she couldn't just sit by and wait forher daughter's tumor to grow. She started to read andresearch. She found the Gerson Therapy. In 1990, Mary and Nora came to the Mexican hospital andstarted the Gerson Therapy. Nora was on the Therapy,strictly, for one and a half years. During this time, withthe frequent coffee enemas and juices, Nora did not go to apublic school, but had home schooling. She also spent a greatdeal of time with coffee enemas on the bathroom floor. Sheused this time constructively: she read all the classics shecould get her hands on, then she read Plato and otherphilosophers, then she went on to read science books andmath. She got a tremendous education. When she took herSAT's, she scored extremely high; on her State equivalencytest her score was almost perfect. With all her backgroundand reading, she also became an excellent writer. At the end of her intensive Therapy, she had anothercheck-up with her neurosurgeon. He took some pictures,studied them, was puzzled, hesitated, took some more pictures- and finally said that he couldn't see any more tumor, justa shadow which he felt was a scar. Nora's mother asked whatNora's prognosis was. The surgeon said that she would neverhave a problem again! Nora was also playing the violin. Thedoctor was very pleased that she could play the violin andthis was a very good sign, since the type of tumor she wassuffering from would affect the fine motor skills. He saidthat she would not be able to play the violin with a tumor inher brain, these delicate motor skills would have beendisturbed. After one and a half years on the strict Therapy, Noraswitched to a maintenance therapy: she was still taking 2 - 3quarts of juice daily and eating organic food. Her motherstarted an organic co-op business, helping to supply herselfand a number of other people in the area with organic food.Mary K. says that she is now helping some 40 people to obtaintheir organic produce. Nora is 19 years old, and has beenadmitted to college. Not only that, but she obtained aPresidential Scholarship, a very high honor, and hopes tostudy medicine - alternative medicine - to help others as shewas helped. return to The Gerson Institute homepage.

About four years ago, he found that he had colon cancer, spreading (metastases) to the liver. Since he is a professor of medicine, he was very much aware of the fact that orthodox medicine (surgery or chemotherapy) has nothing to offer patients with this problem. He found Dr. Max Gerson's book, A Cancer Therapy, which was translated into Japanese some 5 years ago. Using this book, he treated and cured himself completely. It is now some four years later, and he remains in good health, 'cured' (by his own claim in the article). Australian Nelly Goldfeld had essentially the same problem. It began with colon cancer four years ago, and was treated with surgery for the removal of the tumor. But, since the tumor is just 'the tip of the iceberg', and removing it doesn't clear the underlying problem, the cancer almost always recurs. It recurred in Nelly's case, in her liver. Like Professor Hochino, she vowed to beat this cancer, even though her doctors gave her little hope of survival. They told Nelly that they could try 'experimental' laser treatment, with little chance of effectiveness. Nelly then learned about the Gerson Therapy. A newspaper report in Doncaster and Templestowe News, an Australian newspaper, on October 5, 1994 tells Nelly's story. She started the Gerson Therapy on Feb. 14th, 'stocking her house full of fresh fruit and vegetables, vitamin supplements, a juicer and water purifier.' We quote from the above newspaper story: "Nelly still remembers the bewildered look on her doctor's face when she went to have an ultrasound just ten days after taking up the diet. They were astounded. The doctor said to me: 'Well it seems you've scared them off, Mrs. Goldfeld.' Three of the cancerous lesions had completely disappeared, and the fourth had substantially decreased in size." "Seven months later, Nelly has returned to being the rosy-cheeked grandmother she once was. She believes she has fulfilled her vow to rid her body of cancer. "It's not easy, but I have my life. For the first two months, I was too weak to do all he work myself, so we got someone in to help us. But after that, I got so much energy and was able to do everything myself. "Nelly's claims are backed up by her medical reports, which show a rapid improvement in her health from the time of her ultrasound. 'My case is not exceptional. There are hundreds like me. I just hope people read about this (Gerson) Therapy before they go and have chemical or radiation treatment.' " Dr. Lorraine Day We had the great pleasure of meeting Dr. Lorraine Day at the annual convention of the Cancer Control Society in September of 1994. At that time, Dr. Day told her story. She had developed breast cancer, but recovered after refusing mutilating surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Most impressive was her statement that she rejected "traditional" therapies because she studied the medical literature - which proved to her that these treatments are ineffective! Why are patients not given this information, available to professionals? Dr. Day says she came to the common sense conclusion that "you cannot destroy the immune system and get well at the same time." She discovered nutritional healing, the Gerson Therapy, and says: "CANCER DOESN'T SCARE ME ANYMORE!" Dr. Lorraine Day has the courage to defy orthodox medicine by getting up before the entire audience of the Cancer Control Society and testifying, as follows: "I am Dr. Lorraine Day. Some of you know me from the book I wrote: AIDS What the Government Isn't Telling You. Several years ago, I actually spoke here about AIDS. I have been coming to the Cancer Control Society meetings regularly for three years and I have learned more about medicine and how to take care of yourself than I learned in 20 years as an orthodox trauma surgeon. I knew nothing about nutrition as a medical doctor. In the four years of medical school, you don't have one single hour of information on nutrition. I have talked about that and admitted that I, in the past, have told patients that their nutrition has really nothing to do with their health. I was ignorant, I was stupid as many orthodox medical doctors are. Fortunately, I found out what was really going on in the health field by coming to the Cancer Control Society, and I started speaking out about it, studying it and actually had a radio show called "Truth Serum" where I was interviewing many alternative doctors. In the middle of that, I found out that I had breast cancer. I had infiltrating ductal carcinoma and it was spreading through my breast. I went to my first doctor to have the lump taken out. At that time I did not know it was cancer. He refused to take care of me unless I had pre-operative chemotherapy. Even though I told him that I was a physician, and that I would sign any papers releasing him from any legal liability - but that I didn't want chemotherapy. I just wanted the lump taken out and diagnosed. He said, No. His reputation was at stake. So, I walked out of his office realizing that the law considers it acceptable for a physician to abandon a patient if the patient refuses the doctor's prescription. So I went to a former resident colleague, who is a breast cancer surgeon. He took the lump out but he couldn't get all the cancer. He said, 'You have to have your breast removed.' I refused. Then he said, 'If you don't have your breast removed, you must have radiation therapy.' Once again, I declined. Then he said, 'You must have chemotherapy or some other kind of treatment to destroy these cancer cells.' I told him, 'No. I brought you a whole stack of books, if you really want to learn about cancer. Read these books. I won't have any of the orthodox treatments just take the lump out.' He said that he could not get all the cancer. I said, 'Fine. Everybody gets cancer all the time. My body can take care of that!' I immediately went home and called up Marilyn Barnes, whom you just heard earlier. (Marilyn Barnes had just previously testified to her total recovery, now over 14 years, from stage 4 melanoma as well as carcinoma in situ - cervical cancer on the Gerson Therapy.) [Marilyn] came to my house and set me up. She taught a woman I hired how to do the Gerson Therapy. The Gerson Therapy was going to be the basis of my treatment. I started the juices, the enemas, the whole business. In fact, I looked at cancer as a great adventure. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to take all the different alternatives, but I tried as many as I could. But the Gerson Diet is the basis of all my treatment. I am fine. I am healthy. I don't have any evidence of cancer. It has only been close to a year, but I have absolute confidence that I'll be well and healthy for many, many years to come." Dr. Lorraine Day has impressive credentials. She is an internationally acclaimed orthopedic trauma surgeon and author. She was for 15 years on the faculty of the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine as Associate Professor and Vice Chairman of the Department of Orthopedics. She was also Chief of Orthopedic Surgery at San Francisco General Hospital and is recognized world-wide as an AIDS expert. She has been invited to lecture extensively throughout the U.S. and the world; appeared on numerous radio and television shows, including 60 Minutes, Nightline, CNN Crossfire, Oprah Winfrey, and Larry King Live. NOTE: With both a Japanese and an American Professor of Medicine rejecting orthodox treatments for their cancers and curing themselves using the Gerson Therapy, we now see two examples of highly placed medical professionals who are willing to speak out publicly and report their recoveries on alternative cancer treatments. There have been other doctors who used the Gerson Therapy and cured themselves but who would not allow us to use their names, nor did they permit us to refer Gerson Therapy patients to them.WT01-B06-176IA043-000790-B012-382http://www.gerson.org:80/articles.html 207.158.196.67 19970118063400 text/html 1374HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Sat, 18 Jan 1997 06:33:40 GMTServer: Apache/1.2b4Connection: closeContent-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Tue, 24 Sep 1996 19:38:00 GMTETag: "4583e3-46d-32483898"Content-Length: 1133Accept-Ranges: bytes Gerson Healing Newsletter Gerson Healing Newsletter We publish selected articles of wide interest from the Gerson HealingNewsletter in this space.

In a nation that prides itselfon keeping statistics about every conceivable economic activity, it is remarkablethat there is no reliable data on the extent of homelessness. Everyone agrees that homelessness started a dramatic increase in the1970s and 1980s. Republican Jack Kemp, former chairman of the InteragencyCouncil on the Homeless said, "Today's homelessness started to become a highlyvisible and recognized problem in many cities in the late 1970s and early1980s." In the 1950s and 1960s seeing a homeless person was indeed a rarity.Now it seems you trip over them even in the best of neighborhoods. Who are the homeless? Three-quarters of the homeless are single men.Nearly half of them are veterans. Most of these vets were once productiveblue-collar workers who were laid off either by "downsizing" or because ofthe relocation of plants overseas. Homelessness is next to joblessness and both are caused by our massivetrade deficits. In the early 1970s we did not have a trade deficit--ourexports and imports were nearly equal. We also did not have a massivehomelessness problem. And then the floodgates opened. Until 1973 we didnot trade with China at all. We had a small trade deficit with Japan thenas the first waves of Toyotas, Hondas and Datsuns were invading our shoresin small battalions. The vast rise in our trade deficit is mirrored by an alarming risein the homeless population. Now families are joining shelters where onlymales used to flee. It used to be that an American with a high school degreecould get a decent job with a predictable future and buy a decent home. Now, alarmingly, home ownership is declining for the first time in Americanhistory. Many of us are only one paycheck away from poverty and from losingour homes or apartments. Ten thousand Americans are losing their homes toforeclosure every month and many times that number are thrown out onto thestreets by court-ordered evictions. Homelessness is one of the hidden costs of the trade wars. When Americanconsumers buy cheap Chinese shoes, Malaysian clothing and Taiwanese electronicswe are also buying unemployment and homelessness in America. Besides losingjobs and homes, we lose tax revenues and drain our unemployment funds. Whydo you think that we have had federal budget deficits for the last two decades? Because we are losing our tax base. Incomes have not increased in twentyyears, they have actually declined. We are the only major nation to sufferthis fate, so I do not blame international trade alone. I blame the Americangovernment and the trade negotiators for getting us bad trade agreementsand by failing to enforce our own trade and tariff laws. For example, federal law provides that imported trucks are subjectto a 25% duty. Cars are subject to a duty of only 2.5%. The Japan lobbyhas succeeded in having Toyota, Mazda, Nissan and Izusu trucks and minivansclassified as cars for duty purposes, but as trucks for safety and otherpurposes. The British-made Range Rover pulled the Shetland wool over somebody'seyes when it convinced the feds that its $60,000 off-road vehicles were trucksin order to escape the luxury tax, but were cars to escape the truck duty. It should be the other way around--Rovers are certainly luxury vehiclesand should be taxed as such, and they are trucks for duty purposes. EachRover should bring the federal government $10,000 or more in revenues butbrings in only about $1,000. When Range Rovers cost a mere $40,000, MurphyBrown said it more sense to buy a Ford Explorer and strap $20,000 in cashto the hood--you would get the same effect. By circumventing import duties these imported trucks not only costAmerican jobs they cost the U.S. treasury $1.2 billion dollars annually. I estimate that we could build 30,000 homes for the homeless (at $40,000each) with these revenues. This in turn would create tens of thousands ofjobs for plumbers, carpenters, masons and others. Foreign corporations have found countless ways for dodging Americantaxes. Japanese and European corporations set up importing subsidiariesin this country: Toyota of America, Mercedes Benz of North America and soforth. Most of these foreign corporations pay little or no income tax inthe United States. They do this slight-of-hand trick by claiming that theymake no income here by overcharging their own subsidiaries. Their accountantsmiraculously transfer profits back to Tokyo or Munich or London. The InternalRevenue Service has tried unsuccessfully to go after these companies becausemany Japanese parent corporations refuse to turn over documents to the U.S.government. President Clinton promised to close this gaping loophole, buthas not done so thus far. This loophole costs American taxpayers tens ofbillions of dollars every year, strengthens our trade opponents and makesbalancing the U.S. budget that much harder. Without changing our laws, just by enforcing existing laws, we canturn the trade war around. The symptoms of our trade deficits are everywhereto be found. Next time you see a homeless person, let him inspire you towrite your congressman or the president and strengthen your desire to buyonly American products. Most homeless people are casualties of our tradewars and should be constant reminders that we are in a battle for economicsurvival.

Though doctors recommend eating fruitsand vegetables, few would recommend that young children work in hot fieldspicking and packing them. Yet thousands of children pick oranges in Mexicoand Brazil, tomatoes in Mexico and raspberries in Guatemala. These fruitsand vegetables are widely available at your neighborhood grocery store, butare not usually marked with their country of origin. Brazilian and Mexican orange juice is pouring into many juice productsthat appear to be American. A number of American companies hide their importedjuices, including those made from oranges picked by children, in juices madefrom concentrate. Tropicana fresh juices are made by adults in Florida, whileTropicana orange juice from concentrate contains oranges picked by childrenin Brazil and Mexico. Similarly, FloridaGold orange juice from concentratecontains Brazilian juice, squeezed from the labor out of young children. A complaint was filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concerningFloridaGold orange juice's deception of consumers about its country of origin.But the FDA didn't think mislabeling of orange juice was a matter of publicimportance and has allowed the complaint to languish. But consider this: According to the United States Department of Labor,children picking and boxing oranges in Brazil are paid $3.00 for workinga 14-hour day, or 21 cents per hour. Tomatoes from Mexico are allowed tocontain the unhealthy pesticide DDT, though the United States banned theuse of DDT on tomatoes and other agricultural products more than ten yearsago. While the federal government warns Americans not to eat fresh fruitsand vegetables in Mexico, and South and Central America, this same produceis sold at grocery stores across the United States. Not only are many agricultural imports picked by children, they may alsobe tainted with dangerous parasites and bacteria. Recently the source ofcyclosporin was traced by the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) toraspberries grown in Guatemala. Because of cyclosporin infections from theseraspberries more than 850 Americans became ill, suffering from severe diarrhea.The CDC points to contamination in the water in Guatemala as the likely sourcefor this infection. This jibes with the State Department's warning to travelersin Central and South America to avoid eating fruits and vegetables from allthese countries except Chile, Argentina and Uruguay. The State Departmentwarns: "Diarrhea caused by contaminated food or water is potentiallyserious." The unsafe and unsanitary working conditions under which young childrenare laboring can be hazardous to their health and to your own health. Bothyour conscience and your stomach should be wary of consuming fresh produceand juices from Mexico, Central and South America. If the government warns you not to drink the water or eat fresh fruitsand vegetables when you travel to Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil, shouldn'tconsumers be warned to avoid the very same fruits and vegetables when importedinto the United States? At a minimum, the federal government should requirethat grocery stores label fruits and vegetables with their country of originso that consumer are fairly warned and can avoid possibly disease-ladenproduce. In addition, many of the contaminated raspberries from Guatemala werepicked by children. But it not the children that make these berries dangerous,it's the unsanitary conditions under which they are grown. Often sanitationis rudimentary. Outhouses are near the fields and many illnesses are spreadby these unhygienic conditions. The related problems of child labor and unsafe produce needs to be attackedon several levels. First of all, Congress should pass a law banning theimportation of products made by children under the age of 15. CongressmanChris Smith (R. N.J.) has recently introduced this legislation (H.R. 3812)which would enact this ban. This bill has been sponsored by six members ofCongress, three Democrats and three Republicans. Secondly, federal law should require the clear labelling of all producefor its country of origin. No legislation is currently being considered torequire this consumer notification, but consumer groups are now working onvarious proposals. Write to your Congressman and Senator voicing your approvalof the legislation which prohibits the importation of products made by children.Support legislation requiring country of origin information on fresh fruitsand vegetables. And drink your orange juice fresh squeezed. If you want to make a difference, then check outH.R.2602, a bill before Congress which requires country of origin labellingon all produce. Then contact your representative in Congress. Made in theUSA Foundation |MUSA Reports |American Products |Donations MUSA Opinions |Bumper Stickers |C.A.U.S.E.

Statement of Purpose Letter to the NFL Owners List and addresses of NFL Owners There's nothing better than cool autumn Sundays spent watching professional football at the stadium or in the comfort of your own living room. Everyone has their favorite team. Maybe you grew up outside of Philadelphia and are a diehard Eagles fan. Or maybe you had a favorite player like Unitas, or Starr, or Bradshaw who seemed to carry their entire team on their back, and so their team became your team. And maybe you have that old jersey your father gave you, the jersey that made you proud to be associated with that player or team, and with football in general. But one thing has changed. Now when you go to give your son or daughter a t-shirt or hat bearing their favorite team's logo look at the label. Where you might expect to find the words "Made in the USA," you now see "Made in China" or "Made in Bangladesh." Professional football has become this country's most popular sport, and its atheletes make more money than many Americans could hope to spend in a lifetime. Players and owners like Deion Sanders and Art Modell tell us that football has become a business, and what matters is the bottom line. We at the Made in the USA Foundation believe in a different conception of football. We still see it as a "sport" which brings families and friends together, encouraging friendly rivalries and spirited good times. Many of football's most loyal fans, however, are hard-working individuals our country's manufacturing sector. Yet as more and more manufacturing is shipped overseas, these men and women rightfully fear losing their jobs. So we at the Made in the USA Foundation call on the NFL's owners to re-evaluate their priorities, and bring the production of their goods back to the United States. Please copy or print out the letter below and send it to your team's owner. The fans can make a difference. Dear Football is truly an all-American sport. As you know, Wilson still makes the official NFL football in Ada, Ohio in the heartland of the country. As a supporter of the Made in the USA Foundation, I would like to encourage teams and the NFL to have more souvenirs and equipment manufactured in the United States. We want you to join us as well. A large majority of NFL fans like myself want to buy U.S.-made products. But by importing NFL-logo products, the National Football League and its teams are turning off the fans, the lifeblood of the sport. These fans now are refusing to buy imported souvenirs and have become irritated by the lack of choice. I believe that it is in the owners' long-term interests to keep fans supportive and enthusiastic. For every player who makes it to the NFL there are literally thousands who don't make the grade. Unfortunately, many of these athletes are unemployed or are employed in low-wage jobs. In this tough job market we need to keep Americans working at productive jobs. The backbone of our economy has always been manufacturing. Making NFL-logo products in the USA will not by itself turn the economy around, but it is an important symbolic step to creating jobs in the United States. Please help us convince the league that NFL licensed and authorized products should be required to be made in the USA. Sincerely, NFL OWNERS Mr. WilliamV. Bidwell President Arizona Cardinals 8701 S.

American consumers, and consumers from around the world,have the right to know. The European Commission recently proposed that certain food productswere so closely associated with geographical locations that the names wouldbe protected and no one outside of that nation or region could use the name. Just last month the European Commission proposed 318 protected namesincluding: Prosciutto di Parma (Italy), Roquefort cheese (France), Fontinacheese (Italy), Stilton cheese (England), Newcastle Brown Ale (England) andFeta cheese (Greece). The European Commission stated that it is unfaircompetition for producers outside of these regions to use geographical namesassociated with particular products. We at the Made in the USA Foundationwholeheartedly agree. We similarly don't want Florida orange juice to come from any otherplace. We want Idaho potatoes from Idaho, Long Island duckling from LongIsland and Vermont maple syrup from Vermont. Maple Grove Farms of Vermontsells maple syrup that may be from Vermont or maybe from Canada. The labelis clearly deceptive. There is a case pending before the courts in the United States aboutSwiss Army knives that are made in China. I don't believe that the SwissArmy has ever left that country, and most certainly never made it to China. Most Americans would assume that a Swiss Army knife was made in Switzerland. Switzerland is known for its skill in making precision instruments. The Made in the USA Foundation supports the Swiss manufacturer in its claimthat Swiss Army knives can only be made in Switzerland. Similarly, Americans and others would assume that Milwaukee toolsare made in Milwaukee, that Virginia hams come from Virginia and that Rockportshoes come from Rockport. Milwaukee tools are indeed made in Wisconsin andVirginia pigs are the source of Virginia hams, but Rockport shoes are madeelsewhere. Similarly L.A. Gear shoes are not made in Los Angeles, althoughmost consumers would believe that L.A. Gear products are made in SouthernCalifornia. American cities, states and regions deserve the same respectas those in Europe--if a manufacturer wants to use an American geographicalname it must manufacture the product here. The liquor industry has protected regional product names for manyyears. Scotch whiskey can only come from Scotland and Bourbon can only bemade in Kentucky. Turning to clothing, many manufacturers virtually wrap themselvesin the American flag, which they have imported from the Pacific rim. PerryEllis flaunts his "America Series" of imported clothing. If something iscalled "American," then it should come from America. And if not, the labelshould certainly state in large letters, as large as the reference to America,that the product is made elsewhere. Tommy Hilfiger similarly promotes hisAmerican style clothing, but few know that his "American" products areimported. Perry Ellis and Tommy Hilfiger often use the American flag in theirdesigns. Use of the American flag conveys the message that the product isAmerican-made. But often, if the shopper notices the microscopic countryof origin label, he or she may notice that the product is an import. Likea geographic reference, use of an American flag denotes country of origin. How about American flags themselves? In 1994, 850,000 U.S. flagswere imported, mostly from Taiwan and China. In your recommendations toCongress the Foundation proposes that the importation of American flags beprohibited. Similarly, clothing and other articles which include an Americanflag, such as pins, buttons, hats and so forth, should be included in theprohibition. I challenge any Member of Congress to vote against thisproposal. When a product uses the name American it implies manufacture in thiscountry. "American Classic" shoes, especially when dressed up in red andwhite stripes and white stars on a blue background, shouts out: "Made inthe USA." But quietly such products whisper in 6 point type: "Made in China." This is clearly a deceptive country of origin marking. In fact, Icannot conceive of a more deceptive label or package. What does made in the USA mean? Before the Federal Trade Commissionwe proposed that Made in the USA means 75% U.S. content (parts and labortogether) on a cost of goods sold basis with final assembly in the UnitedStates. A lesser standard of 50% was proposed for the label "Assembled inthe USA." The Foundation also believes that "Made in Italy" or "Made in Japan"should meet those same high standards. Now, I understand that shoes cancarry the "Made in Italy" label when the uppers are made in Romania and thesoles come from Taiwan. Only the final assembly was done in Italy. Thisis blatantly unfair to American consumers and competitors. "Made in Italy"on a pair of shoes means quality to many consumers. A fair label for thesehypothetical shoes may be "Uppers Made in Romania, Soles Made in Taiwan,Final Assembly in Italy." Similarly, a VCR can now carry a "Made in Japan" label that was onlyassembled in that country. For example, all of the parts may have come fromTaiwan (40%), Malaysia (30%) and Hong Kong (15%). If that is the case thelabel should fairly read: "Components made in Taiwan, Malaysia and Hong Kong,Final Assembly in Japan." The order on the label should be in descendingorder of where most of the content came from. Computers are truly an international product. No computer that Iam aware of comes 100% from any one country. This is one type of productthat should have a more precise label. In the United States, the Foundationproposed similar requirements for automobile labeling which (with one amendment)became the American Automobile Labeling Act. Every new car sold in the UnitedStates is required to include a label which states the U.S. and Canadiancontent, where the engine was made, where the transmission was made and wherefinal assembly took place. The Foundation proposes that computers be labeled as follows: 1. Country with most content: _____% (e.g. Japanese Content X%or U.S. Content X%) 2. Monitor made in ______________. 3. Mouse made in _______________. 4. Keyboard made in ____________. 5. Central Processing Unit made in ___________. 6. Final assembly in _______________________. In summary, the Made in the USA Foundation wants consumers to be informedaccurately about the country of origin. Information necessary for simpleitems is different than that needed for a car or a computer. And the labelshould be accessible. To the dismay of many store employees, I have turnedVCRs and computers upside down to find a country of origin label. These labels should be on the front of the product or on the pricesticker. No label should leave any doubt. Don't allow manufacturers orimporters to say: "may contain contents from the following countries." Thisis not a country of origin label--it is per se an unfair and deceptive practicethat is rampant. I would like to thank the Commission for providing me withanopportunity to present the views of the Made in the USA Foundation.

Knight started Nikein the 1960s with a $500 investment and is now worth $4.5 billion becauseof his successful, ruthless strong-arm tactics. He has built his massiveempire on worker exploitation and child labor, coupled with massive payoffsto superstars like Michael Jordan to pimp for his products. Nike has paidoff the U.S. Olympic Committee, major colleges and their coaches, and well-knownplayers and celebrities to solicit impressionable children to buy its products.Nike bought Michael Jordan for $20 million, but its hundred-million dollarCosa Nostra spokesmodels include Andre Agassi, Spike Lee, Pete Sampras, DennisRodman and the Dallas Cowboys. Nike was named one of the worst ten corporations in the world by theMultinational Monitor, but it is far worse than a bad corporate citizen.It is corrupt and corrupting our youth and the nation. While ten-year-oldsmade Nike products for peanuts in the Third World, teenagers in this countryare shooting each other for their Nike shoes. The Nike Mafia operates primarily in those countries that tolerateworker exploitation and bribery, including South Korea, Indonesia, Pakistan,China, and Vietnam. The Progressive said "Labor in Indonesia is cheap, afterall- so cheap that it costs an employer less to hire uniformed goons to roughup would-be labor activists than to negotiate." When labor got too expensivein Korea, Nike picked up and left, continuing to use its Korean thugs torun operations in Indonesia. This allows Nike to deny hiring child laborand operating sweat shops by saying, "We just don't do it- the Koreans ownthe plant." Even Nike apologist Donald Katz, who wrote a puff piece on the companycalled "Just Do It" explained the Nike system: "Management by terror andbrowbeating led to strikes by Indonesian workers who were fed up with formerSouth Korean Tiger Division types yelling at them. It was suggested thatsome of the authoritarian managers from Pussan might have been acting outfrustrations with Korean line workers whose demands for better pay were chasingthe domestic shoe scene away. 'They yell at us when we don't make the productionquotas and if we talk back they cut our wages,' one female line worker atan Indonesian factory making Nikes told a reporter for the Far Eastern EconomicReview." Sweltering in 90 degree heat, a young female worker named Eni dabspaint on the soles of freshly moulded shoes. Presses thump at a deafeningpace while glue and rubber burns young lungs. But the Nike advertisementposted on the wall next to her admonishes, "Just Do It." Eni said, "If wemade a mistake, they call us dogs and prostitutes and sometimes they hitus." Workers in Indonesia have protested the abominable working conditions,exhausting overtime, and child labor. When they complain, Nike's henchmanhave the workers fired. Of course these practices are illegal in the UnitedStates, but Nike does little production work where workers have rights. Evenin Indonesia, Nike has lost a court case when it fired protesting workers.One major case against Nike's lieutenants is now before the Indonesian SupremeCourt. The Nike College mafia is corrupting our universities and students.Nike buys college coaches, like Georgetown's John Thompson, who requireshis amateur players to wear Nike shoes. Other colleges have done the same,shilling for Nike, intoxicating impressionable youngsters into believingthat wearing Nikes is the key to an NBA or college basketball future. TheU.S. Olympic Committee prostituted itself by selling Nike the right to callitself an Olympic sponsor. The USOC sells sponsorships to the highestbidder, working conditions be damned. The Olympic Committee prays to thealtar of the almighty dollar without regard to where a company makes itsproducts. Nike is a hollow company, much the way that the Mafia is hollow. Neitheractually produces anything. They both use their money and muscle to takewhat others have made by the sweat of their brow. Nike has others make shoesfor it in Indonesia and elsewhere for $5. These same shoes retail for $100or more. This is not unlike the Mafia buying illegal drugs and marking themup by 2000%. Street value for shoes bears a striking similarity to streetvalue for crack cocaine. For inner city kids they are the only games intown. A few brave souls have stood up to the Nike Mafia. One of those ismy nominee for hero of the year: Joseph Tam. Tam grew up in Hong Kong whereas a child he made little plastic flowers and plastic Christmas trees ina sweatshop. Now Tam is a member of the Portland, Oregon School Board. Whenhe learned that Nike was using six-year old Pakistani children to stitchsoccer balls for six cents an hour, he told Nike that he didn't want their$500,000 contribution. "I asked myself," he said, "Nike contributed thismoney so my children can have a better education, but at whose expense? Atthe expense of children who work for six cents an hour? Children were beatenand branded. One child only wanted to see his mother." Nike, in order to counter the bad press it is getting for using sweatshopsand child labor, set up a phoney organization called PLAY: Participate inthe Lives of American Youth. The only way Nike participates in the livesof American youth is buying millions of dollars in ads targeted to childrento buy their overpriced, overrated sneakers. Nike will keep doing it to us until we do it to them. The only wayto do it to Nike is to Just Say No. Like Joseph Tam did. Don't take dirtymoney from Nike and don't buy their products.

The U.S. charges a relatively small duty- 13 cents a case- on importedbeer. Other nations charge a great deal more. For example, Holland, Germanyand England charge U.S. companies $2.93 a case to export beer into theircountries. China charges U.S. exporters an extraordinary duty of $14 a case.For years, our Canadian neighbor refused to allow U.S. beer to be sold inits provinces. Wine duties are similarly discriminatory against Americanproducts. So every time you order or purchase beer or wine, think about the unfairtreatment U.S. brewers receive overseas and choose American. Great (and Good) American Beers One of the most exciting developments in the U.S. beer industry hasbeen the arrival within the past 10 years of several dozen so-called"micro-breweries," most of which are wholeheartedly devoted to producingquality beers that can compete with the top offerings from Germany, Holland,England, Ireland and Belgium. Many of these micro-breweries make their beers under contract withalready existing breweries. Once the brand is established, however, manyof these initially mom-and-pop operations graduate to their own facilities.Indeed, two of the finest producers, Boston Brewing Co., the producer ofSam Adams beers, and New Amsterdam Beer started as contract breweries, buthave since opened up their own breweries. Like the rest of the world's beers, American beers can be divided intotwo major types. Bottom fermenting beers, which include the familiar pilsener,ambers and bocks, are made from yeasts that settle to the bottom duringfermentation. Top fermenting beers, which include ales, porters and stouts,are made from floating yeasts and tend to be fuller and heartier and deepercolored than bottom fermenters. Though there are vast numbers of American beers worth trying, the followingis my list of standouts, in order of quality. (The type of beer and locationof brewing are indicated in parentheses.) 1) Samuel Adams Boston Lager (amber, Massachusetts) 2) Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (ale) 3) Anchor Steam Beer (amber, California) 4) Collin County Pure Gold (pilsener, Texas) 5) Boulder Extra Pale Ale (ale, Colorado) 6) Collin County Black Gold (boch, Texas) 7) Sierra Nevada Summerfest (amber, California) 8) Kessler Bock (bock, Montana) 10) Boulder Porter (porter, Colorado) 11) Dock Street Beer (Philadelphia) 12) New Amsterdam (amber, New York) 13) Sierra Nevada Stout (stout, California) 14) Kessler Lorelei (pilsener, Montana) 15) Cold Spring Export (pilsener, Minnesota) 16) Anchor Porter (porter, California) 17) Rhomberg Classic Pale Ale (ale, Iowa) Mass market American beers, most of which are heavily advertised, arewell-made and consistent, though they tend toward uniformity. Among the larger volume producers, here are the standouts: Auschenberger (Wisconsin) Erlanger's (owned by Strohs) Stroh's Signature Michelob (Anheuser-Busch)WT01-B06-192IA062-000358-B021-296http://www.madeusa.org:80/govt.htm 207.30.43.49 19970112021845 text/html 1811HTTP/1.0 200 OKServer: Purveyor/v1.2.3 Windows NTMIME-version: 1.0Content-type: text/htmlDate: Sun, 12 Jan 1997 02:09:34 GMTLast-modified: Monday, 21-Oct-96 18:55:18 GMTContent-length: 1606 Government Government Agenda Make a difference!

Free trade is a myth that fuels politicaldebate and drains the U.S. economy. In order for there to be real free (andfair) trade in the world, all nations must agree to certain ground rules. During the past half-century, the United States has developed a set ofrules for factories and workers, establishing a high standard of living,good environmental and occupational safety and health laws, minimum wagesand maximum hours of work. We fought a devastating war to stop slavery. But all of our standards are being undermined by trading "freely" with nationsthat don't have a high regard for human rights, disregard the rights of childrenand scorn the rights of workers. For example, we can't have free trade with a nation that has slavelabor. Or child labor. Similarly, we can't have free trade with a nationthat discriminates against the importation of American products. The GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade purports to be the international ground rulesfor free trade, but it is nothing of the kind. It not only allows childlabor, but actually prohibits nations from banning the importation of goodsmade by 10 year olds. I have been called a protectionist for opposing unlimited free trade. We must protect the values that we have developed over the last fifty yearsand if this is protectionism, I wear that label with pride. However, Ibelieve that we should trade with other nations, so long as the trade istruly free. In order to have real free trade we must have free workers,not child laborers. Henry Ford said that he paid his workers well so thatthey could afford to buy his products. Similarly, we want foreign workersto be paid well so that they can afford to purchase fine American products. Here is the Free Trade Bill of Rights, which should serve as a standardfor other nations seeking to trade with the United States. As the world'sleading manufacturer, and the only superpower, we should flex our muscles,using access to the largest consumer market as leverage for making the playingfield level. Article One. Democracy. The right of the people to votein elections for their representative government shall not be infringed. [Workers in totalitarian nations, like China, are not free workers.] Article Two. Freedom of Speech and Assembly. The right ofthe people to speak freely and to assemble shall not be infringed. Thisarticle includes the right to advertise products for sale and to compareproducts in these advertisements. [Many countries, including Germany, prohibitcertain comparative ads.] Article Three. Prohibition of Child Labor. Children underthe age of fifteen shall have the right to an education and be free fromcoerced labor. [There are two hundred million children under the age of15 "employed" around the world, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Braziland many other nations. Many of these children are sold into slavery andchained to machines.] Article Four. Prohibition of Slave Labor. No person shallbe forced to work or sold into slavery. Prison labor shall be permitted,however, the export of goods made by prison laborers shall be prohibited. [China uses prison labor for exports, including political prisoners] Article Five. Trade Unions Protected. Free and unfetteredtrade unions shall be protected to the fullest extent of the law. All personsshall be allowed to join the trade union of their choice and shall not beretaliated against for joining a union or for soliciting others to join orto form a trade union. Article Six. Environmental Protection. Emissions from factoriesand agricultural chemicals shall be controlled to the maximum extent possible. Environmental laws of the United States shall be the international standard,but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards. [Pesticides,such as DDT which is banned in the United States, are now imported on Mexicantomatoes.] Article Seven. Worker Safety and Health. The safety and healthof workers shall be protected to the maximum extent possible. The occupationalsafety and health laws of the United States shall be the international standard,but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards. Article Eight. Minimum Wages and Maximum Hours. Factory andagricultural workers shall be entitled to reasonable wages, in no event lessthan one-fourth of the hourly minimum wage in the United States. [This meansthat manufacturing wages will rise in the Third World to $1 per hour or more,giving these workers the ability to buy American products. Now workers inNike plants in Indonesia, for example, are paid 14 cents per hour and cannotafford to buy the shoes that they produce.] No worker shall be compelled to work more than forty-eight hours perweek. [The United States adopted the 40-hour work week decades ago, whileGermany and France have even shorter work weeks.] Article Nine. Barriers to Trade. No nation shall discriminateagainst imports from the United States nor impose other barriers to trade. [Most nations impose more trade barriers than the United States. Many nationshave more favorable trade rules for other nations than for the United Statescausing tariffs and duties that discriminate against American goods.] Article Ten. Illicit Trade Prohibited. Nations shall nottrade illicit drugs, poisonous chemicals or materials capable of being usedin nuclear weapons or in chemical or biological weapons. [When an outlawnation provides others with deadly materials, the United States and othernations have every right to ban trade with that country. Currently, Chinahas been caught by the CIA with selling nuclear equipment to Pakistan. Thisprovision would allow the United States to punish China with tradesanctions.] When someone asks you about Free Trade, be prepared with tough questionsabout slave labor, child labor and human rights. Free trade only works ifeveryone plays by the same rules.

What We Stand For What C.A.U.S.E. is Doing Board of Advisors Membership Form Child Labor Around the World Recently your Mom or Dad bought you a new soccer ball. There is a goodchance that the ball was made by someone younger than yourself. Fully halfof the soccer balls sold in the United States are made in Pakistan, and everyone of those soccer balls had an assist from a child under 14 who toils 10hours a day in subhuman sweatshops, stitching the ball or cutting materialused to make it. This is not an isolated problem. More than 200 million children worldwide,some as young as four and five years old, are slaves to the production line.Most of these children work in Asia, especially the nations of India, Pakistan,Bangladesh and Indonesia, but Latin America is guilty of this human rightsabuse as well. India alone employs 50 million children between the ages of10 and 14. These unfortunate children manufacture shoes, matches, clothing, rugsand countless other products that are flooding the American market and drivinghard-working Americans out of jobs. More than 60 years ago the United Statesbanned child labor, sweatshops, long workdays and workweeks. But now we aresubsidizing, encouraging and failing to criticize the enslavement of youngpeople in the Third World. Indian and Pakistani rug makers love child workers so much that theybuythem. That's right, children are bought and sold for cash or for the settlementof a debt. Iqbal Masih was sold into slavery when he was only four yearsold. His Pakistani parents, desperate for money, sold their young son forless than $16. For six years he was shackled to a carpet-weaving loom mostof the time, tying tiny knots 10 hours a day. Carpetmakers like the young weavers because their tiny fingers canmakevery tight knots, and also because they are cheap to own and maintain. Masihwas a free person by the age of 12 and crusaded against the horrors of childlabor. In November 1994 Iqbal spoke out on the abysmal conditions in thesweat shops of Pakistan at the international labor conference in Stockholm,Sweden. The next month, he was given a Youth Action award in Boston. Shockingly,in March 1995 he was shot and killed in his village in Pakistan while ridinghis bicycle. Eshan Khan, chairman of the Bonded Labor Front, a group fightingchild labor, said, "We know his death was a conspiracy by the carpet mafia." Only a boycott by the United States and other nations will have anyimpacton slave-based industries like the rug manufacturers. Nike similarly basesits operations on finding the lowest-cost labor to make its athletic shoes.Twelve-year-old girls work in Indonesian sweatshops 70 hours a week makingNikes in unhealthy plants that reek of glue. Blue jeans and cheap clothingmade in Bangladesh wind up on the shelves of American shops like K-Mart andWal-Mart.The United States needs to take a leadership role in eradicatingchild labor around the globe. Child labor is a human rights issue. What is more of a human rightthangrowing up a free person, attending school without being shackled to medievalmachinery? Please remember every time you go shopping and see a label thatsays made in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia or Indonesia, thata 10-year-old prisoner of a feudal manufacturer probably contributed hisor her labor to that product.Don't buy it. Tell the store why you won't buyclothing and other products from these backward nations. Tell your Senator,Congressman and presidential candidates that we should oppose the cruelestabuse of human rights: child labor. What is the Children Against Underage Servitude andEmployment(C.A.U.S.E.) ? C.A.U.S.E. is a group of American children who are opposed to theexploitationof children in Third World countries. We believe that children should bein school, not in factories. We believe that poor countries can only escapefrom their poverty by education of their children. Child labor only continuesthe cycle of poverty. The basic premise of C.A.U.S.E. is that strong and effective actionmustbe taken to reduce child labor around the world. What We Stand For Consumers have a right to know if products are manufactured by children.This information should be prominently displayed on the product itself, onthe package and in product advertising. C.A.U.S.E. fights to expose child labor whereever itexists. C.A.U.S.E. organizes boycotts against companies that use childlabor. C.A.U.S.E. educates teachers, parents, children and governmentofficialsabout the evils of child labor by producing books, pamphlets, films and othermaterials to show how children are being exploited. C.A.U.S.E. fights to prohibit the United States and other countriesfromimported products made by children under the age of sixteen. What C.A.U.S.E. is Doing C.A.U.S.E.'s primary activity has been to educate the public with books,press conferences, press releases, advertising and media appearances. Education. C.A.U.S.E. provides educational materialsabout child laboraround the world. Legislation. We support legislation to prohibit theimportationofproducts made by children. Consumer Action. C.A.U.S.E. exposes products made bychildrenand urgesconsumers to avoid purchasing these products: Shoes and Apparel. Many leather shoes made in Brazilaremade by children,as is clothing from Honduras, India, Pakistan and Bengladesh. Athletic Equipment. Athletic shoes made by Nike and othercompanies inIndonesia are made by children. Soccer balls are made by children in Pakistan.Soccer balls made by Wilson in China are made by adults. Carpets and Rugs. Most carpets and rugs from India, Pakistanand Bengladeshare made by childen. Orange Juice. Children pick and squeeze oranges in Brazil,some of whichis sold in the United States as "FloridaGold" Orange Juice.

The demands ofthe Olympic Committee for multi-million dollar up-front payments and guaranteeshas virtually assured that most U.S. Olympic souvenirs are imported fromlow-wage countries, and from countries where child labor is rampant. J.C. Penney and Champion are the official suppliers of Olympic T-shirts,jackets and hats. Together they paid about $40 million to the U.S. OlympicCommittee, a handsome fee which will be used to pay for the Atlanta Games. It is a disgrace to see excellent American manufacturers like Champion forcedto go overseas. But these massive payments have forced these suppliers toshop for the cheapest sources around the globe in order to have a profitmargin large enough to offset the Olympic-class royalties. And the cheapestsources of labor are often children working in sweatshops in Latin Americaand Asia. The vendors of Olympic products are not doing as well as planned. The vendors in Atlanta and around the United States are complaining thatconsumers are not buying the overpriced Olympic wares. Apparently, shortsighted manufacturers and retailers assumed that itdoesn't matter where these products are made. But fully 40% of the Americanconsumers will not buy imported clothing. The percentage may even be higherfor sales of patriotic paraphernalia such as U.S. Olympic hats and jackets. The U.S. Olympic Committee shares in both the revenue and the blamefor consumers reluctance to buy U.S. Olympic hats for $16 that are made inTaiwan. The U.S. Olympic Committee could require products using the Olympicsymbols to be made in the USA. But it will take an act of Congress to makesure the next round of Olympic souvenirs are made in the USA. The current Olympic law, 36 U.S.C. 380, is printed on official Olympiclabels and appears in television commercials. Under that law the U.S. OlympicCommittee has the authority to set product standards and can require productswearing the U.S. Olympic Committee label to be made in the USA. But the Committee has only used its authority to accept the highestbid for sponsorship. The Made in the USA Foundation is drafting legislationthat would require sponsors of the U.S. Olympic Teams to be Americanmanufacturers or service providers. This will end embarrassments such asthe Japanese-made Suburu being the official car of the U.S. Ski Team. While the U.S. Olympic Committee urges consumers to "buy the realthing," its activities have virtually insured that the "real thing" is madeis a Third World country. The official Olympic T-shirt sold at J.C. Penneyfor $16 and $17 is made by Champion but stitched in Costa Rica. The U.S.Department of Labor confirms that there are many child laborers in CostaRica. Olympic pants ($24) and Olympic jacket ($35), under the J.C. Penneylabel, are made in Malaysia. U.S. Department of Labor investigators havebeen to Malaysia documenting child labor in many industries. Another Olympic jacket under the Penney label is made in Hong Kong. The USA Olympic hat with five Olympic rings that is made in Taiwan sellsfor $16 at Penney's. Thirty-eight members of Congress wrote to the OlympicCommittee complaining that adidas soccerballs to be used in the Atlanta Gameswere made by young children in Pakistan. The bipartisan group led by CongressmanJoseph Kennedy II wrote "The Olympics represents the ultimate accomplishmentof a young athlete--it should NOT use a soccer ball which represents theultimate repression of children across the globe." Olympics used to be about sports, about world-class amateur athletesfrom around the world competing for the honor of the sport. I am tired ofseeing exploitation of the Olympics by Reebok and Nike and other commercialinterests. And Nike isn't even an official sponsor of the Atlanta Games. It supplies shoes and outfits to many runners and other athletes. Nikebuilt a Niketown in the middle of the Atlanta Games complex so that itsomnipresent "Swoosh" gives the appearance of being Olympic. Take a look at what countries are doing well at the games. CostaRica, Taiwan and Malaysia, three large U.S. Olympic product suppliers, arelow on Olympic gold, silver and bronze, but have taken Olympic green awayfrom deserving U.S. suppliers of hats and shirts. The best way to send a message to these Olympic charlatans is to justsay no. Don't buy U.S. Olympic products that are imports. Write yourcongressman and tell him or her that there oughta be a law that requiresU.S. Olympic sponsors to make their souvenirs in the United States. TheAtlanta Games were supposed to be America's Games. We should support thereal home team, the American workers, who against all odds continue to maketop-quality products in the United States.

While their hamburgers are made withAll-American beef, their Happy Meals usually include a plastic toy that ismade in China. Most Americans consider McDonald's to be as American as applepie, but as the company drifts farther from the vision of its Founding Father,Roy Kroc, it becomes less and less patriotic. One of these days the corporatebean counters will start importing beef from Argentina and Roy Kroc willturn over in his grave. Sadly, Kroc's beliefs died with him at age 82 in 1984. Roy Kroc believedin America and in making his products "All-American." He proudly requiredthat all McDonald's hamburgers contain only U.S. beef and that they be labeled"Made in the USA." McDonald's obviously imports the Happy Meal's little plastic piecesto make its arches more golden. But McDonald's Kroc said "If you justwork for the money, you'll never make it, but if you love what you're doingand you always put customers first, success will be yours." Most McDonald'scustomers don't want imported items surreptitiously slipped into their lunchboxes. By doing so, McDonald's is force feeding America involuntaryimports. Surely, McDonald's customers would pay an extra nickel to get a trueAll-American Happy Meal. Though the Happy Meal is just an "All-AmericanMeal" (hamburger or cheeseburger, fries and a drink) with a ten cent importedtoy. Let's just call it an "Un-American Meal." Last month China became the number one country in terms of a tradeimbalance with the United States, surpassing Japan. Remarkably, the UnitedStates does not use its economic leverage against China to promote democracyor oppose its abysmal human rights record. In addition, China has a vastnetwork of more than 1,000 prison camps where political prisoners and otherinmates manufacture products for export. These prison factories make plastictoys, games, and hundreds of other products that wind up on the shelves ofToys-R-Us and Wal-Mart, and could very well make it into your Happy Mealcontainer. "Involuntary imports" are products that the purchasers believe aremade in the USA, thought they are actually manufactured overseas. McDonald'sis not the only company to blame for these involuntary imports. The smalltoys found in Happy Meals, guaranteed to last 24 hours before breaking, arecommissioned by Disney, Tonka, the Flintstones, Barbie, Cabbage Patch andAnimaniacs. While all of these toys were originally created in the UnitedStates, none of them are made here now. When Sears or Wal-Mart fails to make American products available ontheir shelves, they also make us involuntary importers. When you go intoJ.C. Penney's or Macy's or Nordstrom to buy an American shirt, only to findthat none are available, and you are reluctantly forced to buy an import,you make an involuntary purchasing decision. When you buy a pair of Nikeshoes without realizing they were made overseas, you areinvoluntarily buyingan import. There are many fine, inexpensive American products that would makeexcellent Happy Meal companions. For example, Crayola crayons with a coloringbook, a small Little Tikes toy and baseball cards are three examplesthatare Made in the USA. In fact, baseball cards would probably create morerepeat customers than many current Happy Meal trinkets, with youngsterstrying to get their favorite players. So the next time you walk into a McDonald's, wake up and smell thecoffee. Don't buy a Happy Meal. Write to McDonald's at Kroc Drive, OakBrook, Illinois 60521 and tell them that you want your Happy Meals to bemade in the USA. Or send McDonald's an e-mail at mcdfct@ibm.net. Roy Krocwould be proud of you.

Neitherplan helps small businesses. I am proposing a tax reform plan that makesAmerican companies more competitive, reduces paperwork and helps those earningless than $30,000 per year. It does all of these without increasing thebudget deficit. At the same time it also provides an increase in the minimumwage without increasing unemployment. It may sound impossible, or evenmagical--I call it "trickle up economics." My proposal is quite simple: modify the social securitytax by creating an exemption and eliminating the ceiling. Currently, socialsecurity taxes (FICA and medicare) are the most regressive taxes we have. For someone earning $15,000 per year the social security tax bite is a whopping$2,245, half paid by the employee and half by the employer. I propose thatthe first $15,000 of income be exempt from social security and medicare taxes,for both workers and employers. According to the Tax Foundation (a non-profitthink tank that studies taxation issues), this exemption will cost the U.S.treasury $40 billion, while pumping $20 billion into the hands of those needingit most, plus another $20 billion into their employer's pockets. Social security and medicare taxes currently are imposedonly on the first $60,600 of wages. Those earning one million dollars peryear pay no more in social security taxes than a taxpayer earning $75,000annually. This tax ceiling is illogical and unfair. These taxes are notbased on benefits, they are based on the ability to pay. And a multimillionairecan certainly afford to pay more than a working man earning $75,000 a year. Even Steve Forbes' flat tax did not have a ceiling. (Myproposal is a flat tax, and if Republicans like flat taxes they should endorseending the ceiling on social security taxes.) By eliminating the ceilingon wages subject to social security taxes, the Tax Foundation estimates thatwe will raise $64 billion in new revenues. This no doubt could be calledRobin Hood tax reform: taking from the rich and giving to the poor. The$24 billion surplus can either be retained by the treasury to reduce thefederal deficit, or it can be spread around as a benefit to those earningless than $30,000 per year. This tax reform will also end the "nanny tax" problem forthose employing child-care workers at home: if a nanny is paid less than$15,000 per year (and most are) she (or he) will get more take-home pay andher employer will save money and not be required to file quarterly and annualtax forms. In the real world, where American factories compete withthose in Mexico and Korea, this reform will make the United States much morecompetitive. Take, for example, an assembly worker paid $7.50 to put electronicproducts together. He or she now makes $15,000 in gross salary, and netsseveral thousand dollars less because of taxes, including a substantial socialsecurity tax bite of $1,122.50, nearly $100 a month. The employee will getan immediate raise in take-home pay. At the same time, the employer willsave an equal amount for each employee. With 100 employees, a tidy $100,000will be added to the employer's bottom line. The employer will thus improveits profitability and be more likely to keep its plant in the United Statesopen for business. Who else will this reform benefit? Students are often paidunder $7.50 per hour. Restaurant workers, many in the textile industry andin general those in semi-skilled occupations will benefit. Those earningmore than $60,000 per year will pay more social security taxes, but eventhe rich will benefit by saving taxes (and paperwork) for their nannies,servants and chauffeurs. And if they own a business, the rich will benefitfrom the new exemption. This change will give America what it needs, a raise,at no cost to the economy.

Fully half of the soccer balls sold in the United Statesare made in Pakistan, and every one of those soccer balls had an assist froma child under 14 who toils 10 hours a day in subhuman sweatshops, stitchingthe ball or cutting material used to make it. This is not an isolated problem. More than 200 million childrenworldwide, some as young as four and five years old, are slaves to the productionline. Most of these children work in Asia, especially the nations of India,Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia, but Latin America is guilty of this humanrights abuse as well. India alone employs 50 million children under ages10-14. These unfortunate children manufacture shoes, matches, clothing, rugsand countless other products that are flooding the American market and drivinghard-working Americans out of jobs. More than 60 years ago the United States banned child labor,sweatshops, long workdays and workweeks. But now we are subsidizing, encouragingand failing to criticize the enslavement of young people in the Third World.The so-called 'Third Wave,' boosted by President Clinton and House SpeakerNewt Gingrich in the form of GATT and the World Trade Organization, prohibitsmember nations like the United States from discriminating against the importationof goods made by children. Indian and Pakistani rug makers love child workers so muchthat they buy them. That's right, children are bought and sold for cash orin settlement of a debt. Iqbal Masih was sold into slavery when he was onlyfour years old. His Pakistani parents, desperate for money, sold their youngson for less than $16. For six years he was shackled to a carpet-weavingloom most of the time, tying tiny knots for 10 hours every day. Carpetmakerslike the young weavers because their small fingers can make very tight knots,and also because they are cheap to own and maintain. Masih was a free person by the age of 12 and crusaded againstthe horrors of child labor. In November 1994 Iqbal spoke on the abysmalconditions in the sweat shops of Pakistan at an international labor conferencein Stockholm, Sweden. The next month, he was given a Youth Action award inBoston. Shockingly, in March 1995 he was gunned down in his village in Pakistanwhile riding his bicycle. Eshan Khan, chairman of the Bonded Labor Front,a group fighting child labor, said, "We know his death was a conspiracy bythe carpet mafia." While Pakistan has laws against child labor and slavery,the government has taken very little action to combat it. Only a boycottby the United States and other nations will have any impact on slave-basedindustries like the rug manufacturers. Nike similarly bases its operations on finding the lowest-costlabor to make its athletic shoes. Twelve-year-old girls work in Indonesiansweatshops 70 hours a week making Nikes in unhealthy plants that reek ofglue. Blue jeans and cheap clothing made in Bangladesh wind up on the shelvesof American shops like K-Mart and Wal-Mart. The United States needs to take a leadership role in eradicatingchild labor around the globe. If we are pounished for violating GATT fordoing so, let us confront it head on. Child labor is a human rights issue.What is more of a human right than growing up a free person, attending schoolwithout being shackeld to medieval machinery? Please remember every time you go shopping and see a labelthat says made in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia or Indonesia,that a 10-year-old prisoner of a feudal manufacturer probably contributedhis or her labor to that product. Don't buy it. Tell the store why you won't buy clothingand other products from these backward nations. Tell your Senator, Congressmanand presidential candidates that we should oppose the cruelest abuse of humanrights: child labor. And then buy the American-made alternative. It willmake you feel better about yourself and your fellow workers and send theworld and urgently needed message.

Do you remember during the NAFTA debates when President Clinton andVice President Gore said that if NAFTA was a failure we could get out ofit easily? Well, by all accounts NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement,has been an abysmal failure. At the same time, President Clinton also predictedthat the "peso would become stronger if NAFTA passes." In reality the Mexicanpeso has taken a bath and so has the American economy. Before NAFTA we had a modest trade surplus with Mexico. NAFTA wentinto effect in 1994. During 1995 we ran a $20 billion deficit with our friendssouth of the border. This represents a loss of 460,000 American jobs. Northof the border in Canada the problem is just as bad, another $20 billion deficit,another half million jobs down the tube. While we might not have heard thegiant sucking sound that Ross Perot predicted, the silent draining of high-payingmanufacturing jobs is just as deadly to the American economy. Even economists who predicted job gains from NAFTA are now predictingmassive job losses. Gary Hufbauer, an economist with the International EconomicsInstitute, whose predictions of job gains were embraced by the ClintonAdministration, now has flip-flopped, predicting a net loss of 225,000jobs. The Clinton Administration boldly states that NAFTA created 340,000"good" American jobs. However, the government fails to broadcast the factthat Mexican imports have cost us 800,000 good American jobs, a net lossof nearly half a million. By only counting job gains and not deducting joblosses, the Administration is cooking the books: it is like only countingdeposits in your checking account and failing to deduct the checks writtenon the account. The United States Department of Labor has received 644 petitions forassistance from factories closed by NAFTA, one plant per day since January1994. Briggs and Stratton laid off 2,000 workers in Wisconsin and replacedthem with Mexican workers. Fruit of the Loom replaced 3,200 employees. The not-so-Jolly Green Giant fired 1,200 Californians and replaced them withlow-wage workers south of the border. More than 100,000 Texas have lostjobs due to NAFTA, driving home the fact that Ross Perot was right. A bipartisan group of 52 Congressmen, including 34 Democrats, introduceda bill called the NAFTA Accountability Act, which would pave the way forwithdrawal from NAFTA. This bill provides for the renegotiation of the tradeagreement if the trade deficit persists and other conditions have not beenmet. President Clinton has already backtracked on NAFTA by standing firmagainst the use of Mexican trucks and drivers in California, Arizona, NewMexico and Texas. Among the other hidden problems with the trade agreement,it provided that starting January 1, 1996 Mexican trucks and drivers couldenter the United States freely, even though their vehicles did not meetenvironmental, safety and health standards. The drivers of these huge trucksare not even required to be able to read American road signs. We were better off before NAFTA. Do we ever learn from our mistakes? In addition to the staggering trade deficit with Mexico and Canada, NAFTAopened our southern border to more drug trafficking. One of the consequencesof the trade agreement at your local supermarket is a flood of tempting redripe tomatoes from Mexico. Beware of these attractive produce--they areTrojan tomatoes, tainted with the pesticide DDT. While the United Statesprohibits the use of DDT, Mexico doesn't. NAFTA undermines our living standards as well as our environmental,safety and health laws. The trade agreement exports good manufacturing jobsand does very little positive for America. Now is the time to dump NAFTAand bring jobs back to the United States. Let's get out before it is toolate.

Yes, of course, China is a big market witha billion potential consumers. But, getting down to the nitty-gritty, Chinadoes not make anything that we really need. Trading with China has injuredAmerica greatly, costing 700,000 well-paying jobs, harming hard-workingAmericans. And to add insult to this painful injury, China has been kickingus where it hurts most. The more we trade with China, the more contemptthat it has for the United States and for human rights. As China flexes its political muscles, threatening to invade Taiwan,ignoring human rights and selling weapons of mass destruction to Pakistanand other countries, the United States must respond by tightening traderestrictions. Last year China imprisoned Harry Wu, an American citizen whohad spent 19 years in Chinese labor camps. It is from these very prisonlabor camps that China has been exporting products. Wu was granted admissionto China. After entering the country was arrested for espionage and faceda possible death sentence. The death penalty is a serious risk in Chinawhere more than 1,000 "criminals" were executed last year. In its very essence "trade" means that we get something of value inexchange for our products. Trade is a two-way street. But trade with Chinahas not been a two-way venture. We sold China $11.7 billion worth of productsin 1995, but bought a whopping $45.6 billion worth, leaving us a massive$34 billion deficit, second only to the trade deficit which we have withJapan. Back in the good old days of 1970 we did not trade with China at all. Quian Qichen, the Chinese Foreign Minister, said recently, "For twenty-threeyears before Richard Nixon opened the door of relations between China andthe United States there was no trade. I think you lived quite well. Andso did we." This is only half true. We lived quite well 23 years ago, infact in many ways better than we do now, but the Chinese did not. China'sper capita income has blossomed in the past two decades while ours has declined. In 1973 the United States did not have a trade imbalance with the restof the world. We were in fact on top of the world, with an improving standardof living, low unemployment and a very low federal budget deficit. We really don't get anything of lasting value from China. We purchasedtwo million military-style assault weapons from China in 1993. These productshave a negative value to American consumers. I recently noticed that afterplaying at a video arcade my children were "awarded" whoopee cushions thatwere manufactured in China. Whoopee cushions, like assault rifles, havea negative value. We can live better lives without these useless products. Other Chinese products are no better. Most, if not all, of theChinese-made toys are virtually guaranteed to self-destruct within 48-hoursof purchase. Just look at the broken toys around your house and you'll seewhere they are made. Then look at the ones that have lasted for years: Little Tikes, Lionel Trains, Tinker Toys, and you'll realize that the toyswith lasting value are made in the USA, or Europe. Or take Chinese crayons. Millions of Chinese crayons have been recalled because of lead contamination. Chinese crayons are cheaper than American-made Crayola's, but at whatcost? With workers paid fifty cents per hour or less it is not surprisingthat the Chinese produce clothing cheaper than we do. Not better, cheaper. Would you rather have one well-made American shirt, or two poorly made Chineseones? I would rather have one made in the USA employing well-paid Americanworkers. Fully half of our shoes are made in China. Reeboks, Nikes, all thosehighly advertised American-sounding brands made many of their shoes in China,paying workers twenty-five cents an hour. But remarkably, these shoes donot sell for less than those made in the USA. Why do we grant Most Favored Nation (MFN) status to China and nottrade at all with Cuba? President Clinton made the mistake of granting MFNto China and "delinked" this status from their human rights record. By doingthis Clinton gave the Chinese the wrong signal, and China has used that signas a green light to clamp down on dissenters, arrest Harry Wu and sell nuclearmaterials to Pakistan. China does not deserve MFN status and we should revoke it immediately. Yes, this may provoke a trade war with China. So what? Since trade withChina harms the United States, a trade war would do little harm here, butwould be devastating to China. I understand that Boeing and a few othermajor U.S. companies would be harmed by a trade battle with China, but whatabout the 700,000 net jobs lost to Chinese imports? When human rights and democratic reforms are instituted in China,we will see a dramatic increase in the wages paid to Chinese workers. Whenworkers in China are paid a reasonable wage, we will see our deficit withthat country dramatically reduced. We must be prepared to fight by increasingtariffs and be prepared to battle the other symptoms of Chinese Trade Syndrome. Otherwise, our children will not have jobs and we will buy most of our goodsfrom dictatorial Third World nations, making the United States itself athird-class nation unable to help the developing democracies of the world.

Stop the Presses! Stop the Presses! The International Trade Commissionhas ruled that Mitsubishi violated U.S. trade laws by selling eight massivenewspaper printing presses to the Washington Post at millions of dollarsbelow cost. This process is known as dumping, and dumping is intended todrive competitors out of business. The target of Mitsubishi's dumping campaign,Rockwell, is an American company based in Illinois, which manufacturescompetitive printing equipment in the United States. The Washington Postacknowledges the high quality of the Rockwell presses, but still chose theMitsubishi equipment primarily because of its impossibly-low price. It is important to note that the International Trade Commission isno agency of protectionism. In fact, the ITC often bends over backwardsto make sure the rights of foreign producers are protected and recently ruledthat Mexican tomatoes were not being dumped into the United States. Thus,when the ITC finds that a company dumped products in the United States, weshould take notice. Now is the time to reconsider the decision to buy Mitsubishi printingpresses. The International Trade Commission's unanimous decision that Mitsubishiis dumping these presses demonstrates that the sale was neither fairly norlegally negotiated. If the Washington Post cares at all about America'sfuture, it should immediately cancel its contract with Mitsubishi to buy$250 million worth of printing equipment. Since a contract in violationof U.S. law is legally cancelable, the Washington Post should take the properaction and not aid and abet companies that willfully violate U.S. laws. Mitsubishi's tactics follow a precedent that Japanese companies setin the 1970s when they dumped televisions in the United States, driving allAmerican television manufacturers out of business. Zenith, the lastAmerican-owned company to manufacture television in the United States, stoodalone against the Japanese onslaught, but was eventually driven out of themarket. We have to stop these illegal practices before they destroy anotherAmerican industry. For Japan international trade is war. For the United States tradenegotiation is a game that its lawyers play- if they play nicely, they maybe hired to represent the Japanese after they retire from the government. Far too many U.S. trade negotiators have become traitors, negotiating onbehalf of foreign clients soon after leaving their U.S. government jobs. Mitsubishi has a long history of corporate piracy and militaryinterventionism. A recent example of Mitsubishi's corporate piracy involvesFusion Systems, a small American high-tech company. According to the HarvardBusiness Review, Fusion invented a high-intensity ultraviolet lamp that ispowered by microwaves. Fusion's microwave lamps are state-of-the art andare used in the printing process and in the production of microchips. Fusionbegan selling its products in Japan in 1975. Mitsubishi bought one in 1977and had it delivered directly to its research and development lab whereMitsubishi claimed it as its own in multiple patent filings in Japan. Thisprocess is called theft. Mitsubishi has a favored place in the history of Japan's militaryoperations. When the Japanese emperor launched a military conquest of Taiwanin 1874, Mitsubishi was chosen to provide the ships. After Japan invadedChina in 1937, Mitsubishi was required to provide the military and occupationforces with warships, aircraft, vehicles, weapons and provisions. DuringWorld War II Mitsubishi Heavy Industries manufactured 18,000 warplanes, includingthe feared "Zero," which was often used in kamikaze or suicide attacks whenthe pilot crashed his plane into American warships. After World War II General Douglas MacArthur ordered that the Mitsubishikeiretsu (cartel) be broken up. Now, more than forty companies carry theMitsubishi name and three-diamond logo and are superficially separate. TheMitsubishi keiretsu, which includes Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (manufacturersof the disputed printing presses) and Mitsubishi Motors, has been re-establishedand is now the largest corporate empire in the world. Like suicide missions of its Zero fighters in World War II, the Mitsubishiprinting press sale to the Washington Post is a kamikaze mission. TheInternational Trade Commission found that Mitsubishi is selling the massivepresses far below cost. The International Trade Commission ruled that apunitive tariff of 63% must be paid on these presses, and under Mitsubishi'scontract with the Washington Post, Mitsubishi shoulders this burden. In itsquest to dominate the newspaper printing press business, Mitsubishi is preparedto sacrifice hundreds of millions of dollars. Do we want Mitsubishi, or any foreign company, to control the printingpresses for American newspapers? Do we want the Washington Post or the NewYork Times to be held hostage to Mitsubishi when the newspaper needs spareparts? The Washington Post created compelling history by standing up to PresidentRichard Nixon about Watergate and the Pentagon Papers. The Post knows thedifference between right and wrong and is not afraid to take on powerfulopposition. I, therefore, call upon the Washington Post to do the rightthing- cancel the Mitsubishi contract and buy the superior American-madeprinting presses.

Although the companyoriginally produced arch supports and orthopedic shoes, in the mid-1950sNew Balance began to work with runners to manufacture custom-made runningshoes. In 1976, New Balance introduced the M320 running shoe, whichwas named the number one shoe on the market by Runners World magazine.New Balance has been in the top ranks of the athletic shoe industryever since. As recently as 1991, a German trade magazine ranked New Balance shoesabove Asics, Etonic, Karfu, Nike, Reebok, Converse, Lotto and Adidas- allimports. Clearly, New Balance quality is recognized the world over.In fact, in 1991 alone, New Balance exported over 1 million pairs ofits athletic shoes to Japan. New Balance is especially noted for its superior product design. Forinstance, it was the first company to offer width sizing in athletic shoesand today remains the only major manufacturer to offer it. New Balance manufactures a complete line of athletic shoes for menand women, including running, court, cross court, basketball (men only),hiking and walking shoes. New Balance walking shoes are one of the company's newest product linesand are expected to be the company's second-largest category after runningshoes. These walking shoes are made almost exclusively in the U.S.and are a high-quality alternative to all-imported Rockports. Although most New Balance shoes are made in the Boston area or Maine,about 15 percent are imported, so check the labels on these shoes. Theysell between $45 and $60 and are available in shoe, sporting and departmentstores and through the L. L. Bean catalogue. Allen Edmonds Dress Shoes Allen-Edmonds Shoe Corporation of Port Washington, Wisconsin,started making shoes in 1922, when Elbert Allen helped revolutionize theshoe industry by manufacturing shoes without the traditional nails and stiffsteel shank. Over the years, the company changed both ownership andfocus many times. Today the company is owned by president John Stollenwerkand 19 employees who saved the company from an out-of-state buyout and possibleoffshore production in 1989. The company is also the proud manufacturerof some of the finest handcrafted dress shoes in the world. Allen-Edmonds shoes show up on some of the most famous feet that readthe globe- including former President George Bush's. These fine shoesare exported to 33 countries and received the U.S. Commerce Deprtment's "E"award for exporting. Allen-Edmonds even export to Japan- thanks inpart to Stollenwerk's brazen decision to crash a 1987 Tokyo footwear tradeshow that had denied the company a trade booth. Allen-Edmonds shoes are top quality, classic style dress shoes forboth men and women. The men's shoes are hand-made from the finestlightweight, supple and breathable leathers and feature the largest arrayof sizes in the world (size AAAA to EEE and 5 to 18). The shoes alsofeature the flexibility of a shankless stitched welt design, the comfortand breathability of all-leather soles, and a foot-conforming cork insole.The materials and design combine to create an extremely comfortableshoe. Because they are among the best of the best, these shoes carrya fairly hefty price tag. The average cost of a pair of Allen-Edmunds'men's shoes is $230, but can go as high as $1,500. Originally a manufacturer of men's shoes only, Allen-Edmonds beganoffering women's dress shoes in 1989. These include classic style,low-heel dress shoes and boots made from the best calfskin, suedes, chamoisand exotic leathers available. There are 25 different models, includingslip-on, buckle and tie dress shoes as well as more casual yet fashionableboots and demiboots. Although much of its shoe leather is imported, Allen-Edmonds manufacturesevery single pair of its shoes in Port Washington and Lake Church, Wisconsin,with the help of 400 employees. Allen-Edmonds shoes can be found atquality department and shoe stores nationwide.

Who We Are The Homeless: Another Casualty in the Trade Wars We Are Aiding and Abetting Child Slavery Let's Give America a Raise Testimony on Country of Origin Labels New Bumper Stickers Made in the USA on the Internet Spring Newsletter Can Hathaway Shirtmakers be Saved? One hundred and fifty-nine years ago C. F. Hathaway opened a shirt factoryin Waterville, Maine. It is the oldest shirt factory in the United States.While it may be old on the outside, it is state-of-the art efficiency onthe inside. In 1960 apparel conglomerate Warnaco bought Hathaway. Now, 49 year-oldLinda Wachner, CEO of the Warnaco, announced that Hathaway will be closeddown. It sounds like the same old story that we have heard time and timeagain of ineffecient American plants being put out of business by foreigncompetition. But Hathaway is very efficient and has been getting more so. In Januaryof 1995 it cost Hathaway $124.53 to produce a dozen shirts, or a little morethan $10 each. Not bad for shirts that retail for $50 or more. However, CornellUniversity Professor Peter Lazes worked with the plant to make it even moreefficient. And, as of March, 1996, the cost to make a dozen shirts fell to$62.89, or $5.24 each. At the same time, with a slightly reduced work force,the plant produced 36,612 shirts per week, up from 21,828 per week, andastounding 68% increase in productivity. Wachner visited the plant in January, 1995 and promised workers that shewould not close the plant if quality work continued and the cost of a shirtcame down. From our point of view, and from a legal perspective as well,Wachner and Warnaco breached its agreement with the 500 workers at the Watervilleplant. They cut costs considerably and are now told that they are being cutloose by the company. Warnaco has refused to give details of the profitability of the plant.It claims that Hathaway loses money, which it may, because Warnaco has notadvertised the Hathaway brand for six years. Remember those old eye-patchcommercials with celebrities wearing their Hathaway dress shirts? At the same time that she is effectively firing 500 mostly female workers,Mrs. Wachner is earning $10 million a year, unbelievably more than the entireworkforce at the Hathaway factory. The average employee in Waterville makesabout $15,000 per year. Made in the USA Foundation is working to help the employees at Hathawaybuy the plant. It is working with union, financial, politicians and otherleaders to find the right combination to make Hathaway a viable companyagain. If Hathaway shirts were available at retail outlets, consumers would buythem. Warnaco wounded Hathaway, but lets hope that it lets the plant continuein business.

Joseph Dr. Jules Pagano Nick Nichols Wayne Doran Why Buy American Products? Many of you are familiar with Made in the USA advertising and the importanceof buying goods produced by American workers. Not only does the Made in theUSA label ensure that jobs are kept in the United States, but it also hasproven an effective marketing strategy for businesses. Buying American benefits both workers and corporations, instilling a pridein U.S. citizens about our economy and our manufacturing processes. We atthe Made in the USA Foundation hope to raise public awareness about qualityAmerican goods and the obstacles that our companies face competing in a globaleconomy. What is the Made in the USA Foundation? The Made in the USA Foundation (MUSA) was formed in 1989 by a coalitionof individuals, trade unions and corporations who were concerned about Americancompetitiveness and economic leadership. MUSA is now a 60,000 member independentand non-partisan organization which has been approved by the Internal RevenueService as a non-profit foundation. Donations to MUSA are tax-deductible. The basic premise of the Foundation is that strong and effective actionmust be taken to reduce American reliance on imports, to increase purchasesof U.S. products domestically and overseas and to ensure that the standardsof fair trade are applied evenly around the world. What Does the Foundation Stand For? Consumers have a right to know where products are manufactured. This information should appear on product labels and in product advertising. American environmental and worker safety laws should not be undermined by imports which do not meet these standards. Reciprocity is the benchmark for all bilateral trade. We should not allow foreign countries to do in this country what our companies are prohibited from doing in theirs. Foreign companies that dump products in the United States below manufacturing costs should be dealt with firmly. Foreign government subsidies of manufactured and agricultural products should be aggressively opposed. Foreign products produced by child labor, slave or prison labor should be banned from the United States. Foreign barriers to American products should be attacked aggressively. The Foundation supports promoting American-made products in the USA andabroad through advertising and public relations efforts.

In a nation that prides itselfon keeping statistics about every conceivable economic activity, it is remarkablethat there is no reliable data on the extent of homelessness. Everyone agrees that homelessness started a dramatic increase in the 1970sand 1980s. Republican Jack Kemp, former chairman of the Interagency Councilon the Homeless said, "Today's homelessness started to become a highly visibleand recognized problem in many cities in the late 1970s and early 1980s."In the 1950s and 1960s seeing a homeless person was indeed a rarity. Nowit seems you trip over them even in the best of neighborhoods. Who are the homeless? Three-quarters of the homeless are single men. Nearlyhalf of them are veterans. Most of these vets were once productive blue-collarworkers who were laid off either by "downsizing" or because of the relocationof plants overseas. Homelessness is next to joblessness and both are caused by our massivetrade deficits. In the early 1970s we did not have a trade deficitÅourexports and imports were nearly equal. We also did not have a massivehomelessness problem. And then the floodgates opened. Until 1973 we did nottrade with China at all. We had a small trade deficit with Japan then asthe first waves of Toyotas, Hondas and Datsuns were invading our shores insmall battalions. The vast rise in our trade deficit is mirrored by an alarming rise inthe homeless population. Now families are joining shelters where only malesused to flee. It used to be that an American with a high school degree couldget a decent job with a predictable future and buy a decent home. Now,alarmingly, home ownership is declining for the first time in American history.Many of us are only one paycheck away from poverty and from losing our homesor apartments. Ten thousand Americans are losing their homes to foreclosureevery month and many times that number are thrown out onto the streets bycourt-ordered evictions. Homelessness is one of the hidden costs of the trade wars. When Americanconsumers buy cheap Chinese shoes, Malaysian clothing and Taiwanese electronicswe are also buying unemployment and homelessness in America. Besides losingjobs and homes, we lose tax revenues and drain our unemployment funds. Whydo you think that we have had federal budget deficits for the last two decades?Because we are losing our tax base. Incomes have not increased in twentyyears, they have actually declined. We are the only major nation to sufferthis fate, so I do not blame international trade alone. I blame the Americangovernment and the trade negotiators for getting us bad trade agreementsand by failing to enforce our own trade and tariff laws. For example, federal law provides that imported trucks are subject toa 25% duty. Cars are subject to a duty of only 2.5%. The Japan lobby hassucceeded in having Toyota, Mazda, Nissan and Izusu trucks and minivansclassified as cars for duty purposes, but as trucks for safety and otherpurposes. The British-made Range Rover pulled the Shetland wool over somebody'seyes when it convinced the feds that its $60,000 off-road vehicles were trucksin order to escape the luxury tax, but were cars to escape the truck duty.It should be the other way around- Rovers are certainly luxury vehicles andshould be taxed as such, and they are trucks for duty purposes. Each Rovershould bring the federal government $10,000 or more in revenues but bringsin only about $1,000. When Range Rovers cost a mere $40,000, Murphy Brownsaid it made more sense to buy a Ford Explorer and strap $20,000 in cashto the hood- you would get the same effect. By circumventing import duties these imported trucks not only cost Americanjobs they cost the U.S. treasury $1.2 billion dollars annually. I estimatethat we could build 30,000 homes for the homeless (at $40,000 each) withthese revenues. This in turn would create tens of thousands of jobs for plumbers,carpenters, masons and others. Foreign corporations have found countless ways for dodging American taxes.Japanese and European corporations set up importing subsidiaries in thiscountry: Toyota of America, Mercedes Benz of North America and so forth.Most of these foreign corporations pay little or no income tax in the UnitedStates. They do this slight-of-hand trick by claiming that they make no incomehere by overcharging their own subsidiaries. Their accountants miraculouslytransfer profits back to Tokyo or Munich or London. The Internal RevenueService has tried unsuccessfully to go after these companies because manyJapanese parent corporations refuse to turn over documents to the U.S.government. President Clinton promised to close this gaping loophole, buthas not done so thus far. This loophole costs American taxpayers tens ofbillions of dollars every year, strengthens our trade opponents and makesbalancing the U.S. budget that much harder. We should deny most favored nation status to China- it doesn't deserveit and trading with China costs several hundred thousand jobs. The symptomsof our trade deficits are everywhere to be found. Next time you see a homelessperson, let him inspire you to write your congressman or the president andstrengthen your desire to buy only American products. Most homeless peopleare casualties of our trade wars and should be constant reminders that weare in a battle for economic survival. Without changing our laws, just by enforcing existing laws, we can turnthe trade war around. We Are Aiding and Abetting Child Slavery Recently you bought your son or daughter a new soccer ball. There is agood chance that the ball was made by someone your child's age or even younger.Fully half of the soccer balls sold in the United States are made in Pakistan(some sold as Nike products), and every one of those soccer balls had anassist from a child under 14 who toils 10 hours a day in subhuman sweatshops,stitching the ball or cutting material used to make it. This is not an isolated problem. More than 200 million children worldwide,some as young as four and five years old, are slaves to the production line.Most of these children work in Asia, especially the nations of India, Pakistan,Bangladesh and Indonesia, but Latin America is guilty of this human rightsabuse as well. India alone employs 50 million children between the ages of10 and 14. These unfortunate children manufacture shoes, matches, clothing, rugsand countless other products that are flooding the American market and drivinghard-working Americans out of jobs. More than 60 years ago the United States banned child labor, sweatshops,long workdays and workweeks. But now we are subsidizing, encouraging andfailing to criticize the enslavement of young people in the Third World.The so-called 'Third Wave", boosted by President Clinton and House SpeakerNewt Gingrich in the form of GATT and the World Trade Organization prohibitsmember nations like the United States from discriminating against the importationof goods made by children. Indian and Pakistani rug makers love child workers so much that they buythem. That's right, children are bought and sold for cash or for the settlementof a debt. Iqbal Masih was sold into slavery when he was only four yearsold. His Pakistani parents, desperate for money, sold their young son forless than $16. For six years he was shackled to a carpet-weaving loom mostof the time, tying tiny knots 10 hours a day. Carpetmakers like the youngweavers because their tiny fingers can make very tight knots, and also becausethey are cheap to own and maintain. Masih was a free person by the age of12 and crusaded against the horrors of child labor. In November 1994 Iqbalspoke on the abysmal conditions in the sweat shops of Pakistan at theinternational labor conference in Stockholm, Sweden. The next month, he wasgiven a Youth Action award in Boston. Shockingly, in March 1995 he was gunneddown in his village in Pakistan while riding his bicycle. Eshan Khan, chairmanof the Bonded Labor Front, a group fighting child labor, said, "We know hisdeath was a conspiracy by the carpet mafia." While Pakistan has laws against child labor and slavery, the governmenthas taken very little action to combat it. Only a boycott by the United Statesand other nations will have any impact on slave-based industries like therug manufacturers. Nike similarly bases its operations on finding the lowest-cost labor tomake its athletic shoes. Twelve-year-old girls work in Indonesian sweatshops70 hours a week making Nikes in unhealthy plants that reek of glue. Bluejeans and cheap clothing made in Bangladesh wind up on the shelves of Americanshops like K-Mart and Wal-Mart. The United States needs to take a leadershiprole in eradicating child labor around the globe. If we are punished forviolating GATT for doing so, let us confront it head on. Child labor is a human rights issue. What is more of a human right thangrowing up a free person, attending school without being shackled to medievalmachinery?Please remember every time you go shopping and see a label thatsays made in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia or Indonesia, thata 10-year-old prisoner of a feudal manufacturer probably contributed hisor her labor to that product. Don't buy it. Tell the store why you won'tbuy clothing and other products from these backward nations. Tell your Senator,Congressman and presidential candidates that we should oppose the cruelestabuse of human rights: child labor. And then buy the American-made alternative. The Made in the USA Foundation is sponsoring a new effort to combat childlabor around the globe called CAUSE, Children Against Underage Servitudeand Employment. CAUSE is run by children in America. CAUSE will provide materialsfor students and teachers explaining how children are exploited around theworld and deprived of a real childhood. You can write to CAUSE care of Madein the USA Foundation, 1925 K Street, N.W. Suite 100, Washington, DC 20006.Its a good cause and one that children can get excited about. Perhaps itwill take American children to make Congress take action against child slaveryaround the world. Let's Give America A Raise Neither the Democrat nor the Republican tax cut or minimum wage proposalshelp make the U.S. economy more competitive. Neither plan helps small businesses.I am proposing a tax reform plan that makes American companies more competitive,reduces paperwork and helps those earning less than $30,000 per year. Itdoes all of these without increasing the budget deficit. At the same timeit also provides an increase in the minimum wage without increasing unemployment.It may sound impossible, or even magical- I call it "trickle up economics." My proposal is quite simple: modify the social security tax by creatingan exemption and eliminating the ceiling. Currently, social security taxes(FICA and medicare) are the most regressive taxes we have. For someone earning$15,000 per year the social security tax bite is a whopping $2,245, halfpaid by the employee and half by the employer. I propose that the first $15,000of income be exempt from social security and medicare taxes, for both workersand employers. According to the Tax Foundation (a non-profit think tank thatstudies taxation issues), this exemption will cost the U.S. treasury $40billion, while pumping $20 billion into the hands of those needing it most,plus another $20 billion into their employer's pockets. Social security and medicare taxes currently are imposed only on the first$60,600 of wages. Those earning one million dollars per year pay no morein social security taxes than a taxpayer earning $75,000 annually. This taxceiling is illogical and unfair. These taxes are not based on benefits, theyare based on the ability to pay. And a multimillionaire can certainly affordto pay more than a working man earning $75,000 a year. Even Steve Forbes' flat tax did not have a ceiling. (My proposal is aflat tax, and if Republicans like flat taxes they should endorse ending theceiling on social security taxes.) By eliminating the ceiling on wages subjectto social security taxes, the Tax Foundation estimates that we will raise$64 billion in new revenues. This no doubt could be called Robin Hood taxreform: taking from the rich and giving to the poor. The $24 billion surpluscan either be retained by the treasury to reduce the federal deficit, orit can be spread around as a benefit to those earning less than $30,000 peryear. This tax reform will also end the "nanny tax" problem for those employingchild-care workers at home: if a nanny is paid less than $15,000 per year(and most are) she (or he) will get more take-home pay and her employer willsave money and not be required to file quarterly and annual tax forms. In the real world, where American factories compete with those in Mexicoand Korea, this reform will make the United States much more competitive.Take, for example, an assembly worker paid $7.50 to put electronic productstogether. He or she now makes $15,000 in gross salary, and nets several thousanddollars less because of taxes, including a substantial social security taxbite of $1,122.50, nearly $100 a month. The employee will get an immediateraise in take-home pay. At the same time, the employer will save an equalamount for each employee. With 100 employees, a tidy $100,000 will be addedto the employer's bottom line. The employer will thus improve its profitabilityand be more likely to keep its plant in the United States open forbusiness. Who else will this reform benefit? Students are often paid under $7.50per hour. Restaurant workers, many in the textile industry and in generalthose in semi-skilled occupations will benefit. Those earning more than $60,000per year will pay more social security taxes, but even the rich will benefitby saving taxes (and paperwork) for their nannies, servants and chauffeurs.And if they own a business, the rich will benefit from the new exemption.This change will give America what it needs, a raise, at no cost to theeconomy. Testimony on Country of Origin Labels Joel D. Joseph, Chairman of the Foundation was the first witness calledby the International Trade Commission on April 10 concerning the countryof origin labeling of products. Excerpts of his testimony: There are many deceptive practices being used by companies trying to appearto be U.S. manufacturers. The U.S. Lock Company, for example, does not makelocks in the United States. FloridaGold orange juice may come from Brazil:The label states that the product conducts orange juice from Florida and/orBrazil. But what is it? Florida juice or Brazilian juice? American consumers,and consumers from around the world, have the right to know. We don't want Florida orange juice to come from any other place. We wantIdaho potatoes from Idaho, Long Island duckling from Long Island and Vermontmaple syrup from Vermont. Maple Grove Farms of Vermont sells maple syrupthat may be from Vermont or may be from Canada. The label is clearlydeceptive. There is a case pending before the courts in the United States about SwissArmy knives that are made in China. I don't believe that the Swiss Army hasever left that country, and most certainly never made it to China. The Madein the USA Foundation supports the Swiss manufacturer in its claim that SwissArmy knives can only be made in Switzerland. Similarly, Americans and others would assume that Milwaukee tools aremade in Milwaukee, that Virginia hams come from Virginia and that Rockportshoes come from Rockport. Milwaukee tools are indeed made in Wisconsin andVirginia pigs are the source of Virginia hams, but Rockport shoes are madeelsewhere. Similarly L.A. Gear shoes are not made in Los Angeles, althoughmost consumers would believe that L.A. Gear products are made in SouthernCalifornia. American cities, states and regions deserve the same respectas those in Europe- if a manufacturer wants to use an American geographicalname it must manufacture the product here. New Bumper Stickers Made in the USA Foundation has produced four new bumper stickers picturedon this page and on the back cover. The actual size of the stickers is 3x 11 inches. All of the stickers are white and blue and were made at a unionplant. We are selling the stickers for $1.00 each, a dozen for $10, 100 for$75 and 1,000 for $500. Call us with your order at 800/USA-PRIDE or use theorder form on this page. The stickers can be used by companies or local unionsas a part of a "Buy American" campaign. Most Americans do not realize thatNike uses child laborers to make its athletic shoes in Indonesia and to producesoccer balls under its logo in Pakistan. These children are "paid" from sixto fourteen cents per hour. Some of these unfortunate children were soldinto slavery by their parents for $15 to $20. Do your part to oppose childlabor. There is no charge for shipping and handling.

Joseph Dr. Jules Pagano Nick Nichols Wayne Doran Why Buy American Products? Many of you are familiar with Made in the USA advertising andthe importance of buying goods produced by American workers. Not only doesthe Made in the USA label ensure that jobs are kept in the United States,but it also has proven an effective marketing strategy for businesses. Buying American benefits both workers and corporations, instillinga pride in U.S. citizens about our economy and our manufacturing processes.We at the Made in the USA Foundation hope to raise public awareness aboutquality American goods and the obstacles that our companies face competingin a global economy. What is the Made in the USA Foundation? The Made in the USA Foundation (MUSA) was formed in 1989 by acoalition of individuals, trade unions and corporations who were concernedabout American competitiveness and economic leadership. MUSA is now a 60,000member independent and non-partisan organization which has been approvedby the Internal Revenue Service as a non-profit foundation. Donations toMUSA are tax-deductible. The basic premise of the Foundation is that strong and effective actionmust be taken to reduce American reliance on imports, to increase purchasesof U.S. products domestically and overseas and to ensure that the standardsof fair trade are applied evenly around the world. What Does the Foundation Stand For? Consumers have a right to know where products are manufactured.This information should appear on product labels and in productadvertising. American environmental and worker safety laws should notbe undermined by imports which do not meet these standards. Reciprocity is the benchmark for all bilateral trade. We should notallow foreign countries to do in this country what our companies are prohibitedfrom doing in theirs. Foreign companies that dump products in the United States belowmanufacturing costs should be dealt with firmly. Foreign government subsidies of manufactured and agricultural productsshould be aggressively opposed. Foreign products produced by child labor, slave or prison labor shouldbe banned from the United States. Foreign barriers to American products should be attackedaggressively. The Foundation supports promoting American-made products in theUSA and abroad through advertising and public relations efforts. FTC Accused of Violating Buy American Act How can we expect U.S. businesses and consumers to buy Americanwhen our own government decides to purchase foreign-made goods? This unsettlingnews was revealed one day prior to the Federal Trade Commission's workshopon, of all things, the labeling of products as "Made in America." On March 25, the Made in the USA Foundation filed a complaint againstthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for violating the Buy American Act. Thecomplaint was filed with the Comptroller General of the United States whohas jurisdiction over the Buy American Act. The FTC has conducted an ongoing inquiry into the advertising of productswhich claim to be "Made in the USA," in hopes of preventing false claims.While its efforts to protect companies which use American labor should becommended, the FTC may need to reappraise its own purchasing practices. Before its March 26-27 workshop on "Made in the USA" labeling, theCommission distributed a CD-ROM of public comments to all participants. Yetthis disk, which addresses "Made in the USA" issues, was actually producedin Japan by the Verbatim Corporation. Joel Joseph, Chairman of the Made in the USA Foundation said, "Thisshows that the Federal Trade Commission is not really concerned with buyingAmerican products. It is typical of the inside-the-beltway mentality thatis insensitive to the buy American movement." "The FTC is flouting the Buy American Act at the very moment that itis criticizing companies for their 'Made in the USA' advertising claims. The Made in the USA Foundation contends that the Commission blatantlyviolated the Buy American Act, which mandates that all Federal Agencies mustpurchase goods and supplies made in the United States where reasonably availableand of satisfactory quality. American-made compact disks certainly could have been acquired atcompetitive prices, and American CDs are of comparable or superior qualityto their Japanese counterparts. Ironically, the FTC has filed a complaint against New Balance AthleticShoe for advertising its products as "Made in the USA," because the shoescontain only 71% American content. "At least New Balance is trying its best to make products in the USA,"said Joseph. "The Federal Trade Commission is part of the problem with oureconomy, oblivious to the benefits of buying American, and equally obliviousto the requirements of federal law." Free Trade Bill of Rights (The Foundation has been accused of being protectionist. Overthe last sixty years the United States has built a framework of worker protectionlaws, from minimum wages and maximum hours to occupational safety and health.We want to protect these measures, and if by doing so we are protectionists,then we wear that badge proudly. But we are not opposed to real free trade.This article explains what we mean by free trade. We will have the Free TradeBill of Rights introduced in Congress as one of our legislativeinitiatives.) Free trade never existed. Free trade is a myth that fuels politicaldebate and drains the U.S. economy. In order for there to be real free (andfair) trade in the world, all nations must agree to certain ground rules. Here is the Free Trade Bill of Rights, which should serve as a standardfor other nations seeking to trade with the United States. As the world'sleading manufacturer, and the only superpower, we should flex our muscles,using access to the largest consumer market as leverage for making the playingfield level. Article One. Democracy. The right of the people to votein elections for their representative government shall not be infringed.[Workers in totalitarian nations, like China, are not free workers.] Article Two. Freedom of Speech and Assembly. The rightof the people to speak freely and to assemble shall not be infringed. Thisarticle includes the right to advertise products for sale and to compareproducts in these advertisements. [Many countries, including Germany, prohibitcertain comparative ads.] Article Three. Prohibition of Child Labor. Children underthe age of fifteen shall have the right to an education and be free fromcoerced labor. [There are two hundred million children under the age of 15"employed" around the world, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Braziland many other nations. Many of these children are sold into slavery andchained to machines.] Article Four. Prohibition of Slave Labor. No person shallbe forced to work or sold into slavery. Prison labor shall be permitted,however, the export of goods made by prison laborers shall be prohibited.[China uses prison labor for exports, including political prisoners] Article Five. Trade Unions Protected. Free and unfetteredtrade unions shall be protected to the fullest extent of the law. All personsshall be allowed to join the trade union of their choice and shall not beretaliated against for joining a union or for soliciting others to join orto form a trade union. Article Six. Environmental Protection. Emissions fromfactories and agricultural chemicals shall be controlled to the maximum extentpossible. Environmental laws of the United States shall be the internationalstandard, but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards.[Pesticides, such as DDT which is banned in the United States, are now importedon Mexican tomatoes.] Article Seven. Worker Safety and Health. The safety andhealth of workers shall be protected to the maximum extent possible. Theoccupational safety and health laws of the United States shall be theinternational standard, but any nation shall be free to establish stricterstandards. Article Eight. Minimum Wages and Maximum Hours. Factoryand agricultural workers shall be entitled to reasonable wages, in no eventless than one-fourth of the hourly minimum wage in the United States. [Thismeans that manufacturing wages will rise in the Third World to $1 per houror more, giving these workers the ability to buy American products. Now workersin Nike plants in Indonesia, for example, are paid 14 cents per hour andcannot afford to buy the shoes that they produce.] No worker shall be compelled to work more than forty-eight hours perweek. [The United States adopted the 40-hour work week decades ago, whileGermany and France have even shorter work weeks.] Article Nine. Barriers to Trade. No nation shall discriminateagainst imports from the United States nor impose other barriers to trade.[Most nations impose more trade barriers than the United States. Many nationshave more favorable trade rules for other nations than for the United Statescausing tariffs and duties that discriminate against American goods.] Article Ten. Illicit Trade Prohibited. Nations shallnot trade illicit drugs, poisonous chemicals or materials capable of beingused in nuclear weapons or in chemical or biological weapons. [When an outlawnation provides others with deadly materials, the United States and othernations have every right to ban trade with that country. Currently, Chinahas been caught by the CIA with selling nuclear equipment to Pakistan. Thisprovision would allow the United States to punish China with tradesanctions.] When someone asks you about Free Trade, be prepared with tough questionsabout slave labor, child labor and human rights. Free trade only works ifeveryone plays by the same rules. All-American Basketball Company Formed Although basketball was invented in the United States over 100years ago, NO basketballs are now made in the United States. The Foundationis helping a new company, the All-American Basketball Company to get startedby providing it with an office in Washington, D.C. The company is now looking for a site for its factory which will makebasketballs from scratch using as much American content as possible. TheAll-American Basketball Company is now raising $3.3 million of which it needs$2 million for equipment. The company plans to raise most of its capitalfrom NBA coaches, players and owners. In addition to basketballs, the company will produce T-shirts, sweatpants and other basketball accessories. Rod Willis, president of the company,said that he wants to create meaningful jobs that use all types of skillsand talents, from creative design to engineering. Willis said, "For everyboy who dreams of making the NBA there are 1,000 who never make it. We createdthe All-American Basketball Company for all of those who love basketballand want a career in basketball, but didn't make the dream team. This isour dream team." Made in the USA Shopping Network An exciting new cable television network is planning to bringyou American-made products 24-hours a day. Made in the USA Foundation chairmanJoel Joseph, frustrated by not being able to buy American-made products atretail stores, formed the company. Joining Mr. Joseph as co-founders of theMade in the USA Shopping Network are Terry McAuliffe, Jim Ball, Jim Kofaltand Mike Boyd. Terry McAuliffe was the finance chairman of President Clinton'sre-election campaign. Jim Ball is a venture capitalist. Jim Kofalt was presidentof Cablevision Systems, a major cable television company which owned cablesystems in 17 states as well as the Bravo, Sportschannel and American MovieClassic networks. Mike Boyd, the Chief Executive Officer of the shoppingnetwork, was a co-founder of QVC, the home shopping cable company. The network is now raising capital and lining up American productsuppliers. Stay tuned for an official announcement concerning openingday. New Offices! On February 1st of this year the Foundation moved into itsnewoffices at 20th and K Street in downtown Washington, D.C. This is convenientto both Farragut or Farragut West Metro stations. This move allows the Foundationto grow, as the new space has room for a staff of ten. We are located onthe first floor in suite 100. Our toll-free number (800/USA-PRIDE) rings at our office. Feel freeto call or drop by. Chairman's Corner Trading with China is a lot like eating Chinese food: Itis excitingand appealing at first, but after indulging you are left hungry and unfulfilled,often with a pounding headache. Yes, of course, China is a big market with a billion potential consumers.But, getting down to the nitty-gritty, China does not make anything thatwe really need. Trading with China has injured America greatly, costing 700,000well-paying jobs, harming hard-working Americans. And to add insult to thispainful injury, China has been kicking us where it hurts most. The more we trade with China, the more contempt that it has for theUnited States and for human rights. As China flexes its political muscles, threatening to invade Taiwan,ignoring human rights and selling weapons of mass destruction to Pakistanand other countries, the United States must respond by tightening traderestrictions. Last year China imprisoned Harry Wu, an American citizen who had spent19 years in Chinese labor camps. It is from these very prison labor campsthat China has been exporting products. Wu was granted admission to China.After entering the country was arrested for espionage and faced a possibledeath sentence. The death penalty is a serious risk in China where more than1,000 "criminals" were executed last year. In its very essence "trade" means that we get something of value inexchange for our products. Trade is a two-way street. But trade with Chinahas not been a two-way venture. We sold China $11.7 billion worth of productsin 1995, but bought a whopping $45.6 billion worth, leaving us a massive$34 billion deficit, second only to the trade deficit which we have withJapan. Back in the good old days of 1970 we did not trade with China at all.Quian Qichen, the Chinese Foreign Minister, said recently, "For twenty-threeyears before Richard Nixon opened the door of relations between China andthe United States there was no trade. I think you lived quite well. And sodid we." This is only half true. We lived quite well 23 years ago, in factin many ways better than we do now, but the Chinese did not. China's per capita income has blossomed in the past two decades whileours has declined. In 1973 the United States did not have a trade imbalancewith the rest of the world. We were in fact on top of the world, with animproving standard of living, low unemployment and a very low federal budgetdeficit. We really don't get anything of lasting value from China. We purchasedtwo million military-style assault weapons from China in 1993. These productshave a negative value to American consumers. I recently noticed that afterplaying at a video arcade my children were "awarded" whoopee cushions thatwere manufactured in China. Whoopee cushions, like assault rifles, have anegative value. We can live better lives without these useless products. Other Chinese products are no better. Most, if not all, of the Chinese-madetoys are virtually guaranteed to self-destruct within 48-hours of purchase.Just look at the broken toys around your house and you'll see where theyare made. Then look at the ones that have lasted for years: Little Tikes,Lionel Trains, Tinker Toys, and you'll realize that the toys with lastingvalue are made in the USA, or Europe. Or take Chinese crayons. Millions of Chinese crayons have been recalledbecause of lead contamination. Chinese crayons are cheaper than American-madeCrayola's, but at what cost? With workers paid fifty cents per hour or less it is not surprisingthat the Chinese produce clothing cheaper than we do. Not better, cheaper.Would you rather have one well-made American shirt, or two poorly made Chineseones? I would rather have one made in the USA employing well-paid Americanworkers. Fully half of our shoes are made in China. Reeboks, Nikes, all thosehighly advertised American-sounding brands made many of their shoes in China,paying workers twenty-five cents an hour. But remarkably, these shoes donot sell for less than those made in the USA. Why do we grant Most Favored Nation (MFN) status to China and not tradeat all with Cuba? President Clinton made the mistake of granting MFN to Chinaand "delinked" this status from their human rights record. By doing thisClinton gave the Chinese the wrong signal, and China has used that sign asa green light to clamp down on dissenters, arrest Harry Wu and sell nuclearmaterials to Pakistan. China does not deserve MFN status and we should revoke it immediately.Yes, this may provoke a trade war with China. So what? Since trade with China harms the United States, a trade war would dolittle harm here, but would be devastating to China. I understand that Boeingand a few other major U.S. companies would be harmed by a trade battle withChina, but what about the 700,000 net jobs lost to Chinese imports? When human rights and democratic reforms are instituted in China, wewill see a dramatic increase in the wages paid to Chinese workers. When workersin China are paid a reasonable wage, we will see our deficit with that countrydramatically reduced. We must be prepared to fight by increasing tariffs and be preparedto battle the other symptoms of Chinese Trade Syndrome. Otherwise, our childrenwill not have jobs and we will buy most of our goods from dictatorial ThirdWorld nations, making the United States itself a third-class nation unableto help the developing democracies of the world. A Kinder, Gentler NAFTA Do you remember during the NAFTA debates when President Clintonand Vice President Gore said that if NAFTA was a failure we could get outof it easily? Well, by all accounts NAFTA, the North American Free TradeAgreement, has been an abysmal failure. At the same time, President Clintonalso predicted that the "peso would become stronger if NAFTA passes." Inreality the Mexican peso has taken a bath and so has the American economy. Before NAFTA we had a modest trade surplus with Mexico. NAFTA wentinto effect in 1994. During 1995 we ran a $20 billion deficit with our friendssouth of the border. This represents a loss of 460,000 American jobs. Northof the border in Canada the problem is just as bad, another $20 billion deficit,another half million jobs down the tube. While we might not have heard thegiant sucking sound that Ross Perot predicted, the silent draining of high-payingmanufacturing jobs is just as deadly to the American economy. Even economists who predicted job gains from NAFTA are now predictingmassive job losses. Gary Hufbauer, an economist with the International EconomicsInstitute, whose predictions of job gains were embraced by the ClintonAdministration, now has flip-flopped, predicting a net loss of 225,000jobs. The Clinton Administration boldly states that NAFTA created 340,000"good"American jobs. However, the government fails to broadcast the factthat Mexican imports have cost us 800,000 good American jobs, a net lossof nearly half a million. By only counting job gains and not deducting joblosses, the Administration is cooking the books: it is like only countingdeposits in your checking account and failing to deduct the checks writtenon the account. The United States Department of Labor has received 644 petitions forassistance from factories closed by NAFTA, one plant per day since January1994. Briggs and Stratton laid off 2,000 workers in Wisconsin and replacedthem with Mexican workers. Fruit of the Loom replaced 3,200 employees. Thenot-so-Jolly Green Giant fired 1,200 Californians and replaced them withlow-wage workers south of the border. More than 100,000 Texas have lost jobsdue to NAFTA, driving home the fact that Ross Perot was right. A bipartisan group of 52 Congressmen, including 34 Democrats, introduceda bill called the NAFTA Accountability Act, which would pave the way forwithdrawal from NAFTA. This bill provides for the renegotiation of the tradeagreement if the trade deficit persists and other conditions have not beenmet. President Clinton has already backtracked on NAFTA by standing firmagainst the use of Mexican trucks and drivers in California, Arizona, NewMexico and Texas. Among the other hidden problems with the trade agreement,it provided that starting January 1, 1996 Mexican trucks and drivers couldenter the United States freely, even though their vehicles did not meetenvironmental, safety and health standards. The drivers of these huge trucksare not even required to be able to read American road signs. We were better off before NAFTA. Do we ever learn from our mistakes?In addition to the staggering trade deficit with Mexico and Canada, NAFTAopened our southern border to more drug trafficking. One of the consequencesof the trade agreement at your local supermarket is a flood of tempting redripe tomatoes from Mexico. Beware of these attractive produce- they are Trojantomatoes, tainted with the pesticide DDT. While the United States prohibitsthe use of DDT, Mexico doesn't. NAFTA undermines our living standards as well as our environmental,safety and health laws. The trade agreement exports good manufacturing jobsand does very little positive for America. Now is the time to revise NAFTAand bring jobs back to the United States. Made in the USA is now working on legislation to amend NAFTA. We willpropose that Mexican minimum wages be tied to American wages so that overa ten year period our minimum wages would be equal. We also want Mexicanagricultural products to be free of the pesticide DDT, so our legislationwill remedy this problem. Made in the USA wants Mexican living standardsto improve for two reasons: Mexico is a neighbor and if we want our neighborsto buy our products they must be paid decent wages.

Final Thought This year marks the 40th anniversary of a truly American invention:the TV remote control. Designed by Robert Adler at Zenith in 1956, remotecontrols now outnumber the general population of the U.S. Yet as you flipthrough an endless range of channels from the comfort of your couch takenote of the label on the back of your clicker: not one remote control isstill produced in the United States.

Cleveland symbolizes the heartland of America, its industrial center. NativeClevelanders, including this author, have created the Browns Diaspora, fleeingtheir home town in search of greener, and often warmer, pastures. I haverelocated in Maryland, but I want the Browns to stay where they belong--inCleveland. Cleveland is home of the most loyal sports fans in the nation. Despitea mediocre team over the last decade the Cleveland Browns have played nearlyevery home game on the shores of bone-chilling Lake Erie before 75,000 screamingfans. Art Modell's decision to move the Browns is an affront, not only toCleveland, but to the United States. He epitomizes the lack of loyalty ofAmerican business owners who pick up their factories and move them toMexico. Cleveland fans, like Cleveland and other rust-belt workers, are thefoundation on which teams and nations are built. Professional baseball isnow learning the hard way that without fans the game is dead, and the owner'swallets are lighter as a result. Similarly, if every company picks up itsfactory and moves it to a third-world country, the entire economy will fallapart--few will have money to buy anything. It is not only loyalty--it makescommon sense to cater to your home market, employ your neighbors and developa sense of community. If we have no loyalty to community, loyalty to ourcountry will be next to disappear. The process of having cities and states bid against each other tosubsidize sports teams, or manufacturing companies, is destined for failure. Someone has to pay for all of these subsidies. And that someone is theAmerican taxpayer and the American worker. Maryland taxpayers will pay for the $200 million dollar subsidy tothe "Baltimore Browns." What happens in ten or fifteen years when Maryland'sstadium become obsolete and Tucson or Pensacola or London is willing to paya subsidy to lure the Baltimore Browns? Baltimore suffered this fate oncebefore when the Colts fled in the middle of the night for the illusive glamourof Indianapolis. The Colts should have stayed in Baltimore and the Brownsshould stay in Cleveland. Mercedes-Benz decided a few years ago that it could make its vehiclesmore efficiently in the United States. Dozens of states were tripping overeach other to curry favor with Mercedes. Alabama won the bidding war, luringthe luxury German automaker with a pledge of $253 million in tax breaks andincentives. The United States would have attracted a Mercedes plant without anysubsidy. We must stop this counterproductive struggle pitting one communityagainst another. Congress, under its power to regulate interstate and foreigncommerce, can stop the bidding madness for manufacturing plants. These subsidiesare in essence corporate welfare that harms rather than helps the nationaleconomy. It is the proper role for the federal government to referee thiswasteful competition among the various states. The National Football League and the City of Cleveland have the powerto stop the insanity that allows a successful sports franchise to pick upand move. Current NFL rules allow it to just say "No" to Art Modell. Bydoing so the football league would be acting for its own long-term preservation,because ultimately the fans will rebel and fail to show up for losing teams. The new loyalties will only go so far--so far as their newly adopted hometeam is winning. True loyalty, as Cleveland fans have demonstrated, takesgenerations to nurture. The City of Cleveland, under its power of eminent domain, can seizethe Browns and pay Modell fair compensation. This is the American way. America's Team deserves to stay where it was born, where it has thrived,where it has lost and where the fans support it. I say to Cleveland--Seizethe Day and Seize the Browns. Do it for yourselves and do it for Americaand America's real team.

Unfortunately, the Library of Congress has notshown the same sort of concern about where its own products are manufactured- despite being required to do so under federal law. This flagrant disregardfor the Buy America Act has led the Made in the USA Foundation, AmericanFederation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Council 26,and two local AFSCME unions to file a lawsuit today against the Library ofCongress. In 1990, the Library of Congress initiated the American Memory Project,a pilot project to digitize important works maintained by the Library. Sincethat time, the American Memory Project has become a part of the new NationalDigital Library. But the Library of Congress chose to ignore the Buy AmericaAct by entering into contracts for the American Memory Project which calledfor work to be performed in Jamaica and the Philippines. The Buy AmericaAct mandates that government agencies use American goods and services wheneverpossible. Joel Joseph, chairman of the Made in the USA Foundation, stated: "TheInformation Superhighway has been sold to the American public as a greatengine of job creation. But to be successful, the information highway mustnot be a freeway encouraging job transfers to the lowest cost workers overseas.If the Library of Congress has to go to the Philippines to create the NationalDigital Library of the United States, then the Internet is doomed to be aone-way road to the unemployment lines for millions of Americans." Automated Sciences Group and Systems Integration Group, Inc. were contractedto produce a CD-ROM containing two collections for the American Memory Projectas well as a digital product of various texts for the National Digital Library.Today's lawsuit charges that both contractors falsely submitted documentsto the government for payment under contract, by intentionally and willfullyviolating that contract. The suit also claims that the two companies mademisleading assertions that they would comply with the Buy America Act. Congressman James Traficant (D-OH), a strong supporter of the Buy AmericaAct, said that the Library of Congress should have worked harder to use Americanworkers for the project. Traficant also said that the existing contractsshould be inspected carefully by Congress. "Having spent the better part of my Congressional career fighting to ensurethat federal agencies comply with both the letter and the spirit of the BuyAmerica Act, I find this latest incident quite disturbing," he said. "Themanner in which this contract was awarded should be closely scrutinized byCongress and the Library's own procurement personnel. If procurement rulesand Federal laws regarding Buy American were violated, then the contractshould be null and void." "More importantly," Congressman Traficant continued, "the Library of Congressshould've made a better effort to reach out to American firms and ensurethat all of the work on this contract would be done in this country." The suit filed by the Made in the USA Foundation and AFSCME places blamenot only on the contractors, but also on the Library of Congress. Made inthe USA and AFSCME charge that the Librarian of Congress either knew or shouldhave known that the work was performed outside the United States and thatthe U.S. content of the final product was minimal. Joel Stern, president of Local 2477 of the American Federation of State,County and Municipal Employees, explained why the Library's actions shouldserve as warning to workers throughout the U.S. "Seeking bargain basementwage rates overseas is bad for everyone. It depresses wages here at homeand exploits sub-human wage rates abroad. The saving s realized by thesubcontractor in this situation didn't save American tax-payers any money;it just boosted his own profit margin. It's wrong for the Library of Congressto be associated with this kind of profiteering. Everyone comes out aheadwhen people get a real living wage for the work they do." The Made in the USA Foundation is a non-profit organization with 60,000members nationwide. The Foundation is dedicated to promoting American productsand seeks the enforcement of laws meant to improve U.S. balance of payments,like the Buy America Act. The two AFSCME locals that are joining the Madein the USA Foundation in filing the lawsuit are AFSCME Local 2477 and Local2910, which both represent Library of Congress Employees. AFSCME Council26 represents employees in a number of federal agencies, including the Libraryof Congress.

The ITC, an independent, nonpartisan, factfinding federal agency, prepares quarterly reportson U.S. trade with the countries that come under the authority of Title IV of the Trade Actof 1974. (Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 includes provisions that deny or placeconditions on the granting of most-favored-nation tariff status.) Report highlights follow.  Total U.S. merchandise exports to the countries covered by the report increased to $15.7 billion during 1995 from $13.1 billion during 1994 and $12.8 billion during 1993. Total merchandise imports from these countries rose to $50.7 billion during 1995 from $42.8 billion during 1994 and $33.7 billion during 1993. China continued to dominate U.S. trade with these partners.  U.S. exports to China rose to $11.6 billion during 1995 from $9.2 billion during 1994. During 1995, fertilizers, airplanes, and cotton were the leading items exported to China.  U.S. imports from China increased to $45.4 billion during 1995 from $38.6 billion during 1994. Imports of machinery, mechanical appliances, and electrical equipment jumped to $11.4 billion from $8.7 billion. Major increases also were registered in shipments of miscellaneous manufactured articles and footwear. However, in textiles and textile articles, consisting mainly of apparel items, imports fell from $6.1 billion to $5.8 billion over the period. Footwear and toys were the leading imports during 1995.  During 1995, Russia was the largest U.S. trading partner among the former Soviet republics, followed by Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The U.S. trade deficit of $706.6 million with Russia during 1994 increased to $1.27 billion during 1995. In trade with Ukraine, the U.S. deficit of $150.4 million in 1994 increased to $187.1 million in 1995. In trade with Kazakhstan, a U.S. trade surplus of $71.6 million during 1994 changed to a deficit of $46.9 million during 1995.  U.S. trade with Vietnam more than doubled from 1994 to 1995, showing the continuing effects of the end of the U.S. embargo on trade with Vietnam on February 3, 1994. In 1995, Vietnam ranked fourth in U.S. exports to the monitored countries, after China, Russia, and Romania, with U.S. exports of $249.6 million. The report also presents a section identifying the most rapidly growing imports from Chinaand the extent of their penetration into the U.S. market.

Joseph (Chairman, Made in the USA Foundation. The Made in the USA Foundationis a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting American products inthe United States and overseas with 60,000 members. The Foundation is locatedat 1925 K Street, N.W., Suite 100, Washington, DC 20006, 800/USA-PRIDE, e-mailMadeUSAFdn@aol.com.) While Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer proudly included on hisresume that he dug ditches when he was a teenager, the Boston-based juristcould be more fairly characterized as a stuffed shirt. Justice StephenBreyer, appointed to the United States Supreme Court in 1994 by PresidentBill Clinton, certainly loves his shirts. As the wealthiest justice,worth a hefty $8.5 million, Justice Breyer can afford to buy nearlyanything he wants. The Washington Post reported that Breyer spent $2,100 on 16custom-made shirts from Ascot Chang, a Hong Kong shop that sends fittersto you. This is a staggering $131.25 each. Justice Breyer's priceyshirts say two things about him: he spends wildly, and more importantly,despite his ditch-digging past, he doesn't give a damn about American blue-collarworkers. Justice Breyer lived in New England before his appointment to the nation'shighest court. In nearby Waterville, Maine, the Hathaway Companyhas been making excellent dress shirts for 159 years, making it the oldestshirt factory in the United States. Threatened with extinction byits owner, Hathaway could have used Justice Breyer's business. (NewYork-based conglomerate Warnaco, announced earlier this year that it wasclosing Hathaway, but efforts are underway to keep the factory in businessunder different ownership.) Hathaway shirts sell for a mere $30 and up,certainly within Justice Breyer's budget. Apparently, the multimillionaire justice wanted his shirts custom-fit. The Custom Shirt Shop would have come to his chambers at the Supreme Courtto fit Breyer personally, carefully measuring him 13 different ways. TheCustom Shirt Shop makes its shirts in Franklin, New Jersey, where its unionworkers are paid far more than shirtmakers in Hong Kong. Yet these Americancustom-made shirts can be had for a mere $60 a pop, which would have savedStephen Breyer a cool $1,000.00. The Custom Shirt Shop has several storesin Washington, D.C. and some 70 throughout the country. Stephen Breyer really knows how to spend a dollar, whether an Americandollar or a Hong Kong dollar. He was severely criticized for approvingconstruction of the gold-plated $218 million courthouse in Boston. This "TajMahal" on the Boston waterfront includes a $1.5 million pier and 33 kitchenettesfor the exclusive use of the federal judges who work in thebuilding. But this article in not mainly about a free-spending Supreme Courtjustice. It is about a disloyal one. One who cares more about hisshirts than his country. One that doesn't care about the plight of Americanworkers who suffer an unemployment rate twice that found in Hong Kong.and live on a take-home pay that hasn't increased in two decades. Justice Breyer's loyalties may have been distorted by his foreigninvestments and other foreign ties. Breyer invested heavily in Lloydsof London (a really bad investment) and owns real estate in London and onthe Caribbean isle of St. Kitts. His wife is the daughter of a Britishconservative leader. Possibly, hobnobbing with the elite in Bostonand London blurred Breyer's allegiances and sensibilities. This lack of loyalty is surprising for an Eagle Scout. An Eagle Scoutis the highest achievement for a boy scout, achieved by a mere fewpercent of scouts. Most Eagle Scout's are highly loyal Americans,including among their members many generals and politicians. Forexample, H. Ross Perot and Senator Sam Nunn were both Eagle Scouts. All boy scouts take an oath of loyalty which reads: "A Scout is trueto his family, Scout leaders, friends, school, and nation." Additionally,the Scout's oath pledges the scout to "do the best to do my duty to . . .my country." I call upon Justice Breyer to unstuff his shirts, follow the scoutoath and the scout slogan to "do a good turn daily": Next time youbuy shirts, or anything else, buy American.

Nike has invaded the NFL with Alien Gear Welcome to the National Football League, the pride of Taiwan, Bangladesh and China. You thought football was American? Although the official NFL football is made by Wilson in the US of A, the league has authorized Nike, Reebok and others to produce official NFL gear in Third World countries which allow child labor, slave labor and sweatshop conditions. There's nothing better than cool autumn Sundays spent watching professional football at the stadium or in the comfort of your own living room. Everyone has their favorite team. Maybe you grew up outside of Philadelphia and are a diehard Eagles fan. Or maybe you had a favorite player like Unitas, or Starr, or Bradshaw who seemed to carry their entire team on their back, and so their team became your team. And maybe you have that old jersey your father gave you, the jersey that made you proud to be associated with that player or team, and with football in general. But things have changed. Now when you go to give your son or daughter a T-shirt or hat bearing their favorite team's logo--look at the label. Where you might expect to find the words "Made in the USA," you now see "Made in China" or "Made in Bangladesh." Professional football has become this country's most popular sport, and many athletes make more money in a season than most Americans could hope to spend in a lifetime. Players and owners like Deion Sanders and Art Modell tell us that football has become a business, and what matters is the bottom line. Not all owners and players agree. Frank Gifford, former Giants star and husband of Kathy Lee, agrees that NFL teams should require that products licensed to use NFL logos be made in the USA. We at the Made in the USA Foundation believe in a different conception of football. We see football as America's sport which brings families and friends together, encouraging friendly rivalries and spirited good times. Many of football's most loyal fans are hard-working individuals our country's manufacturing sector. Yet as more and more manufacturing is shipped overseas, these men and women rightfully fear losing their jobs. We call on the NFL's owners to re-evaluate their priorities, and bring the production of their "official" products back to the United States. A large majority of NFL fans want to buy U.S.-made products. But by importing NFL-logo products, the National Football League and its teams are turning off the fans, the lifeblood of the sport. These fans now are refusing to buy imported souvenirs and have become irritated by the lack of choice. I believe that it is in the owners' long-term interests to keep fans supportive and enthusiastic. For every player who makes it to the NFL there are literally thousands who don't make the grade. Unfortunately, many of these athletes are unemployed or are employed in low-wage jobs. In this tough job market we need to keep Americans working at productive jobs. The backbone of our economy has always been manufacturing. Making NFL-logo products in the USA will not by itself turn the economy around, but it is an important symbolic step to creating jobs in the United States. Did you know that NFL coaches and players can be fined for wearing American hats on the sidelines? The football league strongly enforces its game day rules for authorized clothing. While the league's henchman are tough on rule violators, incredibly its rules favor importers of souvenir hats and jerseys. The National Football League, as well as many collegiate teams, sell their souls to the highest bidders. Nike, Starter and Reebok, all three hollow companies, pay millions of dollars for the rights to use the logos of the Dallas Cowboys and many other NFL franchises. By hollow companies I mean companies that don't own a single factory. They are not manufacturers at all, they are marketing companies. College souvenirs are also being made in sweatshops overseas. I saw a University of Maryland jersey at J.C. Penney's selling for over $60.00 that was made in Bangladesh. Irate, I called University officials who placed the blame on the Collegiate Licensing Company. The Collegiate Licensing Company represents 145 major universities in the United States, from Yale and Georgetown to Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, University of North Carolina and the Air Force Academy. For from $50 to $1,000 anyone can be authorized to make T-shirts, sweatshirts, hats or jerseys with the logos of these well-known universities. Collegiate Licensing, and the colleges themselves, could require that team logo products be made in the USA. Next time you see your favorite sports team's name on a T-shirt or hat, look at the label. If it is not made in the USA--don't buy it. Send the NFL and your favorite team a message: you will support it when it supports creating jobs in the USA.

Ringle Components Labor Day Top Ten List Summer's Top Ten List Spring's Top Ten List Cannondale If you are interested in purchasing an American-made, finely crafted bicycle, Cannondale Corp. of Georgetown, CT, is your source. Unlike many of its competitors, Cannondale makes every single one of its bicycles distributed in the U.S. in its plants in Bedford and Phillipsburg, PA. Cannondale currently exports to over 60 countries. Cannondale began just 20 years ago, when president and founder Joe Montgomery and four staffers began hand-building bicycle trailers above a pickle factory. A year later, the small group began to hand-build bicycles. This year Cannondale celebrates its 25th year in business. Although Cannondale has grown significantly since its humble beginnings, Joe Montgomery's commitment to quality, innovation and a hand-built bicycle carries over to this day. Cannondale bicycles feature patented, wide-girth, all-aluminum frames that make these bikes lighter, more efficient and more shock absorbing that a traditional steel frame bicycle. Cannondale was the first company to mass produce such a frame. Each Cannondale frame is computer designed and hand-built. It takes four hours and 40 pairs of human hands to manufacture a single Cannondale frame. Furthermore, every Cannondale frame features a lifetime guarantee. This year, Cannondale has introduced the Super V Active full-suspension mountain bike and the Slice monocoque carbon fiber road bike. (800) BIKE-USA Trek USA Trek USA designs, engineers and manufactures high quality, technologically sophisticated bicycles in the United States. With global markets and a full line of high performance components and accessories, Trek is a leader in the sale of bicycles over $300 U.S. retail. Trek also manufactures the popular Gray Fisher line, and last year acquired the Gary Klein and Bontrager brands. Trek also manufactures a premium line of road bikes and accessories designed by three-time Tour de France winner Greg Le Mond. Founded in a small barn in Waterloo, WI, in 1976, Trek Bicycle Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intrepid Corporation, a privately held company located in Waukesha, WI. Begun with just five employees making hand-built bicycle frames, Trek USA has grown into a globally-oriented corporation. The majority of those employed by Trek work in its three Wisconsin manufacturing facilities. Trek concentrates on developing state of the art bicycles, and in fact the Y bike, a full suspension mountain bike with a carbon fiber composite frame, was designed with technology that was pioneered in the development of the Stealth fighter. In 1995, Popular Mechanics magazine awarded the designers of the Y bike its Design Engineer of the Year Award. (800) 369-TREK Litespeed Litespeed produces some of the world's most technologically advanced, yet best-priced titanium road and mountain frames. This family business has its plant in Ooltewah, TN, and in fact all of Litespeed's mountain bikes, including the Ococee, Tellico and Hiwassee, are named after local Tennessee rivers. The company's commitment to value is reflected in the Hiwassee, which sports a full 3-2.5 Ti frame, front suspension, complete parts, and brilliant durable powdercoat finish- yet retails for under $1600, a price unheard just one year ago. (423) 238-5530 Kryptonite Bicycle Locks In 1971, Boston bike mechanic created his original version of the now-famous U-lock. Though it weighed a hefty 5 pounds, the lock's new design proved very effective. In fact, the Kryptonite U-Lock was installed in the permanent design collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and received the "Good Design" award in Japan. Kryptonite stands behind many of its products with an anti-theft guarantee offer of up to $1000. And though the company had to withdraw this guarantee from covering Manhattan, NYC, the world's stolen bike capital, the company recently came out with its virtually indestructible New York lock, guaranteed throughout the U.S. and Canada. Kryptonite's highest security U-locks are produced in Canton, MA. (617) 828-6655 Merlin Metalworks Merlin Metalworks was founded in 1986 with the goal of building a new generation of bicycles that would combine high strength, unexcelled durability, light weight, and ride comfort in one frame. To achieve this goal, they selected an exceptionally strong titanium alloy originally developed for the U.S. aerospace industry and available only in the U.S.A. The result was the original Merlin mountain bike, the world's first aerospace titanium bicycle. The success of this design brought exponential growth, and today in addition to satisfying the requests of U.S. cycling enthusiasts, Merlin frames are exported to 38 countries around the world. Fully half of the country's yearly production is sold overseas. In addition, the company maintains a full-time sales office in Leysin, Switzerland, to coordinate international sales, though every frame is still handcrafted in one factory in Cambridge, MA. Prices start at $1525, with top-of-the-line models retailing for $3000. Complete bicycles range from $2300 to $5500. (617) 661-6688 Specialized Bicycle Components Specialized makes some of its bikes and most of its components in Morgan Hill, CA. In fact, the flagship M2 Metal Matrix and all Specialized road bikes are made in the U.S., as are Body Geometry clothing, composite Rib Cage bottle cages, and Specialized bottles. But the company takes particular pride in its helmets, which are hand-assembled and hand-taped in Morgan Hill. Specialized helmet designers are constantly developing and testing new retention systems, and creating innovations such as the Brainlock and Headlock, which in 1995 won Bicycle magazine's award for "Best Retention System for Off-Road Helmets." (408) 779-6229 Huffy Huffy Bicycles is the nation's largest bicycle manufacturer. It is also the most efficient manufacturer of bicycles in the world. The company has two manufacturing plants- one in Celine, OH, and the other in Farmington, MO. Huffy produces bicycles in every category, from trikes to tandems. With innovative products for all cycling consumers, Huffy is equipped to meet the needs of today's riders. In addition to Huffy's products for mass market retailers, the company has also produced custom bicycles which have won Olympic, Pan Am and World Championship competitions. Much of the technological innovation needed to produce Huffy's world class racing bicycles has filtered down to Huffy's mass production models. Huffy bicycles are available through major retailers. (800) USA- BIKE Draftmaster Sport Racks Draftmaster Sportsracks have the advantages of roof-rack design- utilizing fork and rear tray mounts- but the accessibility of a traditional rear hitch rack. And because the bikes ride behind the vehicle, there's no aerodynamic drag, hence the name. Produced outside of Portland, OR, Draftmaster Sportsracks come in interchangeable two-, four-, and five-bike models, and have optional tandem, front-wheel, ski and snowboard attachments. (800) 659-5569 Load Llama Rear Bicycle Rack Nett Designs, a commuter conscious bicycle accessory company in Vail, CO has designed a new rear bicycle rack meant for convenience, safety and versatility. The Load Llama Ultimate Bike Rack features expandable, rotating arms that form a sturdy frame basket or stable flat platform to accommodate objects of any shape. Designer Ted Simonett came up with the idea for the Load Llama in 1988 while hiking and biking in New Zealand. Frustrated by the dilemma of whether to carry his gear in a back pack for hiking convenience or in panniers for cycling ease, he improvised with aluminum shelving strips and a bungee cord to create a stable way to carry a large pack on his rear rack. Nett Designs markets this rack to students and exercise-conscious, energy-aware commuters who ride their bikes to work or while doing errands. Load Llama is assembled in Colorado at an employment and training center for people with disabilities. (800) 84LLAMA Ringle Components Ringle Components of Trenton, NJ has been making high end aftermarket components for mountain and road bikes since 1989.

Stickers Government Donations Membership Slinky Richard James was a marine engineer aboard ship in 1943 when a coiled,circular torsion spring fell off a table and began rolling around the deck.Its wild gyrations amused him, and he thought it would make a great toy.James started tinkering with various metals, thicknesses and proportionsof metals, and two years later he perfected a coiled, steel spring that couldspiral from one step to another and "walk" down stairs. His wife Betty wentto a dictionary and found the word "Slinky." The Jameses persuaded the Gimblesstore in Philadelphia to allow them to set up a sloped board in the toydepartment where "Slinky" could walk. Within 90 minutes, all 400 in stockwere sold. In 1945, they set up James Industries in Hollidaysburg, PA, which continuesto manufacture Slinky products under the watchful eye of Betty James. Inthe 1990's, the Slinky line includes a Slinky Junior, two-color plastic Slinkys,Slinky eyeballs and neon Slinkys.

Over the lastsixty years the United States has built a framework of worker protectionlaws, from minimum wages and maximum hours to occupational safety and health.We want to protect these measures, and if by doing so we are protectionists,then we wear that badge proudly. But we are not opposed to real free trade.This article explains what we mean by free trade. We will have the Free TradeBill of Rights introduced in Congress as one of our legislativeinitiatives.) Free trade never existed. Free trade is a myth that fuels political debateand drains the U.S. economy. In order for there to be real free (and fair)trade in the world, all nations must agree to certain ground rules. Here is the Free Trade Bill of Rights, which should serve as a standardfor other nations seeking to trade with the United States. As the world'sleading manufacturer, and the only superpower, we should flex our muscles,using access to the largest consumer market as leverage for making the playingfield level. Article One. Democracy. The right of the people to votein elections for their representative government shall not be infringed.[Workers in totalitarian nations, like China, are not free workers.] Article Two. Freedom of Speech and Assembly. The right ofthe people to speak freely and to assemble shall not be infringed. This articleincludes the right to advertise products for sale and to compare productsin these advertisements. [Many countries, including Germany, prohibit certaincomparative ads.] Article Three. Prohibition of Child Labor. Children underthe age of fifteen shall have the right to an education and be free fromcoerced labor. [There are two hundred million children under the age of 15"employed" around the world, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Braziland many other nations. Many of these children are sold into slavery andchained to machines.] Article Four. Prohibition of Slave Labor. No person shallbe forced to work or sold into slavery. Prison labor shall be permitted,however, the export of goods made by prison laborers shall be prohibited.[China uses prison labor for exports, including political prisoners] Article Five. Trade Unions Protected. Free and unfetteredtrade unions shall be protected to the fullest extent of the law. All personsshall be allowed to join the trade union of their choice and shall not beretaliated against for joining a union or for soliciting others to join orto form a trade union. Article Six. Environmental Protection. Emissions from factoriesand agricultural chemicals shall be controlled to the maximum extentpossible. Environmental laws of the United States shall be the international standard,but any nation shall be free to establish stricter standards. [Pesticides,such as DDT which is banned in the United States, are now imported on Mexicantomatoes.] Article Seven. Worker Safety and Health. The safety andhealth of workers shall be protected to the maximum extent possible. Theoccupational safety and health laws of the United States shall be theinternational standard, but any nation shall be free to establish stricterstandards. Article Eight. Minimum Wages and Maximum Hours. Factoryand agricultural workers shall be entitled to reasonable wages, in no eventless than one-fourth of the hourly minimum wage in the United States. [Thismeans that manufacturing wages will rise in the Third World to $1 per houror more, giving these workers the ability to buy American products. Now workersin Nike plants in Indonesia, for example, are paid 14 cents per hour andcannot afford to buy the shoes that they produce.] No worker shall be compelled to work more than forty-eight hours per week.[The United States adopted the 40-hour work week decades ago, while Germanyand France have even shorter work weeks.] Article Nine. Barriers to Trade. No nation shall discriminateagainst imports from the United States nor impose other barriers to trade.[Most nations impose more trade barriers than the United States. Many nationshave more favorable trade rules for other nations than for the United Statescausing tariffs and duties that discriminate against American goods.] Article Ten. Illicit Trade Prohibited. Nations shall nottrade illicit drugs, poisonous chemicals or materials capable of being usedin nuclear weapons or in chemical or biological weapons. [When an outlawnation provides others with deadly materials, the United States and othernations have every right to ban trade with that country. Currently, Chinahas been caught by the CIA with selling nuclear equipment to Pakistan. Thisprovision would allow the United States to punish China with tradesanctions.] When someone asks you about Free Trade, be prepared with tough questionsabout slave labor, child labor and human rights. Free trade only works ifeveryone plays by the same rules.

American beer and wine 8. American shoes 9. Xerox copiers 10. Harley-Davidson motorcycles This Week's Topic: Car Wars The trade war with Japan is primarily being fought with automobiles. TheU.S. trade deficit with Japan totals $60 billion, with more than half ofthe deficit due directly to automobiles and auto parts. Even though theyfavor their own market, the Japanese have respect for American workmanship,particularly the Honda Corporation. Honda is manufacturing its sleek HondaAccord Coupe, and its new Honda Stationwagon, only in Marysville, Ohio, andplans to export 50,000 per year of them to Japan. The Accord Stationwagonwas designed from the ground up in the USA and will be exported to Europeand Japan. Thanks to Honda U.S. auto exports to Japan increased significantlylast year. According to a recent survey of prospective automobile purchasers conductedby the Made in the USA Foundation most consumers do not know where carsare made. More than seventy-five percent of American consumers surveyed thoughtthat the Pontiac LeMans was made in the U.S.A., when in fact it is made inSouth Korea. The majority wrongly believed that the Honda Accord was importedfrom Japan. Similarly, Motor Trend magazine awarded the Honda Accord it's"Import Car of the Year" award for 1994 even though the Accord is made inMarysville, Ohio! A significant problem, then, is determining what productsare made where so that consumers can make informed purchasing decisions. Because of this confusion in the marketplace Made in the USA was ableto convince Congress that a new law was needed: The American Automobile LabelingAct becomes law in the Fall of 1994. It requires all new cars to includethe U.S. content of the car on the price sticker. Because of this law everySaturn will proudly announce that it is 98% American. On the other hand the number of Americans who want to buy American productsis rising. According to Cambridge Reports, the number of Americans who madea conscious decision against buying foreign products increased from 21% in1985 to 39% in 1989. Made in the USA Foundation estimates that in 1994 it now surpasses 50%.In automobiles, the U.S. marketshare has increased from 73% to 75% since1992. The Saturn is taking the Asian imports on head-on. General Motors assignedits top engineers to the Saturn division, already resulting in 16 patentsbeing issued for improvements to automobile technology and Saturn has 15other patent applications pending. Saturn engineers developed the sixthgeneration of anti-lock brakes. Joining in the battle is the new Dodge/Plymouth Neon. Finally, ChryslerCorporation has decided that it can replace its Mitsubishi-built Colts witha superior American-made product. The new Neon all by itself will save thousandsof American jobs and turn a billion dollar corner in the trade imbalancewith Japan.

Canada and Europe are dumping imported goods on us, and Mexico, Latin America and Asia are invading the U.S. with goods made by child labor. Meanwhile, China thumbs its nose at us while subjugating its citizens, employing prison labor and selling nuclear arms to Pakistan. Pakistan, at the same time, allows the sale of eight year olds to rug manufacturers who produce carpets for the American market. And we call this free trade. Moreover, Canada, our closest ally and friend, has been taking us to the cleaners in the trade wars. Canada sells us huge quantities of subsidized lumber, but refuses to buy our beer and has been holding the value of the Canadian dollar down for years. While we may have a $200 billion dollar trade deficit for the first time in history, most politicians esouse a "don't worry, be happy" attitude. The Clinton Administration continues to boast about our exports, yet these same policy wonks have ignored the rising tide of imported goods. Unfortunately, the resulting trade deficit has cost us four million jobs. Statistics indicate that six million Americans are now unemployed Americans and millions more work for less than they did five years ago. These figures do not even mention the fact that many Americans also have to work two jobs to make ends meet. But we can't rely on a government solution to this problem- we have to do it ourselves. And we can. While a $200 billion trade deficit sounds insurmountable, it helps to look at this problem at the individual level- what economists call microeconomics. If we divide the total U.S. trade deficit by the country's population, we find that the average American has a trade deficit of about $740 per year, or about two dollars a day. This deficit amounts to the equivalent of buying one Japanese automobile every decade, or doing your Christmas shopping for a week. Of course, many Christmas decorations are from China, as are many toys. But does buying Chinese toys and electronic gadgets that may have been made by political prisoners further the Christmas spirit? If you buy a bottle of imported beer every day, you may think that it is a small matter, only $2 a day. Yet this adds up to over $700 a year, the average American's personal trade deficit. Why not try an American microbrew instead? Or if you buy Perrier or another imported water every day for a few dollars, why not try America's own water, Quibell or Lauret? Bloomingdale's features elegant holiday gift baskets that include only imported products, candy from Holland, apple cider from Canada, cookies from Scotland and cheese from France. I received one of these baskets as a gift and promptly returned it, trading the gift in for American products. Why doesn't Bloomingdales offer a gift basket with a variety of American products? It could include olives from California, cheese from Wisconsin, cookies from Maine, Salmon from Washington State and citrus from Florida. Instead of bringing a bottle of French wine or champagne as a gift for your friends or relatives, think about giving them an American present, perhaps something from your hometown or one of these regional specialties. During World War II every American on the home-front had to make sacrifices because of the rationing of gasoline, butter, meat and other essentials. Now Americans are so pampered that we get upset if our cable service is interrupted for a few minutes. The same could be said for our purchasing practices. Are we so lazy that we consider it a sacrifice to look at labels when shopping for products? Are we so spoiled that we won't go a little bit out of the way to find American products? Automobile imports remain a large chunk of our trade deficit. We have started to sell a small stream of American cars to Japan, but we are still flooded with boatloads of Japanese imports. According to J.D. Power and Associates, the quality of American cars and Japanese cars is virtually equal, with European cars lagging far behind. However, the myth of Japanese and European superiority still survives. If your heart is still set on a Japanese automobile or a European one, how much of a sacrifice is it to buy a comparable car made in the USA? Acura already manufactures several of its models in America. BMW makes its Z3 model in its new state-of-the-art plant in South Carolina. Honda has been making Accords and Civics in Ohio for more than ten years. Toyota manufactures its Corolla, Camry and Avalon models in California and Kentucky. Nissan makes the Quest minivan here, as well as the Altima and some Sentras. With this wide variety of "imported" models made in the USA, there is no reason to buy an imported car. For help in buying American products you will need a copy of a book, Made in the USA: The Complete Guide to Buying America's Best Products and a telephone. The guide shows you how to find top-quality American-made products via catalog and by telephone. Unfortunately, many retailers only carry cheap foreign goods marked up 400% instead of American-made products that they can only be doubled in price. It's really not much of a sacrifice to order products over the phone or through the mail because you'll be saving gasoline and time. Plus, most of that gasoline is imported anyway, so you will be protecting the American economy in two ways. The truth is, you're not really the one undergoing hardships by searching out American products. It's the eight-year olds who stitch Nike soccer balls in Pakistan who have made the sacrifices, not the Americans. But the American dream can be restored by a new movement, lead by our youngest citizens, to look for U.S.-made products. I call upon younger generations to give up your Nintendos, Volkswagens, Nikes and Evian spring water. You complain about the state in which this country has been left, but now you can do something to improve it while contributing to an American revival. The future of America is in your hands. Think about this every time you open your wallet- and vote with your dollars for American-made products. It's a small sacrifice to make.

company name, ZIP code, city or state (two-letter postal abbreviation) Search Engine Behavior Searches are performed across several fields: company name city state (two-letter postal abbreviation) ZIP Code The engine can take as many keywords as you can fit into the box. Separate keywordswith a space. If a match of any of your keywords occurs with any field in the master database, the engine will display the match. Matches are not restricted to whole-word matches. For example, if you use"wis" as your keyword, you'll pull up matches with "Wisdom"and "Lewis." The engine is not case-sensitive. Tips for Searching Try to use one or two keywords that are unique to the company you are searching for. "Less is More"— The fewer characters you use in the search, the more matches you'll get. If you want to find only those companies in your ZIP code, simply typein your ZIP code. Do likewise for area code, city and state. However, searching by thesemethods, especially by the two-letter state abbreviation, will bring up other matches thatreally shouldn't be included.

The Background: In 1994, the Wilson Administration and the California State Legislature,responding to the concerns of the more than 8,000 licensed smog-check stationswhich make up the state's $480 million vehicle emissions test and repairindustry, entered into lengthy negotiations with the United States EnvironmentalProtection Agency regarding new federal mandates for vehicle emissions controls.At the outset, the USEPA's position was that every vehicle owner in Californiawould be required to obtain a smog check at a centralized "test only"center. The legislature convinced the USEPA to allow California to designits own unique hybrid program, in which only about 15 percent of the vehiclesin the state will be sent to test-only facilities, with the remaining 85percent continuing to obtain emissions tests at traditional test-and-repairshops. The 15 percent of vehicles that will go to test-only/referee centersare likely "gross polluters"--those vehicles with such high emissionsthat they are responsible for at least half of all the vehicular smog inthe state. Although the hybrid program has the support of the majority of the vehiclerepair industry, including the California Service Station and AutomotiveRepair Association, a tiny segment of the industry remains dissatisfiedwith the compromise, and has spread information that is simply inaccurate.As a result of this campaign, serious misstatements of fact regarding thenew Smog Check II program have recently been aired on late night radio call-inshows, and in paid newspaper advertisements and anonymous flyers. Beloware some of the most often-stated mischaracterizations of the program, repeatedverbatim, followed by the relevant facts. Here are some of the errors and facts, arranged in an easy-to-read menu,with hyperlinks to the actual solutions: "The new Smog Check II program is a 'central smog testing program.'" "Sixty percent of vehicles will fail the test." "If you fail the test, your car will be confiscated." "If your car is confiscated, it will be crushed." "The state will run the test-only centers." Thirty percent of all vehicles will have to go to test-only centers. "Everyone who goes to a test-only center will have to wait in line for hours." "Once identified as a gross polluter, a car must return to a test only center every year as long as it is on the road." "The state wants to crush your car so it can sell emissions credits to big factories." "Cars are not a major source of pollution." "Factories are the source of more pollution than cars are." "A major company that (operates "centralized programs") has greased a lot of politicians will have a monopoly in supplying these tests." "Only 70 percent of cars, or fewer, can be tested in a few remaining local shops..." "Tests could cost up to $100." "Remote sensor vans will video everyone's license plates and send citations." "This is not about achieving safer air." "The Federal Government forced California to comply with this program...and your California federal legislators capitulated." Error: The new Smog Check II program is a 'central smog testing program.'" Fact: As noted in the introduction, California's Enhanced Smog Check IIprogram, is not a centralized program. As a result of the state legislature'ssuccessful negotiations with the USEPA, we instead created a unique hybridprogram in which an estimated 15 percent of the state's vehicles are testedat a test-only/referee center, and the remainder - a full 85 percent - stillobtain tests at traditional privately-operated neighborhood repair shopsand service stations. Error: "Sixty percent of vehicles will fail the test." Fact: While it is true that more vehicles will fail than have in the past(because the new, more sophisticated equipment can now test for an additionalhighly toxic pollutant, NOx, as well as more accurately gauge other emissions),the rate of failure will not be anything near 60 percent. No more than about30 percent are expected to fail the test, and only half of those cars --roughly 15 percent of the cars in the state -- are expected to be foundto have such high emissions that they are classified as gross polluters. Error: "If you fail the test, your car will be confiscated." Fact: The Smog Check II program does not include a provision for vehicleconfiscation. In fact, the new program does not include any new complianceenforcement measures, but instead relies solely on existing state law. Undercurrent California law, the Department of Motor Vehicles will not issuea registration renewal to a vehicle that fails an emission test. Typically,the California Highway Patrol and local law enforcement agencies issue citationsto motorists who do not comply with registration requirements. Error: "If your car is confiscated, it will be crushed." Fact: The Smog Check II program never included a provision for involuntaryvehicle scrappage. The legislature did establish a mechanism for a buy-backprogram as an option available to the owners of vehicles that failed thetest, and who wished to participate in the program. However, it was envisionedthat revenues for the buy-back program, and for a repair-assistance program,would be raised through a $39 fee that new-car buyers would pay in orderto be allowed to skip their first smog check, due 2 years after theirinitial purchase. The program received limited contributions and is stillunder development. Error: "The state will run the test-only centers." Fact: The state will award a legally required minimum of two contracts througha competitive bid process to private industry to operate test-only/refereecenters, much as it currently contracts for existing referee stations. Error: Thirty percent of all vehicles will have to go to test-only centers. Fact: At least for the first few years, no more than 15 percent of all thevehicles in any area will be called into a test-only/referee center forthe biennial test. Gross polluters, once fixed, will be required to returnannually for 2 years to the same centers. Error: "Everyone who goes to a test-only center will have to wait inline for hours." Fact: That would have been the case if California had agreed to the USEPA'soriginal demands, which would have meant that all the state's motorists wouldhave to have their car tested at a test-only facility. Under the hybridprogram, however, only 15 percent of the cars will be sent to the test-only/refereenetwork. Although the test-only/referee center contracts have not yet beenawarded, two criteria for awarding the contract are consumer convenienceand short wait times. Error: "Cars are not a major source of pollution." Fact: Vehicles are the source of at least half of all the smog in California. Error: "Gross polluters are not a major source of pollution...thisprogram will not clean the air." Fact: Gross polluters, although they comprise only about 15 percent of theentire vehicle fleet, are responsible for half the state's vehicular pollution:that is, a full quarter of California's smog. The Rand Corporation has severelycriticized California's old smog-check program for failing to require therepair of gross polluters which, according to a Rand senior policy analyst,was "a failure because it didn't concentrate on the 5 to 10 percentof cars that are the highest polluting." Requiring emissions-relatedrepairs for gross polluters will make significant strides in cleaning theair. Error: "Gross polluters must be immediately repaired...at any cost." Fact: Confirmed gross-polluting vehicles must be repaired and broughtbelow gross-polluter levels. After that, if the vehicle still fails itssmog test, there are waivers and extensions available to give motoriststime to same money for the needed repairs. But within 2 years, vehicleswill need to be repaired to the required standard. Error: "Once identified as a gross polluter, a car must return to atest-only center every year as long as it is on the road." Fact: By statute, identified gross polluters may be required to return toa test-only/referee center every year for 2 years. Error: "The state wants to crush your car so it can sell emissionscredits to big factories." Fact: There is not yet a state scrap program developed. However, the stateprogram will focus solely on mobile source emissions reduction credits,which are not available to stationary sources for swapping. As previouslystated, participation in any scrap program will be voluntary. Error: "Factories are the source of more pollution than cars are." Fact: Most scientists agree that fixed-point pollution has been reducedas much as possible, leaving vehicles as the most significant source ofsmog that can be reduced through more effective controls. Error: "A major company that (operates "centralized programs")has greased a lot of politicians will have a monopoly in supplyingthese tests." Fact: There will not be a monopoly. The law requires a minimum of twotest-only contracts, and the state will likely let three contracts. Sixdifferent companies currently manufacture dynamometers. Error: "Only 70 percent of cars, or fewer, can be tested in a few remaininglocal shops..." Fact: A minimum of 85 percent of the vehicles will continue to be tested at localneighborhood repair shops, the majority of which are expected to continueas licensed smog-check stations under the new program. Error: "Tests could cost up to $100." Fact: The cost of smog tests, as always, will be market-driven. Althoughprices are likely to rise, it is highly unlikely that they will increaseto $100. Error: "Remote-sensor vans will video everyone's license plates andsend citations." Fact: Remote sensing devices (RSDs) will identify only likely gross polluters.Subsequent notices sent to vehicle owners will not be citations, but willmerely require confirmatory smog tests. Those vehicles confirmed as grosspolluters will then be required to be repaired. This ensures that vehiclesonce repaired stay repaired and thus reduce pollution. Remote sensing isrequired in the hybrid system negotiated with, and approved by, the USEPA. Error: "This is not about achieving safer air." Fact: Smog Check II, by identifying those few vehicles responsible formost of the pollution that comes from car exhausts, and by requiring everyoneto take personal responsibility for keeping their vehicles properly maintained,will clean as much as 25 percent of the existing pollution from our air. Error: The Federal Government forced California to comply with this program...and your California legislators capitulated." Fact: California did not adopt the 100-percent test-only program preferredby the federal government. Far from capitulating, a bipartisan majorityof California's state legislature, along with the Wilson administration,worked for many months to create a program designed to achieve three majorgoals: protect small business by preserving the $480 million smog-checkindustry; protect the majority of Californians from unnecessary inconvenience;and the health of all Californians by making our air significantly cleaner.

Back to the FAQ home page Some General Information: Production Cost RFG costs more to produce than California 1994 conventional gasoline.To make California RFG, most refiners must invest in new equipment, addprocessing steps and use more expensive blending ingredients. Dependingon the refiner, these steps or changes will increase production costs byabout 5 to 15 cents per gallon (an average of 10 cents). This includes theadditional 2 to 5 cents per gallon needed to make federal Phase I RFG. However, even though RFG will cost more, it makes economic as wellas environmental sense. When compared with other methods of reducing airpollution, such as additional controls on businesses, RFG is a very cost-effectiveway to clean the air. Price at the Pump The price of gasoline cannot be accurately predicted because it is influencedby many factors, including production costs, weather, crude oil prices,and product supply and demand. However, it is expected that increased RFGproduction costs will be reflected in the price at the pump. Facts About Cleaner-burning Gasoline An Improved Gasoline Formula Cleaner-burning gasoline is an improved gasoline formula that pollutesless. It is not a new fuel, it is still gasoline. By spring of l996, all Californians will be using cleaner-burninggasoline. California's Air Pollution Problem Continues More than 90 percent of Californians breathe unhealthy air. Gasoline-powered vehicles and equipment contribute about half thepollution that makes California's air among the most polluted in the country. Health Benefits are Significant You will have healthier air to breathe. Using cleaner-burning gasolinelowers emissions of pollutants that cause or contribute to health problemssuch as heart and lung disease. Reduces the cancer risk from gasoline emissions by more than one-third. Large Emission Reductions Provides one of the largest emission reductions in California's longfight against smog by reducing smog-forming emissions from motor vehiclesby 15 percent. This is equivalent to removing 3.5 million cars from California'sroads and freeways. Immediately reduces more than 3 million pounds a day of unhealthfulair pollutants from vehicles. No Change in Performance You can use cleaner-burning gasoline in your car exactly the sameway as today's gasoline. Cleaner-burning gasoline works just as well as today's gasoline inboats, jet skis, garden equipment and other gasoline-powered engines. Cleaner-burning gasoline will be available in the same octane levelsas current gasoline. Tested Extensively In cooperation with experts representing automobile manufacturers,gasoline manufacturers, and government, the APB extensively tested cleaner-burninggasoline in hundreds of vehicles. More than 5 million miles were driven on cleaner-burning gasoline.This comprehensive test program did not identify any increase in problemswith the use of cleaner-burning gasoline. Many car parts, especially fuel-system components, fail and requirereplacement during the normal life of the vehicle. Cleaner-burning gasolinewill not change this. Cleaner-burning gasoline did not increase problems in fuel systems.However, testing did show that, on average, vehicles about 10 years oldand older, particularly those with more than 90,000 miles, can experiencea fairly high level of fuel-system problems due to normal wear and tear.Owners of such vehicles are encouraged to have their fuel-system inspectedand to follow their vehicle manufacturer's recommendations regarding maintenanceof fuel system parts. Gas Mileage On average, cleaner-burning gasoline may result in a very small (less thanone-half mile per gallon) reduction in gasoline mileage when compared tothe fuel that is currently being used. Price Cleaner-burning gasoline costs more to produce. Depending on the refinery,this increase in production cost varies from 5 to 15 cents per gallon. Gasolineprices are determined by competitive market forces. The price you will seeat the gasoline pump cannot be accurately predicted. It is expected thatat least some of the increased rest will ultimately be reflected in pricesat the pump. Questions and Answers About Cleaner-burning Gasoline What is California cleaner-burning gasoline? It is an improved gasoline formula that pollutes our air less. Itis not a new fuel. It has been extensively tested under real-world conditions. By spring of 1996, Californians who purchase gasoline for use invehicles or equipment will be using cleaner-burning gasoline. Why does California need cleaner-burning gasoline? Over 90 percent of Californians breathe unhealthy air. Gasoline-powered vehicles and equipment contribute about half thepollution that makes California's air among the most polluted in the country. Do Californians support cleaner-burning gasoline? Yes. Californians want cleaner air: 80 percent of Californians polled statewidesupport the use of cleaner-burning gasoline to help clean California's air. What are the emissions benefits of cleaner-burning gasoline? Cleaner-burning gasoline provides one of the largest emissions reductionsin California's long fight against smog by reducing smog-forming emissionsfrom motor vehicles by 15 percent. This is equivalent to removing 3.5 millioncars from California's roads and freeways. Using cleaner-burning gasoline immediately reduces more than 3 millionpounds a day of unhealthful air pollutants from vehicles. What are the health benefits from using cleaner-burning gasoline? You will have healthier air to breathe. Using cleaner-burning gasolinelowers emissions of pollutants that cause or contribute to health problemssuch as heart and lung disease and asthma. Cleaner-burning gasoline reduces the cancer risk from vehicle emissionsby more than one-third. Emissions of benzene, a known carcinogen, are reducedby one-half. Will cleaner-burning gasoline work in all gasoline-powered engines? Yes. You can use cleaner-burning gasoline in exactly the same wayas the gasoline you are currently using. Cleaner-burning gasoline worksjust as well as today's gasoline in boats, jet skis, garden equipment, chainsaws, and other gasoline-powered engines. Cleaner-burning gasoline will be available in the same octane levelsas current gasoline. Has cleaner-burning gasoline been tested? Yes. Under the guidance of an Advisory Committee, which includesexperts representing automobile manufacturers, gasoline manufacturers, andgovernment, the Air Resources Board (ARB) tested the fuel in hundreds ofvehicles and other gasoline-powered equipment. More than 5 million miles were driven on cleaner-burning gasoline.This comprehensive program did not identify any increase in problems withthe use of cleaner-burning gasoline. Many car parts, especially fuel-system components, fail and requirereplacement during the normal life of the vehicle. Cleaner-burning gasolinewill not change this. The test program indicated that cleaner-burning gasolinedid not increase problems in fuel systems. Testing did show that, on average, vehicles about 10 years old andolder, particularly those with more than 90,000 miles, can experience afairly high level of fuel-system problems due to normal wear and tear. Ownersof such vehicles are encouraged to have their fuel system inspected andto follow their vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for maintenance offuel-system parts. Will I notice any change in gas mileage with cleaner-burning gasoline? Possibly. On average, cleaner-burning gasoline may result in a very small(less than one-half mile per gallon) reduction in car mileage from the fuelthat you are currently using. Many factors affect the actual vehicle fueleconomy one may experience. These include driving habits, vehicle conditionand tire pressure. Because of these and other factors, even with the samegasoline, your mileage can vary by several miles per gallon from one fill-upto the next. Will I have to pay more for cleaner-burning gasoline? Possibly. Cleaner-burning gasoline costs more to produce. Dependingon the refinery, this increase in production cost varies from 5 to 15 centsper gallon. However, the price you will see at the pump cannot be accuratelypredicted. The price of cleaner-burning gasoline is subject to and will be determinedby competitive forces in the marketplace. Many factors including productioncosts, weather, crude oil prices, taxes and supply and demand affect gasolineprices. It is expected that at least some of the increased cost to make cleaner-burninggasoline will be reflected in prices at the pump. What's in cleaner-burning gasoline? All gasoline is made from a recipe of basic ingredients. Cleaner-burninggasoline is composed of these same basic ingredients, but is less pollutingbecause the recipe requires more cleaner-burning components and fewer toxiccompounds. The general cleaner-burning gasoline recipe: Reduces benzene (a known human carcinogen) in gasoline by one-half Lowers the amount of fuel that evaporates from your vehicle; Reduces the amount of sulfur in gasoline by 80 percent, which allowsyour vehicle catalyst to perform more effectively; Reduces aromatic hydrocarbons, a part of gasoline that contributesto smog-forming emissions; and Adds oxygen-containing compounds, which allow gasoline to burn morecompletely in your engine. Oxygenates have been added to gasoline sincethe mid-1970s to enhance octane. Will using cleaner-burning gasoline really make a difference? Yes. It is equivalent to leaving your car at home one day a week. Is cleaner-burning gasoline toxic? Yes. Cleaner-burning gasoline reduces emissions and exposure to toxic substances,which result from the evaporation and combustion of gasoline. Although usingcleaner-burning gasoline reduces emissions of smog-forming and toxic pollutants,like conventional gasoline, cleaner-burning gasoline is a hazardous substance.You should continue to take precautions to avoid exposure to gasoline vaporswhen pumping and handling any gasoline. You should never swallow or siphonany gasoline. Does the State regulate the price of gasoline? No. Why did the State require cleaner-burning gasoline if it may cost moreat the pump? Healthier air is worth it. Cleaner-burning gasoline is one of theleast costly remaining ways to reduce emissions of pollutants into our air.Its use will immediately reduce more than 3 million pounds of pollutionfrom being released to the air each day. Cleaner-burning gasoline is one of the most significant measuresneeded to help California meet state and federal health standards for airquality. Do automobile manufacturers recommend using cleaner-burning gasoline? Yes. Automobile manufacturers participated in the development of the specificationsfor cleaner-burning gasoline and recommend its use in their vehicles. Will using cleaner-burning gasoline affect my vehicle's warranty? No. Will I have to make any changes in order to use cleaner-burning gasoline? No. You can use cleaner-burning gasoline in exactly the same way as thegasoline you are currently using. The same applies to boats, jet skis, gardenequipment, chainsaws and other gasoline-burning engines. It will be availablein the same octane ratings as current gasoline. How extensive was the testing program? The ARB and industry experts conducted a comprehensive 6-month testingprogram. Hundreds of vehicles, as well as other gasoline-powered equipment,used cleaner-burning gasoline during this program. More than 5 million mileswere driven on cleaner-burning gasoline. As part of this testing program, more than 800 vehicles from severalfleets, including Bank of America, GTE California, Pacific Bell, CalTrans,the City and County of Sacramento and California State University, Fresno,were tested on cleaner-burning gasoline. Cleaner-burning gasoline was alsotested on a broad range of other gasoline-burning equipment, including lawnmowers,tractors, leaf blowers, edgers, forklifts, snowmobiles, motorcycles, jetskis and marine pleasure craft. Is there just one way to make cleaner-burning gasoline? No. Gasoline manufacturers will be making their own decisions on theirrecipe for cleaner-burning gasoline. Though individual gasolines may vary,all gasoline produced for sale in California after spring of 1996 will becleaner-burning gasoline. Is there a program to ensure that all gasoline produced in Californiaafter the spring of 1996 is cleaner-burning gasoline? Yes. The State has a comprehensive compliance program to ensure all ofthe gasoline produced for sale in California after spring of 1996 is cleaner-burninggasoline. What is methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and why is it used? MTBE is an oxygenate that helps gasoline burn more completely. Federallaw requires that most gasoline in California contain oxygenates. MTBE isthe oxygenate that most gasoline manufacturers choose to use. Is MTBE something new? No. MTBE has been used in gasoline since the mid-70s. In 1995, about 9billion gallons of oxygenated gasoline were used in California, the majorityof which contained MTBE. Is MTBE the only oxygenate that can be used in cleaner-burning gasoline? No. MTBE is one of several possible oxygenates expected to be used by gasolinemanufacturers to produce cleaner-burning gasoline. MTBE is expected to continueto be the most widely used oxygenate in California. Other oxygenates expectedto be used are ethanol and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE). What is known about MTBE and health? In some states there were complaints of nausea and headaches possibly beingassociated with MTBE. However, recent health studies have found no associationbetween MTBE and these complaints. California health experts are continuingto monitor other MTBE health studies that are currently being conducted. Does cleaner-burning gasoline smell different from conventional gasoline? No. Cleaner-burning gasoline is not expected to smell differentthan the gasoline that most people are currently using. If an odor is noticed,it is probably from oxygenates, usually MTBE. Most gasoline service stations in California use vapor recovery systemsto minimize the exposure of motorists and service-station personnel to gasolineodors and fumes while refueling. Who developed cleaner-burning gasoline? The specifications for cleaner-burning gasoline were developed by ARB engineersand scientists in consultation with gasoline and automobile manufacturersand others. Data from thousands of vehicle tests were used to develop thespecifications. Will there be adequate supplies of cleaner-burning gasoline? Yes, Cleaner-burning gasoline will be available in California tomeet the demand. However, as we have experienced in the past, it is possiblethat unusual conditions could lead to a temporary disruption in die fuelsupply. The State has worked extensively with gasoline manufacturers anddistributors to ensure that adequate supplies of cleaner-burning gasolineare produced and distributed. A mechanism to help ensure adequate suppliesin unusual conditions is in place and ready if needed. What if we need to use more gasoline in the future? As in the past, we expect the market will adjust to meet demand. Is cleaner-burning gasoline the only thing that California is doing tomake the air cleaner? Cleaner-burning gasoline is only one part of a wide range of programs toimprove air quality in California. Other programs include efforts to cleanup cars, trucks, buses, factories, consumer products and other sources.These programs benefit all Californians by helping to clean the air. Inaddition to the above efforts, there are a number of steps that people cantake to reduce air pollution. These include: properly maintaining theirvehicle, car pooling and planning trips to avoid bumper-to-bumper traffic. Will I see cleaner air with cleaner-burning gasoline? White cleaner-burning gasoline is an important component of our programto provide healthy air for Californians, it will not single-handedly eliminateCalifornia's air pollution problem. However, cleaner-burning gasoline incombination with other programs will lead to reduced levels of air pollutionand therefore better air quality.

California's "Cleaner Burning Gasoline": Boom or Bust? The following information about cleaner burning gasoline was provided bythe Society of Automotive Engineers and does not necessarily reflect SEMA's views onthis issue. In June 1996 the California Air Resources Board required the introduction of CARB reformulated gasoline phase 2 (RFG) throughout California, although its phase-in began early in the year. The fuel was supposed to reduce ozone precursor emissions from vehicles by 15 percent and reduce the emissions of carcinogenic compounds such as benzene up to 40 percent. Since then, significant controversy has emerged regarding the fuel and its use. Reports regarding large drops in fuel economy of up to 50 percent (ARB predicted a 1-percent to 3- percent drop), increased fuel leaks and fuel system component failures (especially on older and some imported vehicles), and increased frequencies of vehicle fires were all attributed to RFG. Preliminary testing performed by and/or for CARB had not identified any of these problems. What are the facts? Are Californians driving leaking bombs (and getting poor fuel economy at the same time)? Or does RFG clean the air in a safe and economical fashion as "advertised?" My employer, the Automobile Club of Southern California, decided to try to find out. In late winter 1996 we performed a small test utilizing the Federal Test Procedure (on our emission dynamometer) to evaluate the effects of the fuel on fuel economy and tailpipe emissions. We also used a test track to evaluate acceleration (SAE recommended Practice J1491) and measured interior noise levels as well. Also, driveability was evaluated on the road under a variety of conditions. Results of this test concurred with CARB predictions. Emissions were improved about 15 percent; fuel economy dropped less than 3 percent; and acceleration, noise and driveability were not affected when comparing RFG with the base fuel available at the time. After the release of these test results, the controversy continued and since a short-term performance test could not verify or disprove the reports of deteriorating and leaking fuel systems, The Auto Club decided to follow-up the test program with a survey of motorists conducted in late September. A total of 10,200 motorists who own vehicles from 1923 to 1997 were polled. Questions were asked about fuel economy, fuel system leaks and repairs and fires. Results include: FUEL ECONOMY: Those motorists who consistently track their fuel economy have experienced on average a drop in miles per gallon of 1.7 percent in 1996. FUEL LEAKS: About 3 percent of respondents had some sort of fuel system leak repaired in 1996. While this is considered a "normal" overall rate, 5.5 percent of pre-1982 vehicles received repairs in 1996 versus only l percent of post-1981 vehicles. These results may also be "normal," but the higher rate for older cars bears (and will receive) further study. VEHICLE FIRES: Out of the entire survey, only 19 vehicle fires were reported. Of these, only one fuel-related vehicle fire occurred since the introduction of RFG. The bottom line appears to be that RFG is performing as predicted. Nineteen ninety-six has brought the best air quality to Southern California on record. Further study must continue on older cars to make sure that RFG is not deteriorating fuel system components. --Steve Mazor, Chairman, Society of Automotive Engineers, Southern California Section Back to the FAQ Directory Last updated: Jan. 13, 1997 by Webmaster.

Forests are also important for environmental aspects, i.e.to determine clear cuts. Remote sensing offers possibilities ofregular surveys but due to the cloud cover microwaves are importantto use as a complement to optical sensors. The group has been involved in analyzing the possibilities forbole volume (biomass) determination by using polarimetric datafrom the JPL AirSAR, intensity and interferometric data from ERS-1and intensity data from JERS-1. Investigations using the low frequencyairborne CARABAS system developed by the National Defense ResearchEstablishment are also ongoing. Images have been provided from Ottenbylund, Öland, and fromMaine, USA. Field investigation have taken place at Ottenbylundand it has been shown that the sensitivity for stem volume hasnot saturated like higher frequency SAR systems for the observedstem volume (up to 210 m3/ha). A program for developing models forthe radar scattering is ongoing. Compared to models developedat higher frequencies it is important to investigate what forestproperties dominate the scattering, to what extent coherent interactionstake place and to what extent ground penetration takes place. Presently the main forestry projects in the group are relatedto ERS and JERS interferometry and toCARABAS.

This INSAR technique is promising for determiningdigital elevation models as well as for land classification. AtC-band, used by ERS-1, the top layer of trees are the main reflectinglayer and an effective height (related to forest properties) ofthe forest over the surrounding field can be determined. The remote sensing group has been involved in an ESA prject co-ordinatedby Matra Cap Systems for interferometric applications for forestry.Results will within soon be available on WWW.

The usefulness of SAR imaging has been shownto be good but a major limitation presently is the coverage. Seaice is a very dynamic feature and the area need to be coveredwith a 1 - 3 day interval. An ongoing project is remote sensing of sea ice in the Arcticfor development of remote sensing methods to determine climatechange influence on the ice as well as navigational aspects. Recentlyfinished or ongoing projects are: Shipbased scatterometer investigationsof sea ice, Ice ridge modelling, SAR and SSM/I intercomparison,Ice motion over the Yermak Plateau. Some of the activities are illustrated in figure: illustrating field acitivities on the ice surface for measurementsof ice roughness (main picture). The upper figures illustratethe ship based scatterometer antenna, an ice image acquired withvideo, from helicopter, and a sub-image of a SAR image acquiredby ERS-1 (© ESA, ERS-1,1991). An Arctic expedition took place in 1991 to the high Arctic withthe Swedish ice breaker Oden and the German research vessel Polarstern.The same ships participated in an expedition in 1996. In 1991 the very first ERS-1 SAR images at high latitudes in connectionwith a field experiment were acquired for the program onboardOden for Remote Sensing and Sea ice (Jan Askne, PI) and in 1996similarly some of the first RADARSAT images at high latitude inconjunction with field experiments.
