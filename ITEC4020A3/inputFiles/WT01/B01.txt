Over a period of 30 days the mixture of organic materials is processed within a special reactor silo. Forced air enhances the work of normal bacteria to break down the wood and waste in a manner similar to leaves turning to soil on the forest floor. The process, completed under the controlled conditions of the reactor, is much faster. Once the mixtue is allowed to cure for another 20 days, it is then ready to use as a soil enhancer. The sawdust is used with an equal mix of biosolids to make the compost. Sawdust is a bi-product of the lumber industry and, like sludge, was previously disposed of at a land fill. The sawdust, because of its fine texture, breaks down faster than other amendments such as wood chips, that may also be used in the composting process, Sawdust also provides a consistent compost which is very important to many users, especially golf courses, where it is used in the most demanding situations such as on their greens. Compost applied properly will enhance growth of grass, flowers, shrubs, etc. by improving the basic soils. Recycling is good for the environment and in many cases good business. Prior to making compost, the City of Geneva spent approximately $160,000 in land fill fees per year to dispose of the waste water treatment sludge. The operation of making compost costs approximately $90,000 per year and the final compost product is sold for nearly half that amount. In short, recycling netted a savings of approximately $110,000 per year over the previous manner of doing business. | Lead Page | The Process | The Product | E-mail | Fax | Copyright 1996: Spider Graphics Corporation Last updated June, 1996 WT01-B01-3IA073-000475-B028-184http://www.city.geneva.ny.us:80/mar3.htm 192.108.245.124 19970121041442 text/html 3616HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Tue, 21 Jan 1997 04:13:38 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 3445Last-modified: Tue, 09 Jul 1996 03:57:50 GMT The Compost Product The compost product: Biosolids compost is a clean, pathogen-free soil enhancer.

An additional office opened in 1990 in the Long Beach area. However, the Center's reputation for successfully treating severely overweight people extends beyond Southern California; patients are referred from all states in the Continental US as well as from abroad. Bariatric Surgery is the exclusive concern of the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity. This concentrated focus has provided Dr. Mathias Fobi with the basis for perfecting the Fobi-Pouch for Obesity procedure and providing his patients with a safe, well tolerated and very effective method to lose weight and maintain weight loss. The Medical Staff of the CSTO continues research and education to treat obesity and provides information that will assist in unlocking the genetic mystery behind obesity. Dr.Fobi is internationally recognized for his efforts and is frequently asked to lecture on his findings.. The CSTO participates in several professional organizations, including the American Society for Bariatric Surgery, the North American Association for the Study of Obesity and the American College of Clinical Nutrition. Dr. Mathias Fobi received his M.D. at the University of Cincinnati in 1974. His advanced training was at Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital, Los Angeles (residency and internship), Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles and Cottage Hospital, Santa Barbara. He is board certified by the American Board of Surgery and is a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons (F.A.C.S.). Additionally, he is a member of the American Medical Association, the Los Angeles Medical Association, the National Medical Association, the California Medical Association, the Charles R. Drew Society, the Los Angeles Surgical Society, the North American Association for the Study of Obesity, the American Society of Bariatric Surgery and the American College of Clinical Nutrition. Dr. Fobi, along with CSTO medical staff Dr.s Hoil Lee and Ronald Holness, believe that through increased education, research and clinical treatment, there is hope for the clinically morbid obese patient. Patient Testimonials At the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity, we have learned from our patients, how, in their years of battling weight problems, they were very isolated and shied away from any attention. They were reluctant to talk about themselves or the troubles they've experienced while being overweight. Now that these same patients have conquered their weight problem, they want to tell the world about all the wonderful things that are happening to them. And we say that a picture is worth a thousand words -- but here is a little of both, straight from some of our patients. Kandy Wendell knew that being overweight was killing her. She spent more than her time in an Emergency Room from significant health problems associated with being overweight. She suffered from high blood pressure, diabetes, agonizing headaches and she had difficulty breathing and walking. At this point, she weighed 350 lbs. "I was a true couch potato," she admits, "I would come home from work and go immediately to bed because I was so exhausted.-- Can you imagine what's it like to carry an extra 200 lbs? It's like being on a chain gang!" If she didn't get rid of her excess weight, she dreaded what her life was going to be. She remembers the day that she overheard a coworker, also a patient of the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity, being complimented on how well she looked after losing weight. "I had to know how she did it, " thought Kandy. When she did find out, she took the information to her family physician who helped her determine that this method could help her, too. Her family was also supportive, so it made it easier to make this decision -- one that she doesn't regret. Kandy scheduled her surgery in February 1994 and , at age 47, maintains her weight at 160 lbs. "I'm proud of my decision and I am actually participating in life, now." Walking, dancing and an increased social life are now part of her regular activities. Kandy talks about what it was like to be out with friends and only being able to watch from the fringes because her weight and health problems limited her from doing things that are second nature now. "I really believe that I was given a second chance at life. I feel better and I look forward to every day." Her medical problems are a thing of the past, too. Her doctors report that her medical numbers (high blood pressure, diabetes, triglycerides, cholesterol) are text book perfect. See Kandy today. Health problems also plagued Ken Sullivan, too. Within three years of a post coronary bypass, he started again to have problems. The wife of a friend, also a physician, was a patient of Dr. Fobi's. He recommended that Ken find out if he would be considered a suitable candidate. At 352 lbs, Ken realized that he had few options left. Weight problems confounded him most of his life. "I was always on a diet with an 'up and down' success -- the more I would lose, the more I would gain back." In June 1994, at age 43, Ken had the surgery. Two years post surgery, he maintains his weight at 187 lbs. Of course, he's had some help maintaining his weight. Patients who have the burden of the excess weight lifted find out it's much easier and more enjoyable to be active. Within 30 days of the surgery, his physician friend helped him on a bike, and he hasn't stopped yet! "I love it! I ride daily now. The first rides were hard but it's something I really enjoy now." Ken will be participating in a "Ride Across America" and he has also ridden in Spain and Italy. This is something he wouldn't have even comprehended doing at 163 lbs heavier. And his only regret: "I wish I would have had the surgery 10 years ago!"See Ken today. Fran Caban was the epitomy of a "little person trapped in a big body." At age 48, she currently weighs a slim 114 lbs. Before Fran had her surgery in September 1989, she weighed 319 lbs. She proudly confesses that she dropped from a size 52 dress to a size 4! Fran started having weight problems after she had had her children. "I started gaining weight and became depressed when I couldn't lose it -- then I'd turn to food for comfort." Health problems set in. She was having back problems, embolisms, leg clots and gall bladder attacks. "My liver was totally encased in fat." Fran was also aware that people treated her differently because she was overweight. She was ignored or treated rudely by people who didn't realize that it wasn't her choice to remain overweight. Fran started noticing a woman in her church who was losing weight and got up the courage to ask her how she did it. At that point, she made a conscious decision that this was something she needed to do, too. "This decision changed my life -- it saved my life!" The surgery is only the beginning she reminds anyone who is considering this. "I changed my eating habits and I exercise now. But now, I can do things with my grandkids that I couldn't do with my kids."See Fran today.

The initial visit at the Center for Surgical Treatment for Obesity is free, provided that you have had no other bariatric surgery. At this consultation, Dr. Fobi and the rest of the staff will make a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine if you would be a successful candidate for the surgery. You would be considered a good candidate if: you are at least 75 lbs over your ideal weight; you have not had success with other diet plans; you are between the ages of 10 and 75; you do not have a drug or alcohol problem (Patients will be considered If they have completed treatment and/or have at least one year of sobriety); you do not suffer from any severe psychoemotional or medical problems that would make surgery unnecessarily risky. Many insurance companies recognize the long-term benefits of this operation and provide coverage for it. However, as with any surgery, preauthorization is necessary. This can take as little as 2 to 5 weeks, or up to a year, based on your insurance company's philosophy on this as a weight loss option. Surgery will be scheduled accordingly. If you do not have insurance coverage, and still want to have the surgery, you will be given a list of fees that you will need to pay prior to surgery. The hospital stay consists of 4 days, barring any complications. You would be admitted on the day of the surgery and be discharged after four days. The Fobi Pouch operation is a vertical banded gastric bypass which reduces the stomach size from its original 3000 cc capacity to 30 cc. When you eat, the pouch will fill quickly, giving a full, satiated feeling. While each person recovers, from any illness or surgery, at a differing rate, it generally takes about six weeks to recover from any major abdominal operation. At first, while your stomach is healing, you will be restricted on the amount and type of foods you can eat. As it heals, you will gradually be introduced to your normal types of foods, however, the quantity will be drastically reduced. However, because the size of your stomach has also been decreased, you will not feel hungry, which is typical in conventional diets. You will consult with the patient counselor prior to leaving the hospital to help you with dietary changes and expectations. You will also be given a vitamin regimen to begin. You will be encouraged to begin light activity, especially walking. This is to aid in the healing process of the surgery as well as beginning the lifestyle changes that makes this program successful. However, as the weight comes off, you will find that doing things, like walking, will be easier and more enjoyable for you. If you have a desk job, you can expect to return to work within three weeks. If your job requires more physical activity, such as bending, lifting or stretching, you may return to work in six weeks. The Center For Surgical Treatment of Obesity has a patient counselor on staff to assist you in all phases of your treatment. Debbie Kearns is a former patient who has lost 135 lbs since her surgery in 1995. Debbie will answer any questions about pre and post surgery and will be there to help all patients during their weight loss period. This may range from diet questions , surgery expectations to the emotional rollercoaster you may have as you encounter the changes that accompany your weight loss. Your association with the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity only begins with your surgery. Follow up visits are scheduled at seven days post surgery, six weeks, three months, twelve months and yearly thereafter. There is no charge for these visits as it is important for the Center to track your progress. The Center also schedules monthly support group meetings in the Long Beach, CA and Las Vegas areas. These meetings provide an opportunity for patients, and those awaiting surgery, to work through problems that may be encountering as well as reveling in the joy of others' successes. For patients residing out of the area, a monthly newsletter helps keep these patients supported and they are encouraged to call the office monthly, to check in with the Center staff.

Introduction Americans have an obsession about dieting. There are countless articles and advertisement for programs and products offering solutions to our weight problems. For the severely overweight person, clinically termed as morbidly obese at 75 lbs over ideal weight, diets offer a hollow promise of success. We hear of people talking about losing the same 15 lbs, over and over again. This "lose and gain" cycle is known as the yo-yo syndrome. As difficult as dieting may be for the person needing only to lose 15 lbs, what can this be like for the person needing to lose 75, 100, 150 lbs or more? The severely overweight person faces challenges that a person, at their ideal weight, cannot fathom. Many may be on a starvation diet while friends and relatives scrutinize their eating habits -- convinced that they are sneaking food. Overweight people also face discrimination -- in jobs and social situations; even the clothes they need usually cost more! Many can't enjoy the simple things that most Americans take for granted -- like going to the movies, riding on a roller coaster, even walking up stairs or tieing shoes is a major ordeal. As a person gains weight and becomes more difficult to move around, the inactivity results in an increased weight gain. It becomes a vicious cycle. There has been much attention to the recent discovery of the "obesity gene." This coincides with research conducted by Dr. Fobi to indicate that Obesity is a hereditary disease. This can explain how an entire family, except one person, can be overweight, while diet and other lifestyle habits are the same. Some of the other findings of Dr. Fobi include: 1) Less than 2% of the Severely Obese population is affected by what we call "hormonal imbalance." 2) Less than 2% of the Severely Obese population has what can be classified as morbid obesity due to an eating disorder. 3) While obesity is not a psychological or psychiatric problem, people who are obese may be more prone to psychological or psychiatric disorders. And most importantly, 4) Obesity is not a problem of willpower. Obesity is a disease! It can be treated by a person with strong willpower, but the success rates are still less than .01%. The National Institute of Health makes regular studies of obesity. In 1991 and '92, consensus statements were issued rebutting conventional diets for morbid obesity. In summary, these two statements had two important facts: 1) that diets alone have not been successful for the morbidly obese and 2) in the first year, 66% of dieters will regain their weight loss. When you consider a diet program, consider this fact: No diet program is a permanent answer to weight loss, however, bariatric surgery is the only method endorsed to provide such a solution for the morbidly obese. Bariatrics is the branch of medicine that deals with the treatment of obesity. The physicians at the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity are Bariatric Surgeons, meaning that the obesity treatment is through surgery, combined with lifestyle changes. There are no medications, fad diets, herbs, hypnosis, etc. involved. Bariatric Surgery had a strong popular awareness in the 1960's when "stomach stapling" was at an all time peak. But the history of bariatric surgery has roots beginning over a hundred years ago when this surgery was prescribed for patients suffering from ulcers. It was discovered that the surgery had a built in side-effect; the patients also lost weight! In 1981, Dr. Mathias Fobi opened the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity for the purpose of education, treatment and continuing research of obesity. The procedure exclusively performed by the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity is the vertical transected gastric bypass with a silastic ring stoma, more commonly referred to as "the Fobi-Pouch." Many people may consider Bariatric Surgery to be a radical approach to combating a problem of "willpower." In reviewing this information, and with physicians and patients who show long term, successful results of the procedures, you can determine that the complications of obesity are greater than the complications of this surgery. Bariatric Surgery isn't for everyone, but for those who do have the surgery and lose weight, they also lose the symptoms of major medical conditions. These include: high blood pressure, increased incidence of cancer, diabetes, strokes and heart disease, circulatory problems, sleep apnea, pulmonary problems, etc. In the 15 years of operation, Dr. Fobi has found this version of bariatric surgery to be most effective for his patients. This procedure has eliminated many of the common fallacies about bariatric surgery, such as "staples bursting" or "stomach stretching" etc. Over 6,000 patients have been treated since the Center opened. If you, or a friend or loved one, suffers from morbid obesity, we encourage you to visit our other web pages. This is the first step in taking control of your life.

Until a time when a less invasive, effective, nonsurgical treatment is available, surgery offers the only long-term control of obesity. Surgery should not be considered as the last resort because, at this time, it is the only effective resort. Obesity is a hereditary disease. The exact method of genetic transmission is not known. The expression of obesity varies with social, environmental, cultural, economic and psychological influences. Obesity may be caused by a glandular or hormonal imbalance, but affects less than 2% of the obese population. Obesity may be due to an eating disorder but rarely is obesity due to an eating disorder. It is highly probable that the obese person with eating disorders has the disorder as a result of the frustration or associated problems of the obesity. Obesity is definitely not caused by a lack of willpower. Obesity is not a psychological or psychiatric disorder. On the contrary, obesity may predispose to psychological or psychiatric disorders. Obesity Scope Mild Obesity : 120% of ideal weight but , <140% or BMI> 25 but <30 or>20 lbs but <50 lbs above ideal weight. Moderate Obesity: 140% of ideal weight but < 160% or BMI 30 but <35 or 50 lbs but <75 lbs above ideal weight. Morbid or Severe Obesity: 160% of ideal weight or BMI 35 but < 50 or 75 lbs above ideal weight. Super Obesity or Malignant Obesity: 225% of ideal weight or BMI 50 Complications of Obesity The multitude and severity of complications are all directly proportional to the severity and duration of obesity and vary with the distribution of body fat. A. Medical Complications: Diabetes, Hypertension, Gallbladder disease, Gastrointestinal Disorders, Menstrual Irregularities, Degenerative arthritis, Venous Stasis Ulcers, Pulmonary Hypoventilation Syndrome, Sleep Apnea, Snoring, Coronary Artery Disease, Arterial Sclerotic Disease, Increased Incidence of Malignancies (Ovaries, cervix, uterus, breast, prostate, gallbladder), Increased risks with Surgery, Accident Proneness, Pseudotumor Cerebri. B. Social Complications Clothing Limitations, Movement Limitations (can lead to inability to maintainhygiene), Limited access to chairs and passage Ways, Limitations to Walking and Climbing, Sexual Limitations. C. Economic Complications Cost of Futile Weight Loss Modalities, Cost of Treatment of Medical Complications, Increased Costs of Health Insurance Premiums, Job Discrimination, Costs of Special Clothing or devices to overcompensate for limitations. D. Psychiatric Complications Depression, Social Withdrawal, Neurotic disorders, Guilt, self hate, feelings of hopeless and helplessness, suicide risk. Non Surgical Treatment of Obesity 1) $13 billion is spent annually by Americans on conventional diet methods 2) Conventional diet methods result in 98% recidivism rates. These include: Commercial Diet Programs, Medically Supervised Low Calorie Diets, Behavior Modification Programs, 12 Step Programs, Pills and Pharmaceuticals, Exercise Programs. Surgical Treatment of Obesity 1) Gastric Bypass: Golden standard for obesity surgical treatment >80% success with >50% excess with loss maintained for more than 5 years. Mortality of <1% and morbidity of <10%. Long-term complications include deficiencies of Iron, Calcium, Fat soluble Vitamins A, D and E and Vitamin B12, Folic Acid and B1 and B6 levels. Anemia is seen in menstruating individuals. There are various modifications of the gastric bypass operations. The Fobi-Pouch, one of the modifications, has excellent weight loss, less complications, less revision and best tolerated by the patients. 2) Gastroplasty: The most common operation for control of obesity. About 60% success rate with >50% excess weight loss maintained for more than 5 years. Mortality rate of <1% with morbidity of <10%. High revision rate due to staple line breakdown which approached 28% over a five year period. No long-term complications characteristic of this operation. Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and silastic ring vertical gastroplasty (SRVC) are the two most common gastroplasty operations performed. 3) Other operations: Biliopancreatric Diversion (BPD) Gastric Banding (GB) Intestinal Bypass (JB) -- not recommended Biliopancreatric Diversion with the Duodenal Switch The Fobi-Pouch for Obesity The Limiting Proximal Gastric Pouch, called "Fobi-Pouch for Obesity" is not a new operation. It is a modification of an operation, over a hundred years old, now applied to the management of the severe recalcitrant medical problem of obesity. The operation, "The Fobi-Pouch for Obesity" has an operative mortality of <.02% and significant morbidity of <10%. It is 95% effective with greater than 50% excess weight loss that is maintained for more than five years of follow up. Long term related complications are limited to Fat soluble vitamin deficiencies, Calcium, Iron, B12, and Folic Acid deficiencies with the resultant anemia. All of these can either be prevented or corrected. There are occasional problems with frequent vomiting, diarrhea and meat intolerance. The operation is completely reversible if the need does arise. The Fobi Limiting Proximal Gastric Pouch consists of a less than 30 cc pouch of the proximal stomach on the lesser curvature, a silastic ring around the stomach that functions as a stoma. The band is 5.5 - 6.5 cm long. A gastroenterostomy to a Roux-y limb of the jejunum completes the operation. A gastrostomy tube is placed to decompress the distal stomach perioperatively. The gastrostomy site has a silastic ring marker to facilitate percutaneous radiological evaluation of the distal stomach if the need arises. The Fobi Pouch has the following significant characteristics: 1) Vertical <30 cc pouch Easy to intubate, less distensible, provides early satiety. 2) Transected Pouch Minimal mobilization, no problem with staple line breakdown, minimal occurrence of marginal ulcers. 3) Banded pouch, longer band, 5.5 - 6.5 cm Leaves a large stoma - but limited in diameter, allows dumping -- but not severe dumping, band has not be documented to erode in a primary case. 4) Imbricated Gastrojejunostomy The limb of the jejumun that is brought up to form the gastroenterostomy is also used to imbricate the transected edge of the proximal pouch thus diminishing the possibility of leaks and subphrenic abscess. 5) Large gastroenterostomy 1.5 - 2 cm long Markedly decreased rate of gastric outlet stenosis 6) Decompressed distal gastric pouch with a gastrostomy No incidence of acute gastric distension, decreased incidence of atelectasis, provides for temporary feeding and administration of medication if the need does arise. 7) Marked gastrostomy site Provides easy access to study distal bypassed stomach radiologically and/or endoscopically, as needed, access for enteral feeding in the rare case of excessive weight loss. The only foreseeable complications from this operation are Vitamin A, D and E, Calcium, Iron, B12 and Folic Acid deficiencies and the associated anemia. These problems are preventable and correctable. Areas of concern with the use of the gastric bypass by many in the field of obesity are now adequately resolved by the Fobi-Pouch operation for obesity (FPO). These are: 1) Acute gastric distention with or without perforation. The routine use of a temporary gastrostomy as part of FPO has eliminated this complication as a concern in the gastric bypass operation. (3% to 0% in our last 1000+ patients.) 2) Leaks Leaks have been minimized in the FPO. The imbrication of the proximal pouch with the Roux-Y Limb has significantly reduced the incidence of leaks with intra-abdominal abscess. The band above the gastrojejunal anastomosis has also significantly reduced the incidence of breakdown at the gastrojejunal anastomosis. The use of a selective protocol of using the gastrostomy feeding channel in certain patients undergoing revision operations and keeping the patients NPO for 7 days to two week has significantly reduced the incidence of leaks in revision operations. Direct visualization of the anterior and posterior aspect of the pouch also allows easy diagnosis of an intraoperative traumatic complications. 3) Pouch Size and Measurements Direct visualization of the transected pouch's anterior and posterior surface allows the surgeon to have a better control on the pouch size. There are, to date, no controlled studies to show that there is a significant difference, if any, in the restrictive operations when the pouch has been maintained at a size less than 50 cc. It should be noted that as much as the idea of measuring the pouch is stressed by many, there appears to be no difference between an estimated pouch and one that is measured on review of various series in the published reports. 4) Closed Loop Obstruction Admittedly, the incidence of bowel obstruction after the gastric bypass operation is higher than after the gastric banding or vertical banded gastroplasty just because the nature of this operation involves the small bowel. The incidence of bowel obstruction, particularly closed loop and internal hernia obstructions, are reduced in the FPO by: a) closing the mesenteric gap at the jejunojejunal anastomosis; b) placing an anti-kinking suture at the jejunojejunal anatomizes; c) closing the gap between the Roux-Y Limb and the mesocolon. 5) Access to the bypassed gastric segment The marked gastrostomy site in the FPO provides ready access to the bypassed gastric segment for radiological and endoscopic evaluation. Access to this segment for feeding purposed in cases of rapid weight loss, problems with the gastric outline, or in the rare case of protein malnutrition, is also facilitated by the marked gastrostomy site. 6) Difficult Operation The FPO operating time, in experienced hands, is about double the time that a vertical banded gastroplasty operation takes. The Perioperative complications in series of more than one thousand patients is around 10%. However, the significant difference in the amount of weight loss and the low revision rate with the associated morbidity seen in revisions, make the FPO a much more desirable operation than any of the restrictive operations. 7) Micronutrient deficiencies (i.e. Fat Soluble Vitamins B12, Iron, Calcium and the associated conditions.) Information of these deficiencies are given to the patients and they are placed on nutritional supplements for the rest of their lives. Yearly monitoring is required. Protocol for Fobi-Pouch Surgery Four days hospitalization consisting of an AM surgery admission with discharge in four days. Follow up is at seven to ten days, six weeks, three months, six months and yearly thereafter. Preoperative work-up includes CBC, SMA 22, thyroid profile, HIV test, Hepatitis panel, EKG, CXR, GB ultrasound, UGI series, Body Composition, treadmill evaluation, esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy and other tests as may be deemed necessary by the patient's condition. A specialized team is used for treatment of patients, consisting of an anesthesiologist, scrub nurse, circulating nurse, patient counselor, cardiologist, pulmonary specialist and two surgeons. Other consultants are called preoperatively or postoperatively, as deemed necessary. Psychiatric disorders have not been found to be a contraindication for the procedure. Patients with a history of psychiatric problems are cleared for surgery by a consulting psychiatrist. Selection of patients for this operation is based on the simple surgical policy of assess the risk benefit ratio. All patients have stomach X-rays within two weeks after the operation. Yearly stomach X-rays are planned for the first three years, and as necessary thereafter. Radiographic evaluation of the distal bypassed stomach is recommended every five years after age 50. #1 Safe <10% perioperative morbidity<1% mortality #2 Effective >50% excess weight loss in 95% of patients 5 years #3 Reproducible Surgical technique should be easily reproducible. Results from various centers should be comparable. #4 Minimal Revision Rate <2% per year. The Fobi Pouch Operation meets all the above criteria and more.

Buildings suffer a similar fate as well. Buildings fall "sick" when their air-ducts become choked with accumulated dirt and dust. Sick Buildings Essentially, "sick buildings" are modern central air-conditioned buildings that were designed and built to save energy and costs but with little consideration for the respiratory well-being of the inhabitants. Buildings become "sick" when the air becomes stale because of excessive dust, bacteria and gases. The US Environment Protection Agency (EPA) consistently ranks poor Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) as a major health concern in their studies. Hidden from our eyes, sealed dusts such as dirty heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems are the major causes of poor indoor air quality. Dirty ventilation systems are also perfect breeding grounds for micro-organisms such as bacteria and fungus. Sick Building Syndrome Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), a disease not widely known, is a pervasive ailment caused by poor IAQ in air-conditioned environment. SBS has been accorded high priority by the World health Organisation (WHO) in view of the large numbers of people potentially at risk. SBS is characterised by eyes, nose and throat irritation, mental fatique, headaches and body aches. Surveys have suggested that this syndrome is a major cause of absenteeism and reduced working efficiency among office workers resulting in lost man hours. Similarly, an IAQ survey conducted in six air-conditioned buildings in Singapore between November 1992 and July 1993 revealed higher incidences of mental and physical stress among workers. A recent study of the air quality of 57 commercial offices, conducted by NUS, found that half the number of offices had unacceptable formaldehyde levels. Formaldehyde is a cancer causing agent found in furniture glue. 60% of the building studied also had unhealthy carbon dioxide levels. Maintaining air quality in a sealed environment is an important but often overlooked issue. This is compounded by the fact that most air-ducts are difficult and expensive to clean. But now, the impossible is made easy with advanced technology. Introducing the all-purpose robotic air-duct cleaner. With Danduct Duct Cleaning System, cleaning difficult-to-reach air-ducts is a breeze.

Accompanied by an array of brushes of different sizes, the robot can be easily reconfigured to handle inspection and cleaning of round, rectangular and even flexible ducts. The Danduct robot is equipped with different tools to handle the toughest of cleaning jobs. Prior to cleaning, an inspector Danduct robot will be sent to inspect and probe the condition of the air-ducts. This is to discover any blockages that may obstruct the cleaning process. After inspection, the refitted Danduct robot will be sent to remove dirt and waste accumulated in the air-ducts. With front rolling and slide brushing action, the Danduct robot scrubs away dirt effortlessly. The swirling dirt and waste will be removed by way of suction at the other end of the duct. The entire cleaning operation is closely monitored by the operator on the TV screen to ensure the smooth running if the operation and that all hazardous wastes are removed from the air-ducts. Furthermore, the whole operation is also recorded on video tape and submitted to clients as verification of work performance. Hidden from our eyes, air-ducts accumulate dirt and dust through the years. They become a hotbed for the growth of germs and diseases. Danduct robot effectively removes all the dirt from your air-ducts, and maintains good Indoor Air quality (IAQ) of your buildings.

Unanimously, A threat or use of nuclear weapons should also be compatible with the requirements of the international law applicable in armed conflict particularly those of the principles and rules of international humanitarian law, as well as with specific obligations under treaties and other undertakings which expressly deal with nuclear weapons; E. By seven votes to seven, It follows from the above-mentioned requirements that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law; However, in view of the current state of International Law, and of the elements of fact at its disposal, the Court cannot conclude definitively whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which the very survival of a State would be a stake; IN FAVOUR: PRESIDENT Bedjaoui, JUDGES: Renjeva, Herczegh, Shi, Fleischhauer, Vereschetin, Ferrari Bravo; AGAINST: VICE-PRESIDENT Schwebel; JUDGES: Oda. Guillaume, Shahabuddeen, Weeramantry, Koroma Higgins. F. Unanimously, There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international controlS.

HOW TO PREVENT A MASSIVE NUCLEAR WAR--LESSONS OF THE COLD WAR !!!!!PREFACE   The enclosed paper is VERY important because it reminds people of the horrors of the many Cold War confrontations between the superpowers, and tells them what was NOT known by the public at the time, that nearly all these Crises were NUCLEAR. It now seems likely that the ComprehensiveTest Ban Treaty (CTBT) will be signed soon, but the USA (and other nuclear powers, who have however far less capability for using their weapons to intimidate their opponents, as the USA has done repeatedly) clearly intends to keep its nuclear arsenal  for the indefinite future.  They have several "sub-critical tests" planned  for this year, and computer simulation experiments must surely be in progress already, since they are of course not detectable, and presumably are funded from a "black budget".   Thus the public will be lulled into a feeling of false security. Historyrepeats itself, since we all know now that this is what happened after the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963.  I believe the only way to avert this danger, short of waiting for the actual use of nuclear weapons (which is inevitable under the proposed regime, but even that may be by a "terrorist nation" or the mafia, thus justifying the continued possession by the nuclear powers), is to remind people of what they had almost forgotten (or like meand most ordinary people never really knew):!!!THE WORLD WAS OFTEN AT RISK OF A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST DURING THE COLD WAR!!!   A public thus aroused by knowing the terrible risks that have been taken in the recent past, and one hopes empowered by a forthcoming favourableWorld Court judgement that the possesession as well as use of nuclear weapons is illegal, might prevent catastrophe--as they did in 1969 (see below Nixon's statement of 14 October 1969, VIETNAM Crisis #12).

This is an appalling record, but there is no reason to believe that any other great power having the same advantages as the U.S.A. would have acted any better.  The human race is ill-equipped to deal with nuclear weapons.   The Cold War and the Soviet nuclear threat to the U.S.A. was ended by Mikhail Gorbachev.  It is now widely believed, however, that the U.S.A. "won the Cold War."  The very dangerous crises of the Cold War, their threats distorted by propaganda at the time, are now almost totally forgotten.  The role of the military establishment that led us into these crises remains unquestioned, its prestige untarnished. The public remains in ignorance.    This paper is an attempt to inform the public simply and clearly about the very dangerous nuclear crises of the Cold War.  Until these are widely understood, the great dangers of present policies will not be questioned and discussed.  The U.S.A., with its Freedom of Information Act, is the least secretive of all the world's great powers.  Much of the information in this paper has been made available by the benefit of this Act. Members of the public have thus been able to inform themselves of the way that nuclear weapons have threatened world security over the years.   There are 36,000 nuclear weapons in the world in 1996 and the threat of the destruction of civilization by these weapons remains very great. The more that nuclear weapons increase military power, the more they decrease national security.  The only escape from this paradox is by the balanced reduction and eventual total abolition of these weapons on a rigid schedule.  This is a matter of great urgency; the present lull in great power rivalry may not last long.****************************************************************************TableI.

The U.S.A. had thus rapidly shown that it was prepared to use this new ultra-destructive weapon, with its lingering poisonous effects, in the same way as conventional weapons.  President Truman believed that the Soviet Union would never be able to make an atomic bomb. He did not hesitate to use the threat of the U.S. atomic bomb against the Soviet Union.  The first such threats came only ten months after the end of WW-II, in disputes over the Soviet-Iranian border area (Crisis # 1, IRAN I) and the Balkans (Crisis #2, YUGOSLAVIA I)  Crisis #3, BERLIN I, was much more serious and lasted for 15 months.  The terminal event of this period came on 3 September 1949, when the Soviets exploded their first atomic bomb.  The U.S. monopoly of nuclear weapons had lasted barely four years.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Nuclear Crisis #1 in Year: 1946  Name of Crisis: IRAN I (Azerbaijan)Threatened use of nuclear weapons by: U.S.A.Target: U.S.S.R.Crisis starts: March 1946 Crisis ends:   48 hours after Truman's ultimatumThreat of nuclear attack:  StatedAt issue in Crisis: British pre-war domination of Iran was challenged after                     the war by the Soviets.BACKGROUND: During WW-II there was a U.S.A. and Soviet wartime agreement to occupy Iran jointly. This denied it to the Germans and allowed aid convoys to enter the U.S.S.R. through Iran.  After WW-II, the Soviets demanded oil concessions equal to those of the British, as previously agreed.  To enforce this claim Soviet troops remained in northern Iran and supported a revolutionary movement in Azerbaijan Province adjoining Soviet territory.  The Soviets moved tanks to the border and showed no sign of removing their troops from Iran by 2 March 1946 as agreed by them at the London Conference of the Council of Foreign Ministers.  CRISIS EVENTS:  President Truman meets personally with Soviet Ambassador Gromyko and delivers an ultimatum: Remove Soviet troops in 48 hours or the U.S.A. will drop the atomic bomb.  "We're going to drop it on you," Trumanis reported to say to Gromyko.OUTCOME: Soviets removed their troops in 24 hours.  This threat of an atomic bomb attack on the Soviet Union by Truman came only 10 months after the end of WW-II.  Three months after this crisis, on 14 June 1946, the U.S.A. presented the Baruch Plan for the international control of nuclear material for the production of atomic energy.  Soviet rejection of this plan must now be viewed in the light of their experience of U.S.A. "atomic control" in the IRAN I crisis over Azerbaijan.****************************************************************************Crises #2 to #15 omitted here****************************************************************************Nuclear Crisis #16 in Year: 1983Name of Crisis: FIRST STRIKEThreatened use of nuclear weapons by:  U.S.A.Target: U.S.S.R.Crisis starts: 1 December 1983, 9 Pershing II's delivered to Ramstein, Germany Crisis ends: 19 November 1985, Gorbachev and Reagan meet in Geneva Duration: 2 yearsThreat of nuclear attack: Implied (at very great risk)At issue in Crisis:  U.S. preparation for FIRST STRIKE CAPABILITYBACKGROUND: In the nuclear arms race the U.S.A. had always held a 5 to 10-year lead over the Soviet Union and in the 1980's a system for a FIRST STRIKE surprise attack on the U.S.S.R. was nearly ready.   It had 3 parts:  1) Decapitation: the flat trajectory Pershing II missiles  were extremely accurate  and  designed to "decapitate" (behead) the Sovietleadership. Flight time to Moscow from bases in West Germany was 6 minutes;  2) Counterforce: it would be possible by the late 1980's to  knock out all known Soviet missiles on land and at sea with MX and Trident-II missiles usingthe new very precise "Navstar" guidance system.  In case a few Soviet missilessurvived this First Strike, the U.S.A. needed a "shield";  3) Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) or Star Wars, was the "shield", and thisenormously costly and incomplete system was the third part of FIRST STROKE.  These very threatening plans meant that a world nuclear holocaust might resultfrom a faulty Soviet radar warning.  Six minutes gave the Soviets little time for analysis of U.S. intentions.  The Soviets understood all of these threats very clearly.CRISIS EVENTS: 1983, 26 October: Soviet Premier Andropov stated Soviets will walk out at Geneva if deployment of Pershing II and Cruise missiles begins.-15 November: Britain: First shipment of Tomahawk Cruise Missiles arrives.-30 November: West German parliament votes 286:226 to accept first shipment of9 Pershing II missiles on German soil, in spite of demonstrations by 400,000 Germans, during 1983, opposed to the deployment of medium range missiles.  -1 December: FIRST STRIKE Crisis #16 begins when U.S. C-5 Galaxy transports deliver 9 Pershing II missiles to Ramstein air base near Mannheim, West Germany, which are then transported to the U.S. Army 56th Field Artillery Brigade base at Mutlangen.  In Geneva, Soviet negotiator Yuli Kvitsinsky walksout of a meeting with U.S. negotiator Paul Nitze, ending nuclear arms negotiations and offering no resumption date.-8 December: Nuclear Winter, that might kill most nuclear war survivors ispredicted, even if only half of U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons used (joint statement by 4 U.S. and 4 Soviet scientists meeting in Washington).1985, 11 March: Gorbachev elected General Secretary of the Central Committee by a margin of one vote over Grishin, a hard liner who would probably have escalated the arms race.  This election may well prove to have been a critical event in world history.-15 March: Nuclear Winter "that would wipe out all life on earth .. is all themore reason to continue President Ronald Reagan's weapons build-up," Richard Perle, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defence. -July: Soviets stop nuclear tests-19 and 20 November, Gorbachev and Reagan meet in Geneva; Cold War tensions ease progressively for the next two years, and the FIRST STRIKEe Crisis also abates during this period.1987, 8 December: Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty signed in Washington by Presidents Gorbachev and Reagan. It will eliminate all medium and short range nuclear weapons.OUTCOME: With the end of the worst Crisis of all, the Cold War also ended. *****************************************************************************PERIOD 5:  1985-1991:  GORBACHEV ENDS THE COLD WAR   The relentless arms race culminated in Crisis #16, FIRST STRIKE. This was the most dangerous period in human history.1985, 11 March: Mikhail Gorbachev is elected General Secretary of the Cental Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  He beats his rival, Victor Grishin, a hard-liner, by one vote.  Gorbachev sets to work to end the nuclear arms race and the Cold War in a series of bold and visionary steps:-July: Gorbachev orders the cessation of Soviet nuclear tests.-July to December: U.S.A. tests 9 nuclear weapons.-19 and 20 November: GENEVA SUMMIT where Gorbachev meets U.S. President Reaganand tensions between the U.S.A and U.S.S.R. begin to ease.1986: "International Year of Peace." Nuclear weapons tests: U.S.A.: 15                                                               U.S.S.R.: 0-15 January, Gorbachev, "The Soviet Union proposes that a step-by-step consistent process of ridding the earth of  nuclear weapons be implemented and completed within the next 15 years, before the end of  this century."  Gorbachev proposed three stages for this process:  1) Elimination of all U.S. and Soviet medium range missiles in Europe.  All U.S. and Soviet nuclear tests to cease immediately.  All U.S. and Soviet strategic weapons to be reduced by one half.  All U.S. and Soviet space-strike weapons to be eliminated.   2) (1990-95)  Other nuclear powers join in nuclear disarmament, eliminating nuclear tests and space-strike weapons.  All tactical nuclear weapons to be eliminated.  A ban on all non-nuclear weapons, based on new physical principles, whose destructive power is close to that of nuclear weapons.    3) (1995-2000)  Elimination of all remaining nuclear weapons.-11 and 12 October: REYKJAVIK SUMMIT: Gorbachev offers 50% reduction in strategic weapons and removal of all U.S. and Soviet medium range missiles in Europe. Reagan, unprepared, flounders and refuses.-3 November: "Contragate" scandal erupts.  The Reagan administration's illegalsale of arms to Iran to finance its illegal covert war in Nicaragua is exposed.1987 February: Soviets resume nuclear tests after a 19 month halt.-May to August: Iran-Contra affair is probed by Senate and House committees.The Reagan presidency is increasingly implicated and threatened.-8 December: Washington: Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty issigned by Presidents Gorbachev and Reagan.  It will eliminate all medium and short-range nuclear weapons. This marks the end of the FIRST STRIKE Crisis#16 and is a landmark event in the approaching end of the Cold War.1989 February: Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan complete.-March: Part of new Congress is chosen in free elections in U.S.S.R.-June: Elections give Solidarity majority in Poland.-November: Demolition of Berlin Wall.1991, 17 January:  U.S. launches war (Desert Storm) against Iraq.-June: Yeltsin becomes President of Supreme Soviet after first free national elections. -19-21 August: Gorbachev is toppled in abortive coup by old guard communist hard-liners. Had they won - and they nearly did - the nuclear arms race could well have resumed its fatal course. - 8 December: Yeltsin meets with the leaders of the Ukraine and White Russia and abolishes the  U.S.S.R., with no mandate to do so.******************************************************************************PERIOD 6   1991-  :POST COLD WAR RE-GROUPING   Following the break up of the Soviet Union, the United States has emerged as the world's number one superpower.  A dangerous conclusion is that the U.S.A. "won the Cold War" with Ronald Reagan's weapons build up (see theAPPENDIX for Pozner's comments in "Eyewitness").    This period is similar to the "Scared Straight" period after Crisis #11, CUBA. It is a time of precious opportunity for nuclear disarmament. In 1996 Russia is in economic and political turmoil, China is rapidly emerging as a world power, there are still 36,000 nuclear weapons in the world. The world situation is not stable.   The balanced reduction and total abolition of these weapons, on a rigid schedule is a matter of great urgency; the present lull in great power rivalry may not last long!*****************************************************************************SOURCES1.

Further, the inextricable link between the "peaceful" and warlike us=es ofnuclear technologies and the threat to future generations inherent in cre=ationand use of long-lived radioactive materials must be recognized.  We mustmove toward reliance on clean, safe, renewable forms of energy productionthat do not provide the materials for weapons of mass destruction and do =notpoison the environment for thousands of centuries.  The true "inalienable="right is not to nuclear energy, but to life, liberty and security of pers=on in aworld free of nuclear weapons.     We recognize that a nuclear weapons free world must be achievedcarefully and in a step by step manner.  We are convinced of its technolo=gicalfeasibility.  Lack of political will, especially on the part of the nucle=arweapons states, is the only true barrier.  As chemical and biological wea=ponsare prohibited, so must nuclear weapons be prohibited.     We call upon all states -- particularly the nuclear weapons states, =declaredand de facto -- to take the following steps to achieve nuclear weaponsabolition.  We further urge the states parties to the NPT to demand bindi=ngcommitments by the declared nuclear weapons states to implement thesemeasures:     1)  Initiate immediately and conclude by the year 2000 negotiations =on anuclear weapons abolition convention that requires the phased elimination= ofall nuclear weapons within a timebound framework, with provisions foreffective verification and enforcement.*     2)  Immediately make an unconditional pledge not to use or threaten =to usenuclear weapons.     3)  Rapidly complete a truly comprehensive test ban treaty with a ze=rothreshold and with the stated purpose of precluding nuclear weaponsdevelopment by all states.     4)  Cease to produce and deploy new and additional nuclear weaponssystems, and commence to withdraw and disable deployed nuclear weaponssystems.     5)  Prohibit the military and commercial production and reprocessing= of allweapons-usable radioactive materials.     6)  Subject all weapons-usable radioactive materials and nuclear fac=ilitiesin all states to international accounting, monitoring, and safeguards, an=destablish a public international registry of all weapons-usable radioacti=vematerials.     7)  Prohibit nuclear weapons research, design, development, and test=ingthrough laboratory experiments including but not limited to non-nuclearhydrodynamic explosions and computer simulations, subject all nuclearweapons laboratories to international monitoring, and close all nuclear t=estsites.     8)  Create additional nuclear weapons free zones such as those estab=lishedby the treaties of Tlatelolco and Rarotonga.     9) Recognize and declare the illegality of threat or use of nuclear =weapons,publicly and before the World Court.     10)  Establish an international energy agency to promote and support= thedevelopment of sustainable and environmentally safe energy sources.     11) Create mechanisms to ensure the participation of citizens and NG=Os inplanning and monitoring the process of nuclear weapons abolition.     A world free of nuclear weapons is a shared aspiration of humanity. = Thisgoal cannot be achieved in a non-proliferation regime that authorizes thepossession of nuclear weapons by a small group of states.  Our commonsecurity requires the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. Our object=iveis definite and unconditional abolition of nuclear weapons.* The convention should mandate irreversible disarmament measures, includ=ing but notlimited to the following: withdraw and disable all deployed nuclear weapo=ns systems; disableand dismantle warheads; place warheads and weapons-usable radioactive mat=erials underinternational safeguards; destroy ballistic missiles and other delivery s=ystems.  Theconvention could also incorporate the measures listed above which should =be implementedindependently without delay.  When fully implemented, the convention woul=d replace theNPT.New York, April 25 1995*******************************************     This statement is endorsed by members of the Non-GovernmentalOrganization (NGO) Abolition Caucus and other groups listed on theattachment.To sign on to this statement please send a fax or email stating the name,address, fax, telephone and e-mail of your organisation to:Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East: Xanthe Hall, IPPNW Germany, +49-30-693-8166, ippnw@oln.comlink.de, orN., C. & S.

It is not a membershipbody but is open to all organisations endorsing the ABOLITION STATEMENT,drafted at the NPT Conference in New York in 1995. Its over-archingpremise is the vision of entering the 21st century with a plan in place f=orthe elimination of nuclear weapons.What is the Network?300 organisations have organised themselves into what was termed a"tight" (rather than the usual loose) network which aims to provide group=sconcerned with nuclear issues a forum for the exchange of informationand the development of joint initiatives. The "tightness" of the network(like the tautness of a web) is defined by how close the members of thenetwork work together and how good the lines of communication are.The Network plans to have an office in California, USA, staffed by afacilitator. The Global Network Office will be overseen by a ManagementGroup. The substantive work of the network is done by InternationalWorking Groups on issues relating to the abolition of nuclear weapons.How did it come about?In 1995 at the Conference to Review and Extend the Non-ProliferationTreaty in New York a group of 40 to 50 activists, representing NGOs fromall around the world met each day to coordinate their work and calledthemselves "The Abolition Caucus". This group drafted a consensusdocument which was known as the "Abolition Statement". In less than twoweeks the first 200 organisations had signed the statement and thisnumber is still growing. Added to this, the International Coalition forNon-Proliferation organised a meeting during the NPT Conference on aDraft Nuclear Weapons Convention, called "Beyond the NPT". Thedemand for a Convention became the prime focus of the lobbying work ofthe Abolition Caucus and also of the Abolition Statement. They called onthe delegates toinitiate immediately and conclude by the year2000 negotiations on a nuclear weapons abolitionconvention that requires the phased eliminationof all nuclear weapons within a timeboundframework, with provisions for effectiveverification and enforcement.The Abolition Caucus requested the NPT parties to adopt this goal in thefinal report of the Conference. The opposition to the indefinite,unconditional  extension of the NPT was clearly expressed in the originalstatement, which has since been updated to remove references to theConference and other dates.Development of the NetworkA core group went on to organise a further meeting in The Hague tocoincide with the oral hearings at the International Court of Justice inNovember 1995 of the advisory opinion on the use and threat of use ofnuclear weapons (World Court Project). The 60 participants at thismeeting agreed by consensus to found a network and defined itsstructure. The title "Abolition 2000 - A Global Network to EliminateNuclear Weapons" was chosen.The idea of a "tight network", consisting of regions, working groups and =adistribution/communications centre (later titled the "Global NetworkOffice") was born. Most importantly it was decided that there should beno central committee to take decisions on behalf of the network, and thatinitially no common strategy would be decided, except to take actionunder the only agreed common position: the Abolition Statement, whicheverybody had signed. The group that had organised the meeting in TheHague was given the task of setting up the office and finding the fundingfor a staff person for it. A second meeting in Edinburgh in March 1996gave this group the title "Interim Management Group", whose function issolely to oversee the functioning of the Global Network Office. Themembers of the Interim Management Group are:  Lysiane Alizard(France), Colin Archer (Switzerland), Janet Bloomfield (UK), Reiner Braun(Germany) Jackie Cabasso (USA), Michael Christ (USA), Xanthe Hall =20(Germany), Pamela Meidell (USA), Alice Slater (USA), and Alyn Ware, =20(Aotearoa/NZ).  It was agreed that this group should be more regionally =20balanced than it presently is, and it is hoped that new members will be =20found before the next full meeting of the Network in the Pacific Region i=n =201997.The RegionsThe Regions are at present North America, Central and South America,Europe, the Pacific, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The Network hassome organisations in all of these regions, but the strongest are the Pac=ific,Europe and North America. Asia has much activity, but little participatio=nin the meetings at present. Some regions are establishing regionalnetworks to look for common strategies. The USA, Canada, Germany andNorway have formally established abolition networks.To join these networks contact:AOTEAROA/NZ - Kate Dewes,  P O Box 8390, Christchurch,Aotearoa/New Zealand, Tel/Fax: +64-3-348 1353, E-mail:katie@chch.planet.co.nzCANADA - Debbie Grisdale, Physicians for Global Survival, 170a BoothSt., Ottawa, Ontario, K1R 7W1, Canada, Tel: +1-613-233 1982, Fax: 2339028, E-Mail: pgs@web.apc.orgGERMANY - Xanthe Hall, IPPNW Germany, Koertestrasse 10, D-10967Berlin, Germany, Tel: +49-30-693 0244, Fax: 693 8166, E-Mail:ippnw@oln.comlink.apc.orgNORWAY - Frederik Heffermehl: Norwegian Peace Alliance,  N Juelsgt28A, N-0272 Oslo 2, Norway, Tel: +47-2244 8003, Fax: 2244 7616USA - Karina Wood, Peace Action, 1819 H Street NW, Suite 420,Washington DC 20006-3603, USA, Tel: +1-202-862 9740, Fax: 862 9762, E-Mail: panukes@igc.apc.orgThe Working GroupsThe Working Groups deal with substantive issues arising out of theAbolition Statement.

Some groups meet regularly and others communicateby e-mail, fax, telephone and post. Anyone interested can participate atany one time by contacting the convenor.Nuclear Weapons Convention: convened by Juergen Scheffran (INESAP)Institut fuer Kernphysik, Schlo=DFgartenstra=DFe 9, D-64289 Darmstadt, Ge=rmany, Tel: +49-6151-163016, fax: 166039, E-mail: scheffran@hrzpub.th-darmstadt.deThe time is right to demand a Nuclear Weapons Convention (NWC). As inthe Abolition Statement, negotiations should start now because it will be= along process to complete them, and NGOs should be involved in this.Working for a NWC is the logical next step of the World Court Project, asit is for the International Network of Engineers and Scientists and thePugwash, who have set up a Study Group on the NWC. At the group'smeeting in New York in March 1996, an outline of the elements of a modeltreaty was discussed with various participants taking on the drafting ofspecific language. An executive summary of the treaty is now completeand has been forwarded to the Canberra Commission (a Commission ofexperts convened by the Australian Government to discuss concretemeasures to achieve the abolition of nuclear weapons). Plans are beingmade to organise a World Conference to Abolish Nuclear Weapons in1998.Overcoming Nuclear Threats: convened by Rob Green (WCP UK)2 Chiswick House, High Street, Twyford, Berks RG10 8AG, UK, Tel/Fax: +44-=734 340 258,E-mail: robwcpuk@gn.apc.orgThe group is assessing and will report on the implications of theInternational Court of Justice's advisory opinion(s). It will propose act=ionsfor the nuclear weapons states to comply with the ruling. It aims tocoordinate the work to challenge the doctrine of deterrence. Thedeterrence doctrine and the abolition of nuclear weapons areincompatible. There is a brochure on the implications of possible Courtrulings, which will be updated after the ruling itself. Also there is abrochure on "Deterring War Responsibly". Both are available from RobGreen.Nuclear Test Ban and Beyond: convened by Jackie Cabasso (WSLF) 1440 Broadway, Suite 500, Oakland, CA 94612, Tel: +1-510-839 5877, Fax: =839 5397, E-mail: wslf@igc.apc.orgThe work of this group refers to the points on testing in the AbolitionStatement: working for a truly comprehensive test ban that preventsdevelopment of nuclear weapons and for the closure of the test sites. TheCTBT negotiations are now underway in Geneva. The Test Ban will mostlikely not be comprehensive because the nuclear weapons states havedeveloped the technical capability to replace testing. Computer simulatedtests are far from messing around on a laptop - the facilities are as big= orbigger than football stadiums. Above Ground Explosions take place thatare not technically termed nuclear explosions although explosions takeplace using nuclear material. There are also plans for "laser fusion"facilities at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California, USA and inBordeaux, France (Megajoule). Technical knowledge and understanding ofwhat subcritical, hydrodynamic or hydronuclear tests are, or what laser o=rintertial confinement fusion is will be an important task of this group.These are the methods of the future that will enable the nuclear weaponsstates to continue collecting data and experimenting with themodernisation, miniaturisation and design of nuclear weapons. The groupis campaigning to get language introduced into the preamble of the CTBT(language available from Jackie Cabasso) that will specifically refer to =theprevention of the development of nuclear weapons as the intention of thetreaty. The concept of "The Test Ban and Beyond" is to favour an earlyconclusion of the CTBT, while recognising that this will not fulfil ourobjectives and therefore planning for beyond this. Action in 1996 and 199=7,following completion of the CTBT, centre around the subcritical testsplanned in the United States.Fissile Materials (no convenor as yet)Much work is going on in this area by organisations in the Networkalthough a working group has not yet formally been convened. TheConference on Disarmament in Geneva plans to negotiate a fissile material"Cut-off" after completion of the CTBT. Discussions at present are aroundthe issues of banning fissile material completely - i.e. destroying stock=piles- and the production of fissile materials in the civilian sector. If thestockpiles remain, the present status quo will be perpetuated, as with th=eNPT and most likely with the CTBT, that the declared nuclear weaponsstates retain their capability, while forbidding it for all others. This =is notdisarmament. Disallowing fissile material production only in the militaryand not in the civilian sector repeats the mistake of the NPT by ignoringthat nuclear energy produces bomb material that can be diverted, legallyor illegally, for military purposes. The question of fissile materialproduction is important because it cuts off the source of material - "pul=lingthe plug on the bomb".Chernobyl: convened by "For Mother Earth" Lange Steenstraat 16/D, B-9000 Gent, Tel + Fax: +32-9-233 8439, E-mail:fme@int.knooppunt.beThis group was originally set up to coordinate the activities for the 10t=hanniversary of the Catastrophe at Chernobyl. It has developed a petition,addressed to Boutros Ghali asking for the IAEA to stop promoting nuclearpower and for the UN to set up an International Alternative EnergyAgency, which will be circulated until November 30th 1996. This area is a=ninitial breeding ground for cooperative work between disarmament andenvironmental groups. The pro-nuclear lobby tried to claim that themedical consequences of the Chernobyl accident were very low (no morethan 30 deaths). Calculations from German physicians put the figure ataround 25,000 deaths so far, an increase in thyroid cancer 100 times high=erin the worst hit areas, and diabetes figures have doubled. The main pointis not the figures but the suffering, physical and psychological.A Non-Nuclear Security Model for Europe: convened by Solange Fernex(WILPF and Greens, France) F-68480 Biederthal, France, Tel: +33-89-407183, Fax: 407804This group is looking at NATO and WEU and the unacceptability of thesealliances in the future for solving security problems. The WEU is accepte=das the European leg of NATO. An opportunity to open the discussion oncommon security policy in Europe is emerging preceding Maastricht II.NGOs should try to intervene in this discussion. The group proposes thatthe OSCE is the correct organ to work on security in Europe throughsolving conflicts non-violently and on a political level. The OSCE is muc=hbigger than WEU or NATO, with 54 member states, including states fromEastern Europe, neutral states and all NATO members. Security is not amilitary problem, but often to do with ethnic, religious or economicproblems rather than a threat of outside invasion. The OSCE is currentlyunder Swiss Presidency. It is launching a discussion on a model forsecurity in the 21st century and is inviting input. The group suggestsencouraging non-nuclear weapons states to participate in this discussion.If the WEU is accepted as Europe's security force, then the currentlyproposed security arrangement - a European nuclear deterrent shared byFrance, UK, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Greece, Turkey andothers - will become a reality.Lobbying, Dialogue and Campaigning:convened by Xanthe Hall (IPPNW Germany)Koertestrasse 10, D-10967 Berlin, Tel: +49-30-693 0244, Fax: 693 8166, E-=Mail:ippnw@oln.comlink.apc.orgThis working group arises out of work that IPPNW has being undertakingin the last year or more as their main area of work. Physicians and otherprofessionals have the ability to influence decision-makers in their area=s ofcompetence. During lobbying work on the CTBT and NPT it has becomeclear that many organisations are involved in lobbying and this workoften crosses over. This working group would focus on methodology; itwould help set up international delegations and avoid duplication ofefforts; it could discuss best approaches to different negotiating forums.IPPNW has also been working with Oxford Research Group onDialoguing with Decision-Makers, such as nuclear scientists, arms traders=,military leaders. IPPNW  has met with NATO to discuss a nuclear weaponfree zone in Eastern Europe. Already had some success in bringingmilitary leaders from Britain and China together to discuss security andabolition. The lobbying and dialoguing needs corresponding campaigningto show the breadth of support behind it and to involve the grassrootswith this work in postcard, letter-writing and fax actions. Working withpolitical parties, locally and nationally, as well as local authorities i=s veryimportant.

Reporting from combat zones is extremely dangerous. CPJ advises journalists to undertake these hazardous assignments only with the backing of a news organization that will provide them with comprehensive insurance. The SafetyNet is an interactive bulletin board for foreign correspondents. Reporters in dangerous areas can warn colleagues about professional difficulties and safety hazards faced by the working press. They can exchange practical information on lodging, travel logistics, accreditation rules, and other subjects. As a start, CPJ's regional experts have provided up-to-date information on working conditions in several of the world's riskiest current assignments: Algeria, Chechnya, and the former Yugoslavia We also offer guidance for coverage of Cuba, still the most closed society in the Western hemisphere.

Since the end of the Cold War, with the eruption of ethnic conflicts around the world, journalism has become a far more dangerous profession. Homicide is now the leading cause of job-related death for reporters, editors and broadcasters around the world. As a young child growing up in Communist-ruled Budapest, I witnessed the arrest of my mother and father who worked as correspondents for United Press International and the Associated Press, respectively. In retaliation for doing their jobs, they were falsely charged with being CIA agents and sentenced to long prison terms. I have therefore never taken for granted the right of reporters to cover the news "without fear or favor." As a foreign correspondent covering stories from southern Africa to the Middle East, I witnessed firsthand the dangers routinely faced by our colleagues. Like many of us, I left these assignments wishing that we could do more for those who face daily peril. Now we can. I am appealing to you as a colleague to help the Committee to Protect Journalists continue to fight for the rights of beleaguered journalists everywhere. By becoming a member today, youâll play an important role in protecting press freedom and the right of journalists to freely report the news. Since 1981, CPJ has been defending the rights of journalists. Itâs an important mission. Attempts to suppress their freedom have grown more brazenï¿½and more deadly. CPJ has documented that since 1986, more than 300 journalists have been murdered as a direct consequence of their workï¿½in 1995 alone, 45 were assassinated. In all these cases, we are actively pressuring governments to investigate and prosecute those responsible. Sometimes, of course, the governments themselves are responsible. CPJ is an organization that is committed to the freedoms that we cherish as American journalists. The Committee investigates more than a thousand attacks on the press each year and works to make sure that those responsible are held accountable for their actions. Here are two recent examples of CPJ at work: Fred Mâmembe, editor of Zambiaâs leading independent newspaper The Post, is facing a barrage of sedition and criminal libel suits for his criticism of President Frederick Chilubaâs government. When he was arrested and placed in a maximum security prison for several weeks between February and March 1996, CPJ inundated officials in Lusaka with letters protesting Mâmembeâs detention and alerted the news media to his situation. After his release, Mâmembe told CPJ that without the international outcry he could very easily have "disappeared" from his cell without anyone noticing. In October 1995, in retaliation for his reporting on Bosnian Serb atrocities, Christian Science Monitor reporter David Rohde was tried and convicted by the Bosnian Serbs of illegally entering Bosnian Serb territory and of falsifying documents. On behalf of CPJ, I held several meetings with Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic at the Dayton peace talks. I urged him "to work with his Bosnian Serb colleagues to bring this situation to a positive end." Our efforts were instrumental in securing Rohdeâs release a few days later. It doesnât always work that way. Journalists are being jailed in record numbers. And when they are murdered--even in the United States--the crimes are usually never solved. Most people believe that journalists who get in trouble just happen to be in harmâs way while covering a story. The truth is that journalists are threatened, physically assaulted and targeted for political assassination in a direct attempt to control how the news is reported. Pro-government death squads in Turkey have murdered journalists sympathetic to the Kurdish opposition. Crime reporters in Russia are routinely intimidated by organized crime thugs and corrupt officials. And in Algeria, journalists are regularly hunted down by religious extremists who are determined to eliminate any secular voice in the country. These crimes are not just attacks on the press, they are an attack on all freedoms. Thatâs why we need you to join the Committee to Protect Journalists. To maintain its independence, CPJ does not accept government funding. We rely entirely on your support. Your tax-deductible contribution will help the Committee continue to investigate attacks against journalists, no matter where they happen and without regard to political ideology. Weâll continue to keep the journalism community informed about these problems by publishing our findings in our member newsletter, in special investigative reports and on the Internet. Weâll also stay in contact with reporters who cover the media business, international affairs and human rights to raise awareness about how restrictions on press freedom and attacks on journalists adversely affect the coverage of all important stories. Your CPJ membership means that you are committed to the struggle for freedom of the press and for the safety of journalists everywhere. It also means that CPJ can continue working to make sure that these ideals are upheld around the world. On behalf of CPJ and your colleagues who have been persecuted for reporting the news, thank you for supporting the Committee to Protect Journalists.

Judge Maria Laura Garrigos de Reborisaid in her Dec. 17 decision in the more than two-year-old libel case thatcolumnist Horacio Verbitsky had only been doing his job as a journalistwhen he wrote that the president had not been tortured as he claimed duringhis arrest under the military dictatorship. The judge also acquitted Ernesto Tiffenberg and Fernando Sokolowicz,editors of Pagina 12 sued by President Menem, and ordered Menemto pay the costs of the trial. In her verdict she said that freedom ofexpression meant both the right of the press to inform and the right ofsociety to be informed. "The journalist fulfilled the duty imposedby his job when he said Menem was not telling the truth," she saidin a television interview. "This is a major victory for the Argentine press at a privotalmoment in the country's evolution as a democratic society," said WilliamA. Orme, Jr., CPJ's executive director. "We commend our Argentinecolleagues in their principled pursuit of press freedom. This decisionis particularly important because the Argentine press, which is held inhigh esteem by the majority of people, has for years been under legal assaultby the Menem government." President Menem sued Pagina 12 in October 1994 for publishingthe article by Verbitsky that questioned the veracity of the president'sclaims of torture. It was the fourth libel suit initiated by Menem againstthe paper, which also has been the target of lawsuits by members of theMenem government. CPJ criticized the continued legal harassment of Pagina12 in a letter to President Menem in 1994. A broad range of Argentine journalists, writers, and officials had ralliedin support of Pagina 12, including the Association for the Defenseof Independent Journalism, an independent press freedom group formed oneyear ago to act on behalf of threatened or harassed journalists. Scoresof journalists were among the thousands of people who were murdered ordisappeared under the military dictatorship in Argentina that ended in1983. CPJ is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization devoted to the defenseof press freedom and the professional rights of journalists around theworld.

"Nobody in the world has been sentenced to so many years in prison for articles others have written,"he said from his jail cell in an interview with the daily Yeni Yuzyil. Yurtcu, former editor in chief of the now-defunct daily Ozgur Gundem, is serving a 15-year sentence, upheld on appeal in December 1994, for disseminating "separatist propaganda."The case against Yurtcu was based on articles about the Kurdish conflict published in Ozgur Gundem in 1991 and 1992. Throughout its existence, his paper had been targeted by the Turkish government for its extensive and balanced reporting on the Kurdish conflict. For three years running, Turkey has held more journalists in prison than any other country. Yurtcu's case is emblematic of the types of charges used by the government to imprison dozens of reporters, editors, and columnists. The basis for most of these charges is the Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of the Penal Code, which in effect classify all reports on the Kurdish rebellion other than the government's as "incitement to racial hatred" or propaganda for the insurgent Kurdistan Workers' Party, the PKK, in the country's Southeast.â YURTCU REPORTS ON POLITICAL PRISONERS, KURDISH REBELLION Yurtcu entered the world of journalism as a reporter for the now-defunct daily Ekspres in 1966. He later went on to work as a reporter, columnist, or editor at many other newspapers, including Yenigun, Ulus, Politika, Dunya, Demokrat, Gunes, Cumhuriyet, and Yeni Halkci. It was at Yeni Halkci in 1971 that Yurtcu first earned national recognition as a journalist who reported news the government would rather suppress. He published a series of articles documenting the systematic torture of political prisoners. It was for these and other investigative stories that he was inducted in 1975 as an honorary member to the National Writers' Union of Turkey, an honor accorded very few journalists. Yurtcu became the editor of Ozgur Gundem in 1991. Under his editorship, Ozgur Gundem was widely read and highly respected as an unbiased newspaper that offered readers an alternative to the government's view on the Kurdish issue. Ozgur Gundem broke new ground with its hard-hitting reporting on the fighting in southeastern Turkey between the military and the PKK guerrillas, a conflict that has received inadequate coverage from the mainstream, pro-government media. During Yurtcu's tenure at the paper, Ozgur Gundem's circulation reached 100,000, a record-breaking number for a nonmainstream newspaper in Turkey. YURTCU JAILED AND OZGUR GUNDEM SHUT DOWN BY THE GOVERNMENT In 1993, Yurtcu was tried and convicted for various articles published in Ozgur Gundem. He was sentenced to a total of 15 years and 10 months in prison for violating Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of the Penal Code. He was sent to prison in December 1994 when an appeals court upheld his sentence. Since his imprisonment, several more sentences have been handed down from other cases against him, and he says he is no longer sure how many more years he will be incarcerated. He is currently serving his 15-year sentence in the Sakarya prison, east of Istanbul. Yurtcu's case was only one of many launched by the government against the newspaper. Authorities had led a concerted campaign of arrests, bans and trials against Ozgur Gundem, eventually forcing the paper to close in April 1994. In addition to the legal harassment, journalists at the paper were frequent targets of violent reprisal by unidentified assailants. In 1992 alone, four journalists with the paper were assassinated. The murderers were never brought to justice. Since Ozgur Gundem's closure, two successor papers, which were less objective in their coverage and less successful, were also shut down by the government. The latest incarnation, Demokrasi, has regained some of the balanced reporting Ozgur Gundem was known for, but it has a circulation of only 5,000 readers. YURTCU VOWS TO FIGHT INJUSTICE OF HIS SENTENCE In an interview with the Turkish daily Millyet, Yurtcu was blunt about the impossible bind in which Turkish journalists find themselves: "My problem is not unique. ... What I'm going through can face all journalists out there. They can use laws to put you in prison just for mentioning the word ï¿½PKK' in your news story. They take this as ï¿½praising the terrorist organization.' How can you write about the Southeast without mentioning the PKK?" At great cost to himself, Yurtcu's determination to change the situation for Turkish journalists is unwavering. A colleague of his from Ozgur Gundem recalled in an article published in Demokrasi how the courageous Turkish editor was offered the option of self-imposed exile when his prison sentence looked imminent. "He wouldn't accept," Huseyin Akyol wrote. "He decided to stay in his country to fight against the injustice. He believes that being a journalist cannot be a crime.".â |International Press Freedom Awards|| CPJ Website | Urgent Case Index | WT01-B01-44IA024-000250-B021-374http://www.cpj.org:80/pubs/regionalreports/reportsindex.html 169.132.35.44 19970108111434 text/html 1489HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 11:14:23 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 1318Last-modified: Fri, 06 Dec 1996 20:39:36 GMT CPJ Press Freedom Briefing October 1996 Clampdown in Addis Ethiopia's Journalists at Risk September 1996 Briefing Paper on Press Freedom In Bosnia And Herzegovina Before the September 14th Elections June 1996 Briefing on Press Freedom in RussiaBefore the Presidential Elections (c) 1996 Committee Protect Journalists | CPJ Website || Publications|                                                                        WT01-B01-45IA024-000250-B022-33http://www.cpj.org:80/pubs/regionalreports/ethiopia/index.html 169.132.35.44 19970108111546 text/html 5907HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 11:15:14 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 5736Last-modified: Fri, 06 Dec 1996 20:39:54 GMT Press Freedom Report By Kakuna Kerina Committee to Protect Journalists Table of Contents Introductory Essay by Josh Friedman Clampdown in Addis: Ethiopiaâs Journalists at Risk The Press Proclamation and the Prosecution of Journalists Censorship and Libel Freedom of Information The Private Press: The ChallengesFacing Independent Journalists The State Media: The Government Press and the Broadcast Monopoly Ushering Ethiopian Journalism into the 21st Century Recommendations to the Ethiopian and U.S. Governments Appendix i: Distribution of Print Media Printing Presses The New Technologies Foreign Media Presence Professional Associations Training Appendix ii: Attacks on the Press in Ethiopia, 1992-1996 Appendix iii: A List of Ethiopian Media Government Newspapers Government-run Broadcast Media and Wire Services Private Newspapers Private Magazines ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) thanks the many reporters and editors who generously shared their time as we conducted research for this report. We would also like to thank the following Ethiopian government officials who formally received CPJ to discuss our requests and concerns about press freedom: Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Justice Minister Mahteme Solomon, and Speaker of Parliament Davit Yohannes. CPJ is indebted as well to the representatives we met with from local nongovernmental organizations, the international diplomatic community, and international donor agencies working on media-related issues in Ethiopia. ABOUT THIS REPORT In May 1996, CPJ Africa program coordinator Kakuna Kerina and board member Josh Friedman conducted a 12-day fact-finding mission to Ethiopia. The primary reasons for the mission were: The alarming fact that for three consecutive years, Ethiopia has imprisoned more journalists than any other African country; The mass arrests of journalists in 1995 for their coverage of an assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as he attended an Organization of African Unity (OAU) meeting in Addis Ababa, and on Ethiopiaâs former Communist dictator Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, who is living in exile in Zimbabwe; A critical need for a firsthand analysis of the Ethiopian media, especially in light of the unprecedented social and political changes that have transpired in the five years since Col. Mengistuâs regime was overthrown and democratic elections (albeit boycotted by the opposition) were held in 1995 for the first time in the countryâs history. CPJ held more than 50 in-depth discussions with journalists from the private and state press, government officials, and representatives of international donor agencies and local nongovernmental organizations. It is important to note that in most of those informative and often lengthy discussions, numerous government officials and private citizens spoke on the condition of anonymity. CPJ is releasing this report on Oct. 7, 1996--the day Ethiopiaâs Parliament reconvenes--to focus attention on important media issues that legislators will address, such as an update on the Press Proclamation No. 34/1992, a restrictive press law enacted in 1992; the establishment of a media committee within the Parliament; the creation of a press council and a government Department of Information; and the structuring of a regulatory framework for future private ownership of broadcast media. Josh Friedman, a CPJ board member and a former chairman of the Committee, is the U.N. bureau chief for Newsday and an adjunct professor of journalism at Columbia Universityâs Graduate School of Journalism. In 1985, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his coverage of the famine in Ethiopia. Kakuna Kerina, CPJâs Africa program coordinator, is an editor, author, and award-winning documentary filmmaker. She has lived and studied in Ghana, Ethiopia, and Botswana, and traveled throughout Africa.

What is CPJ? The Committee to Protect Journalists is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization founded in 1981 to monitor and protest abuses against working journalists and their news organizations, regardless of their ideology or nationality. CPJ is the only organization in the United States with a full-time staff devoted to documenting and responding to violations of press freedoms throughout the world. How did CPJ get started? A group of U.S. foreign correspondents created CPJ in response to the often brutal treatment of their foreign colleagues by authoritarian governments and other enemies of independent journalism. Who runs CPJ? CPJ's professional staff--based in New York City--includes an area specialist for each region of the world. These specialists track press conditions in their regions through independent research, reports from the field and fact-finding missions. The Committee's activities are directed by a board of prominent U.S. journalists. The press is so powerful; why does it need protection? The press in the United States does have great power and enjoys legal protection. But that's not the case everywhere. On average, at least one journalist is killed every week somewhere in the world. Scores of journalists are imprisoned every year because of what they have reported. And hundreds more are routinely subjected to physical attack, illegal detention, spurious legal action and threats against their safety. How is CPJ funded? CPJ is entirely dependent on private donations from journalists, news organizations and foundations. To maintain its independence, CPJ does not accept government funding. How does CPJ "protect" journalists? By verifying and publicizing press freedom violations and by acting on behalf of imprisoned and threatened journalists, CPJ seeks to combat such abuses. CPJ organizes vigorous campaigns at all levels--using a range of local and international media--and, when necessary, works behind the scenes through governmental and other channels to effect change. When would a journalist call upon CPJ? In an emergency. Using local contacts, CPJ can intervene anytime foreign correspondents are in trouble. CPJ is also prepared to immediately notify news organizations, government officials and human rights organizations of press freedom violations. Before travel. Call CPJ for local contacts around the world or for practical advice regarding dangerous assignments. Or visit the Correspondentâs SafetyNet at this Web site for safety tips and other vital information about reporting from danger zones. On assignment. CPJ provides information to journalists to help them better protect themselves while covering dangerous situations, and provides contacts and other practical information to foreign editors and correspondents in the field. What else does CPJ do? When dangerous situations arise--such as a coup--CPJ will send foreign editors and correspondents same-day advisories with practical information. Reports by CPJ are transmitted instantly to other press freedom organizations worldwide via fax and the Internet. CPJ provides safety training to foreign journalists and offers current information about foreign news organizations and local press conditions. CPJ advises local press groups on how to document press freedom violations and mobilize international support. CPJ presents International Press Freedom Awards each year to journalists who have displayed special courage in defending press freedom despite imprisonment, physical attack, censorship or threats. Whatâs the best way to contact CPJ? If you are in need of emergency aid or would like to report an attack on the press: Call CPJ at (212) 465-1004. Call collect if necessary. Fax us at (212) 465-9568. Or, send an e-mail to one of our regional program coordinators. If you would like to learn more about CPJâs work, are interested in becoming a member or would like to order one of our publications: Use CPJâs Web site Call us at (212) 465-1004. Or, write us: CPJ, 330 Seventh Avenue, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10001. How can I help? Become a member. CPJ relies on your financial support. We do not accept government funding. Call upon us. Let CPJ know when you, your colleagues or other journalists need help. Cover attacks on the press as news stories. Recognize that in many countries attacks on the press signal a coming crackdown on all freedoms and are an indication of political and social upheaval.

In a signed statement drafted by Marton, Milosevic âreiterated our support for a free press in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] and the right to publish and broadcast freely in the FRY.â âThe pledge is not nearly as specific and full as I had hoped,â Marton noted. âItâs a symbolic document.â She came to the meeting with the Serbian president yesterday with a âmanifesto for him to sign,â mentioning B92 and other broadcast and print media closed or obstructed in recent weeks. At first Milosevic âphysically tore up the paper,â Marton said, refusing to admit that he had practiced censorship. Marton persisted, finally handing him a handwritten statement endorsing the right to a free media, which the President signed. âMilosevic also verbally promised to keep hands off B92,â said Marton, referring to the largest independent radio station in Belgrade, shut down for two days last week during tumultuous demonstrations challenging the Serbian presidentâs nullification of the results of the Nov. 17 municipal elections. B92 and another station, Radio Index, are now back on the air. âIt was due to the combined pressure of U.S. and Western European press freedom groups and governments, and the offer to have [U.S. radio stations] Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty serve as stand-ins for local broadcasters,â said Marton. âNow we need to maintain pressure in order to keep the media open in Yugoslavia,â said the CPJ chair. âThis was Milosevicâs first meeting with the fourth estate since the demonstrations began,â the American journalist noted. Marton, an author and former foreign correspondent, has served as the chair of the board of directors of the Committee to Protect Journalist since 1994. She is the host of the National Public Radio program "America and the World," aired in New York on WNYC and on public radio stations across the country. In Belgrade to investigate the status of the independent media, Marton has met with more than one hundred reporters from various independent news outlets still facing government pressure and has witnessed the throngs of marchers. âThe opposition is handling the situation well,â she commented. âThey are showing remarkable restraint and calm, as well as great tenacity and courage.â Marton also obtained the signature of opposition leader Vuk Draskovic to the pledge to respect the right of the free media to operate freely. Radio B92 in Belgrade also maintains a site at www.opennet.org CPJ is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization devoted to the defense of press freedom and the professional rights of journalists around the world.

"The government should call an immediate and complete halt to its gross interference with the independence of the news media," Marton said at a press conference here today. "President Milosevic should guarantee complete and unrestricted freedom of the press throughout the republics of Serbia and Montenegro from this day going forward," Marton said. Marton's press conference was called to demonstrate support from CPJ and other Western journalists' groups for the independent radio station B92, which had been shut down for two days earlier this week by the Milosevic government. On Dec. 5, Serb authorities backed down under intense international outcry and B92 was again permitted to broadcast, although other independent radio stations are still off the air and the independent news media remains under severe government pressure. The press conference was hosted by Veran Matic, the founder and editor-in-chief of B92. Matic was a recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award in 1993. "When I first heard that B92 was being jammed, and then was taken off the air altogether, I knew that I had to come to Belgrade to show solidarity with our colleagues who are courageously attempting to cover the news under extremely difficult and risky conditions," Ms. Marton said. "We believe that a strong international show of support is required to keep Serbia's free press alive at this critical moment," Marton said at the news conference. She called on President Slobodan Milosevic to "stop immediately your gross interference in the independent media in Serbia and cease the creation of obstacles for the legal operation of B92 and other media covering the opposition and public events in Serbia." Marton has requested a meeting with President Milosevic. Marton, an author and former foreign correspondent, has served as the chair of the board of directors of CPJ since 1994. She is the host of the National Public Radio program "America and the World," aired in New York on WNYC and on public radio stations across the country. B92 and other independent news outlets in Serbia faced interference in their transmissions and were subsequently shut down by Serb authorities for two days for their coverage of massive public demonstrations rocking the Balkan nation in the wake of opposition victories in the Nov. 17 municipal elections since nullified by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The director of Radio B92 told CPJ that the government started interfering with its transmission when the station began reporting on the large daily protest marches in Belgrade and other Serbian cities last week. The government retaliated with sporadic blocking of B92's signal, then with the jamming of all programming on Nov. 28. The transmitter was shut off on Dec. 3. The station was notified by federal communications authorities that it was illegally operating "without a license." On the evening of Dec. 5, Serb authorities backed down under intense international outcry and B92 was again permitted to broadcast. During the shut-down, B92's journalists continued to report directly from the streets of Belgrade, relaying the news through the city by telephone, electronic mail, and printed flyers, and rebroadcasting information via Voice of America. Through the Internet, B92 has been posting daily news briefs and maintaining a RealAudio broadcast on its site on the World Wide Web (www.opennet.org). Attached is a chronology of recent press freedom violations documented by CPJ in the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro and the texts of correspondence between Serbian authorities and B92.

It is our hope that this recognition by their peers in the United States will send a signal to opponents of a free press everywhere.â Information on the award recipients follows. Burton Benjamin Memorial Award for lifetime achievement in promoting press freedom Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Twenty-five years ago Arthur Ochs Sulzberger made a decision that profoundly strengthened the free American press. He decided that The New York Times should publish portions of the Pentagon Papers, the secret Defense Department history of United States involvement in Vietnam. The series of articles that followed changed the publicâs perception of its government ï¿½ and, just as important, changed the pressâs view of its role in a democratic society. The pressures on Mr. Sulzberger as publisher of The Times were great. The paperâs longtime lawyers told him that he risked criminal prosecution. The Vietnam War was going on, with American soldiers coming back in body bags, and he was an intensely patriotic person. But he decided that the interest of telling Americans the truth about an issue that was dividing the country must prevail: that it was the publicâs right to know and the pressâs duty to report. After the third installment of the series appeared in The Times, the Nixon Administration won a restraining order from a judge: the first prior restraint against newspaper publication ever granted to the federal government. The Supreme Court overturned that restraint in a landmark decision. Justice Hugo L. Black, in his concurring opinion, said that âin revealing the workings of government that led to the Vietnam War,â The Times and other newspapers that followed it ânobly didâ what the Framers of the Constitution had hoped and expected. The Burton Benjamin Memorial Award honors the late CBS News senior producer and former CPJ chairman who died in 1988. INTERNATIONAL PRESS FREEDOM AWARD WINNERS J. JESUS BLANCORNELAS is co-founder of the muckraking newsweekly Zeta, in Tijuana, Mexico. His career-long dedication to press freedom in Mexico has played a crucial role in the evolution of the Mexican press, which, despite government pressure and threats from criminal bosses, today provides increasingly balanced news coverage. With Zeta, founded in 1980, and earlier with the Tijuana daily AB C, Blancornelas defied official efforts to censor his publications, a stance that caused him personal hardship and cost the life of his longtime colleague, popular columnist Hector FÃ©lix Miranda, who was murdered in Tijuana in April 1988. The year before unidentified assailants riddled the Ze taoffice with gunfire. And over the years waves of harassment ranging from confiscation of issues to outright threats to advertisers have plagued the newspaper. In a country where the news media had historically cowered to government interests and where bribe-taking among journalists was commonplace, Zetadared to provide what few other Mexican newspapers had: hard-hitting stories on Mexicoâs most vexing problems ï¿½ official corruption and drug trafficking. Despite the risks, Blancornelas has not been deterred and has inspired a newly empowered generation of independent journalists to reject old habits of self-censorship, bribe-taking and government subsidies. YUSUF JAMEEL, a Kashmiri journalist withAsian Agein Delhi, India, who was formerly a correspondent for the BBC and a stringer for Reuters andTime magazine, is a leading reporter on the civil war in Indian-held Kashmir. His career has been marked by violent reprisal ï¿½ beatings, grenade attacks and, last fall, a letter bomb addressed to him that killed a colleague and injured Jameel. He has withstood pressure and attacks from all parties to the conflict in Kashmir, which pits Indian security forces and government-backed militias against an array of guerrilla groups fighting for the stateâs independence or merger with Pakistan. The combatants view the local press as biased in favor of their adversaries and retaliate through violence and intimidation. In 1990 Indian security officers seized Jameel, took him blindfolded to a remote location and interrogated him about a colleagueâs alleged contacts with militants. Twice in 1992 unidentified assailants threw grenades at his home and office in Srinagar. Later that year security officers severely beat him while he was covering a protest march by a Kashmiri womenâs group. Jameel also has periodically faced threats from militant separatists displeased with his coverage of the war. Although he continues to be based in Delhi, he wrote in an article for the International Press Institute in September that he is âkeen to return to Srinagar to resume work, but many well-wishers concerned for my safety insist that I should not do so.â He continues, âBut I believe that such risks are part of my profession.â DAOUD KUTTAB has long challenged censorship practices of both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. Kuttabâs outspoken criticism of the Palestinian Authorityâs despotic treatment of the nascent independent press and his creative techniques to educate, empower and mobilize independent Palestinian media are driving forces behind efforts to foster independent journalism in the Middle East. In the 1980s, Kuttab worked as a reporter and later managing editor of the now defunct English-language weekly Al-Fajr, as a reporter and columnist for the Arabic-language East Jerusalem daily Al-Quds, and as a contributor to other papers, among them the Jerusalem Post. During that time, he was arrested, searched, and fingerprinted on several occasions for activities that included participating in public demonstrations against Israeli press censorship and writing about an armed attack by Jewish extremists at the Palestinian University in Hebron. After leaving Al-Fajr, Kuttab went to work for the dailyAl-Quds, where he broke many stories on the peace process and was the first Palestinian to conduct exclusive interviews with Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. Since the Oslo Accords, Kuttab has been a vocal critic of the anti-democratic impulses of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, whose government has dealt despotically with critical reporting and legitimate political dissent, jailing dozens of journalists. In August 1994 when Arafat ordered Al-Quds to stop publishing Kuttabâs columns after he led independent journalists in a protest against the banning of Jerusalemâs only other Arabic-language daily at the time, Kuttab was fired. But he has refused to be silenced, writing opinion pieces for The New York Times, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, International Herald Tribune and others. Last April he established the censorship-free Arabic Media Internet Network, a World Wide Web site known as AMIN (http://www.amin.org). As president of the Palestinian Audio-Visual Union, he has been active in protesting censorship and access violations by the Israelis and the Palestinian Authority. OCAK ISIK YURTCU had little to celebrate last July 24, Journalists Day in Turkey. âNobody in the world has been sentenced to so many years in prison for articles others have written,â he said from his jail cell in Sakarya prison east of Istanbul in an interview with the daily Yeni Yuzyil. Yurtcu, former editor in chief of the now-defunct daily Ozgur Gundem, is serving a 15-year sentence, upheld on appeal in December 1994, for disseminating âseparatist propaganda.â The case against this journalist, respected by his peers in Turkey and beyond for his independence and tenacity, was based on articles about the Kurdish issue published in Ozgur Gundem in 1991 and 1992. Throughout its existence, his paper had been targeted by the Turkish government for its extensive and balanced reporting on the Kurdish conflict. Yurtcu was charged under the Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of the Penal Code, which in effect classify all reports on the Kurdish rebellion other than the governmentâs as either propaganda for the insurgent Kurdistan Workersâ Party, the PKK, in the countryâs Southeast or as âincitement to racial hatred.â Since his imprisonment in 1994, several more sentences have been handed down from other cases against him, and he says he is no longer sure how many more years he will be incarcerated. The governmentâs campaign of arrests, bans and trials against Ozgur Gundem forced the paper to close in April 1994. In addition to the legal harassment, journalists at the paper were frequent targets of violence by unidentified assailants. In 1992 alone, four journalists at the paper were assassinated. The murderers were never brought to justice. At great cost to himself, Yurtcuâs determination to change the situation for Turkish journalists is unwavering. He reportedly rejected the option of self-imposed exile over prison. âHe decided to stay in his country to fight against the injustice,â writes a colleague. âHe believes that being a journalist cannot be a crime.â THE COMMITTEE TO PROTECT JOURNALISTS is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization founded in 1981 to monitor abuses against the press and promote press freedom around the world.

The cases are based on articles and a cartoon published in March criticizing the government. In a letter released today in advance of Mr. Haririâs Washington meeting with President Clinton Friday, CPJ expressed its deep concern over the pending trials of Al-Diyar editor in chief Sheril Ayyoub, director Youssef Howeyyek and cartoonist Elie Saliba. Government prosecutors have brought six libel suits against Mr. Ayyoub and Mr. Howeyyek for a series of articles that appeared in Al-Diyar between March 1 and March 16 that criticized Mr. Hariri and other Lebanese government officials. Mr. Saliba is charged in one of the suits for his satirical cartoon depicting current members of government. Their trials are expected to begin before the end of the year. The journalists are being prosecuted for vaguely worded offenses under both the Lebanese Publications Law and the Penal Code that include âdefaming and soiling the honor of the president of the republic and the government.â They face up to two years in prison and fines of up to 100 million Lebanese lira for each charge if convicted. Spokesmen for the newspaper said that the imposition of such heavy monetary penalties would likely force the paper to cease publication. âThese journalists are being prosecuted for having carried out their professional duties,â CPJ said in its letter, noting that such measures represent violations of the right of freedom of information guaranteed by Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations. The committee asked the prime minister to recommend to the appropriate authorities that charges against the journalists be withdrawn and to take steps âto enact the necessary legal safeguards to prevent future violations of journalistsâ rights to report news and opinions freely.â CPJ documents and responds to press freedom abuses around the world. From its headquarters in New York, CPJ works to win the release of imprisoned journalists, directs international campaigns of protest against repressive governments, and provides practical safety information to reporters assigned to dangerous areas.

Kirsch told CPJ that Serbian Security Forces beat him, seized his camera and confiscated his videocassette. On Oct. 11, Kirsch, a free-lance journalist and cameraman working for Insight News Television Limited (INTV) of Great Britain, was videotaping a destroyed house in Jusici, a Muslim village now under the control of the Bosnian Serb Republic. According to Kirsch's own account of the incident, 10 Serb police with AK-47 assault rifles ran from around the house and yelled, "Don't move or we'll shoot!" He said the soldiers then ordered him to stop filming. Kirsch told CPJ that two Serb police then "took turns shoving and kicking me" while they tried to take his camera. Kirsch said police knocked him to the ground, spit on him and pointed their guns at him. He said he tried to hand off his camera to a Danish International Police Task Force (IPTF) officer, but a Serb policeman pointed his gun at the Danish officer and ordered him to give up the camera. Kirsch also reported that a U.S. Army cameraman, operating under the Peace Implementation Force (IFOR) command, filmed the entire scene. IFOR retrieved Kirsch's camera the next day and returned it to him, but the videocassette inside was missing. Kirsch and INTV have requested copies of the IFOR videotape of the attack, but these requests have been denied. In an appeal to Flavio Cotti, chairman of the OSCE in Europe, CPJ Executive Director William A. Orme, Jr., called upon the OSCE to thoroughly investigate the incident and to ensure that Kirsch's videocassette is returned. CPJ also pointed out that the attack on Kirsch occurred nearly one month after the Sept. 14 elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and demonstrates a continued and blatant lack of fidelity to the Dayton Peace Accords. The accords, signed Dec. 14, 1995, guarantee freedom of movement and freedom of expression throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. Addendum measures to the Dayton Accords further specify guarantees that journalists "will not be subject to detention, harassment or interference in pursuit of their legitimate activities." In light of these measures, CPJ called on OSCE to put an end to any further attacks on journalists in Bosnia and Herzegovnia. CPJ is a New York-based nonprofit, nonpartisan organization devoted to the defense of press freedom around the world. On Sept. 6, 1996, CPJ issued a briefing on press freedom conditions prior to the Sept. 14 Bosnian elections. To obtain a hard copy of the report, call (212) 465-1004, x110.

This, in response to a report by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) detailing the legal harassment and imprisonment of Ethiopian journalists, and the governmentâs systematic exclusion of the private press from official press conferences. State Department Spokesperson Nicholas Burns told the Committeeâs chair, Kati Marton, that CPJâs report Clampdown in Addis: Ethiopiaâs Journalists at Risk led to the policy change. In a public statement, Secretary of State Christopher told reporters, âEthiopia has made progress in human rights during the past five years, but the United States wants to see more. One of the areas of our concern is the freedom of the press and the treatment of journalists.â CPJâs report is based on a fact-finding mission conducted last May by Africa Program Coordinator Kakuna Kerina, who wrote the report, and CPJ board member and Newsday U.N. bureau chief Josh Friedman, who wrote the reportâs introductory essay. Based on more than 50 interviews with government officials, journalists and other sources, the report demonstrates how independent journalists are regularly harassed, censored and jailed under the provisions of a restrictive press law enacted in 1992. The repressive climate exists despite promises of press freedom made by the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) in 1991 and by the recently elected Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, who served as TGE president. Clampdown in Addis, which was released on October 7 -- the day Ethiopiaâs Parliament reconvened to address key media issues -- made several recommendations to the Meles administration, and called on the United States and other Western countries to take a more aggressive role in encouraging the Ethiopian government to uphold guarantees of press freedom. âSecretary of State Christopherâs position is a welcome step toward what CPJ hopes will be a continued U.S. government commitment to press freedom and support for Ethiopiaâs independent journalists,â said Kerina. âWe look forward to the time when the Ethiopian government views the private press as an ally, not an enemy, in the democratic process.â To order copies of Clampdown in Addis: Ethiopiaâs Journalists at Risk, please call (212) 465-1004.

The report, Clampdown in Addis: Ethiopiaâs Journalists at Risk, demonstrates how independent journalists are regularly harassed, censored and jailed under the provisions of a restrictive press law enacted in 1992. This, despite promises of press freedom made by the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) in 1991 and by the recently elected Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, who served as TGE president. The report is being released on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopherâs first official visit to Ethiopia and on the day the countryâs parliament reconvenes to address key media issues. In addition to making several recommendations to the Meles administration, the report also calls on the United States and other Western countries to take a more aggressive role in encouraging the Ethiopian government to uphold guarantees of press freedom. âJournalists must struggle to practice their profession in an environment that is intolerant of a core democratic principleï¿½the right to speak freely without fear of government reprisal,â said CPJ Africa program coordinator Kakuna Kerina. Kerina, the reportâs author, went to Ethiopia in May on a fact-finding mission with CPJ board member and former chair Josh Friedman, who wrote the reportâs introductory essay. Friedman, the U.N. bureau chief for Newsday, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for his reporting on the famine in Ethiopia. In their discussions with more than 50 Ethiopian journalists, government officials and other sources, Friedman and Kerina found that the Meles government, which still maintains a monopoly on the broadcast media, uses restrictive provisions of the 1992 Press Proclamation to quash opposing viewpoints and limit the news the independent press may report. Under that law: Libel is classified as both a criminal and civil offense, demanding penalties of payment in the amount of twice the value of a publisherâs assets. Journalists are prohibited from disseminating information that the government deems âsecretâï¿½a charge often leveled against journalists reporting on issues of national security or ethnic unrest in the provinces. Journalists are guaranteed the right to âseek, obtain and reportâ news from any government source, but the private press is routinely denied access to government officials and their agencies as well as to official state press conferences. Ethiopiaâs independent journalists currently work under threat of arrest and prosecution by either a poorly trained police force or an inexperienced, partisan judiciary working in a backlogged court system. Both are spurred on by government officials who are easily offended by public criticism of their policies. Many journalists are arrested in an arbitrary manner, on the initiative of police or as a result of charges filed by the public prosecutor. In many cases, police officers decide independently that publications have acted illegally, and they arrest journalists before gathering evidence or filing charges in the courts. From 1993 to 1995, more than 50 Ethiopian journalists were imprisonedï¿½of those, 31 were behind bars at the end of last year. The report recommends that the Meles government take aggressive steps to ensure press freedom in Ethiopia. Among them, CPJ calls on the Ethiopian government to: Immediately and unconditionally release all journalists who have been imprisoned for exercising their internationally recognized legal right to report the news. Eliminate all criminal libel statutes in the Press Proclamation. Abolish excessive bail, which is primarily used as a weapon to drive private publications into financial insolvency. Grant the private press equal and unrestricted access to government press conferences, including joint press conferences with foreign diplomatic representatives and other international figures. Establish an equitable system that permits private ownership of broadcast media. The United States, which supports the Meles government and gives Ethiopia the second highest amount of U.S. aid allocated to sub-Saharan Africa, can greatly influence the development of a free press. Among its recommendations, CPJ also calls on the U.S. government to: Give media training higher priority when allocating funds for democratization in Ethiopia. Issue a public statement granting the private press equal and unrestricted access to all press conferences involving U.S. officials and to all official U.S. Embassy functions. Publicly encourage the Ethiopian government to give the private press access to government officials and activities.

MacArthur HONG KONG----Oct. 3. A delegation of the Committee to Protect Journalists led by Peter Arnett of CNN today concluded a ten day fact-finding mission to Vietnam and Cambodia, where they documented seriuos difficulties for local and foreign journalists in both countries, Arnett and CPJ program coordinator Vikram Parekh reported in a press conference here. Arnett, Parekh and Harper's magazine publisher John R. MacArthur first traveled to Vietnam, where they interviewed scores of local journalists and top-ranking government officials. Arnett and Parekh continued on to Phnom Penh to investigate press freedom conditions in Cambodia. Despite far-reaching market reforms, Vietnam's media remain entirely state-owned and subject to strict control by authorities, the Committee reported. The country's press is officially encouraged to expose corruption in government offices, but criticism of major policies remains off limits. Three publications--the daily newspaper Hanoi Moi and the magazines Tien Phong and Business and Law--are currently under investigation for revealing state secrets in articles about the country's civil aviation and oil field operations. "It is disturbing to see the media being investigated for attempting to ensure public accountability," said Parekh, "but we were encouraged by comments indicating that the publications were not in danger of criminal prosecution." The country's ideology chief, Hun Tho, told CPJ that in his opinion the three publications had not committed serious violations, Parekh noted. CPJ is guardedly optimistic about the prospects for press freedom in Vietnam. "The very fact that we were welcomed as an official delegation and granted access to officials at the highest level represents a significant opening," Parekh said. Cambodia's newly emergent press is highly combative, but also highly partisan and often inflammatory, CPJ reported. Local journalists work against the chilling backdrop of assassinations, violent assaults, and a restrictive press law. Four journalists have been killed in Cambodia since 1994, and, according to CPJ, there has been no credible attempt to investigate any of these murders. However, in a meeting with Arnett and Parekh, First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh described the lack of progress in the investigations as "unacceptable" and pledged to raise the issue with the country's Interior Ministry. Cambodian journalists also face legal constraints, compounded by the lack of an impartial judiciary and police force. A new press law passed by the National Assembly allows criminal penalties for articles that threaten the country's "political stability" and "national security"--vaguely worded provisions that Cambodian journalists and public defenders fear will be used to muzzle the press. In response to CPJ's concern, Information Minister Ieng Mouly said a draft sub-decree aimed at clarifying the terms, would be presented to local and foreign journalists, as well as nongovernmental organizations for comment. The New York-based Committee--a nongovernmental organization that monitors press freedom conditions worldwide--announced its findings at a conference in Hong Kong hosted by the Freedom Forum Asian Center. CPJ will also be publishing its findings in an upcoming report.

"We hope that the verdict in the Feral Tribune trial signals an expansion of press freedom in Croatia," said William A. Orme, Jr., executive director of CPJ. "The next step is to ensure that criminal libel statutes, which are designed to discourage aggressive political journalism are banished from the law books." Judge Marin Marcela delivered his verdict at a Zagreb Municipal Court, saying that the offending materials in Feral Tribune were obviously absurd and merely intended to pass judgment on political activity. The charges against Viktor Ivancic, the editor in chief of the satiric newspaper Feral Tribune, and Marinko Culic, a reporter with the weekly, stem from an April 29 article criticizing Tudjmanâs proposal to rebury the remains of World War II Fascists alongside their victims. This was the first application of a law passed by the Croatian Parliament on March 29 which effectively criminalizes any critical reporting or satirical commentary on the president, the prime minister, the parliament speaker or the chief magistrates of the supreme and constitutional courts. âSuch laws have no place in any country, and are especially to be condemned in a self-proclaimed democracy such as Croatia,â noted CPJ in a legal brief presented to the court. âNo journalist in any Western democracy is in prison as a result of a conviction of seditious libel.â Adjourned June 24, the criminal trial against the Feral Tribune journalists reopened yesterday. The defendants faced up to three years in jail had they been convicted. At least two more cases are pending against two other newspapers, Novi List and Nacional for charges under the same criminal code articles applied in the Feral Tribune case. CPJ has protested the charges against these newspapers and continues to call for the elimination of the articles from the Croatian Criminal Code.

Severe restrictions on the physical mobility and editorial freedom of local print journalists and broadcast media have compromised the internationally supervised election process, CPJ said. "By definition, no election can be considered truly free and fair unless the news media is able and willing to report fairly and openly to the entire electorate on the campaigns of all major contending parties, and all reporters, local and foreign, are free to cover the news without restrictions on their movements or justified fears of reprisals," CPJ said in a statement sent to the OSCE. "With few exceptions, throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, these standards have not been met," said CPJâs executive director, William A. Orme, Jr. CPJ is a private nonpartisan organization based in New York and devoted to the defense of press freedom around the world. A CPJ report on press freedom conditions in Bosnia was sent Thursday to Flavio Cotti, chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and also sent to NATO leaders, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and leading European foreign ministers. The statement denounces attacks on reporters attempting to cover opposition parties and obstruction of freedom of movement for journalists. Conditions are particularly harsh in Serb- and Croat-controlled areas. Reporters brave enough to drive between regions are intercepted and sometimes beaten. Correspondents are dismissed or censored for articles "harming the national interest." Independent radio stations have their signals overridden by state-run broadcast media or cut off entirely by well-timed "power outages." Television screens go blank during critical newscasts or candidates' debates. Air time allotted to the opposition is withheld. An internationally supported experiment in nonpartisan broadcasting, IN-TV, known as "Carl Bildt's TV" after the High Representative in Bosnia, has been blocked by the Bosnian government's refusal to grant a frequency. Bildt told CPJ chair Kati Marton that IN-TV will be begin broadcasting tomorrow but acknowledged that its impact will be largely limited to major cities.

Khadzhiev was shot in the head twice from two Russian armored personnel carriers while attempting to leave Grozny, capital of the secessionist republic of Chechnya, with his wife and young son. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Khadzhiev's death brings to 10 the number of journalists confirmed as killed in the line of duty in Chechnya since Russian troops invaded Grozny in December 1994. Local groups report higher totals of correspondents' deaths, although very little information is available about the circumstances of some of the killings. Reports on the incident are contradictory. ORT reported today that Khadzhiev, an ethnic Chechen, was slain by Chechen supporters of the late Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev. But NTV, Russia's only independent television, and RTR, the state-owned company, broadcast an interview with an unidentified passenger in Khadzhiev's car. He said that Russian armored vehicles opened fire at the unmarked Volga in which the family was travelling after Khadzhiev presented his ORT press credentials and was waved through the checkpoint. "Khadzhiev's death is yet another indication of the indifference of the Yeltsin government to the safety of journalists covering the war. Most disturbing--as in past attacks -- is the official denial of Russian military involvement, essentially condoning violence against the media," said Catherine Fitzpatrick, Eurasian Program Coordinator for CPJ. The Glasnost Defense Foundation in Moscow, a press freedom monitoring group, characterized Khadzhiev as a supporter of the Moscow-installed government of Doku Zavgayev in Chechnya. Though ORT is partially privately owned and supervised by a public board, it has tended to broadcast the Kremlin's viewpoint on the conflict in Chechnya. Interfax further reported that Zavgayev's bodyguard had identified Khadzhiev's body yesterday at a morgue in the town of Tolstoy-Yurt, nine miles north of Grozny. ORT said that the company had lost contact with Khadzhiev a week ago and appealed for any information on his whereabouts. The car was not marked as a press vehicle. Due to recent attacks on correspondents' cars marked "TV" or "press," some reporters believe that such markings put them in jeopardy. Last week, for example, Russian helicopters fired at clearly-marked CNN and WTN (World Television Network) vehicles at Grozny checkpointst. CPJ protested to the Russian government about these attacks. In June 1995, minutes after being waved through a military checkpoint, Natalya Alyakina, a free-lance reporter for the German press agency RUFA, was shot by an Interior Ministry soldier. In July of this year, Alyakina's killer was given only a suspended sentence for "involuntary homicide caused by misuse of a weapon." Four other journalists, including American photojournalist Andrew Shumack, are missing and presumed dead.

Guessab was the seventh journalist murdered in Algeria this year and the 59th victim of an ongoing campaign targeting the Algerian media for assassination. "This murderous campaign against journalists in Algeria is the most lethal documented by CPJ in the last ten years," said Avner Gidron, CPJ's research director. Guessab and his two brothers were driving yesterday in the Algiers suburb of Beau Fraisier, when unidentified men sprayed their car with gunfire. Guessab and one of his brothers were killed; the other brother was seriously wounded. Before joining "Radio Koran" in 1991, Guessab had worked for Radio Mitidja, an Algiers radio station. No group has claimed responsibility for the killing. But Islamic fundamentalist rebels are presumed responsible. The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has claimed responsibility for the bulk of journalists' slayings in Algeria. As many as 40,000 people have died in the Algerian conflict. But the 59 journalists killed since May 1993 have all been deliberately targeted, not killed in crossfire, in a concerted campaign to assassinate secular intellectuals and professionals. While the greatest threat to the journalistic profession comes from armed opponents of the government, the regime itself has done much to hinder the work of journalists. Last month Algerian editors were ordered by the government to submit all unofficial reports about violence to a censor. Newspapers are only allowed to carry stories about the security situation that have been supplied by the official Algerian Press Service. Since the army interrupted the electoral process in January 1992 to prevent a victory by the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in parliamentary elections, many independent journalists have been dragged to court, newspapers have been suspended, and the state's monopoly on printing has been used to intimidate publishers. Further information about the Algerian press is available in CPJ's annual report, Attacks on the Press in 1995. The report documents in detail the assassination of Algerian journalists by extremists and instances of government censorship of the press. Attached is a list, documented by CPJ, of the 59 journalists killed in Algeria since May 1993. 59 Journalists Murdered in Algeria Since 1993 Muslim fundamentalist rebels are believed to be responsible for a majority of these assassinations.

"The uprisings have occurred precisely because there is no other outlet in Indonesia for political criticism or independent analysis," said CPJ's Executive Director, William A. Orme, Jr. "Even factual reporting has been constrained by a series of media bans and jailings of journalists over the past two years," he added. Authorities have pressured Indonesian journalists into reporting favorably on a recent crackdown that ended a month-long standoff between the government and supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the former leader of the Indonesian Democratic party (PDI) who was ousted at the governmentâs behest in June. The measures cited by CPJ today include assaults on journalists, seizure of their materials, and warnings to newspaper editors. A blockade prevented journalists from covering the July 27 government seizure of the PDI headquarters in Jakarta, which had been occupied by Megawati supporters. According to local sources, soldiers seized video footage belonging to Associated Press Television and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In addition, two local journalists covering the crackdown sustained beatings. Cecek Sutriatna Sukmadipraja, a photographer for the Muslim magazine Ummat, was assaulted by soldiers for refusing to turn over his film. Despite having shown the soldiers his press credentials, Sukmadipraja was kicked in the groin and beaten with rattan, wood, and metal objects until he collapsed. A colleague took him to the intensive care unit of a local hospital, where he was given a blood transfusion and stitches for neck and back wounds. Kemal Jufri, a free-lance photographer who strings for Hong Kong-based Asiaweek, was hit on the head by a soldier while attempting to photograph the beating of a civilian. Jufri's camera was smashed and thrown into a sewage canal. Soldiers also attacked journalists covering a July 28 protest by PDI supporters in Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, located 800 km east of Jakarta. Subechi, a reporter for the daily Surabaya Post, and Adi Sutrawijono, a photographer for the daily newspaper Surya, were detained at the army district command. Although Subechi and Sutrawijono identified themselves as journalists, they were beaten and kicked for three hours along with ten protesters. They were released when two officers determined that they were in fact journalists, giving them Rp 50,000 (about US$20) as "uang damai," an Indonesian gesture of resolution. The local commander then added Rp 20,000 to the amount, which the journalists planned to return to the East Java military commander. Since June, senior Indonesian army officers have delivered explicit warnings to the local press about reporting on the conflict with Megawati loyalists. Lt. Gen. Syarwan Hamid, the head of the socio-political section of the military general staff, summoned Jakarta-based editors and bureau chiefs to a meeting on July 28, where he advised them to support the government's stance. According to local sources, warnings have been issued to two leading dailies--Kompas and Merdeka--for their critical coverage of the crackdown. The latest assaults on the press follow a broader crackdown that began with the June 1994 banning of three leading weeklies, which ended a four-year long policy of keterbukaan, or "openness." The banned publications included the country's largest circulation newsmagazine, Tempo, and two daring tabloids, DeTik and Editor. All three had received warnings from the Information Ministry in the months prior to their banning for aggressively reporting on a banking scandal, separatist wars in Aceh and East Timor, and the government's controversial purchase of 39 aging East German warships. The government subsequently targeted underground journals, which had proliferated in the wake of the press bans. Three journalists were jailed in 1995 for publishing unlicensed news magazines that criticized the government. Among them was Ahmad Taufik, the president of the Alliance of Independent Journalists, Indonesia's only independent journalists union. SUHARTO'S CRACKDOWN ON INDONESIA'S INDEPENDENT PRESS June 21, 1994: Indonesian Information Minister Harmoko bans the magazine Tempo and the tabloids DeTik and Editor, provoking international and domestic protests. August 7, 1994: Editors and reporters from the banned newsweeklies and other publications form the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI), Indonesia's only independent press association. AJI began documenting press freedom violations and publishing a magazine, Independen, that emerged as one of the few critical media voices in the country. March 16-17, 1995: The government closes AJI's offices and arrests several leading members, including AJI President Ahmad Taufik. The state-sponsored Indonesian Journalists Association (PWI) expels 13 AJI members from its ranks. (Membership in PWI is mandatory for all practicing journalists). June 16, 1995: AJI President Ahmad Taufik, AJI member Eko Maryadi, and office assistant Danang Kukuh Wardoyo are brought to trial on charges of violating Article 19 of the Indonesian Press Law, which prohibits the publication of an unlicensed newspaper or magazine, and Article 154 of the Indonesian Criminal Code, which bars the expression of "feelings of hostility, hatred or contempt toward the government." The charges stem from articles in AJI's monthly news magazine, Independen, that dealt with topics such as the succession to President Suharto and the personal wealth of the country's leaders. September 1, 1995: Taufik and Maryadi are each sentenced to 32 months in prison--terms that are later extended to three years. The union's office assistant, Danang Wardoyo, was sentenced on August 24 to 18 months in prison. September 11, 1995: Tri Agus Susanto Siswowihardjo, editor of the newsletter Kabar dari Pijar (âNews from Pijarâ), is convicted of insulting President Suharto, in violation of Articles 55(1) and 134 of the Indonesian Criminal Code, and sentenced to two years in prison. December 6, 1995: Taufik is awarded CPJ's International Press Freedom award at a ceremony in New York. More than 300 journalists and media executives in attendance sign appeals for the release of Taufik and his jailed colleagues. The appeals are hand-delivered by CPJ to the Indonesian Embassy. March 27, 1996: The Indonesian Supreme Court upholds the sentences of Taufik, Maryadi, Wardoyo, and Siswowihardjo. The journalists are subsequently transferred to Cipinang prison, where some of Indonesia's leading dissidents are jailed June 13, 1996: The Supreme Court upholds the banning of Tempo magazine, reversing two lower court decisions that ruled in favor of Tempo publisher Goenawan Mohamad.

I am writing to express our profound concern about the proposed 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act (Senate Bill 1718), which, as reported out of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, would leave intact present U.S. policy permitting the use of journalists and journalistsâ credentials by U.S. intelligence agencies. The members of the board of directors of CPJ strongly oppose the recruitment of journalists by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, and the fraudulent use of journalists' credentials by intelligence agents. Such practices can and will endanger the lives of U.S. correspondents and other journalists around the world, while cutting off vital sources of information essential to the assessment and formulation of U.S. foreign policy. Further, the covert use of journalists in official intelligence-gathering operations would erode a cornerstone of our democracy: the constitutionally guaranteed status of the free press as an institution wholly independent of government. This dispute may seem fundamentally philosophical, but I assure you that its consequences are quite real. I know. I have experienced first-hand the damage to the lives of journalists who have been unjustly charged with espionage. In 1955, when I was a young girl in Budapest, my parents, both Hungarian citizens, and Associated Press and United Press International wire-service correspondents respectively, were tried, convicted and imprisoned on false charges of being CIA agents. They were sentenced to 25 years in prison, but were released in 1956, shortly before the Hungarian Revolution. My parents were never recruited by the CIA-- in fact, to their knowledge, they had never even met a CIA agent. For almost two years, I did not even know where my parents were. My mother and father were arrested for simply doing their jobs as good reporters: writing the truth about Communist-controlled Hungary in the 1950s. Since then, I've always felt that the safeguarding of press freedom was my special mission. You will surely recall that Terry Anderson, another of our board members, and former Middle East bureau chief for the Associated Press, was held hostage for seven years by terrorists who accused him of working for the CIA. As Terry pointed out in his testimony at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, "We are talking about a real danger. This is not imaginary. Journalists are put in danger by the perception they are connected to intelligence agencies." More recently, to cite just one of scores of such cases, Pulitzer Prize-winners Roy Gutman of Newsday and John Burns of The New York Times had their lives threatened by Bosnian Serb militia leaders who asserted that Gutman and Burns were U.S. intelligence agents. Gutman sued in Yugoslavian courts to clear his name. The mere public suggestion that he was connected to U.S. intelligence services has made it impossible for him to work safely in his region of experience and expertise. For both Terry and Roy, it would have been immensely helpful if they had at least been able to accurately assert that the use of U.S. journalists by the CIA was prohibited by U.S. law. As Ted Koppel stated in his testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: "How often the CIA would actually use such cover is beside the point. The relevant question is how often it would be assumed, both at home and abroad, that American reporters are working with a second, secret agenda." This perception creates an extraordinarily dangerous working environment for journalists. This is especially true in countries which tend to be hostile to U.S. interests and U.S. journalists. As you know, virtually all serious journalists and news media organizations reject the proposition that our profession should be among the various "cover" options available to U.S. intelligence operatives. The World Press Freedom Committee, the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the Radio-Television News Directors Association and the North American National Broadcasters Association are among the organizations that have stated their opposition to this amendment. Such a policy would cast a cloud of suspicion over all American correspondents overseas, making it difficult, if not impossible, for them to do their jobs. The disturbing acknowledgment that the CIA has waived restrictions on the use of journalistic credentials in intelligence-gathering operations in the past, and wishes to retain the right to do so again, may have already led some foreign leaders to believe that the CIA and leading U.S. policy-makers are actively urging an end to official constraints on the use of journalists for espionage. In the House of Representatives, amendment 311 to the 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act (HR 3259) --passed on May 22 in a 417-6 vote-- took a positive first step by requiring a written presidential waiver for any authorization of the use of journalists in intelligence operations. However, even that amendment was not nearly strict enough. First, it applied only to journalists accredited by âa United States media organization,â in effect permitting CIA recruitment of unaffiliated freelance journalists and of all journalists working for news organizations headquartered outside the United States. (It should be noted that many international news agencies, such as Reuters, are critical providers of information to the U.S. public.) Second, it explicitly permitted the âvoluntary cooperation" of journalists with U.S. intelligence agencies. As involuntary âcooperationâ is presumably never an alternative in a free society, this caveat renders meaningless any prohibition on the use of journalists by intelligence agencies. Finally, it would leave under a pall of suspicion the many local journalists in repressive or conflict-ridden societies who cover human rights issues and national security affairs, and who are often accused of working for foreign intelligence services. In the past ten years, the Committee to Protect Journalists has documented 456 job-related deaths of journalists in 61 countries. Most of these deaths--more than 300--were deliberate political assassinations. Any policy initiative that would potentially add to this terrible toll should be vigorously opposed. CPJ's concern transcends the very real issue of the safety of individual journalists. The covert use of journalists as government spies, and the use of fraudulently obtained journalism credentials by government spies, would fatally compromise not just the credibility of the U.S. press, but the very integrity of our democracy. As Mort Zuckerman noted in his testimony to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, "To be the instrument of government, rather than a constitutional check on government, would undermine the good that independent journalism does for an open society." Journalists like my parents and Terry Anderson know from their own personal experience that a policy which permits the use of journalists in intelligence operations jeopardizes the safety of all journalists working in dangerous and repressive countries. We strongly urge that the 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act (Senate Bill 1718) be amended to include a complete and unalterable ban on the use of journalists as intelligence operatives, and on the fraudulent use of journalistic credentials and agency affiliation as cover for espionage activities.

The trial of Amari, Kheireddine Ameyar, La Tribuneâs publisher, and Baya Gacemi, the editor in chief, will begin on Monday, July 29. Amari was arrested at his home in Algiers on the morning of July 4. He is charged with desecrating a national emblem for drawing a cartoon, published on July 2, which depicted the Algerian flag in a satiric manner. If convicted of this offense, Amari could be sentenced to up to ten years in prison. On July 10, an examining magistrate denied Amariâs request for bail. He is being held at Serkadji prison. On July 3, La Tribuneâs offices were sealed and Ameyar and Gacemi were placed under judicial supervision and ordered to appear before the court twice a week. Publishers of independent newspapers in Algeria yesterday denounced the detention of Amari and the suspension of La Tribune and called for an end to press censorship. Algerian journalists, who for three years have been the targets of an assassination campaign by extremists, held a one-day strike on July 15 to demand Amariâs release and the reopening of La Tribune. CPJ and RSF consider the imprisonment of Amari and the suspension of La Tribune to be grave violations of press freedom. And we believe that government censorship, which forces the press to print government propaganda as news, jeopardizes journalists who face a constant threat of assassination by terrorists. CPJ and RSF join our Algerian colleagues in calling on the government of Algeria to demonstrate its commitment to freedom of the press by: Immediately releasing Chawki Amari Ending legal proceedings against Kheireddine Ameyar and Baya Gacemi Lifting the suspension of La Tribune and Ending government press censorship The information in this news alert may be freely copied and distributed provided that it is properly attributed to the Committee to Protect Journalists. | News Alerts Index | CPJ Website |WT01-B01-71IA024-000250-B025-71http://www.cpj.org:80/news/cot07.22.html 169.132.35.44 19970108112819 text/html 3923HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 11:28:04 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 3752Last-modified: Fri, 26 Jul 1996 21:24:28 GMT CPJ News Alert | News Alert Index | CPJ Website | For Immediate Release 22 July 1996 Contact: Kakuna Kerina (212) 465-1004, x103 CPJ Denounces Continued Imprisonment of Three Journalists in CÃ´te d'Ivoire NEW YORK--The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) today denounced the continued imprisonment of Ivoirien journalists Abou Drahamane SangarÃ©, Emmanuel KorÃ© and Freedom Neruda of the independent daily newspaper La Voie, and appealed to the Ivoirien government for their release. On 18 December 1995, La Voie published a satirical article suggesting that the presence of President Henri Konan BÃ©diÃ© brought bad luck to the Ivoirien soccer team when he attended the African Champions Cup final, which the local team lost. Director of publications SangarÃ© and reporter KorÃ© were arrested on 21 December 1995 and sentenced on 28 December 1995 to two years in prison for "offenses against the head of state." La Voie was also fined three million CFA francs (US$ 6,000) and banned for three months. La Voie deputy-editor Neruda was arrested on 2 January 1996 and sentenced to a two-year prison term on 11 January 1996. On 12 June 1996, an appeals court in CÃ´te d'Ivoire confirmed the two-year jail sentences imposed on the three journalists. They are now appealing to the supreme court. "President Bedie's attack on the La Voie journalists was his first official act towards the private press, just months after being elected to office, and firmly establishing his government's continued intolerance for press freedom," says Kakuna Kerina, Program Coordinator for Africa. "During his campaign, Bedie routinely imprisoned journalists and banned private newspapers, thus effectively outlawing free expression in Cote d'Ivoire." Since President BÃ©diÃ© took office in December 1993, there has been an increase in prosecutions against independent journalists which have resulted in sentences of up to three years imprisonment. Physical attacks on Ivoirien journalists have also occurred: in June 1995, Mr. SangarÃ© was savagely beaten by four policeman at the order of Security Minister General Ouassenan Kone for an article he wrote in the satirical weekly, Bol Kotch, about the minister's treatment of student unrest in the country. The beating took place in Minister Kone's office, and in his presence. CPJ contends that the sentences handed down against SangarÃ©, KorÃ© and Neruda are unjustified and excessive. Having previously protested these convictions to President BÃ©diÃ© on numerous occasions, CPJ reiterates its calls for the reversal of the journalists' convictions, and their immediate, unconditional release.

In June and July of 1995, Christine Anyanwu, editor-in-chief of the now defunct weekly The Sunday Magazine, Weekend Classique editor Ben Charles Obi, Tell magazine assistant editor George Mbah, and TheNEWS editor-in-chief Kunle Ajibade, were among 42 people arrested and charged with treason for their coverage of a suspected coup plot. They were secretly tried by a Special Military Tribunal which did not adhere to Nigerian standard legal procedures, denied the right to appeal, and initially sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. After the ensuing international outcry, the journalists' sentences were commuted to 15 years imprisonment. "It was this particular act that first suggested the lengths to which General Abacha would go to muzzle the traditionally vibrant independent press in Nigeria," says Kakuna Kerina, Program Coordinator for sub-Sahara Africa. "It is a testament to the fact that, in General Abacha's estimation, the survival of his military dictatorship depends on strategically silencing the press, one of Nigeria's most enduring institutions opposed to military rule." The four journalists continue to be held in deplorable prison conditions. Anyanwu, who is hypertensive and suffers frequent bouts of malaria, Mbah, who regularly endures epileptic seizures and Ajibade, who has a serious heart condition, are routinely denied medical attention, family visitation and legal counsel. To focus continuous worldwide attention to General Abacha's relentless assault on the independent media, CPJ is extending its campaign, "Nigeria: The Press Under Siege." To date, the campaign has mobilized CPJ membership, successfully prompted international media coverage, and initiated joint actions with other international press freedom and human rights organizations, while working with Lagos-based journalists, to demand that General Abacha immediately and unconditionally release journalists Anyanwu, Obi, Mbah and Ajibade. CPJ has already forwarded to General Abacha more than 100 signed letters urging the release of the four, as well as that of Tell editor-in-chief Nosa Igiebor (who was released on 24 June) and press freedom/human rights attorneys Chief Gani Fawehinmi and Femi Falana. In recognition of Igiebor's release after six months of detention without charge, CPJ once again calls on General Abacha to uphold his proclamations of a commitment to true democratic principles by releasing the aforementioned journalists and media advocates. "If General Abacha's plans for a transition to democracy are to succeed," asserts Kerina, "he must allow the immediate restoration of an independent press which can work freely without fear." His Excellency General Sani Abacha Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces State House Abuja, NIGERIA Dear General Abacha: I write to express my deepest concern for The Sunday Magazine editor-in-chief Christine Anyanwu, Weekend Classique editor Ben Charles Obi, Tell magazine assistant editor George Mbah and TheNEWS editor-in-chief Kunle Ajibade, who have endured deplorable prison conditions since July 1995, when they were convicted of treason for their converage of an alleged coup plot. They were secretly tried by a Special Military Tribunal-which in no way conformed to standard legal procedures, denied the right to appeal, and initially sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, then 15 years. The persecution of the above-named editors, because of their work as journalists, unquestionably violates Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that states, "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas." Nigeria is a signatory to this declaration. I am heartened by the June 24 release of Tell editor-in-chief Nosa Igiebor. However, his attorney, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, as well as media and human rights attorney Femi Falana, remain in detention since February 1996 without charge. I urge you to intervene on the side of press freedom and immediately and unconditionally release editors Anyanwu, Obi, Mbah and Ajibade, and media advocates Fawehinmi and Falana. Finally, I respectfully call on you to uphold your public proclamations of a transition to democracy by ensuring an environment in which journalists may work freely and safely. I welcome your comments and reply.

And CPJ reiterated its call on the government to rescind its imposition of prior censorship on all independent reporting on security matters. Chawki Amari, a cartoonist with the independent, French-language daily La Tribune, was arrested at his home in Algiers on the morning of July 4. He is charged with desecrating a national emblem for drawing a cartoon, published on July 1, which depicted the Algerian flag in a satiric manner. If convicted of this offense, Amari could be sentenced to up to ten years in prison. On July 10, an examining magistrate denied Amari's request for bail. He is being held at Serkadji prison On July 3, La Tribune's offices were sealed and Kheireddine Ameyar, its publisher, and Baya Gacemi, the editor in chief, were placed under judicial supervision and ordered to appear before the court twice a week. Algerian editors and journalists have called a newspaper strike for Monday, July 15, to demand Amari's release and the reopening of La Tribune. "We support our Algerian colleagues' demands," said William A. Orme, Jr., CPJ's executive director. "The Algerian government's censorship policies and the continuing terrorist campaign against journalists put the press in an untenable position. Journalists who face a constant threat of assassination by terrorists are put even more at risk by being forced to print government propaganda as news." Since May 1993, 59 journalists have been murdered in Algeria. This is the most lethal assassination campaign against the press documented by CPJ in the last ten years. The shadowy Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has claimed responsibility for the bulk of journalists' slayings in Algeria. Since the army interrupted the electoral process in January 1992 to prevent a victory by the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in parliamentary election, dozens of independent journalists have been dragged to court, newspapers have been suspended, and the state's monopoly on printing has been used to intimidate publishers.

The journalists, who were released unharmed Monday evening, had been held as hostages by the militia to secure a meeting with the editors of Kashmir's leading newspapers. "Militias sponsored by the Indian government have abducted journalists on three occasions over the past year, and have been implicated in at least one assassination attempt," said Vikram Parekh, CPJ's Program Coordinator for Asia, who visited the strife-torn state last year. "If India's new leaders are at all committed to press freedom, they must immediately act to disarm these militias," he added. The 19 journalists were traveling together from Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir, to a press conference that had been called by the Muslim Mujahideen, one of several Indian-backed militias in the region. They were intercepted at Anantnag, a town 50 km (35 miles) south of Srinagar, by gunmen of another Indian-backed militia, the Jammu and Kashmir Ikhwan, and taken to the nearby headquarters of Ikhwan commander Hilal Haider. Haider segregated six journalists who worked for the Kashmiri press: reporters Gulzar Ahmed and Abdul Qayoom of the Urdu daily Uqab, Masood Ahmed of the Urdu daily Wadi-ki-Awaz, Shujaat Bukhari of the English-language daily Kashmir Times, Zahoor Shair of the Urdu daily Al-Safa, and photographer Maqbool Sahil of the Urdu weekly Chattan. He said all six would be killed unless the editors of Srinagar's eight major daily newspapers appeared before him by noon the following day. The eight editors had disregarded a "ban" that Haider had ordered on their newspapers the previous week for having given the Ikhwan inadequate coverage. The editors, who were informed of the threat by phone, said they would not heed the summons. Haider told the other 13 journalistsï¿½mostly correspondents for the Indian and international pressï¿½that they were free to leave. The thirteen, however, insisted on staying until their colleagues were released as well. Seven-and-a-half hours after the abduction, and following protests to Indian authorities by journalists in Srinagar, an elite commando unit known as the Rashtriya Rifles intervened and secured the release of all 19 journalists. The kidnapping occurred the same day that Indian Home Minister Indrajit Gupta announced that the government would hold long-deferred state assembly elections either this September or October. The elections had been called off last fall by the Indian Election Commission, on the grounds that conditions in the state were unsuited to free and fair polling. Along with several other counter-insurgency militias, the Jammu and Kashmir Ikhwan had fielded candidates in the controversial federal parliamentary elections held in Kashmir last May. "It is difficult to see how the Indian government plans to hold free and fair assembly elections when the contestants are expected to include members of armed groups that routinely harass and intimidate the press," Parekh said. Earlier attacks on the Kashmiri press are documented in detail in CPJ's 1995 report, On a Razor's Edge: Local Journalists Targeted by Warring Parties in Kashmir. Based in New York, CPJ is a non-profit, non-partisan organization of journalists dedicated to upholding press freedom worldwide.

Bilello, who was arrested and deported from Cuba last week following several days of meetings with independent journalists there, testified before a joint session of the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere and the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. "Cuba remains the one country in the Western Hemisphere where there is no press freedom," said Bilello. "There is, however, a small but growing group of independent journalists in Cuba who are trying to work outside the confines of state media. "The men and women in Cuba who are struggling to establish an independent press face tremendous obstacles," said Bilello. "The problems of a lack of basic supplies, such as pens, notebooks, typewriters, and the need for state permission to own and operate computers and fax machines, are dwarfed by Fidel Castro's campaign of harassment and intimidation against the fledgling free press." According to CPJ's research, the Castro campaign against the independent press has escalated in recent months. Since February, CPJ has documented at least a dozen cases of press freedom violations including the forced exile of several independent journalists, and the arrest and interrogation of many others. "These journalists are treated like political agitators even though many of them until recently were employed by Cuban state media outlets," said Bilello. "Their only aim is to carve out a livelihood that is independent of state-controlled media yet a comfortable distance from organized factions at home and abroad." According to Bilello, her interrogation and deportation typifies the kind of police-state intimidation tactics to which independent Cuban journalists and their families are subjected. Arrested in her hotel room in Havana at 10:30 p.m., Wednesday, June 19, by Cuban security forces, Bilello was brought for interrogation to Interior Ministry offices. She was questioned for three hours about her activities and contacts in Havana. Cuban police interrogators seized her notebooks, personal papers, and other private documents, along with rolls of exposed film and other possessions. At 2:00 a.m. she was informed that she was being "expelled" for her support of "fomenting rebellion." She was placed aboard a 7:00 a.m. flight to Cancun, Mexico. At no time was she physically mistreated or threatened, Ms. Bilello reported. "Clearly Fidel Castro is the greatest obstacle to a free press in Cuba" said Bilello. "But the effect of certain provisions of current U.S. policy towards Cuba inadvertently assists Castro's campaign to silence the island's fledgling independent press." Bilello cited aspects of three specific U.S. policies or programs that undermine the efforts of Cuba's independent journalists and severely restrict the ability of U.S. news organizations to operate effectively in Cuba. Editorial Content of Radio Marti: Because no nongovernmental news outlets are permitted within the island, independent journalists must work exclusively for clients outside the country. Many of these reporters work as unpaid stringers for the U.S.-funded Radio Marti. In Cuba, however, association with Radio Marti is considered a crime against the state. Increasingly, according to many of the journalists Bilello met with, Radio Marti primary interest are news events that focus almost exclusively on dissident activity and repression by the Castro regime. The station often refuses to run material that does not reflect its hardline political position, say Cuba's independent journalists. Cuba's independent journalists and CPJ are concerned that Radio and TV Marti's imminent move from Washington, D.C. to Florida, the home of many anti-Castro Cuban emigre organizaitons, will further weaken the news agency's editorial objectivity. U.S. Aid to Independent Journalists: Section 109 of The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 authorizes the U.S. government to provide assistance to individuals and organizations supporting democratization in Cuba. Those on the island who receive U.S. government funds are labeled dissidents and clients of U.S. interests. CPJ is concerned that this provision will be broadly interpreted to include Cuba's independent journalists. Financial aid from the U.S. will endanger their safety, discredit their effort to establish an independent press, and vindicate Castro's accusations that independent journalists are political agitators for U.S. interests. Preconditions to Establish and Exchange News Bureaus: Section 114 of The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act contains several preconditions that must be met before U.S news organizations can set up bureaus in Havana and Cuban news agencies can set up bureaus in the United States. Among the preconditions to be met: Cuba allows distribution throughout the island of all news and broadcast stories by U.S. news organizations with Cuban bureaus; Cuba allows Radio and TV Marti to open an office on the island; U.S. Treasury officials are able to ensure that only accredited journalists regularly employed with a news-gathering organization can travel to Cuba. The unintentional effect of these conditions will be to prohibit the operation of U.S news bureaus in Cuba, to the detriment of the struggling independent journalists there and the American public, which will continue to learn next to nothing about Cuba. "Even if Castro were to unilaterally allow U.S. news bureaus to set up shop in Havana, there would still be U.S. government barriers facing news organizations," said Bilello. "What the independent journalists in Cuba tell me they need is a ï¿½marketplace of opportunity' where they can learn from and work with U.S. reporters and gain the economic independence necessary to establish their credibility in the eyes of their countrymen," Bilello said. The opening of U.S. news bureaus in Cuba would bring about a radical improvement for the island's independent journalists, said Bilello. The creation of job opportunities -- for stringers, reporters, editors, cameramen, soundmen, and other newsroom positions -- would give Cuba's independent journalists significant exposure to the workings of free and independent news organizations, and train them to operate as effective and objective journalists. Employment by politically independent U.S. news organizations would also provide Cuba's struggling independent journalists with economic independence. This economic freedom is essential if Cuba's independent journalists are to establish their credibility and political independence in the eyes of Cuba's citizenry. Bilello urged the members of the Subcommittee to reevaluate those provisions of U.S. policy that threaten the struggling independent press in Cuba. CPJ's sole mandate is the promotion of press freedom: our job is to document, protest and publicize physical and legal attacks on journalists and other violations of press freedom. CPJ has no position on the broad questions of U.S. policy towards Cuba except to the extent that those policies have an impact on the ability of independent reporters, editors, and broadcasters to do their jobs without official interference or fear of reprisal.

"We would like to express our sense of profound sadness and outrage at the death of our friend and colleague Veronica Guerin," said CPJ's Executive Director William A. Orme, Jr. "We extend our deepest sympathies to her family, and call on the Irish government to take immediate action to bring Veronica's murderers to justice." In New York last December, Guerin, who was the crime reporter for the Sunday Independent, received CPJ's International Press Freedom Award for her courage in reporting on Ireland's criminal underworld despite numerous death threats and assassination attempts against her. After one such attack--a masked intruder broke into her home in January 1995 and shot her a day after the Independent ran her profile of the suspected mastermind behind the largest robbery in Ireland's history--Guerin wrote of the experience and vowed to carry on her work. "In deciding to continue ... I am simply doing my job," she said. "I am letting the public know exactly how this society operates." "Veronica Guerin's assassination is a chilling reminder that threats to a free press exist even in nations that are not struggling with political tyranny or civil conflict," Orme said. "Veronica's courage and persistence should serve to remind us all of the profound respect owed journalists around the world who risk their lives to report the truth."

Orme, Jr. Phone: (212) 465-8538 Cuban Officials Interrogate and Deport CPJ Staff Expert NEW YORK--Cuban Interior Ministry officials detained, interrogated, and deported from Cuba today a visiting staff expert from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), accusing the U.S.-based press freedom organization of âfomenting rebellionâ through its support for Cubaâs independent journalists. Suzanne Bilello, CPJâs program coordinator for the Americas, was arrested in her hotel room in Havana at 10:30 p.m. Wednesday by two plainclothes Interior Ministry officials and a uniformed Immigration officer. She was brought for interrogation to Interior Ministry offices in the Miramar district, where she was questioned for three hours about her activities and contacts in Havana. Cuban police interrogators seized all of Bilelloâs notebooks, personal papers, and other private documents, along with rolls of exposed film and other possessions. At 2:00 a.m. she was informed that she was being âexpelledâ for her support of âfomenting rebellion.â She was placed aboard a 7:00 a.m. flight to Cancun, Mexico, where she arrived this morning. At no time was she physically mistreated or threatened, Ms. Bilello reported. âWe strongly protest the unjustified seizure of Ms. Bilelloâs personal papers and other belongings as an unconscionable invasion of privacy, and as a violation of press freedom,â said CPJ Executive Director William A. Orme, Jr. Bilello, a journalist with long experience in Latin America, had traveled to Cuba from Mexico on June 16 on a touristsâ visa obtained from the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. During her four-day stay she met with reporters and editors of five newly established independent Cuban news agencies. The official harassment and arbitrary detention of independent journalists has prompted repeated CPJ protests in recent months. Founded by journalists who were formerly employed by Cuban state media outlets, the independent news agencies send reports about local economic, social, and political issues to clients abroad. As a gesture of collegial support, Bilello provided the independent journalists with modest gifts from CPJ of pens, notebooks, and medicines that are scarce or prohibitively expensive in Cuba. The importation of the gifts had been approved by Cuban Customs officials. She also gave the independent news agencies small advance payments from private sources to help underwrite their news-gathering costs in the coming months. The Interior Ministry officials questioned Bilello extensively about these gifts and payments, alleging that they constituted support for ârebellionâ and âcounterrevolutionary activities.â âAs her Cuban interrogators acknowledged, Suzanne Bilello broke no Cuban laws,â said Orme. âHer visit was motivated by a desire to help and to meet personally many of the independent Cuban journalists whom CPJ has long supported. âThese police-state intimidation tactics typify the kind of harassment to which independent-minded local journalists are routinely subjected, but which few foreigners ever experience.â CPJ is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization founded in 1981 to monitor abuses of the press and to promote press freedom throughout the world.

The trial is now scheduled to resume on Sept. 25, the judge announced. The defendants face up to three years in jail if convicted. After reading the indictment and hearing the opening defense statements, the judge adjourned the trial until September in order, he said, to call new witnesses. CPJ board member James C. Goodale, an attorney and expert on press freedom issues, presented the judge with a legal brief, prepared at the request of defense counsel. The CPJ brief condemned the prosecution as an example of seditious libel, a legal concept that the Committee characterized as "fundamentally antithetical to the values of a democratic society." The judge did not agree to enter the brief into the record, stating that the Croatian legal system had no procedures for filing such documents. But he did agree to meet with Goodale at a future date to hear CPJ's concerns. After the hearing, Goodale and other representatives from press freedom groups and local NGOs held a public meeting and press conference where they denounced the statutes used to prosecute the journalists, citing international practice regarding criminal libel. The charges against Viktor Ivancic, the editor in chief of the satiric newspaper Feral Tribune, and Marinko Culic, a reporter with the weekly, stem from an April 29 article criticizing the president's proposal to rebury the remains of World War II Fascists alongside their victims. This is the first application of a law passed by the Croatian Parliament on March 29 which effectively criminalizes any critical reporting or satirical commentary on the president, the prime minister, the parliament speaker or the chief magistrates of the supreme and constitutional courts. The Media in Croatia A Chronology of Attacks Documented and Protested by CPJ March 22, 1995: Responding to an appeal on behalf of the independent weekly newspaper Feral Tribune, the Croatian Constitutional Court finally withdraws a 50 percent sales tax on the paper. The tax, usually levied only on pornographic publications, had been in effect since July 1, 1994. Aug. 11, 1995: The Croatian government takes away the frequency of Radio LAE, known for its opposition to the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), and turns it over to a government company, FFI Commerce. FFI Commerce is said to have connections with HDZ and President Tudjman. March 29, 1996: The Croatian Parliament passes into law two amendments to the Penal Code that threaten press freedom. One, a seditious libel law, authorizes the public prosecutor to start legal proceedings against anyone who has offended or slandered the president, the parliament speaker, the prime minister or the presidents of the supreme and constitutional courts. Earlier legislation required the public figures themselves to file charges against individuals for slander or offense. Under the new law, the government leaders need only consent to charges brought by the public prosecutor. The second law makes it a criminal act to divulge classified information "vital to state interests," though such state secrets are left largely undefined. *Note: President Tudjman did not have to approve the laws before they took effect, as previously reported. The amendments only needed to be signed into law by the president. This "act of promulgation" is only a formality, not comparable to a veto, and the law can only be abolished by an act of parliament. April 7, 1996: The Croatian government imposes a US$2.5 million fine on the independent daily Novi List for its alleged use of printing equipment from Italy, which the government claims is reserved for Italian-language newspapers in Croatia. On May 10, the Croatian Minister of Finance decides to suspend the fine, although by law Novi List must first pay the penalty and then follow with an appeal. Novi List's editor in chief, however, is optimistic that the fine against the newspaper will be suspended indefinitely. April 12, 1996: The two new amendments to the Penal Code, which were passed by parliament on March 29 and signed by the president, are published in the official government newspaper. As per Croatia's procedures, the laws take effect eight days after publication. April 20, 1996: The two new amendments to the Penal Code passed by Parliament on March 29, 1996, go into effect. April 25, 1996: Members of the Croatian financial police enter the offices of the weekly independent newspaper Panorama and order all staff to leave within 15 minutes. The police proceed to lock all the offices and charge the newspaper with violating "ecological" standards. The offices are reopened on May 10 after CPJ and others protest the shut-down. April 29, 1996: The Feral Tribune publishes an article by Marinko Culic entitled "Bones in the Mixer." The article is critical of President Tudjman's recommendation to turn a World War II concentration camp in Jasenovac, where thousands of Serbs were killed by Croatian Fascists, into a memorial that would also honor Croats killed under Communist rule in the former Yugoslavia as well as those who died during the 1991 Croatian war against the Serbs. The cover of the Tribune issue in which the article appears displays a cartoon of a skeleton wearing a presidential sash that reads: "We're all going to Jasenovac." May 3, 1996: Viktor Ivancic, editor in chief of Feral Tribune, is taken to police offices and informed that the general prosecutor of Croatia has brought criminal charges against him and Feral Tribune reporter Marinko Culic for "rudely and falsely slandering" the president under the new "seditious libel" amendment to the Penal Code approved March 29 by the Croatian Parliament. The charges stem from the April 29 Feral Tribune article described above. The journalists face up to three years' imprisonment if convicted. May 23, 1996: Nevenko Kosutic, the daughter of President Tudjman, files a civil libel suit against Feral Tribune demanding 3.5 million kuna (US$635,000) in damages. Ms. Kosutic claims that the Feral Tribune slandered her by publishing allegations that she set up a prosperous business using government connections. Ms. Kosutic's lawyer later asks the court to order the provisional withdrawal of the money from Feral Tribune's bank account pending a verdict in the suit. May 30, 1996: Leaders of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) announce that the party intends to sue the weekly independent newspaper Globus for a May 21 article that contends that the ruling party has drafted a list of opposition politicians whom they plan to denounce as public enemies. No legal action has yet been taken. June 14, 1996: The first session of the trial of Feral Tribune editor Viktor Ivancic and reporter Marinko Culic on charges of seditious libel opens in Zagreb.

The verdict, issued yesterday, reversed earlier decisions by lower courts that found the ban to be arbitrary and unlawful. "By overturning the lower court verdict, the Supreme Court has extinguished one of the few rays of hope for press freedom in Indonesia," said Vikram Parekh, CPJ's Program Coordinator for Asia. Speaking for the court, Chief Justice Soerdjono said that Indonesian Information Minister Harmoko acted lawfully in banning Tempo because he had already issued six warnings to the magazine for its political coverage. Soerdjono also affirmed that the Information Minister was empowered to revoke publishing licenses, and had no obligation to abide by an Indonesian Press Council recommendation that Tempo be allowed to continue publishing. Tempo was ordered closed on June 21, 1994 because its content was deemed incompatible with a "healthy and responsible press," for allegedly failing to act in conformity with national press guidelines, and for disregarding prior warnings from the government. The magazine had received warnings earlier that year for covering labor unrest, a corruption scandal involving a Bapindo bank official, salary disparities within the military, and a report that accused the government of underestimating the cost of repairing 39 aging East German navy vessels that it had purchased from the reunified German state. Tempo publisher Goenawan Mohamad subsequently mounted a legal challenge to the ban. To the surprise of many observers, the trial court ruled in his favor on May 3, 1995, as did the Administrative High Court on November 3, 1995. The decision was brought to the Supreme Court on appeal by Harmoko. "During CPJ's meeting last January with Indonesian Embassy staff in Washington, they pointed to the lower court ruling as evidence that Indonesia was governed by the rule of law," Parekh said. "But yesterday's verdict seems politically motivated, and calls into question the independence of the Indonesian judiciary." Yesterday's ruling is the second of two major setbacks for press freedom by the country's Supreme Court. On March 27, 1996, the court upheld the prison sentences of three press freedom activists who had been jailed a year earlier for publishing an unlicensed magazine, and exposing the government to "hostility, hatred, and contempt." All three were members of the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI), an officially unrecognized journalists' union that was formed in response to the banning of Tempo and two other popular news weeklies. CPJ honored one of the jailed journalists, Ahmad Taufik, with its International Press Freedom Award in December 1995. Based in New York, CPJ is a non-profit, non-partisan organization of journalists dedicated to defending press freedom worldwide.

Thatâs the central conclusion of a briefing paper on press freedom in Russia issued today by the Committee to Protect Journalists, a U.S.-based press freedom advocacy organization. âUnder either a Zyuganov administration or a re-elected Yeltsin government, journalists in Russia will have to battle to preserve the fragile press freedoms they have gained over the course of the decade,â said William A. Orme, Jr., CPJâs executive director. âThe press has suffered its most violent attacks in decades during Yeltsinâs years in office. Of the 13 assassinations of Russian journalists that CPJ has documented since 1994, the Yeltsin government has not seriously investigated, much less prosecuted, a single case.â CPJâs 16-page report documents many of these murders as well as the beatings, threats, and legal harassment Russian journalists have endured during Yeltsinâs rule. CPJ reports that journalists at greatest risk for attack in Russia today are those covering the war in Chechnya, investigating organized crime, reporting on corruption in the military or criticizing government officials. Among the reportâs grimmest findings: At least eight journalists have been murdered in mafia-style contract killings in Moscow and the provinces. At least five journalists have been assassinated while covering the war in Chechnya, three of them this year alone. Four journalists reporting from Chechnya are missing and presumed dead. Several journalists have suffered attempts on their lives or received anonymous death threats. CPJâs briefing paper also addresses the efforts by the Yeltsin campaign to influence media coverage, including applying outright pressure on editors in the provinces, and offers background on the economic hardships of the Russian media that foster their continued dependence on the government. The Committee to Protect Journalists documents and responds to press freedom abuses around the world. From its headquarters in New York, CPJ works to get detained journalists out of jail, directs international campaigns of protest against repressive governments and provides practical safety information to reporters assigned to dangerous areas. CPJ is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization financed wholly by donations from individuals, private foundations and news organizations.

All are responsible for brutal campaigns against journalists and press freedom, as documented by CPJ in its ongoing monitoring of press freedom violations worldwide. The Enemies of the Press list is released annually on May 3, World Press Freedom Day. Heading the list for the second straight year is Abu Abdul Rahman Amin, the head of Algeria's rebel Armed Islamic Group, who claims responsibility for many of the 58 assassinations of journalists in Algeria since 1993. "Each of these 10 men is actively committed to the eradication of the independent press, " said William A. Orme, Jr., executive director of CPJ. "Scores of working journalists were killed, imprisoned, or driven into exile as a result of their direct or covert actions." The Enemies of the Press 1.Abu Abdul Rahman Amin, leader of the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria. His insurgent faction has claimed responsibility for many of the 58 assassinations of journalists in Algeria over the past three years. Rahman Amin has threatened all secular journalists with death. "Those who fight with the pen," he proclaimed, "shall die by the sword." 2.Chinaâs leader Deng Xiaoping. China's leader, Deng Xiaoping. China's nonagenarian strongman may no longer run his government on a daily basis, but his ruling philosophy--"socialism with Chinese characteristics"--continues to serve as a pretext for the complete suppression of independent reporting. When it takes over Hong Kong in June 1997, Deng's regime is expected to muzzle one of the most vibrant and pluralistic news centers in all of Asia. As the man who ordered the June 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square, which included the imprisonment of China's leading journalists, Deng is directly responsible for restricting the press freedom rights of more than one-fifth of the world's population. 3.Nigeria's President Sani Abacha persecutes independent journalists by ordering or encouraging editorial office bombings, seizures of periodicals and equipment, and the arbitrary detention of journalists, often without charges. One result is a steady stream into exile of the profession's best and brightest. For those who stay, the risks are great: in 1995 four journalists were sentenced by a secret military tribunal to 15 years in prison for reporting on dissident army officers accused of plotting the overthrow the regime. 3.Turkeyâs Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz runs a government that at any given moment holds more journalists in jail than any other in the world. Yilmaz has done nothing to improve on his predecessor Tansu Ciller's dismal press freedom record. At the end of 1995, CPJ documented 51 cases of Turkish journalists who were then in jail simply for exercising their profession. Most were imprisoned for reporting that was allegedly sympathetic to the Kurdish cause. Despite international criticism, Yilmaz has so far chosen to retain and enforce the notorious Articles 7 and 8 of the Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of the Penal Code, which effectively criminalize independent news reporting about separatist movements, army counterinsurgency tactics, Islamic fundamentalism, and other topics central to the country's political life. 5.Tajikistanâs President Emomali Rakhmonov. President Rakhmonov has overseen the systematic elimination of independent Tajik news media. The paramilitary forces he commanded during the recent civil war were responsible for many of the 29 death-squad killings of journalists since 1992. All independent local news organizations have been forced to close, and hundreds of Tajik journalists are in hiding or in exile. The repressive Rakhmanov regime is wholly dependent on Russian military and economic aid. 6.Indonesiaâs President Suharto. President Suharto has orchestrated a two-year-long crackdown on the country's independent press. After banning three leading newsweeklies in June 1994, his regime brutally suppressed demonstrations by journalists and others against the closures. Last September, the leader of the only independent journalists union, Ahmad Taufik, and his colleague Eko Maryadi were sentenced to three years in prison for publishing an unlicensed magazine and supposedly subjecting the government to "hostility, hatred, and contempt." At least 80 members of Taufik's union, the Alliance of Independent Journalists, have been fired from their jobs due to government pressure. 7.Cubaâs President Fidel Castro. Cuba remains the only country in the Americas without any independent publications or broadcasters. Reporters not employed by state media are not allowed to own or operate a computer or a fax machine. Independent local journalists who attempt to send news dispatches to clients abroad face such retaliatory measures as internal travel bans, overnight detentions , the harassment of friends and relatives, seizures of equipment, and threats of prolonged imprisonment. 8.Saudi Arabiaâs King Fahd bin Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. King Fahd uses his enormous financial and diplomatic clout to silence dissenting voices not just in Ryadh but throughout the Arab world. The Saudi press, though privately owned, is one of the most restricted in the world. King Fahd must approve the hiring of editors; he also can (and does) dismiss them at will. More disturbing still, the Saudi royal family has acquired the most important international Arab periodicals and broadcast outlets and uses its influence to suppress all criticism--indeed, all serious examination--of its business interests and diplomatic entanglements. 9.Kenyaâs President Daniel arap Moi.President Moi has declared war on the independent press and widened his net to include foreign correspondents. Critical coverage of Moi has been decreed a criminal offense, while newspapers and printers have been arbitrarily closed for publishing opposing viewpoints. Journalists covering the trial of human rights activist Koigi wa Wamwere were physically attacked by pro-government thugs. The government last year introduced a restrictive new press law, including government-mandated "codes of conduct" for journalists, only to withdraw the initiative in the face of fierce international condemnation. 10.Slovakiaâs Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. In his latest assault on press freedom, the thin-skinned prime minister pushed through parliament an amendment to the Criminal Code that would imprison journalists and others found guilty of "spreading false information abroad." Since Meciar dismissed all but one of the 18 members of the state radio and television supervising councils in November 1994, the Slovakian broadcasters have become mouthpieces and apologists for the prime minister's increasingly autocratic rule. This backslide into repression bodes ill not only for Slovakia but for all of post-communist Central Europe.

Martonâs trip begins today in Zagreb and will continue on to Sarajevo and Belgrade. She is scheduled to meet with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and acting Bosnian President Ejup Ganic. Marton will also hold fact-finding sessions with local and foreign journalists based in the three countries. âCPJ has two goals for this mission,â said Ms. Marton. âFirst, we want to gather firsthand information about the problems faced by independent reporters and news outlets in the Balkans. Second, we want to convey our serious concerns about press freedom to the regionâs leaders.â Marton will be presenting her findings to leaders of international press freedom groups gathered at UNESCO headquarters in Paris for the May 3 commemoration of World Press Freedom Day. Upon her return to the United States, she will brief the U.S. media at a press conference in Washington, D.C. Since 1991, CPJ has documented 25 deaths of working reporters in Croatia and 20 deaths in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most appear to have been deliberate assassinations. The Balkans war has been the single most dangerous assignment for foreign correspondents since Vietnam. Most reporters killed, however, have been local journalists. Independent news outlets in Zagreb, Sarajevo and Belgrade continue to face severe political pressures, legal obstacles and economic constraints. Political pressures are expected to intensify in the period leading up to the September parliamentary elections in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro. Background information on press freedom violations in the Balkans may be found in CPJâs annual report Attacks on the Press in 1995 (CPJ, March 1996). Marton, a Hungarian-born author and journalist, has chaired CPJâs board of directors since 1994. She is the host of âAmerica and the World,â a weekly international affairs program on National Public Radio. From 1977 to 1979, Marton covered Central Europe as Bonn bureau chief for ABC News. Marton has also reported for many other leading news organizations, including PBS, NPR, The Times of London, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and Newsweek. She has published four books, including an award-winning account of the 1948 murder in Greece of CBS correspondent George Polk.

The moves prompted Srinagar editors Friday to suspend publication of their newspapers indefinitely. "Elections in Kashmir will only be free and fair if the local press is free to report on them," said Vikram Parekh, CPJ's program coordinator for Asia, who visited Kashmir last year. "The government's introduction of a press gag and the threats issued by the leading separatist group make such an outcome impossible," he added. In a letter dated April 17, Kashmir's federally-appointed state government threatened to press criminal charges against local newspaper editors who published statements by separatist leaders, material deemed "prejudicial to the unity and integrity of the State and the country," or articles that "directly or indirectly express lack of faith" in the state and federal constitutions. The directive also barred "inflammatory matter likely to foment ... regional tension" and, in a vaguely-worded provision, appeared to ban reports that would deter government employees from participating in the election process. Most of Kashmir's leading newspapers allocate as much as a quarter of their copy to press releases from separatist groups, material that editors say they publish under militant pressure. Failure to publish such statements has frequently resulted in the temporary closure of Kashmiri newspapers and printing presses by militant groups. But last week's directive appeared to go much further than simply banning the publication of separatist press releases. "The directive potentially encompasses any questioning of the electoral process in Kashmir, and it completely silences debate over the issue of sovereignty," Parekh said. The pro-Pakistan Hizb-ul-Mujahideen--Kashmir's most powerful separatist group--responded to the directive on Friday, warning Kashmiri editors that they would be "dealt with severely" if they published government statements or advertisements. Militant groups unanimously oppose holding state or federal elections in Kashmir, contending that a plebiscite must first be held to determine sovereignty over the disputed state. Kashmiris are scheduled to vote for seats in the lower house of parliament, known as the Lok Sabha, in May. The Kashmiri press has recently come under increasing pressure from armed separatists and Indian-backed militias, with two journalists killed since September in unresolved cases, and another sustaining severe injuries when he was abducted and shot last December.

Sheikh is the sixth journalist to be killed in the Indian-held state since 1990, when a simmering separatist movement exploded into a full-scale war. "Sheikh's murder hints at a new ruthlessness in stamping out press freedom in Kashmir," said Vikram Parekh, CPJ's program coordinator for Asia, who visited the strife-torn state last year. "Certainly, by failing to fully investigate such slayings, the Indian government is abetting that process," he added. Sheikh had been missing since late March, when family members say he was kidnapped by an Indian-backed militia. Local police, on the other hand, contend that he was abducted and slain by separatist guerrillas. The editor of two minor Kashmiri newspapers, the Urdu daily Rehnuma-e-Kashmir and the English-language weekly Saffron Times, Sheikh had recently spoken out against an increase in killings and arson incidents in the vicinity of his hometown, Pampur. Sheikh was also the head of an Islamic trust that is responsible for shrine and mosque management in the area. Doctors performed an autopsy Wednesday, but local reporters said the details had not yet been released. Sheikh's colleagues in the Kashmiri press called for a judicial inquiry into his murder, a demand endorsed by CPJ. The editor's slaying closely paralleled the recent murder of Kashmiri lawyer and human rights activist Jalil Andrabi, whose body was discovered floating in the Jhelum river on March 27. Andrabi's wife reported that her husband had not been seen since his arrest by Indian army officers on March 8. "Kashmiri journalists routinely face intimidation by militant separatists, Indian troops and, more recently, renegade militants supported by the Indian army," Parekh said. Several recent assaults remain unresolved, including two assassination attempts. Last December, unidentified gunmen abducted and shot Zee Television correspondent Zafar Meraj, as he was returning from an interview with an Indian-backed militia leader. Meraj is currently recovering in New Delhi. Three months earlier, on Sept. 7, Agence France-Presse photographer Mushtaq Ali was killed when he opened a letter bomb addressed to Yusuf Jameel, the Srinagar correspondent for the BBC and Reuters.

The petition also urged Yilmaz to repeal laws that are used to jail journalists in Turkey. âTurkey holds more journalists in prison than any other country,â said Avner Gidron, CPJâs research director. âWe are sending this petition to Prime Minister Yilmaz as a way of letting the Turkish government know that this is a matter of serious concern for journalists in the United States.â âUnfortunately, it appears that the new government has not improved on its predecessorâs dismal press freedom record,â said Gidron. âImprisonment of journalists and violence against the press is continuing.â At least seven journalists have been jailed in the past two weeks. And several reporters were brutally beaten by police at a recent student demonstration in Ankara. In its annual report, Attacks on the Press in 1995,CPJ documented that, for the second consecutive year, Turkey holds more journalists in prison that any other nation, 51 at the end of 1995. Most of these reporters, editors, publishers and columnists were convicted under the terms of Articles 7 and 8 of the Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of Turkeyâs Penal Code. Article 8, despite recent revisions, still criminalizes news reports that are purportedly âaimed at destroying the indivisibility of the Turkish state.â Article 7 similarly criminalizes all news articles deemed by the state to be âterrorist propaganda.â And Article 312 of Turkeyâs Penal Code mandates up to three years in prison for writing that allegedly âincites hatred or enmity.â Journalists attending the National Press Clubâs Freedom of Information Day Program in Washington, D.C., signed appeals for the release of all journalists imprisoned in Turkey for practicing their profession and urging Prime Minister Yilmaz to seek a repeal of Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of the Penal Code, and a revision of Article 7 of the Anti-Terror Law.

More journalists have been killed in Tajikistan in the past four years -- Nikulinâs death today brings the number to 29 -- than in any other republic of the former Soviet bloc, according to figures compiled by CPJ. At the same time, CPJ faxed a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, requesting that Russian authorities press their counterparts in Tajikistan for an official report about the murder and any subsequent investigations. âTajikistan is wholly dependent on Russian economic and military support, and Moscow should send a clear message to Dushanbe that murderous attacks on their correspondents will not be tolerated,â said William A. Orme, Jr., CPJâs executive director. âWe are requesting that the Yeltsin government join us in asking Tajik authorities to guarantee the safety of all correspondents in Tajikistan and to ensure that thorough investigations into these killings proceed immediately.â Nikulin was shot and killed in his office in Dushanbe this afternoon at 4:20 p.m. News accounts indicate that he was shot twice after answering his office door. Last December the body of Mohyedin Alempour, a correspondent for the BBCâs Persian-language-service, was found with a bullet wound in the head near the state university of Tajikistan. The last killing before Alempourâs took place in November 1994. Tajik authorities have not solved any of the murders of journalists, and no information on the investigations has been disclosed despite CPJâs repeated requests.

The campaign will mobilize CPJ members and international press freedom organizations, while working with Lagos-based journalists, to urge Gen. Sani Abachaâs military regime to cease its relentless assault on the countryâs independent press. âNigeriaâs press continues to be targeted by the government, and attacks on journalists and editorial offices have escalated in recent months,â said Kakuna Kerina, CPJâs program coordinator for Africa. âWe are gravely concerned about our imprisoned colleaguesâ lives,â she added, âand we condemn the governmentâs refusal to allow them the internationally mandated human right to medical care, legal representation and family visitation.â Gen. Abacha is using every weapon in his arsenal to intimidate journalists, including detention without charge; enforcement of military decrees before the secret Special Military Tribunal; assault, interrogation and torture at the hands of police and State Security Service (SSS) agents; editorial office bombings; and the banning and seizure of publications. The July 1995 conviction of The Sunday Magazine (TSM) editor in chief Christine Anyanwu, Weekend Classique editor Ben Charles Obi, Tell magazine assistant editor George Mbah and TheNEWS editor in chief Kunle Ajibade for coverage of, and alleged complicity in, a suspected coup plot, illuminated the lengths to which the current regime will go to restrict the press. The journalists continue to be held in deplorable conditions in a prison system where, during the past five years, 9,905 prisoners have died from communicable diseases alone. 1995 came to a close with a rash of bombings, seizures and the detention without charge, on December 23, of Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of Tell magazine and a 1993 recipient of CPJâs International Press Freedom Award. In early 1996, General Abachaâs unprecedented reign of terror against press freedom was expanded to include nonjournalists: Prominent human rights attorneys Gani Fawehinmi and Femi Falana, who represent many members of the countryâs independent press, were detained without charge and are still being held in undisclosed locations. As reported in CPJâs annual report, Attacks on the Press in 1995, âNigeriaâs 136-year-old press still manages to produce 21 daily and 22 weekly newspapers, and 19 weekly newsmagazines, the majority of which are privately owned. Their struggle to publish and remain financially viable under the current siege is a testament to the professionalism and sheer ingenuity of journalists who manage to work while in hiding, publish with police stationed at printing presses and disseminate information to fellow citizens as police seize entire runs from the newsstands.â CPJ applauds the World Press Reviewâs recent choice of Dapo Olorunyomi, editor in chief of TheNEWS, a Lagos-based news magazine as co-winner of the magazineâs 1995 International Editor of the Year Award. The award is given annually to editors working outside the United States, honoring âenterprise, courage, and leadership in advancing the freedom and responsibility of the press, enhancing human rights, and fostering excellence in journalism.â Olorunyomi shares the award with Fred Mâmembe, managing director and editor in chief of The Post, a Zambian daily newspaper. We encourage all those interested in participating to sign the attached letter to General Abacha, then mail or fax it to CPJ. CPJ will then forward the protest letters to the State House in Abuja, Nigeria. His Excellency Gen. Sani Abacha Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces State House Abuja, NIGERIA Your Excellency: I support the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonpartisan press freedom advocacy group, in its campaign to obtain the release from prison of Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of the Lagos-based Tell magazine and a recipient of CPJâs 1993 International Press Freedom Awards. Igiebor was arrested on Dec. 23, 1995, by agents of the State Security Service. He continues to be held in solitary confinement without charge and has been denied legal counsel and family visitation rights. Igieborâs imprisonment is a clear violation of Article 19 of the United Nationsâ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states, âEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers.â Nigeria is a signatory to this declaration. Also in violation of Article 19 is the imprisonment of journalists Kunle Ajibade (TheNEWS), Christine Anyanwu (The Sunday Magazine), George Mbah (Tell) and Ben Charles Obi (Weekend Classique). They continue to be held in deplorable and life-threatening conditions, and have been denied the internationally recognized human right to medical care, legal representation and family visitation. I respectfully call on Your Excellency to order the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Igiebor and his colleagues and to allow them to resume their journalistic work. Until the time of their release, I also request that you grant them their rights to medical care, legal representation and family visitation. Lastly, I respectfully call on you to intervene on the side of press freedom and to uphold your public proclamations of support for an independent press by establishing an environment in which journalists may work freely and safely. I welcome your comments and reply.

Taufik heads Indonesia's only independent journalists' association and has been in jail since March 16, 1995, when he was arrested for publishing a magazine that was critical of President Suharto's regime. "More than 300 leading American journalists and news media executives have signed appeals for Ahmad Taufik's release," said William A. Orme, Jr., CPJ's executive director. "We're sending their petitions to President Suharto today, on the first anniversary of Taufik's imprisonment, as a way of letting authorities in Jakarta know that his case remains a matter of grave concern to his colleagues in the United States." Taufik, who is president of the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI), was convicted on Sept. 1 of violating Article 19 of the Indonesian Press Law, which prohibits the publication of an unlicensed newspaper or magazine, and Article 154 of the Indonesian Criminal Code, which bars the expression of "feelings of hostility, hatred or contempt toward the government." The charges stemmed from articles in AJI's monthly newsmagazine, Independen, that dealt with topics such as the succession to President Suharto and the personal wealth of the country's leaders. Taufik was sentenced to 32 months in prison--a term that was later increased to three years. Also convicted and sentenced on the same charges were another AJI member, Eko Maryadi, and the union's office assistant, Danang Wardoyo. A journalist since 1986, Taufik formerly worked at the Bandung bureau of Tempo magazine. Tempo was one of three leading newsweeklies banned by the Suharto regime in June 1994, sparking nationwide demonstrations and international condemnation. The three publications shared a reputation for editorial independence and daring coverage of Indonesia's political and military affairs. Taufik and others who went on to form AJI played an instrumental role in marshaling public protests against the media bans, as well as subsequent violations of press freedom in Indonesia. In retaliation, authorities pressured Indonesian editors to dismiss AJI members from their staffs and repeatedly raided the union's offices. CPJ honored Taufik with one of its prestigious International Press Freedom Awards at a ceremonial dinner in New York on December 6, 1995. Peter Arnett, Carl Bernstein, Wolf Blitzer, Phil Donahue, Max Frankel, Katharine Graham, Anthony Lewis, Walter Isaacson, James Ottaway, Dan Rather, Frank Rich, Yndamiro Restano, Gene Roberts, David Rohde, William Safire, Frank Sesno, Howard Stringer, Ted Turner, Mike Wallace and hundreds of others signed appeals for the journalists' release at the ceremony. The Committee presented the appeals to the Indonesian Embassy in Washington, D.C., in a January meeting with embassy officials and today sent the petitioners' names by courier to Suharto.

On Sunday, China deported Shui An-teh and Chuang Chi-wei, both reporters for Taiwan Television Enterprise (TTE), after detaining them for two days for videotaping Chinese troops conducting military exercises in southeastern Fujian province. According to the official Xinhua News Agency, the two journalists signed written confessions of their wrongdoing--a usual condition of release for foreign journalists detained in China. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, however, Shui and Chuang said they were unaware that they had been taping in a restricted area and maintained that they were engaged in ordinary reporting activities. Fujian province has been the staging ground for recent Chinese missile tests, widely seen as an attempt to intimidate Taiwanese voters from supporting pro-independence candidates. "Taiwanese reporters should be free to report on scare tactics that are directly aimed at influencing the outcome of Taiwan's election," said William A. Orme, Jr., CPJ's executive director. "However, the detention of the two reporters fits a pattern of continued harassment by China of Taiwanese journalists," he added. Reporters for Taiwan's state-owned media have repeatedly been shut out of the General Assembly by United Nations officials in New York, acting under apparent pressure from China. In February 1994, for example, Taiwanese television reporters Ming Young and Chiou Yueh--who had been accredited at the United Nations since 1990 and 1992, respectively--were abruptly denied renewal of their press passes. Taiwan itself has made major strides toward press freedom in recent years. The print media is privately owned, as are a growing number of radio stations. According to the Committee, however, there remains substantial room for improvement. Taiwanese authorities ended a yearlong series of violent crackdowns on unlicensed radio stations in early 1995, but they now jam the broadcasters' frequencies and continue to impose fines on station owners. Pirate radio's growth was fueled in recent years by immensely popular call-in programs, which offered ordinary Taiwanese a chance to air discontent with government policies. Taiwan's government also retains ownership of the island's three licensed television stations. According to both the political opposition and independent journalists, those stations have devoted the lion's share of their campaign coverage to incumbent president Lee Teng-hui. A start-up private television company--the People Broadcasting Corporation, whose board includes Hsu Hsin-liang, the presidential candidate of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party--was granted a broadcasting license last year. But stiff capitalization requirements have kept it from going on the air in time for the elections.

For the second consecutive year, Turkey held more journalists in jail (51) than any other country as the government continued to suppress independent reporting on the Kurdish conflict. The Committee to Protect Journalists today called on Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz to release Turkey's imprisoned journalists and rescind the laws used to punish and censor the local press. "Turkey surpasses such totalitarian regimes as China and Syria in its willingness to throw journalists in jail," said CPJ Chair Kati Marton. "The new Turkish government should demonstrate its commitment to democracy by releasing our imprisoned colleagues and abolishing Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of the Penal Code, which are inherently incompatible with press freedom." The number of confirmed cases of imprisoned journalists in 1995 exceeds CPJ's accounting for 1994 --a then-record 173 imprisoned journalists at year's end. The increase in 1995 was largely attributable to the recent crackdown on independent journalism in Ethiopia and Nigeria. In each of the 182 cases documented in Attacks on the Press in 1995, CPJ staff researchers verified that the jailed journalists were imprisoned as a direct reprisal for their reporting and remained incarcerated on Dec. 31, 1995. "Imprisonment is a very effective form of censorship," said William A. Orme, Jr., CPJ's executive director. Attacks on the Press in 1995 documents that at year's end: At least 182 journalists were in jail, up from 173 in 1994; The four countries with the highest number of imprisoned journalists were Turkey (51), Ethiopia (31), China (20) and Kuwait (18); Vietnam, Peru, Myanmar (Burma) and Nigeria each held eight journalists in jail; and There were six jailed journalists in Syria, four in Indonesia and Algeria, and three in Zaire. The Legal Tools Used to Imprison Journalists Though the political contexts of these imprisonments vary widely from country to country, the incarcerations of journalists fall into several broad categories. Some representative cases: Turkey: Isik Ocak Yurtcu, the editor of Ozgur Gundem, Turkey's leading pro-Kurdish daily, was imprisoned on Dec. 28, 1994. Charged under Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, he was convicted of publishing "separatist propaganda." He remains in prison, serving a 25-year sentence. Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law defines nongovernmental accounts of the Kurdish conflict as proscribed propaganda; publishing such independent reports is a criminal offense. Turkey is the biggest offender in this category, but it is not unique: In Ethiopia and many other countries, journalists writing or broadcasting reports on civil war or ethnic strife are accused of violating broadly drafted hate speech laws, as if their reporting were the cause rather than a consequence of those conflicts. Peru:Eduardo Sihue Cano, a graphic artist for the left-wing magazine Cambio, was imprisoned on June 12, 1992, and sentenced to six years in prison for being an "apologist for terrorism," a crime under Peru's 1992 anti-terrorism legislation. Under Peruvian anti-terror laws, Sihue had no right to confront his accuser; his attorney could not review evidence beforehand or otherwise challenge the government's case; the judges were hooded ("faceless") security officials with limited legal training. Sihue remains in prison. Again, Peru is not unique. Turkey, Kuwait, Algeria, China, Iran, Myanmar (Burma), Nigeria, Syria, Tunisia and Vietnam also consider the publication of news stories about armed insurgents a criminal violation of anti-terrorism laws. Special tribunals with unidentified accusers and anonymous judges are used by several other countries, including the United Kingdom, for prosecuting alleged terrorist offenses. Ivory Coast (Cote D'Ivoire): Abou Drahamane Sangare and Emmanuel Kore, who work for the opposition daily La Voie, were imprisoned on Dec. 21, 1995, for suggesting in print that President Henri Konan Bedie's attendance at the African Champions Cup final brought bad luck to the losing national soccer team. The two were sentenced to two years in prison for "offending the chief of state." They remain in prison. Turkey, Indonesia, Central African Republic, Iran, Myanmar (Burma) and Cameroon and many other countries use criminal libel and slander laws to imprison reporters who write unflattering stories about the president, elected officials, spiritual leaders and businessmen. China: Gao Yu, a free-lance journalist from Hong Kong, was imprisoned on Oct. 2, 1993. She was tried without counsel and sentenced to six years in prison for "leaking state secrets" about China's structural reforms in articles for the pro-Beijing Hong Kong magazine Mirror Monthly.She remains in prison. Algeria, Vietnam and others rely on similarly arbitrary and vague definitions of national security and state secrets to imprison journalists. Nigeria:Nosa Igiebor, the editor in chief of Nigeria's Tell magazine, was imprisoned on Dec. 23, 1995. He was arrested by six members of the State Security Service at his home in Lagos. Authorities demanded that he reveal his sources for articles critical of the government and accused him of receiving financial support from "outsiders." Igiebor's arrest and detention were confirmed by numerous CPJ sources in Nigeria. Government authorities still deny that they have detained him, however. He has not been charged with any crime. In Algeria, Iraq, Libya, Western Sahara, Zaire, Zambia and other countries, journalists are often jailed without charges. Authorities also often deny that they are holding these journalists in jail, which makes it difficult to confirm many cases of imprisoned journalists. Turkish Campaign Against Press Ensnares American Journalist Almost all of the journalists prosecuted for these offenses are nationals working for local publications and broadcast outlets. One recent exception was Aliza Marcus, an American journalist working in Reuters' Istanbul bureau, who was charged in August 1995 for allegedly contravening Article 312 of the Penal Code, which makes it a crime to "incite racial hatred." Marcus' real offense was reporting on the forced evacuation of Kurdish villages by the military. She faced up to three years in prison, even though the facts in her story were never contested. The charges against Marcus were dropped after her trial prompted protests from prominent foreign journalists, including CPJ Honorary Chairman Walter Cronkite, who discussed the case in Ankara with then-Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. "I believe international pressure made a big difference in my case, but Turkish journalists don't get the same level of international support," said Marcus, who is receiving a Freedom of the Press Award from the National Press Club in Washington today. Marcus has since left Turkey, forced out by the government's refusal to renew her press accreditation. She now works for Reuters in Cyprus. Special Reports and Information in CPJ's Attacks Report Drawn from the firsthand research of CPJ's full-time professional staff, Attacks on the Press in 1995is the single most authoritative and comprehensive assessment of the status of press freedom around the world today. CPJ's staff writers examine press freedom conflicts in more than 100 countries and offer detailed information on 720 cases of imprisonment, censorship, legal harassment and physical assaults on reporters, editors and broadcasters around the world. The book features insightful commentaries on the murders of journalists in Algeria and Russia, and examines broader press freedom crises in Nigeria, Cuba and Kashmir. Christian Science Monitor correspondent David Rohde writes of his ordeal as a prisoner of the Bosnian Serbs; Palestinian journalist Imad Musa discusses arbitrary detention and censorship under Arafat; Russian reporter Masha Gessen reports on homophobic attacks against gay and lesbian journalists in 14 countries over the past five years. Journalists Killed 1986--1995 For the first time, CPJ's annual report includes a complete list of all confirmed cases of journalists who have been killed in the line of duty in the past 10 years. More than 300 of these 456 confirmed deaths bore all the signs of deliberate political assassinations, CPJ reports. Few of these crimes have been prosecuted, however. The five countries with the highest death tolls over the past decade were Algeria, with 53 confirmed killings, all by radical Islamist terror factions; the former Yugoslavia, where at least 45 reporters were killed in cross fire and at the hands of assassins; Colombia, with 43 deaths, most in reprisal for coverage of drug trafficking; Tajikistan, where 29 journalists were killed, the victims of death squads and armed insurgents; and the Philippines, also with 29 dead, where journalists were targeted for exposing corruption during a rocky transition to democracy. As reported in January, CPJ's Attacks on the Press in 1995 documents 51 cases of journalists murdered in the line of duty last year. Forty-five of these deaths were political assassinations, including the murders of 24 Algerian journalists, and six resulted from combat assignments. The Committee to Protect Journalists documents and responds to press freedom abuses around the world. From its headquarters in New York, CPJ works to get detained journalists out of jail, directs international campaigns of protest against repressive governments and provides practical safety information to reporters assigned to dangerous areas. CPJ is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization financed wholly by donations from individuals, private foundations and news organizations. The CPJ annual report was released today in Washington, D.C., at a press conference at the National Press Club.

"The suppression of the printed and electronic editions of The Post and the continued legal harassment of editor Fred M'membe and his colleagues call into question the Zambian government's proclaimed commitment to democracy," said CPJ's executive director, William A. Orme, Jr. "The censorship of independent news reporting is especially troubling during an election year, when Zambians rely on news organizations such as The Post for information about opposition viewpoints and government actions and policies." CPJ denounces the following incidents of detention without trial, censorship and the protracted legal harassment of the The Post''s editorial staff: The Feb. 5 issue of The Post, which revealed the Zambian government's plan to hold a referendum in March to promulgate a controversial draft constitution, was banned by presidential decree and declared a "prohibited publication" under Section 53 of the Penal Code. The decree also warned the public that any citizen caught in possession of the edition, including the on-line version, could be charged with committing a criminal offense under the Prohibited Publications Act. M'membe, managing editor Bright Mwape and special projects editor Masautso Phiri were arrested on Feb. 6 and charged with possessing state secrets, a violation of Section 4 of the State Security Act, and possessing a banned publication. The three were released on bail of US$350 each on Feb. 7, the same day that President Chiluba ordered the removal of the Feb. 5 edition from The Post's World Wide Web site. President Chiluba's decree marks the first act of censorship of the Internet on the African continent. If convicted, M'membe, Phiri and Mwape face a maximum of 25 years in prison. In a separate incident, on Feb. 23, M'membe, Mwape and columnist Lucy Banda Sichone,went into hiding to avoid imprisonment on charges of contempt of Parliament after the Zambian National Assembly, on Feb. 21, found the three journalists guilty of violating the Powers and Privileges Act. The Act is a colonial law that prohibits nonmembers of Parliament from criticizing proclamations issued by members of Parliament. In the Jan. 29 edition of The Post, M'membe, Mwape and Sichone had written articles commenting on the vice president's criticism, in Parliament, of a recent Supreme Court decision. The National Assembly Standing Orders Committee sentenced the three journalists to indefinite detention until they publicly apologized for breach of Parliament. On Mar. 4, M'membe and Mwape surrendered to parliamentary authorities, explaining that they would not apologize to the House. M'membe pleaded with the speaker of the National Assembly to absolve Sichone, who remains in hiding with her three-month-old infant, of blame. Attorneys for The Post have petitioned the High Court, challenging the constitutionality of the National Assembly Powers and Privileges Act. As reported in CPJ's annual report, Attacks on the Press in 1995: "After a promising start, President Frederick Chiluba's government reneged on its promises to reform repressive legislation. Instead, it embarked on a deliberate campaign to restrict press freedom and is rapidly becoming one of the worst violators of press freedom in southern Africa." Since its launch in 1991, The Post has endured military raids, censorship, arrests and numerous legal actions sanctioned by President Chiluba's government. For their exposure of government corruption, the journalists face countless charges, including defamation of the president, which amount to more than 125 years in prison. CPJ has initiated a campaign to bring world attention to this pattern of harassment of the Zambian independent press and to urge President Chiluba to ensure an environment in which Zambian journalists can work freely. We encourage all those interested in participating to sign the attached letter to President Chiluba, then mail or fax it to CPJ. CPJ will forward the protest letters to the State House in Lusaka. CPJ applauds the World Press Review's recent choice of Fred M'membe as co-winner of the magazine's 1995 International Editor of the Year Award. The award is given annually to editors working outside the United States, honoring "enterprise, courage, and leadership in advancing the freedom and responsibility of the press, enhancing human rights, and fostering excellence in journalism." M'membe shares the award with Dapo Olorunyomi, editor in chief of TheNEWS, a Lagos-based news magazine. His Excellency President Frederick Chiluba President of the Republic of Zambia State House Independence Avenue P. O. Box 30208 Lusaka, ZAMBIA Your Excellency, As an advocate of press freedom, I write to express my concern over the persecution of the staff of your countryâs leading independent daily newspaper, The Post. Managing director and editor in chief Fred Mâmembe and his colleagues, managing editor Bright Mwape, special projects editor Masautso Phiri and columnist Lucy Sichone, have endured relentless harassment and an unprecedented number of legal charges since the newspaper was launched in 1991. For exercising their rights as journalists to freely express ideas and opinions, Mâmembe, a winner of three international press freedom awards, and his colleagues face countless charges that amount to more than 125 years in jail. More recently, on March 4, Mâmembe and Mwape surrendered to parliamentary authorities after spending 10 days in hiding to avoid imprisonment on charges of contempt of Parliament. They were sentenced by the National Assembly Standing Orders Committee, which convicted the journalists without trial in a court of law, under the National Assembly Powers and Privileges Act. They are now serving an indefinite prison sentence. Sichone, who was also convicted with Mâmembe and Mwape, remains in hiding with her three-month-old infant. Furthermore, Mâmembe, Mwape and Phiri are facing charges of violating Section 4 of the State Security Act, the conviction of which has a jail sentence of 25 years, in connection with the banned printed and on-line editions of The Post, which Your Excellency decreed a âprohibited publication.â This decree marks the first act of censorship of the Internet on the African continent. I strongly urge Your Excellency to annul the convictions of the three journalists and to immediately and unconditionally release M'membe and Mwape. I also urge you to revoke the ban on the Feb. 5 edition of The Post, and to revoke the colonial National Assembly Powers and Privileges Act. Finally, I respectfully call on Your Excellency, in this election year, to intervene on the side of press freedom and to uphold your public proclamations of support for a free and independent press by ensuring an environment in which journalists may work freely and safely. I welcome your comments and reply, _______________________________ _____________________ Name Date The information in this news alert may be freely copied and distributed provided that it is properly attributed to the Committee to Protect Journalists. | News Alerts Index | CPJ Website |WT01-B01-93IA023-000251-B019-171http://www.cpj.org:80/news/alg3.12.html 169.132.35.44 19970108113747 text/html 17259HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 11:37:12 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 17087Last-modified: Fri, 26 Jul 1996 21:21:55 GMT CPJ Press Release | News Alert Index | CPJ Website | For Immediate Release March 12 1996 Contact: Avner Gidron (212) 465-1004 x105 Veteran Algerian Reporter Assassinated NEW YORK -- The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonpartisan advocate of press freedoms, vigorously condemned today's murder of Djilali Arabdiou, a reporter and photographer with the pro-government weekly Alg&eacuterie ActualitÃ© Arabdiou is the sixth journalist murdered in Algeria this year and the 58th victim of an ongoing campaign targeting the Algerian media for assassination. "This murderous campaign against journalists in Algeria is the most lethal documented by CPJ in the last 10 years," said Avner Gidron, CPJ's research director. Unidentified men shot and killed Arabdiou this morning in Ain Naadja, a southwestern suburb of Algiers. Arabdiou was considered the dean of Algerian photojournalists, his colleagues told CPJ. No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing. But Islamic fundamentalist rebels are presumed responsible. The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has claimed responsibility for the bulk of journalists' slayings in Algeria. As many as 40,000 people have died in the Algerian conflict. But the 58 journalists killed since May 1993 have all been deliberately targeted, not killed in cross fire, in a concerted campaign to assassinate secular intellectuals and professionals. While the greatest threat to the journalistic profession comes from armed opponents of the government, the regime itself has done much to hinder the work of journalists. Last month Algerian editors were ordered by the government to submit all unofficial reports about violence to a censor. Newspapers are only allowed to carry stories about the security situation that have been supplied by the official Algerian Press Service. Since the army interrupted the electoral process in January 1992 to prevent a victory by the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in parliamentary elections, many independent journalists have been dragged to court, newspapers have been suspended, and the state's monopoly on printing has been used to intimidate publishers. CPJ's annual report Attacks on the Press in 1995, which documents in detail the assassination of Algerian journalists by extremists and instances of government censorship of the press, will be released on March 14, in Washington, DC. Attached is a list, documented by CPJ, of the 58 journalists killed in Algeria since May 1993. 58 JOURNALISTS KILLED IN ALGERIA Armed Muslim fundamentalists are suspected of involvement in most of the following murders in Algeria: 1996 March 12: Unidentified men shot and killed Djilali Arabdiou, a reporter and photographer with the pro-government weekly Alg&eacuterie ActualitÃ© in Ain Naadja, a southwestern suburb of Algiers.

Chaikova, who had frequently traveled to Chechnya and the surrounding regions, was known for her hard-hitting coverage of the war in the breakaway republic and issues such as Russian authorities' use of special "filtration" prison camps to control the population. In a follow-up to a conversation in early May, Chaikova's colleagues reiterated to CPJ on June 11 that the federal Russian prosecutor's office still has not opened an investigation into her death and that the local Chechen village prosecutor who originally took up the case is unlikely to get far because of limited resources. The editors of Obshchaya Gazeta, a respected weekly with a circulation of about 10,000, have mounted their own investigation and have sent reporters to the scene to check various hypotheses of her murder. A statement by a local official and a note by Chaikova point to federal troops as the suspects. But other clues indicate that Chechen leaders themselves may have ordered her death, believing that she was a spy and perhaps acting on rumors spread by the KGB's successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB). No firm allegation can be made because no central Russian investigation has been opened. Chaikova was last seen by colleagues toward the end of March. Jaromir Stetin of the Czech news agency Epicenter saw her on March 19 when she filed her report from the blockaded village of Sernovodsk, and Komsomolskaya Pravda reporter Alexander Yevtushenko saw her on March 20. They both reported that Chaikova was headed for Samashki and had plans to disguise herself as a Chechen peasant woman in order to cover the news there. She was often known to dress in a kerchief and long black skirt to appear "just like a local," according to Obshchaya Gazeta correspondent Alexander Trushin. Trushin and colleagues from the Russian wire services ITAR-TASS and Postfactum went to Chechnya in early April to look for Chaikova after she had been missing for more than 10 days and had failed to make a scheduled phone call to the newspaper's editorial offices in Moscow. The journalists started their search in Grozny, showing crowds of demonstrators her picture. They then worked their way through Chechen villages, some recently bombed by federal troops, interviewing residents there and placing ads about Chaikova's disappearance on local commercial television stations. In Samashki, a local government official said that Chaikova had spent the night of March 20-21 in his village, then left with refugees through a safe corridor made by the Russian military and reportedly had been headed toward Zakan-Yurt-Kulary. "Go look for her at the federals' [the Russian federal troops' base]," the official instructed Trushin. "She had a camera and photographed everything they committed here." At the time, Russian troops were surrounding Samashki while they completed mop-up operations, detaining many civilians suspected of harboring guerrillas. Chechen fighters then told Trushin and his colleagues that an unidentified woman had been buried in a neighboring village and advised them to inquire at the Urus-Martanovsky District prosecutor's office. There the reporters discovered photographs that clearly indicated that Chaikova had been beaten, blindfolded, forced into a kneeling position, and shot in the back of the head. The prosecutor explained that her body had been discovered on the outskirts of Gekhi near a sewage pipe but that a forensic examination indicated that she had been murdered elsewhere and her body dumped outside the village. When she was found, villagers buried her in their local cemetery in a Muslim ceremony. Her body was exhumed April 12, and the Moscow correspondents made a positive identification. Chaikova is only one of at least five journalists who have been assassinated while covering the war in Chechnya, and four others are missing and presumed dead. The Yeltsin government has failed to properly investigate, much less prosecute, a single case. Nor has it done so for the cases of eight other journalists who have been murdered for their work since 1994. In each and every instance, CPJ has demanded that President Yeltsin order a thorough investigation and bring to justice those responsible for the murder of journalists. And we have also written to President Clinton urging him to press for full investigations and public disclosure of the findings in these cases. Please join us in our appeal by sending your own letter to President Yeltsin. If you have any further questions about Chaikova's case, please direct them to Catherine Fitzpatrick, CPJ's program coordinator for Central Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union.

Sani Abacha. Igiebor and his staff at Tell have come under repeated assault for exposing government corruption and denouncing the aborted transition from military rule to democracy after the June 1993 elections. On Dec. 23, 1995, Igiebor was arrested without charge by six agents of the State Security Service (SSS) and placed in solitary confinement. SSS agents simultaneously seized 20,000 copies of Tellâs Christmas Day edition with the cover story âAbacha Is Adamant: Terrorizes the Opposition.â During the following month, over 110,000 additional copies of Tell were seized from printing presses and newspaper vendors as the government escalated its efforts to cripple the publication editorially and financially. Authorities continue to demand that Igiebor reveal his sources for articles published in Tell condemning Abachaâs government. But he has repeatedly refused to do so and as a result has been relocated to a maximum security prison in Minna State where he is denied his right to legal counsel and family visitation. In January 1996, the federal government announced that Igiebor was being held under Decree 2 of 1984 for acts prejudicial to state security. In February, Igieborâs attorney, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, was also arrested without charge, and he continues to be held in a maximum security prison facility in Bauchi State without access to family or legal counsel. Igiebor, a 1993 recipient of CPJâs International Press Freedom Awards, is no stranger to the tactics that Nigeriaâs military strongmen use to silence opposing voices. He was deputy editor of Newswatch magazine in 1986 when the editor, Dele Giwa, was assassinated by a parcel bomb after Newswatch was suspended for publishing recommendations on political reform. As Tell magazine has matured into a strong voice in defense of press freedom, the staff has come under increased harassment: senior editors and managers are frequently arrested and reporters beaten; their editorial offices have been occupied by SSS agents; editions have been seized regularly and the magazine itself has been banned. In May 1995, Igiebor was forced into hiding after a warrant for his arrest was issued for contempt of court. The charges were in connection with articles he published exposing the governmentâs manipulation of the Abuja High Court to prevent pro-democracy organizations from holding public meetings. In March 1996, the Committee launched an international campaign, âNigeria: The Press Under Siege,â to bring world attention to Gen. Abachaâs relentless assault on the countryâs independent press.

He is currently serving a three-year jail sentence for publishing an unlicensed magazine, Independen, and for expressing "feelings of hostility, hatred or contempt toward the government" in several of the magazine's articles. Held in prison since his arrest in March 1995, Taufik was sentenced on Sept. 1. His case is emblematic of the Indonesian government's determination to eradicate the country's independent press. As part of that effort, in June 1994 authorities banned three leading newsweeklies known for their editorial independence and daring coverage of domestic politics. The move sparked nationwide demonstrations and international condemnation. Taufik, who worked for TEMPO --one of the banned magazines--joined several colleagues to form the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) as an alternative to the state-sponsored Indonesian Journalists Association (PWI). Under his leadership, AJI came to play an instrumental role in marshaling public protests against the bans, and it documented the crackdown in a timely and independently produced book. The organization also began publishing the influential Independen, a limited-circulation magazine that ran investigative stories on government corruption and other subjects that angered President Suharto and Information Minister Harmoko. Soon after AJI was formed, Harmoko and PWI quickly tightened the screws on the fledgling organization. PWI demanded that editors fire staff members who belonged to AJI or risk losing their publishing licenses. As a result, more than 80 AJI members have lost their jobs, and many others have been transferred to noneditorial positions. After the arrest of Taufik and several colleagues--two of whom, Eko Maryadi and Danang Wardoyo, are also serving jail sentences--the state union expelled 13 of its members for simultaneously belonging to AJI. Throughout his trial, Taufik reaffirmed his commitment to press freedom. "Journalists should tell the truth and only the truth," he said. "I'm prepared to be jailed just for the truth." In recognition of his courage, CPJ honored Taufik with its annual International Press Freedom Award in December 1995. CPJ has also initiated a letter-writing campaign to secure Taufik's release and urges readers of this page to join in the appeals.

Bosnian Serbs release U.S. journalist after CPJ intervenes By Jeanne Sahadi Taking journalists hostage has become a tactic of the Bosnian Serbs, who often use their captives to secure the release of their own POWs. Christian Science Monitor reporter David Rohde, however, was the first journalist to be charged and convicted of crimes in retaliation for his reporting on Bosnian Serb atrocities. He helped expose the massacre of thousands of Muslims by Bosnian Serb forces after their capture of Srebrenica. During his illegal detention, which began on Oct. 29, Rohde was tried and convicted of illegally entering Bosnian Serb territory and of falsifying documents. Three meetings between CPJ Chair Kati Marton and Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic at the Dayton, Ohio, peace talks helped secure Rohdeâs release on Nov. 8. âIn my meetings with Mr. Milosevic, I made it clear to him that the American media would not let go of the David Rohde story until he was safe and free,â Marton said. âI urged him to work with his Bosnian Serb colleagues to bring this situation to a positive end.â Upon his release, Rohde was cleared of all charges as âa sign of goodwill and contributionâ to the talks, according to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Acknowledging the cooperative effort that secured Rohdeâs freedom, J. Anthony Periton, editor in chief of The Christian Science Publishing Society, said, âThis outcome would not have been possible without the help of a large group of people. We particularly want to thank the U.S. State Department, the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Committee to Protect Journalists.â (c) 1996 Committee Protect Journalists | Front Page| CPJ Website |                                                                        WT01-B01-99IA023-000251-B020-308http://www.cpj.org:80/awards96/fifteen.html 169.132.35.44 19970108114053 text/html 4348HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 11:40:30 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 4177Last-modified: Wed, 13 Nov 1996 16:59:07 GMT International Press Freedom Awards Index CPJ at 15 The Committee to Protect Journalists marks its 15th anniversary this year. The American journalists who filed CPJâs papers of incorporation in 1981 dedicated the organization to the defense of âhuman and professional rights of journalists around the world.â Their goal was to use the power of the U.S. media on behalf of colleagues abroad threatened by authoritarian governments and other enemies of independent journalism. They were compelled by a sense of urgency. Death-squad killings of journalists were rampant in Central and South America, and violent attacks on the press were on the rise elsewhere. The incorporating documents laid out clearly CPJâs basic mandate: the protection of journalists through âthe compilation and verification of the actual or threatened violations of the professional rights of journalists; the mobilization of public opinion throughout the world for the prevention of . . . such violations; and the dissemination of information concerning the status and treatment of journalists throughout the world.â It was an ambitious but realistic agenda. Since 1981, CPJ has documented, protested, and publicized thousands of violations of press freedom and has grown into a vitally important institution to journalists and news organizations worldwide. It is the only U.S. organization with a full-time staff devoted solely to this important work. Rapid-fire requests for CPJâs help can come during crises ranging from crackdowns on independent newspapers to political assassination campaigns against editors and reporters. On average, over the past decade at least one journalist has been killed every week somewhere in the world. Scores of journalists are imprisoned every year because of what they have reported. Hundreds more are routinely subjected to physical attack, illegal detention, spurious legal action, and threats against themselves or their families. And even in the United States, where the press enjoys great power and legal protection, journalists have been murdered with impunity. CPJ turns the spotlight of public attention on these actions. It can intervene anytime a reporter is in trouble. A professional staff of highly experienced regional specialists track press conditions through an extensive network of sources, reports from the field and on-site fact-finding missions. Volunteers from its board of prominent journalists and international membership are ready to assist. CPJ notifies news organizations, government officials, and human rights groups of press freedom violations. In many cases, its protest campaigns have been responsible for getting journalists out of jail or preventing their threatened imprisonment. This year, with the establishment of CPJâs Web site, journalists everywhere have access to the latest news about press freedom conditions around the world and a vast database of information about past violations. Paradoxically, the expansion of press freedom since the end of the Cold War has made CPJ more important than ever. Jailings and murders of journalists increase virtually every year. So do the calls for CPJâs help. Last year alone, CPJ responded directly to more than 250 press freedom violations and documented 500 other such incidents. We are proud of what the Committee to Protect Journalists has accomplished in its first 15 years. But we are asked to do much more, and with your support, we can do more. CPJ is entirely dependent on donations from journalists, news organizations, and private foundations. It is nonpartisan, nonprofit, and nonstop. |International Press Freedom Awards|| CPJ Website | WT01-B01-100IA023-000251-B020-394http://www.cpj.org:80/awards96/jusuf.html 169.132.35.44 19970108114132 text/html 4279HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 11:40:56 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 4108Last-modified: Thu, 14 Nov 1996 21:14:05 GMT International Press Freedom Awards The career of Kashmiri journalist Yusuf Jameel, one of the leading reporters on the civil war in Indian-held Kashmir, has been marked by violent reprisals--beatings, grenade attacks, and, last fall, a letter bomb addressed to him that killed a colleague. Formerly a correspondent for the BBC and a stringer for Reuters and Time magazine, Jameel currently works as a reporter in Delhi for the daily newspaper Asian Age. He returned to Kashmir in September to report on the first state-assembly elections there since the civil war began in 1989. But getting the story was not the only purpose of Jameel's trip. He had returned to attend a memorial service by Kashmiri journalists for Mushtaq Ali, a cameraman with Asian News International and Agence France-Presse. Ali was fatally injured in September 1995 when he opened a letter bomb addressed to Jameel, who was working for the BBC at the time. Jameel sustained only minor injuries. Soon after, he relocated to London, where he worked for the BBC for several months more before returning to India. ATTACKS ON JAMEEL SIGNIFY PROBLEMS FACING KASHMIRI JOURNALISTS Like so many of his colleagues, Jameel has had to withstand pressure and attacks from all parties to the conflict in Kashmir, which pits Indian security forces and government-backed militias against an array of guerrilla groups fighting for the state's independence or merger with Pakistan. The combatants view the local press as being biased in favor of their adversaries, and retaliate through violence and intimidation. To date, six Kashmiri journalists have been murdered in the course of their work; in four of those cases--including Mushtaq Ali's--the perpetrators' identities remain unknown. Srinagar-based newspapers have frequently been forced to suspend publication under pressure from the various warring parties. And numerous local journalists have survived abductions, including 19 correspondents for the foreign and domestic media who were kidnapped and detained for seven-and-a-half hours by an Indian-backed militia while en route to a press conference last July. HIGH PROFILE MADE JAMEEL KEY TARGET FOR ALL SIDES While working as a journalist for the BBC and Reuters--news organizations that are widely respected in Kashmir for their nonpartisan coverage of the war--Jameel was an especially conspicuous target for intimidation. In 1990, Indian security officers seized him, took him blindfolded to a remote location and held him incommunicado for interrogation about a colleague's alleged contacts with militants. Unlike most cases involving attacks on Kashmiri journalists, Jameel's abduction resulted in disciplinary action for three of the officers involved. On two separate occasions in 1992, unidentified assailants threw grenades at Jameel's home and office in Srinagar. Later that year, security officers severely beat him on the head as he attempted to cover a protest march by the Kashmiri women's organization Dukhtaran-e-Milat; Jameel was hospitalized for four days following the assault. In addition to the violent reprisals, he has periodically faced threats from militant separatists who were displeased with his coverage of the war. As of November 1996, Jameel continued to be based in Delhi. In an article for the International Press Institute's IPI Report, however, he said, "I am keen to return to Srinagar to resume work, but many well-wishers, concerned for my safety, insist that I should not do so.â But, he added, "I believe that such risks are part of my profession." |International Press Freedom Awards|| CPJ Website | WT01-B01-101IA023-000251-B020-467http://www.cpj.org:80/awards96/jesus.html 169.132.35.44 19970108114203 text/html 9547HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 11:41:52 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 9376Last-modified: Thu, 14 Nov 1996 21:13:59 GMT International Press Freedom Awards In recognition of more than two decades of courageous journalism, in defiance of political pressure and violence that cost the life of his associate, the Committee to Protect Journalists will present J. Jesus Blancornelas, editor of the Mexican newspaper Zeta, with its prestigious International Press Freedom Award. When Blancornelas and longtime colleague Hector FÃ©lix Miranda co-founded Zeta, a feisty weekly newspaper in the Mexico-U.S. border city of Tijuana, in 1980, they set a bold agenda for Mexican journalism. In a country where the news media had historically kowtowed to government interests and where bribe-taking among journalists was so commonplace that it spawned a litany of catchphrases, Zeta dared to provide what few other Mexican newspapers had: hard-hitting stories on Mexicoâs most vexing problems--official corruption and drug trafficking. The cost of Zetaâs independence has been high: FÃ©lix, a popular columnist known as "FÃ©lix the Cat," whose writing frequently targeted the wealthy and powerful, was murdered in 1988. A year before, unidentified assailants riddled the Zeta office with bullets. And over the years the newspaper has suffered waves of harassment ranging from confiscation of its issues to outright threats to advertisers. FÃ©lixâs death is one of 10 cases documented by CPJ over the past decade of Mexican journalists who were murdered in apparent reprisal for their work. In virtually every case, investigations have been incomplete or contradictory, leaving key questions unresolved and leading suspects uninvestigated. Zeta's drama has played out in one of the most contentious and volatile regions of Mexico. In 1989 Baja California was the first state in Mexico to elect an opposition governor, Ernesto Ruffo Appel of the center-right National Action Party, ending the political monopoly of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Blancornelas and Zeta played a pivotal role in this historic political turning point by providing a forum for opposition viewpoints and subjecting previous governments to close investigative scrutiny. In recent years Tijuana has been one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in Mexicoâs ongoing internecine drug war which threatens the countryâs economic and political stability as well as its social fabric. Tijuana was also the site in 1994 of Mexicoâs most traumatic political assassination since the tumultuous aftermath of the 1910 Revolution, when the PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated after a campaign rally in the working class Lomas Taurino neighborhood. Despite the risks, Blancornelas has not been deterred. Largely inspired by his example, a newly empowered generation of independent, well-trained journalists are rejecting the old habits of self-censorship, bribe-taking, and government subsidies to provide the Mexican public with more balanced coverage of the news. In the spirit of the International Press Freedom Awards, whose previous recipients have included the courageous Irish investigative journalist Veronica Guerin, assassinated in June, and other pioneers and guardians of a free press who have risked political persecution and personal hardship, CPJ is honored to give an award this year to Blancornelas. THE UPHILL CLIMB TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT VOICE IN TIJUANA Blancornelas and FÃ©lix launched Zeta soon after losing control of another Tijuana newspaper, ABC, which they had started in 1977. The dailyâs hallmark was in-depth reporting of government corruption. In late 1979, the paper was taken over by a government-controlled labor union in a move orchestrated by Baja Gov. Roberto de la Madrid, a member of the PRI. The takeover occurred after Blancornelas had refused de la Madridâs demand that he fire FÃ©lix, the paperâs star columnist. Fearful that Zeta, which picked up where ABC left off, would be a target of government reprisal, Blancornelas decided to edit and publish the paper from San Diego for a couple of years to avoid a shutdown by Mexican authorities, who controlled a newsprint monopoly. Meanwhile, FÃ©lix stayed in Tijuana, writing irreverent columns about the backroom happenings of social and political life in Baja California. FELIX MURDER ENRAGES MEXICAN PUBLIC In 1988, FÃ©lix, who served as co-editor of Zeta, was assassinated while driving to work along a narrow Tijuana street. Outrage followed his murder. Thousands attended the funeral, and an unusual alliance of Tijuana journalists and political officials demanded justice. They would not allow this murder to be left unsolved as had those of many other Mexican journalists. Two employees of a Tijuana racetrack owned by the son of a powerful PRI politician and power broker were eventually convicted of the shooting, and they are currently serving prison sentences. But authorities never established a motive for the assassination, and it is widely believed the intellectual authors remain at large. In the wake of FÃ©lixâs murder, Blancornelas continued to print his colleagueâs name on the masthead of Zeta and, in each edition, reproduced one of FÃ©lixâs columns opposite a black page that asked,"Who killed me?" In the year following FÃ©lixâs murder, several journalists found their careers threatened when they criticized how the case was being handled. Five reporters were fired from the daily El Herald after they published a special edition critical of the investigation. The five later formed their own weekly journal, Cambio 21. Two radio commentators were given unplanned"vacations" after opening their morning talk shows to callers critical of the police investigation. And other journalists said they felt subtle pressures to tone down coverage of the case. BLANCORNELAS SETS PRECEDENT FOR MEXICAN JOURNALISTS FIGHTING GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF PRESS With both ABC and Zeta, Blancornelas insisted that his newspapers not be beholden to anyone. In an effort to bypass one of the most onerous government controls over the press--a requirement that all newsprint be purchased directly from the Mexican governmentâs newsprint monopoly-- Blancornelas went to San Diego in 1981, and there printed Zeta and exported it to Tijuana. According to Blancornelas, Mexican authorities could not block Zetaâs import because they would have been forced to do the same with U.S. publications entering the country. In 1990, Mexican President Carlos Salinas decided to sell the newsprint monopoly, enabling newspapers to buy newsprint directly from foreign manufacturers. But the lingering fear of government interference remains, and some Mexican newspapers have opted to publish on the U.S. side of the border. Newspapers in Hermosillo, Sonora, for instance, are printed in Tucson, Arizona, and some papers in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, are printed in El Paso, Texas. Blancornelas has also been an inspiring figure for those Mexican journalists eager to break the bribe-taking habits of their predecessors. As late as 1989, it was still common practice for reporters, editors, and columnists to take money from elected officials, government bureaucrats and businessmen in exchange for flattering profiles or uncritical coverage. From Zetaâs founding in 1980, Blancornelas made the paperâs policy clear: bribe-taking is unacceptable. The slightest suspicion of bribe-taking is cause for dismissal, Blancornelas says, and to date no cases have come to light. "[Journalists] make good money here. They donât need it [bribes]," he said. Zetaâs example has helped bring about a sea change in the way Mexican journalists do business and how they view their role. In 1990, Baja California Gov. Ruffo prohibited state officials from offering government bribes to journalists. Former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari enacted a similar policy among his cabinet. As a result, says Blancornelas,"ï¿½ the tradition-bound daily newspapers have no other recourse but to change their tainted politics, speak the truth, and learn to survive through advertising and circulation sales or die." Blancornelasâ refusal to abide by the status quo, which has shackled and silenced Mexicoâs press, has helped myriad publishers, editors, and reporters find the courage to build a free and independent press there. Throughout Mexico, Blancornelas has been recognized as a pioneer, a rare example of courage and independence in the provincial press for more than two decades. |International Press Freedom Awards|| CPJ Website | WT01-B01-102IA023-000251-B021-8http://www.cpj.org:80/awards96/daoud.html 169.132.35.44 19970108114221 text/html 4743HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 11:42:10 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 4572Last-modified: Thu, 14 Nov 1996 21:13:48 GMT International Press Freedom Awards Daoud Kuttab has long challenged the censorship practices of both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority. Kuttab's outspoken criticism of the Palestinian Authority's despotic treatment of journalists and his creative techniques to educate, empower and mobilize independent Palestinian media are driving forces behind efforts to foster independent journalism in the Middle East. IN CONFLICT WITH ISRAELI AUTHORITIES In the 1980s, Kuttab worked as a reporter and later managing editor of the now defunct English-language weekly Al-Fajr, as a reporter and columnist for the Arabic-language East Jerusalem daily Al-Quds, and as a contributor to other papers, among them the Jerusalem Post. During that time, he was arrested, searched, and fingerprinted on several occasions for activities that included participating in public demonstrations against Israeli press censorship and writing about an armed attack by Jewish extremists at the Palestinian University in Hebron. After leaving Al-Fajr, Kuttab went to work for the daily Al-Quds, where he broke many stories on the peace process and was the first Palestinian to conduct exclusive interviews with Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres. KUTTAB CHALLENGES ARAFAT'S CRACKDOWN ON CRITICAL REPORTING AND LEGITIMATE POLITICAL DISSENT Since implementation of the Oslo Accords, Kuttab has been a vocal critic of the anti-democratic impulses of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian Authority president. Arafat's government has dealt despotically with critical reporting and legitimate political dissent, jailing dozens of journalists. In August 1994, Arafat ordered Al-Quds to stop publishing Kuttab's columns after Kuttab led independent journalists in a protest against the banning of Al-Nahar, Jerusalem's only other Arabic-language daily at the time. Al-Quds capitulated and fired Kuttab. But Kuttab has refused to be silenced. He has written op-eds that have appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, International Herald Tribune, Daily Telegraph, and Daily Yomuri. And, as president of the Palestinian Audio-Visual Union, Kuttab has been active in protesting censorship and access violations by the Israelis and the PNA. He is also working with some newly licensed local TV stations, providing journalism training and encouraging television journalists to use whatever latitude they have to report local news independently. INTERNET SITE CREATED BY KUTTAB HELPS FOSTER FREE PRESS In April 1996, as co-director of Internews Middle East--a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization that aims to facilitate the free flow of information by supporting independent journalists and media--Kuttab started the censorship-free Arabic Media Internet Network, a World Wide Web site known as AMIN AMIN's stated mission is "to increase the availability of information to Middle East journalists about their own and neighboring countries, enhancing the flow of information and strengthening the media practitioners' access to it, which will in turn actively promote freedom of the media in the region." The site features a magazine to which Palestinian journalists contribute stories that newspapers and other publications will not carry for fear of official retaliation. Kuttab expects this site to enable other Arabic newspapers in the Middle East to go on-line. In June, Kuttab used the site to mobilize support for Dr. Eyad Sarraj, a human rights activist arrested by the Palestinian Authority for his criticism of Arafat's authoritarian rule. Kuttab posted an open letter from Sarraj to Arafat that no newspaper had been willing to publish. Kuttab's creative and untiring support of press freedom and free expression has played a crucial role in the development of a nascent, independent Palestinian media and has contributed to an expansion of these freedoms elsewhere in the Middle East. |International Press Freedom Awards|| CPJ Website| WT01-B01-103IA023-000251-B021-85http://www.cpj.org:80/awards96/sulz.html 169.132.35.44 19970108114257 text/html 7947HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 11:42:25 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 7776Last-modified: Wed, 13 Nov 1996 16:51:44 GMT International Press Freedom Awards Twenty-five years ago Arthur Ochs Sulzberger made a decision that profoundly strengthened the free American press. He decided that The New York Times should publish portions of the Pentagon Papers, the secret Defense Department history of United States involvement in Vietnam. The series of articles that followed changed the publicâs perception of its government--and, just as important, changed the pressâs view of its role in a democratic society. The pressures on Sulzberger as publisher of The Times were great. The paperâs longtime lawyers told him that he risked criminal prosecution. The Vietnam War was going on, with American soldiers coming back in body bags, and he was an intensely patriotic person. But he decided that the interest of telling Americans the truth about an issue that was dividing the country must prevail: that it was the publicâs right to know and the pressâs duty to report. After the third installment of the series appeared in The Times, the Nixon Administration won a restraining order from a judge: the first prior restraint against newspaper publication ever granted to the federal government. The Supreme Court overturned that restraint in a landmark decision. Justice Hugo L. Black, in his concurring opinion, said that "in revealing the workings of government that led to the Vietnam War," The Times and other newspapers that followed it "nobly did" what the Framers of the Constitution had hoped and expected. PENTAGON PAPERS CASE In June 1971, Sulzberger gave his editors the go-ahead to publish portions of the Pentagon Papers, the classified Defense Department study that revealed that throughout four administrations there had been a much higher level of official commitment to and frustration with the countryâs war efforts in Vietnam than had been publicly acknowledged at the time critical decisions were made. To assess whether the Times would aggravate the problem of government confidentiality by publishing the Pentagon Papers, editors reviewed the many books and articles that had been written by former government officials during the Kennedy and Johnson years. They found that despite the Papersâ "top secret" classification, much of the information contained within them had already been revealed by the former government officials themselves. By deciding to run excerpts of the study, Sulzberger knew that as the Timesâ publisher he risked criminal prosecution for violating espionage laws. But he chose to do so in the interest of revealing to American citizens the extent to which they had been deceived by their government. After the Times printed its third installment of the Pentagon Papers, the Nixon administration cracked down, winning an injunction of prior restraint. If the Times published the remaining articles in its series, the government argued, it would bring "immediate and irreparable harm" to the "national defense interests of the United States and the nationâs security." The Pentagon Papers case went to the Supreme Court, and, in a landmark decision, the Court overturned the restraining order. In a concurring opinion, Justice Hugo L. Black said, "Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government." He added that The New York Times and those that followed it deserved commendation, not condemnation, for their work. The Times later received the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Sulzbergerâs decision to risk government censure and his newspaperâs reputation in the interest of the American public marked a turning point for journalism. The New York Timesâ victory in the Pentagon Papers case sent a clear message that the publicâs right to know can override the governmentâs right to secrecy. SULZBERGERâS CAREER AT THE NEW YORK TIMES Currently the chairman and chief executive officer of The New York Times Company, Sulzberger has spent his entire professional career with the Times, beginning in 1951, except for one year (1953-1954) when he was a reporter for the Milwaukee Journal. After service in the U.S. Marine Corps in both World War II and the Korean War, he worked as a reporter on the Timesâ city staff and as a foreign correspondent in its Paris, Rome, and London bureaus. He was appointed publisher in 1963, upon the death of his brother-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and remained in the post until 1992, when he handed over the reins to his son, then deputy publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr. Sulzberger has also played a leading role in several of the journalism professionâs top associations. He was a director of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau and was chairman from 1974 to 1976. He was a director of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, and served as chairman from 1988 to 1989. (The NAB and ANPA have since merged, and the new organization is called the Newspaper Association of America.) He served as a director of the American Press Institute from 1975 to 1986 and of the Associated Press from 1975 to 1984.

ABOUT THE BURTON BENJAMIN MEMORIAL AWARD The Burton Benjamin Memorial Award is presented to individuals for their lifetime achievement in promoting press freedom. It is named for the late Burton Benjamin, who was senior executive producer at CBS News and served briefly as chair of the Committee to Protect Journalists before his death in 1988. During his 29 years in television, Benjamin worked as a writer for several CBS News programs, including "The 20th Century." He went on to supervise "CBS News Sunday Morning," anchored by Charles Kuralt, and became executive producer of the "CBS Evening News" with Walter Cronkite, who called him "undoubtedly the finest documentary producer with whom I was ever privileged to work." Benjamin is best remembered as the author of the Benjamin Report, which followed his internal probe of the 1982 CBS documentary on the Vietnam War. Benjamin also wrote Fair Play: CBS, General Westmoreland, and How a Television Documentary Went Wrong. Previous recipients of the Burton Benjamin Memorial Award are Walter Cronkite, CBS News; Katharine Graham, The Washington Post Company; R.E. (Ted) Turner, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.; George Soros, The Soros Foundations; and Ben Bradlee, The Washington Post. |International Press Freedom Awards|| CPJ Website | WT01-B01-104IA023-000251-B021-262http://www.cpj.org:80/pubs/regionalreports/bosnia96/breport.html 169.132.35.44 19970108114424 text/html 29231HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 11:43:37 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 29059Last-modified: Fri, 06 Dec 1996 20:41:13 GMT CPJ Press Freedom Briefing |CPJ Website| Bosnia information links | Briefing Paper on Press Freedom In Bosnia And Herzegovina Before the September 14th Elections The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonpartisan, nongovernmental organization based in the United States, is dedicated to defending the rights of journalists around the world. Since the Dayton Peace Accords, the treaty that ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was negotiated in Dayton, Ohio, and signed in Paris in December, 1995, CPJ has been concerned about compliance, by all parties, with the terms of the agreement as they affect journalists. OBLIGATIONS TO ENSURE PRESS FREEDOM ASSUMED BY DAYTON PARTIES Bosnia's constitution guarantees freedom of movement throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina and states that freedom of movement shall not be impeded (Art. 1.4). Freedom of expression is also guaranteed (Art. 2.h). Annex 6 of the Dayton Accords contains an Agreement on Human Rights which affirms freedom of expression (Art.1.8) and the right to liberty of movement and residence (Art. 1.13). In addition, the parties to the Dayton Accords have signed a document titled "Agreed Measures on Dayton Accords Compliance," dated March 18, 1996, which states: "Access to electronic and print media for all recognized political groupings is an absolute prerequisite for successful elections and for the building of a viable constitutional order" (Point 1). The parties agreed to disseminate standards to enable journalists to perform their professional duties and for governments to issue licenses and frequencies fairly (Point 7). In July, prior to the start of political campaigning for Sept. 14 general elections, the parties agreed to a document titled "Regulations Concerning the Obligations of Governments in Relation to the Media in Bosnia and Herzegovina," a supplement to the Dayton Accords. The document states that "the Governments will permit journalists to enjoy complete freedom of movement and unhindered pursuit of their professional activities throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. Journalists who are citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina shall exercise this right on the basis of an indentification card issued by their media organization or by an appropriate professional association. Accreditation cards will be identical in both Entities, and will only state the name of the journalist, the specific media...and should include a photograph. Foreign journalists shall exercise their rights on the basis of accreditation already issued by the appropriate authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina or to be issued in the future by the OSCE [intergovernmental Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe] Media Experts Commission and such accreditation will be valid in the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina." (Art. 125). Article 126 guarantees that journalists "will not be subject to detention, harassment or interference in pursuit of their legitimate activities." Article 127 states that the governments "will ensure that licenses and frequencies for electronic and printed media are granted expeditiously, on the basis of objective non-political criteria, in order to ensure that all political parties and candidates in the elections have equitable access to the media." The supplemental agreement also contains "Standards for Professional Conduct for the Media and Journalists," such as the injunctions "to make a clear distinction between factual reporting and editorial comment" (Art. 128); "to ensure that the information they report is factually accurate, complete, fair, equitable and unbiased" (Art. 130); "to avoid distortion, suppression, falsification, misrepresentation and censorship"; and "to avoid language which encourages discrimination, ridicule, prejudice or hatred" (Art. 133). CPJ notes that like all press laws, these "standards," arrogantly flouted by state-sponsored media, are difficult to define and adjudicate and actually become cudgels in the hands of governments determined to suppress independent media. GENERAL MEDIA CLIMATE: TOTAL STATE CONTROL All major television and radio stations are controlled by regional authorities and their ruling parties in each ethnically determined "entity" of Bosnia: the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Sarajevo-based government); the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Muslim-Croat Federation including the Croat-controlled "mini-state" of Herzeg-Bosna) and the Republika Srpska (Serb Republic), the Bosnian Serb enclave. Correspondents describe conditions in Republika Srpska and Herzeg-Bosna as particularly severe. Although election rules require access by opposition candidates, quite typical is the announcement of SRT (Serb Radio-Television) in late July that it would simply no longer give air time to political parties "deemed unpatriotic" by editors. According to the Aug. 14 report of the International Crisis Group (ICG), SRT in Republika Srpska announced frankly that "Political parties and coalitions that think that they will generate support from viewers through lies and still take part in the pre-election campaign, must expect to be pulled from the screen of [Bosnian] Serb television." When representatives of the Party for Democratic Action (SDA) of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic appeared on a nightly 90-minute program supposedly set aside for other political parties, SRT's television screen went blank for 14 minutes then switched to pop-music videos. Even if stations go through the motion of creating timeslots for the opposition, these opportunities are used by the ruling parties to ridicule their competition, or else the program will be disrupted by a fortuitous power outage. The Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) and Media Plan (MP) have documented copious examples of "strategic omissions," "outright character assassinations," and "preferential treatment of political patrons." Independent or opposition newspapers are reduced to limited circulation, such as the daily Oslobodjenje in Sarajevo or the fortnightly Novi prelom in Banja Luka, with runs of 10,000 and 5,000, respectively. While publications can be found in kiosks, people still find the purchase of a newspaper a luxury in postwar Bosnia. Editors in one entity are prevented from distributing their newspapers in another and it is rare to find even opposition publications willing to cross boundaries. Broadcast journalists told CPJ that the process for obtaining licenses was "sheer anarchy." Regulations are contradictory or unclear, officials corrupt, and authorities reluctant to cede their monopolies. Even independent television or radio stations that have obtained permission to broadcast experience disruptions. According to IWRP, Hyde Park, the popular call-in talk show broadcast twice a week by Sarajevo's independent radio station Studio 99, has repeatedly complained of lines going dead when listeners attempt to discuss controversial issues. On June 4, when the topic was the existence of two armies in the Muslim-Croat Federation and on June 6, before a scheduled debate on plans to send an official Bosnian delegation to Belgrade for negotiations on establishment of relations with Serbia, the lines went dead. Radio Zid, an independent radio station in Sarajevo, told CPJ that its listeners began complaining in August that they could no longer tune in to the station. In its place, they were hearing a new officially sponsored station, Orthodox Radio St. John, broadcasting out of Republika Srpska. Editors at Radio Zid discovered that Radio St. John was using its frequency, 89.9. At first Radio Zid increased its kilowattages but it received a letter from the commander of IFOR (the Peace Implementation Force) saying that Zid was interfering with military communications. The radio station then appealed to the OSCE, but was told that the OSCE could not stop the Serb station from broadcasting. Next, radio executives appealed to the Bosnian Ministry of Culture to give them a new, as yet unused frequency, 89.7, but they have received no answer. The station is now publicly appealing to the international community to intercede on its behalf so that its audience can once again receive Radio Zid's broadcast signal. Radio St. John was founded by, among others, Sonja Karadzic, daughter of Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader and indicted war criminal who was forced to step down from public office. Sonja Karadzic reportedly has invested heavily in the station, now broadcasting on nine frequencies. Sonja Karadzic is the head of the International Press Center in Pale, which has come under fire from foreign and domestic correspondents for charging exorbitant accreditation fees. International monitors fear that another newly established radio station in Srpska Republika, Radio Drina, with far less technical ability and financial support than Radio St. John, will also be drowned out. IN-TV, known as "Carl Bildt TV" after the High Representative of the international community, has been plagued with difficulties in staffing and financing the $11 million project . But the chief obstacle has been the Bosnian government's refusal to amend a law that prevents the linkage of private stations' frequencies into a network or using several transmission points to provide wider reception. The New York Times reported on Aug. 28 that police surrounded the space leased in Sarajevo for the station's central studios and prevented entry. Although the studios were moved to another building, Bosnian officials warned the new landlord not to cooperate with the station. Furthermore, according to foreign officials, some of the five independent stations are being harassed by local authorities. In a conversation with CPJ's chair Kati Marton on Sept. 2, High Representative Bildt said that IN-TV would begin broadcasting on Sept. 7. He acknowledged difficulties for the station in reaching rural areas and expressed concern about the need to keep the station functioning long after the elections. Local journalists told CPJ they were skeptical of Bildt's efforts to piece together a station out of five existing independent stations, all weak, without sufficient experience and personnel. "Many of the best journalists have left the country," said one who remained. The project was not being taken seriously, others said, because it was widely believed that the signal could not reach Republika Srpska, and would therefore have little impact where it was needed. According to the International Crisis Group, the network is based on five essentially Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) stations and broadcasts from Sarajevo. This one-sided approach necessitated by local realities is likely to undermine the project's impact on Bosnian Serb and Croat-controlled territory. An American documentary filmmaker close to the project said there would be satellite uplinks that would enable people with satellite dishes to receive the broadcast. But a European monitor claimed that the satellite would enable the stations only to communicate with one another, not to expand their audience. He acknowledged that an estimated 10 percent of the population in Serb territory own the dish antennas and could in theory receive the signal. IN-TV is "tinkering around the margins, however powerful a medium [it is]; it is not going to singlehandedly redress all the grievances and imbalances," said the European observer. In any event, the tinkering will come too late, with the station coming on the air only a week before the elections. ATTACKS ON MEDIA AND JOURNALISTS Widely reported interethnic violence, increasing again before the elections, has spilled over to journalists covering controversial issues and the campaigns of opposition parties. Several notorious incidents late last year and after the onset of the campaign in July have had a chilling effect on reporters. In December 1995, Senad Avdic, editor of the independent weekly Sarajevo magazine Slobodna Bosna, was assaulted by unidentified thugs after publishing an article critical of the government, editors told CPJ. The magazine is known for its anti-nationalist stance and sensational corruption stories, based on reports from police and intelligence sources, Western monitors said. On Aug. 15 or 16, 1996, Nedzad Mulahuseinovic, a schoolteacher in the town of Tesanj, close to Serb territory, was severely beaten by unidentified assailants. Nedzad Mulahuseinovic is married to Azenina Mulahuseinovic, the correspondent in this Muslim-controlled town for the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje, her colleagues at the newspaper told CPJ. Azenina had reported several stories about the harassment of local opposition political parties, including the beating of a local leader of the UBSD (United Bosnian Social Democrat) party two months ago. Her editors believed that the targeting of her husband was related to her coverage of the pre-election violence. Mato Bikic, a correspondent for ONASA, the news agency affiliated with Oslobodjenje, was beaten in Tuzla on Oct. 6, 1995, according to Bikic's colleagues. Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF) said the suspect in the beating is a journalist from Zmaj od Bosne, a newspaper close to the radical wing of the local branch of the SDA, Izetbegovic's party. CPJ has also received well-documented allegations of dismissals of journalists for ethnic or political reasons, although the victims are unwilling to go on the record for fear of retaliation. Authorities have also moved to ban media that refuse to submit to state control. The OSCE-sponsored Free Election Radio Network (FERN) headquarters in Sarajevo told CPJ that the Bosnian Serb Transport and Communications Ministry had forbidden FERN from using its transmitter, located on Mount Kozora, to broadcast to Banja Luka and the surrounding area. At the request of Bosnian Serb officials, FERN had sought permission to broadcast from the Ministry but was refused the right on Aug. 12. The Ministry then banned the station on Aug. 15 for using a transmitter without permission. FERN employees told CPJ that they continue to broadcast and that the transmitter in question is protected by IFOR forces. FERN also said that the Bosnian Serb administration has not proceeded with any further action since FERN ignored the ban and listeners still receive the signal. OBSTRUCTION OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT By all accounts, the greatest factor affecting press freedom is the absence of freedom of movement . The population's overwhelming tendency is to remain in their own ethnic enclaves because of stories of violent reprisals against those who endeavor to return to their hometowns. As a Sarajevo-based journalist told CPJ, "The political divison in the country makes the job of our journalists impossible on the territories of Republika Srpska or Herzeg-Bosna." "Local journalists do not even take advantage of the rare opportunities afforded them on trips organized by the OSCE and IFOR,"explained an international monitor. RSF has described some heavily guarded field trips across borders organized for journalists by the international community, mainly to attend OSCE press conferences. Adnan Sarajlic, head of Radio Zid in Sarajevo, complained, "Because it's impossible to go to Republika Srpska without the international organizations, journalists can only meet officials. Obviously, what interests us is to talk to the residents." Zoran Ilic, deputy head of Sarajevo's Studio 99, also expressed his frustration at not being able to "do a normal report by meeting the inhabitants of the city rather than local and international officials." The Croat-controlled "mini-state" of Herzeg-Bosna was supposed to be dismantled by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman by the end of August, but reporters told CPJ that a disbanding would be meaningless. "Although we expect a dismantling soon, we will still be dealing with the very same Croat authorities," said a news director convinced that freedom of movement for Muslims in Croat-controlled territory would not improve soon. Journalists told CPJ that local news media have gotten around freedom of movement restrictions by maintaining telephone and, to a smaller extent, electronic mail connections with stringers in local villages who attempt to cover opposition campaigns. Journalists sometimes become more vulnerable to violence when they are far from their news organizations' headquarters (see Mulahuseinovic case above). Under the terms of agreements about working conditions for journalists, accreditation is supposed to contain only the name of the correspondent and his or her news organization. But in Bosnia, where every transaction, public and private, is defined by ethnicity, people are skilled at decoding ethnic origin just from names or photographs. Many independent local reporters do not have cars at their disposal in the devastated postwar country. The license plates of private automobiles can denote the ethnicity of passengers because the letters indicate the towns of origin of the vehicles. On July 5, 1995, in Usce on the bridge near the Serb-controlled town of Doboj, two Serb journalists from the fortnightly Alternativa -- Bosko Jelic and Aco Sakota -- were attacked and roughed up by unidentified Bosnian Muslims who came from the Muslim-Croat Federation. The bridge at the "Inter-Entity Border Line" (IEBL), as the line between the two ethnic enclaves is known, had been recently reopened. The reporters' car, a red Yugo with license place DO-1262, which shows that the car is from Doboj, was damaged. Journalists at the scene charge that IFOR troops present "did nothing." IFOR told a foreign reporter that they were aware that some beatings took place when 130 people crossed the bridge from the Federation. A checkpoint has now been established at the bridge and the story of the beaten journalists has become legendary, cited by many correspondents interviewed by CPJ as the reason they would not engage in efforts to cross the IEBL. Foreign journalists report that while IFOR press passes are generally honored and cars with foreign or OSCE license plates allowed to pass, authorities in Republika Srpska are demanding a separate credential obtainable only from the government's International Press Center in Pale. Frank Havlicek, Vice President of Industrial Relations and Environmental Services for The Washington Post, discovered in June that Press Center officials were charging 20 DM (US $30) for a seven-day press pass and 100 DM (US $150) for "services," pressuring foreign journalists to accept the translation and escort services of a "bodyguard" who functioned as the government's informer. Ostensibly the purpose of the bodyguard is to look out for the numerous land mines remaining in the region. Journalists who refused the service, however, such as a Finnish television crew interviewed by Havlicek, were pursued and harassed by a Press Center employee sent to enforce the rules. RSF reported that Francoise Michel of the French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) and Carsten Hoffmann of the German news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) were informed by Serb officials in April that they were not authorized to work in Republika Srpska because they had failed to obtain accreditation from the International Press Center. Michel reported that an English-language AFP colleague who failed to obtain permission to cover a visit by High Representative Bildt in Pale in mid-May was stopped and reprimanded by police. DPA's Hoffman did obtain accreditation from the Pale Center, but when he asked for authorization to travel to Srebrenica, site of the widely reported Serb massacre of Muslims, he was refused. Other foreign reporters, including Americans from major news media, told CPJ they simply circumvented the Pale International Press Center in order to avoid its restrictions, and took their chances in the field without passes or escorts. While foreign journalists have more access with their foreign plates and IFOR passes, their interpreters can instantly meet roadblocks when they go "in the other direction." For example, a Serb translator will be needed to get around Republika Srpska; yet attempting to enter non-Serb areas will place the interpreter at risk. A Western reporter traveling with a Serb interpreter from a major newspaper reported incidents of being stopped by Croat policemen and told not to go into certain areas because "fighting is going on," although that was not always the case. The news team was also stopped by Muslim police because the translator was a Serb. Although stopped while attempting to report on the postelection scene in Mostar in the Muslim-Croat Federation, the reporter and translator did not turn back. On most occasions presentation of IFOR and foreign press credentials and vows to publicize incidents of obstruction of the press were enough to gain passage, but the reporter avoided risk to the interpreter by staying away from non-Serb areas. RSF learned that Austrian journalist Gregor Mayer, assigned to Bosnia by the magazine Profil, and his interpreter Zoltan Nemeth, a journalist from Novi Sad, Serbia, were refused passage within Republika Srpska in late April. A border guard showed Mayer a list containing his name and purportedly those of other journalists banned from Serb territory, and then sent the reporters away, saying they did not have the necessary accreditation from the International Press Center in Pale. Several days later, when the pair were investigating suspected massacres of Bosnian Muslims in eastern Bosnia, Serb police forced them to return to the border. SHORT-TERM DETENTIONS The ease with which journalists were arrested and falsely accused early in the year, despite the Dayton agreement's guarantee of freedom of movement, and the slowness of the responses by OSCE, discouraged many reporters from travel and made them skeptical of the ability of the international community to come to their aid. On Feb. 8, 1996, Srdjan Ilic, an Associated Press (AP) photographer based in Belgrade, Serbia, and Hidajet Delic-Degi, a photographer who works for the Bosnian news agency BH Press and AP, were detained on a bridge in the no-man's-land between entity checkpoints. Serb police told Delic-Degi "we're looking for people like you." The pair were taken to the Grbavica district in Sarajevo, under Serb control at the time, then to Serb police headquarters in Pale. Ilic was released the next day, but Delic-Degi, who was carrying negatives of photographs taken in Bosnian President Izetbegovic's office, was kept in detention. Bosnian Serb authorities accused Delic-Degi of having served in the Bosnian government's army in 1992 and of having ordered the murder of a Serb that summer. Delic-Degi's colleagues at AP's Belgrade office informed CPJ that the accusations were false and that Delic-Degi was exempted from military service because of his work at AP. For five days the Bosnian Journalists Association and the Union of Independent Professional Journalists of Bosnia and Herzegovina boycotted their coverage of all activities of High Representative Bildt and OSCE Chief of Mission, U.S. Ambassador Robert Frowick. A group of some 100 journalists demonstrated outside the offices of the High Representative and demanded international intervention. On March 25, Delic-Degi was set free in Pale, less than 24 hours after a Serb reporter, Ninko Djuric, was released by the Bosnian government. Djuric, who works for the Pale-based Bosnian Serb weekly Javnost, had been arrested on Sept. 10, 1995, during fighting at Mount Ozren. No reasons were given for his arrest. CPJ protested the use of noncombatant journalists in prison-of-war exchanges. Srecko Latal, a Bosnian journalist working for AP, was detained on March 29. Latal had been attacked by a crowd of Serbs when he went to investigate clashes between Serbs and Bosnian police near Sarajevo. The crowd then forced Latal into a Serb police car. At this point, Italian soldiers with IFOR reportedly intervened and took Latal out of the Serb police car. The soldiers searched him, took him inside an armored personnel carrier, handcuffed him, and returned him to the Serb police, despite the fact that an Agence-France Presse reporter at the scene shouted that Latal was a member of the press. Latal was released three hours later in Serb-held Lukavica. In a letter to IFOR, CPJ protested the Italian soldiers' treatment of Latal. NO KILLINGS, DISAPPEARANCES, OR IMPRISONMENT But Unsolved Cases Remain In the four years of the wars in the former Yugoslavia (1991-1995), 45 journalists were confirmed by CPJ as killed in the line of duty. At least 15 were not killed accidentally in crossfire, but deliberately targeted by assassins. Since the signing of the Dayton Accords on Dec. 14, 1995, and the end of the Bosnian war, there have been no reports of journalists killed or missing. Yet the murders of those killed during the war or missing and presumed dead remain unsolved. To date, not a single killer of a journalist has been brought to justice. Sasha Kolevski, a cameraman for SRT (Bosnian Serb television) in Banja Luka, and Goran Pejcinovic, the station's driver, disappeared on Sept. 23, 1995, while covering fighting on Mount Ozren in Serb-controlled territory. According to an SRT reporter who was riding with them at the time of the incident, Bosnian troops shot at their vehicle, seriously wounding or killing Kolevski and Pejcinovic. The body of Pejcinovic was returned to Bosnian Serb authorities on Oct. 25. CPJ is still trying to establish what happened to Kolevski, at the request of his colleagues. There are currently no reports of journalists convicted and imprisoned or held in detention for a prolonged period. Two cases from before the war remain under investigation. Frane Jezidzicic, a Bosnian Muslim correspondent in central Bosnia for the Croatian daily Slovodna Dalmacija, was arrested on July 18, 1993, by Bosnian Serb soldiers near Bugojno. He was reported as being still in prison at the end of 1994. No news of his current status has been available. Alojzij Krivograd, a Slovenian freelance photographer working for United Press International, AP, and other international news agencies was arrested on Sept. 10, 1992 while walking from Gorazde to Foca. According to the Slovenian Foreign Minister, he was detained by Serbs in Foca. The International Committee of the Red Cross has declared him missing. ***** This report was prepared by Catherine A.

U.S.-backed insurgents who had toppled Soviet-backed dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam four years before had just held elections to legitimize their rule. Tesfaye's* paper, Beza, ran cartoons lampooning members of the new government as a submissive soccer team dominated by a newly elected, U.S.-sponsored prime minister, Meles Zenawi. The following week, Tesfaye didn't let up. He ran a joke depicting the newly elected president, Negasso Gidada, as a puppet of Meles, who had been an insurgent leader. Listing the names of the favorite horses of Ethiopian rulers, past and present, the joke said Meles' favorite horse was Negasso. "That was not funny," Hagos Debesse, a top Justice Ministry official, told a mission from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) in May 1996. He was trying to explain why the government had responded to Tesfaye's editorial irreverence by throwing him into jail. But it is the situation for journalists in Ethiopia that is not funny. In fact, it verges on the tragic. Despite hopes that Ethiopia would finally throw off centuries of repression with the fall of the Derg, as Mengistu's murderous regime was called, this isolated, mountainous African country has become one of the world's most frequent jailers of journalists. Alarmed by this trend, CPJ sent a two-person delegation that spent two weeks last May interviewing scores of journalists, government officials, and diplomats in Addis Ababa. We wanted to find out how the new Ethiopian government's promises of press freedom had gone wrong, to seek a way to reverse the trend, to bring attention to the situation, and to urge the country's leaders to trust a free press. The team consisted of Africa Program Coordinator Kakuna Kerina and myself. I had reported from Ethiopia in the 1980s for Newsday. Kakuna had spent time in Addis with her family during their political exile from Namibia. Kakuna's documented report of our visit and of the individual cases of jailed journalists follows this introduction. We found that, like everything else in Ethiopia, one of the most misunderstood countries in the world, the press scene is more complex and nuanced than we had anticipated: From 1993 to 1995, Ethiopia imprisoned more journalists than any other country in Africa, jailing more than 50, of whom 31 were behind bars at the end of last year. Even with the spectre of jail, independent journalism still flourishes in Addis Ababa, although government repression of distribution stops most papers at the city's edge. Working with sparse budgets and outdated technology, home-grown independent journalists dedicated to telling the story turn out publications ranging from the lurid and satirical to the bland and objective. Newsboys, themselves reportedly thrown into jail on occasion, hawk these newspapers and magazines on the street corners of downtown Addis. But repression is taking its toll. The guarantees of a free press proclaimed by Ethiopia's new rulers when they marched into Addis Ababa have degenerated into suspicion and punishment. Optimistic journalists who had responded exuberantly to the promised freedoms are disillusioned, confused, and prone to censor themselves. The Ethiopian government, having belatedly realized the implications of a free press, which it had promised in order to please potential Western donors, has instituted a powerful and unpredictably enforced new press law--sometimes waiting more than half a year to prosecute journalists. Many new publications have been driven out of business by large fines and bond requirements. It is unfair to put all of the blame for this sad turn of events on Ethiopia alone. It, after all, has no experience with a free press. We in the West have also let down Ethiopia's fledgling independent journalists. --The United States, captivated by the new government's pledge to counter the spread of militant Islam from neighboring Sudan, has done little more than emit a few ritual clucking sounds at the repression of journalists, while continuing to give Ethiopia the second highest amount of U.S. aid allocated to sub-Saharan Africa. --Western journalists have virtually ignored the plight of their colleagues in Addis Ababa, focusing in their rare visits to Ethiopia on the new government's Nuremberg-style trials of leaders of the Derg. --With a few exceptions, Western groups devoted to helping the press have devoted scant resources to Ethiopia compared with their investment of time and money in other newly freed countries, especially in Eastern Europe. Press rights groups have overlooked the problems of so-called moderate journalists, generally focusing on the most outspoken anti-government publications. What does Ethiopia offer the United States to induce it to ignore the lack of a free press its own journalists enjoy? One clue was a visit by CIA Director John Deutsch, who had preceded us by just days, presumably with matters other than press freedom on his mind. Ethiopia belongs to a small club of countries whose strategic location on the edge of the Middle East attracts U.S. patronage and support--although the end of the Cold War has diminished their leverage. (One of those countries, Turkey, is among the few nations to jail more journalists than Ethiopia.) Located in what one State Department official calls "a bad neighborhood," the Horn of Africa, a pro-U.S. Ethiopia gives Washington a window on Sudan and Somalia, and proximity to strategic routes between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Emperor Haile Selassie, an autocratic ruler, had welcomed U.S. military installations. But when the Derg deposed the emperor in the 1970s, Ethiopia moved into the Soviet camp. The Reagan administration struck back by encouraging insurgent movements among restive Ethiopian ethnic groups who resented a central government controlled by the Amharas, who have traditionally been in charge. Among them were the Tigreans, who dominate the present government, and the neighboring Eritreans, who seceded with the acquiescence of the new government after it took power. Millions died from the famine of the 1980s, which was exacerbated by the civil war that had plagued the country for more than 20 years. Armed by the Soviets, the Derg repressed both its enemies and ordinary citizens. During a period called the Red Terror, many intellectuals were dragged from their homes and shot to death, their survivors forced to reimburse the government for the cost of the execution bullets to retrieve the victims' bodies. When the Tigrean-led Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) marched into Addis Ababa in 1991, they pledged that Ethiopians would finally be able to live freely. But, according to one insider, promises to comply with international pacts guaranteeing such things as press freedom were made casually just to please potential Western donors. Ethiopia was in dire need of help to rebuild after the civil war, as well as alleviate chronic food shortages and cope with an exploding population of 55 million that is expected to double by the year 2025. Those casual pledges led to unexpected consequences. After years of repression under Mengistu's Marxist regime, independent journalists flooded the streets with newspapers. Reporting was minimal. Sourceless stories spoke of sensational government conspiracies and attacked the new leaders and their families. Personal scores were settled in print. It was not unlike what had occurred in Russia and Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union, where rumor and gossip had often been the only source of news. The most popular private newspaper was, and probably still is, Tobia. It was started almost immediately after the fall of the Derg by a group of former Ministry of Information officials and employees, most of them Amhara. The lively reporting of Tobia and other private papers reminded readers how boring the government-controlled press was, with its uncritical, stenographic reports of government pronouncements. That officials of the Derg's Information Ministry were attacking them and showing up their own journalists unsettled the new leaders. Then emissaries of well-meaning but sometimes patronizing foreign organizations began to arrive with offers of training and money to buy modern word processing and broadcasting equipment, but only if the government gave up control of such institutions as the Ethiopian News Agency. This isn't the way things are supposed to work in Ethiopia, which has repelled colonial domination for centuries, its population isolated on mountain plateaus thousands of feet high. Foreigners are not supposed to tell Ethiopians what to do. Indeed, Ethiopian rulers have purposefully imported technology cautiously and slowly over the past century to avoid too much Western influence. Few foreigners understand the nuances of Ethiopian culture, where language is so subtle that, unless couched properly, praise can be insulting. Most outsiders know only one side of Ethiopia--Addis Ababa, a modern city with an explosively growing mass of urban poor dominated by a mostly Amharic, educated elite. Few see the countryside, where other ethnic groups live, often the way their ancestors did a century ago, sometimes even a millennium ago. Prime Minister Meles, Parliament Speaker Davit Yohannes, and Justice Minister Mahteme Solomon, who gave lengthy interviews to the CPJ mission, depicted themselves as beset not only by legitimate journalists but by political opponents hiding behind the press. Westerners could not understand that such publications were deliberately printing erroneous and provocative stories to drive the country into Rwanda-style ethnic anarchy, they suggested. In what would probably come as a shock to Bill Clinton, Meles called the Addis independent press "the most critical" in the world. In October 1992, the Meles government came up with an ingenious solution that allows it to continue to claim to the West that there is no prepublication censorship in Ethiopia, while retaining the power to jail journalists it does not like. It devised a truly arbitrary press law under which scores of editors, publishers, and reporters have been hauled into jail for periods ranging from a few days of questioning to more than a year behind bars. The law gives wide latitude to police, prosecutors, and judges to jail journalists on charges of encouraging ethnic strife or violence, or insulting the military or leaders of the country. One particularly clever Catch-22 clause of the law criminalizes erroneous stories, despite the refusal of government agencies to provide information or interviews to independent reporters, or to permit them to attend government press conferences or travel in the provinces. CPJ labored mightily to figure out how the law is implemented. But how and why people are thrown into jail remains a somewhat mysterious process. The result is clear, however. Many journalists are driven out of business by having to pay prohibitively expensive bond to stay out of jail. The very vagueness of the law induces self-censorship. Sections of the law that were intended to privatize the press remain unimplemented, giving the government further control. Parliament has not nominated members of the semi-autonomous boards that are supposed to take over government-controlled radio, television, newspapers, and the national news agency. But it is expected to do so when it reconvenes in October 1996, government officials insist. Implementation of a law authorizing private broadcasting, however, is likely to take at least two more years. The government's clampdown on the press, combined with the unwillingness of private and government journalists to put aside their differences and work together, has thwarted previous foreign-funded attempts to help Ethiopian journalists improve their craft. There are a few exceptions--some British consultants and a few isolated American diplomats are still plugging away. But the government has made it clear it intends to maintain control. The bleak situation has obscured the encouraging appearance of several independent publications that are trying to improve reporting quality and coverage of all sides of the story. They have even published some impressive investigative pieces on official corruption. Upon visiting Addis, CPJ discovered a growing variety of publications--in Amharic or English, which most educated people read--that are staffed by journalists who are neither pro- nor anti-government. These newly emerging, so-called moderate journalists are caught in a sort of limbo. They do not want to belong to the association of journalists working for the government press, and most do not seem comfortable with the Ethiopian Free Press Journalists' Association, which is controlled by journalists from avowedly anti-government newspapers. Many journalists we encountered wish that foreign journalists would come to Ethiopia to teach them professional reporting, editing, and publishing techniques. But because their two journalism associations refuse to cooperate with each other, the journalists are unwittingly undermining themselves. So complete was the Derg's elimination of a civil society that international donors cannot find a neutral Ethiopian institution to house training programs, a media center equipped with computers and a library, or the like. If only the two associations merged into one, donors could use the new group as a local partner. The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) has dropped ambitious plans to help Ethiopian journalists. For the past three years, AID money allocated to "democratize" Ethiopia has been diverted from media to other projects such as election reform, according to AID sources. One sad clue to the virtual U.S. abandonment of independent journalists in Ethiopia is the privately donated press library that has been gathering dust for three years on an inaccessible shelf in AID's Addis Ababa office. Other foreign agencies and foundations have also muted their support of a free press, in part because of government demands that it control their efforts. One of the only exceptions to the pattern is a project to modernize Ethiopian TV by the Overseas Development Administration, the British AID equivalent. So what is the moral of this complicated story? We obviously have what can be called a failure to communicate. One could make a case that the Ethiopian government is inadvertently repelling potential support for its newly freed press by demanding too much control of foreign help--or that it is doing so deliberately. And one could make a case that Western governments, especially Washington, are inadvertently failing to push for a free press in Ethiopia out of ignorance or inefficiency--or that they are doing so deliberately because the desire for influence in the Horn of Africa exceeds their belief that others should have the same rights their own citizens enjoy. But it is obvious that Ethiopian journalists are getting short shrift. Don't they deserve the same support the West gives journalists in Eastern Europe? Ethiopia, after all, was also a Soviet client. Ethiopian journalists are desperate for contact with the rest of the world--to improve their techniques, to become more professional, to make their country known to the rest of the world, and to protect the belated arrival of a free press in the home of one of the world's most ancient civilizations. *On second reference Ethiopians are referred to by the first of their names (c) 1996 Committee Protect Journalists |Index|CPJ Website| WT01-B01-107IA023-000251-B021-475http://www.cpj.org:80/pubs/regionalreports/ethiopia/clamp.html 169.132.35.44 19970108114600 text/html 6841HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 11:45:49 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 6670Last-modified: Thu, 10 Oct 1996 13:26:25 GMT CPJ Press Freedom Briefing Clampdown in Addis Ethiopiaâs Journalists at Risk by Kakuna Kerina After centuries of feudal rule, 17 years of communist dictatorship, almost three decades of civil war, and no tradition of an independent press before 1992, Ethiopia is at a crossroads. As one of the African continentâs youngest exercises in democracy, Ethiopia can serve as an example of a true democracy--one that does not sacrifice freedom of expression and human rights as its leaders establish order. Or, it can join the ranks of neighbors whose leaders assumed office promising respect for press freedom and other civil rights, but who have since broken these and other pledges. As things stand today, Ethiopiaâs independent journalists and the government of Meles Zenawi, the countryâs first freely elected prime minister, eye each other with mutual suspicion and distrust. Journalists labor under a restrictive press law and penal code, and, as a result, more journalists have been jailed in Ethiopia in the past three years than in any other African country. The Committee to Protect Journalists embarked on a fact-finding mission to Ethiopia in May 1996 to better understand how and why the press law and other legal measures are used against journalists. Following the fall of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariamâs communist regime in 1991 and encouraged by assurances of press freedom by the newly installed Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE), a vociferous independent media exploded into existence, signaling what many hoped would be the end of tight government control over information. One of the first acts of the TGE, led by then-President Meles*, was passage of the Press Proclamation No. 34/1992 in October 1992. The law quickly put an end to the euphoria that fueled the countryâs new era of free speech as journalists realized how vulnerable they were under the proclamation, which is both restrictive and contradictory. The legislation prohibits, among other things, the dissemination of information the government deems dangerous, and requires the licensing of all journalists. Moreover, it classifies libel as both a criminal and civil offense, demanding penalties of payment in the amount of twice the value of a publisherâs assets. Criminal libel laws or indeed any statutes intended or used to insulate government officials from press criticism through the application of civil or criminal penalties have no place in democratic societies. The right to speak freely without fear of government reprisal is a core principle of democracy, and critical reporting must be tolerated and protected, not criminalized. In late 1993, reeling from criticism from a growing number of newspapers and magazines about state policies and the political transition under way, the government cracked down on the press, starting with the detention of Tefera Asmare, editor of the independent newspaper Etiopis. In connection with an article titled "Thereâs War in Gondar," Tefera was charged with "inciting people against the government" and "disseminating false rumors," under Article 10, Section 2 of the Press Proclamation. Tefera was later charged with 11 counts of libel under the press law; five counts were for the same story carried in different editions of Etiopis. In March 1994, he was convicted of all charges and sentenced to a two-year prison term. He was released on Sept. 27, 1995. The irony of Teferaâs arrest was that he was legally carrying out his responsibilities as a journalist according to the Press Proclamationâs Art. 4, Sec. 2, which states that "the press gathers and disseminates news; expresses opinions on various issues; forwards criticisms on various issues; participates in forming public opinion by employing various other methods; [and] undertakes other activities necessary for the accomplishment of its purposes." Teferaâs case is emblematic of the double bind imposed on independent Ethiopian journalists--he is one of more than 50 who have been imprisoned for their work since 1993. By simultaneously using ambiguous articles of the Press Proclamation and provisions of the civil, penal, and criminal codes, many of which were created in the 1950s, the Meles government has put the media on notice that it will not hesitate to manipulate the laws to suit its own ends. Ethiopia, which is a signatory to several regional and international charters guaranteeing press freedom, such as the African Charter on Human and Peopleâs Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), has rapidly become a country where reality belies the governmentâs public proclamations about the need for a free press. Contradictory statements by government officials illuminate this gap between rhetoric and policy. "A free press is an essential ingredient of any democratic exercise [because it provides] information to the public so they can make informed decisions," Prime Minister Meles told CPJâs mission. During the same meeting, however, he also said that the government has to impose restrictions on the media to stave off ethnic strife and threats to national security. The stance that Prime Minister Melesâ administration chooses to adopt toward the independent press in the coming years will have significant repercussions. The existence of a free press in Ethiopia is dependent upon a clear commitment from the government to support the development of private media and to lift restrictions on reporting and private-sector competition. Ethiopia cannot claim to be a genuine democracy, nor should it be treated as one by Western donors such as the United States, unless the Meles government ceases its practice of subjecting independent journalists to repeated arrests, detention without trial, and excessive fines. *On second reference, Ethiopians are referred to by the first of their names.

Journalists are granted certain rights by the Press Proclamation; yet at the same time the vagueness of these guarantees allows the government undue leverage to interpret editorial "intent" in published materials. This grants the government free rein to prosecute and punish journalists for perceived insults against the state and its officials. As a result, many independent publishers employ attorneys on retainer to conduct prepublication reviews of their newspapers and magazines to reduce their chances of becoming targets of government reprisals. Journalists are often arrested in an arbitrary manner, either on the initiative of police, or when charges have been filed by the public prosecutor. In many cases, police officers decide independently that publications have acted illegally, and they arrest journalists before gathering evidence or filing charges in the courts. The police often base their actions on the Press Proclamationâs Art. 10, Sec. 10, which prohibits the media from "any defamation or false accusations against any individual, nation, nationality, people or organization," or "any criminal instigation of one nationality against another, or incitement of conflict between peoples and any agitation for war." Within 48 hours of an arrest, police can also request 14-day stays from the district courts, renewable for an additional 14 days, to remand journalists into custody while the police gather evidence. In May 1996, when CPJ asked Justice Minister Mahteme Solomon about the governmentâs expectations and plans regarding the establishment of a modern police force, he replied, "The police force is in its infancy. Many [police officers] were soldiers who protected the government, not the people." Modernization of the force would be "very expensive when compared to needs for food, medication, and education," he said. In early 1996, when the Ministry of the Interior was dismantled, the police force was placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. It remains to be seen, however, whether the police force will become fully accountable to the prosecutor and the courts. The case of Lullit Gebre Michael, editor in chief of the independent daily The Monitor, exemplifies the danger of allowing police to subjectively interpret the Press Proclamation when they themselves have limited understanding of journalistsâ rights or the role of the media in a democracy. In November 1995, Lullit and publisher Fitsum Zeab Asgedom were arrested at The Monitorâs editorial offices and taken to the Criminal Investigation Department for questioning. The arrests were in connection with two wire stories The Monitor ran from the government-run news wire service, the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA). The stories, which ENA had received from the Panafrican News Agency and Agence France-Presse services, reported an assassination attempt on Col. Mengistu in Harare. Lullit tried to verify the information with the Ethiopian ambassador to Zimbabwe, and quoted him in a follow-up article. The ambassador said that he was unaware of the incident and asserted that the Ethiopian government was not involved. In recounting her experience with the Ethiopian justice system, Lullit said that she realized the police had no knowledge of how the press operates. During questioning, she said, she had to explain to her interrogator that ENA was a government wire service and that The Monitor, like many other newspapers, paid a monthly fee for use of the wireâs news reports. When Lullit went before the court the next day, the judge refused to hear her comments, said that he had not read the articles in question, and remanded her to custody. After nine days of detention, she was released without charge on a 10,000 birr* bond (US$1,600**). Five days later, Fitsum was released on the same conditions. The court ordered the newspaper to suspend publication for three weeks. In August 1996, the case was officially closed without explanation. The state-run Ethiopian Television (ETV) also carried the ENA story on the Mengistu assassination attempt, but suffered no repercussions. The Monitorâs case, however, was as much a turning point for state journalists as for the independent press because it marked the first time a government news story had been used as justification for prosecuting an independent journalist. As one state reporter told CPJ, "I was bitter when The Monitor editor was arrested for telling the truth. It was a deliberate misinterpretation of the news by the prosecutor." Though legal harassment of government journalists is rare, the state press has not been immune to prosecution. In February 1993, editor Tesfaye Gebre Ab and columnists Tsegaye Hailu, Sileshi Tesserna, and Yeshtile Kokab of the government daily Addis Zemen, were detained and charged with "creating fear among the population." The arrests were in connection with an article discussing the positive and negative effects of democracy in Ethiopia. The journalists were eventually freed on a bond of 10,000 birr (US$1,600) each. In August 1993, after six months of litigation, the First Criminal Bench of the Central High Court acquitted them. Protecting oneâs sources can also lead to prosecution and jail time in Ethiopia. Even though Art. 8, Sec. 4 of the Press Proclamation prohibits the state from forcing journalists to reveal their sources, the state may bring charges under the State Security Act against a journalist who refuses to do so. Conviction on such charges would result in a guaranteed prison sentence. As a result, many independent journalists use pseudonyms to avoid identification by police and the public prosecutorâs office. One private publisher told CPJ that he insists on pseudonyms for reporters who cover controversial issues, like the economy and land lease programs, in the interest of the journalistsâ safety. For attorneys representing the private press, the amorphous nature of the Press Proclamation prevents them from confidently advising journalists on how to protect themselves from future arrests and litigation. The Ethiopian court system is modeled on the Napoleonic Civil Law system, where each offense and penalty is decided on a case-by-case basis without regard to previous rulings in similar cases. Absent prior decisions to incorporate into their defense strategies, attorneys are at the mercy of individual judgesâ interpretation of the law. In interviews with CPJ, a number of attorneys who represent journalists said that even if the court adhered strictly to existing laws and the constitution, the judiciary is not independent, and therefore could not be expected to reach objective decisions. These attorneys pointed out that the dismissal of the majority of Ethiopiaâs experienced judiciary in May 1996 landed the country squarely in a crisis. Today the court system is so severely backlogged that many defendants may spend more time in prison awaiting trial than they would if convicted of the charges against them. As one journalist told CPJ, "Christ, in his second coming, will see a judge sooner than the average Ethiopian citizen if the situation continues as it has until now." The governmentâs position that it was necessary to purge the judiciary of those loyal to Emperor Haile Selassie and Col. Mengistu is insufficient justification for citizensâ prolonged imprisonment, in deplorable conditions, while awaiting trial. And the stateâs 30-year plan for the establishment of an independent judiciary is not a solution to the court crisis. The government should immediately appoint enough prosecutors, judges, and investigators to end the current state of indefinite pretrial detention.

Hence, the law is often used as a government tool for post-publication censorship and punitive prosecution. According to Art. 8 of the Proclamation, the news media may not publish: Information designated as secret by Parliamentâs Councilof Representatives or the prime ministerâs cabinet, the Council of Ministers; Information that is held secret under the provisions of other laws; Information relating to any court case heard in camera, or information relating to a case pending before any court, unless the court decides otherwise; or Private information about a victim of a crime, unless the person consents. The law leaves open for broad interpretation what information is designated as "secret" and does not offer specific guidelines on what constitutes a "criminal offense against the safety of the state, the administration, or national defense," the very charge leveled against journalists who are hauled into court for violating Art. 8. Without such specific guidelines, journalists are unable to protect or defend themselves. In defense of the restrictive clauses of the Press Proclamation, Prime Minister Meles told CPJ, "Whatâs considered free press may be inimical to democracy." The prime minister cited the role of "hate radio" in Rwandaâs civil war as an instance where a government would be justified in restricting access to broadcast media. (Radio Mille Collines, the Rwandan radio station Prime Minister Meles was referring to, was a propaganda tool of the acting Rwandan government and was privately owned by members of that government. In CPJâs view, it is inaccurate to conclude that such a station is part of the independent news media.) Ethiopian journalists run a high risk of punishment for reporting on national security issues and ethnic unrest. They are most frequently prosecuted under Art. 480 of the Penal Code, which prohibits "false rumors and incitements to the breach of the peace" and is punishable by fines of 1,500 birr (US$250) or up to six monthsâ imprisonment. In court decisions where litigation against journalists was based on Art. 480, virtually all press reports and criticisms of conflict and ethnic violence have been characterized by the government as cases of spreading false rumors, supporting the stateâs historical denial of the existence of unrest in the country. Journalists are required to shoulder the burden of proof that their reports are true, whereas the public prosecutor need simply charge that their reports are false. In cases of libel, the state targets both the editor in chief and the publisher of a publication when charging criminal liability. If the publisher is a corporate entity, all of the corporationâs shareholders are considered liable. To enact stiffer penalties, the state usually charges journalists under the Penal Code, but fines them according to the Press Proclamation, which imposes substantially higher fines. In many cases, newspapers like Etiopis, Muday, and Ruh were forced into insolvency by such excessive fines, and eventually stopped publishing. Post-publication punishment for violations of the penal and civil codes with respect to sedition, defamation, and copyright is commonplace; penalties range from fines of up to 50,000 birr (US$8,300), to a minimum of one year in prison, and/or injunctions against the publication. Moreover, all publishers are required to submit two copies of each issue to the Ministry of Information within 24 hours of publication. The Ministry of Information then forwards one copy to the public prosecutorâs office for review. Failure to comply with the requirement results in charges of publishing an illegal press product. Conviction on such a charge can result in a prison sentence of up to three years and/or a fine of up to 50,000 birr (US$8,300).

Moreover, independent journalists have been refused confirmation of information, or answers to questions posed to government representatives, in violation of Art. 19 of the Press Proclamation, which states that "government officials shall have the duty to cooperate with the press." As a result, many publishers use personal contacts and fellow journalists in both the state and independent media as sources for acquiring government information for their publications. One independent journalist told CPJ, "They [government officials] know they have a duty to obey the law. Now when you ask for information they tell you, "If I give you this information, all the other journalists will go against you because I didnât give it to them,â or, "Iâve given [this information] already.â But they will never say "noâ outright." The private press is also barred from attending government-sponsored press conferences, including those held by the diplomatic community in conjunction with the Ethiopian government. By complying with this restriction on the private press, the international community has sent mixed messages to the Ethiopian government, quite possibly undermining its own efforts on behalf of independent journalists. When CPJ asked Prime Minister Meles whether his administration has plans to grant the private press access to government information, he replied that an "official decision has not yet been made." Perhaps, he said, "we will have to relax, and every member of government will make his own individual decision about whom to speak with." The question of access will be central in parliamentary discussions that begin in October 1996. Speaker of the Parliament Davit Yohannes told CPJ that decisions will be made regarding the appointment of a government spokesperson or the creation of a Department of Information, which would be responsible for informing the media about government policies and activities; and the establishment of a press council, accessible to all media, which would promote and offer support to the press. CPJ strongly urges the Ethiopian government to appoint a government press secretary to disseminate information to all press. Such an appointment would leave independent journalists less vulnerable to charges of publishing false information.

Publishers also complain that they are crippled by an informal "ban" on advertisements placed by state-owned institutions in the private press, by the refusal of government media to accept paid promotional advertising from private newspapers, and by the reported warnings that private businesses have received about the repercussions of placing advertisements simultaneously in both the state and private press. Technologically, the private press is more advanced than the state press, but this advantage may be short-lived because the government is now three years into a major modernization program for its news organs. Operating on shoestring budgets with skeleton staffs, many private newspapers and magazines lay out their publications themselves on personal computers equipped with outdated desktop publishing programs that are modified to work in both the Amharic and English languages. Using laser printers to prepare camera-ready page proofs, self-taught production staffs produce the most basic graphics. These publications would greatly benefit from access to more sophisticated technology and production training. The independent press publishes products that vary in editorial quality and political analysis. English-language newspapers reflect the decline of English-language instruction in the educational system. And both Amharic- and English-language publications reflect the negligible editorial skills of the majority of practicing journalists. Some newspapers, like the Addis Tribune and The Monitor, which have been accused in the past of treading too carefully to avoid the perception of criticizing the government, are now covering more local and political issues, as well as press freedom and human rights. However, the bulk of the criticism directed squarely at the government can be found in publications like Tobia and Urji, which are regarded as political opposition papers by the government and its supporters. There is some justification for the governmentâs view: some independent publishers and journalists were partisans of Col. Mengistu; others of the late Emperor Haile Selassie; and others still of various ethnic insurgent groups. This, however, does not justify the stateâs intolerance of the expression of opposing viewpoints. English-language newspapers targeting the Addis-based international community have created a new segment of the market. 7 Days Update and Addis Digest excerpt major stories from both the state and private media, providing translations of articles from Amharic-language publications. Entrepreneur and The Sun are weekly newspapers that extensively cover business issues. Reporter, an Amharic-language weekly, has also carved out a niche for itself, offering investigative reporting in the form of exposÃ©s of government corruption and mismanagement. Many of the best-selling independent Amharic-language publications plan to publish English-language editions in the near future.

The primary challenge facing the state-run news outlets is a public perception of irrelevance and lack of objectivity. As one journalist who has worked for both the private press and the state media told CPJ, "The government press is not even serving the government. People have stopped watching television. There is no journalism in the government media." State journalists still practice self-censorship learned over decades of having to give all stories a pro-government slant. For this reason and for economic ones, it is not uncommon today for a state journalist to write for a private publication, under a pseudonym, to earn extra income and to take advantage of the opportunity to work on stories not covered extensively in the government media. And many state journalists have moved permanently to the private press because the salaries are higher. In 1993, the government implemented a five-year reorganization and decentralization plan aimed at rendering state newspapers and broadcast outlets semi-autonomous. Although the government will continue to cover all costs of production, including salaries, as the plan is institutionalized, its publications and broadcast stations are expected to generate advertising revenue and create additional income sources to become entirely self-sufficient by 1998. The government has shown little willingness to give up control of the airwaves to private ownership in Ethiopia, where the adult literacy rate is 22.8 percent, where fewer than one percent of the population of approximately 55 million reads newspapers or magazines, and where an estimated 10 million radios are in use. The role that private radio will play in the development of the media in Ethiopia is a significant one, especially for the large segments of the population that have little or no access to news of the country outside their own regions. Radio remains the medium that is most effective at reaching a geographically dispersed and linguistically diverse population. Until licenses are granted to private broadcasters, the state monopoly of the dissemination of information will continue to restrict Ethiopian citizens' ability to make informed decisions. CPJ's questions to top government officials about the state monopoly of broadcasting yielded unsatisfactory responses. Officials vacillated between asserting the hard-line position that Ethiopia can ill afford to allow unrestricted access to radio frequencies lest it become another Rwanda, to admitting that the government has been undecided about how to set up a regulatory framework within which to organize and grant licenses. Recent technological advances aside, the relatively low production values and editorial quality of Ethiopian Television (ETV) and Radio Ethiopia support private investors' beliefs that the government is wary of opening up the marketplace to competition from private broadcasters who may offer superior programming. As independent journalists pointed out to CPJ on several occasions, the press law allows for open access to broadcasting, and the government's current denial of licenses to independent journalists constitutes unlawful restriction of fair competition. Officials told CPJ that when Parliament reconvenes in October, it is expected to nominate semi-autonomous boards that are supposed to take over all government-controlled media, including newspapers, radio, television, and the national news agency. The implementation of a law authorizing private broadcasting, however, is likely to take at least two more years. Access to satellite dish technology and hardware, previously available only to foreign embassies and high-ranking government officials, was granted to private citizens on Aug. 7, 1996. Importation of satellite dishes for commercial purposes, however, remains illegal. And restrictions on the movement of satellite dishes within the country are also in effect. ETV was launched in 1963 with a staff of 29 people. Today its staff of approximately 570 produces ETV's programming in antiquated studios on much of the organization's original equipment. Currently the station is undergoing a modernization effort as part of the government's restructuring program, and it expects to relocate to a new building, with modern studios and transmitters, in central Addis Ababa. Of all the state media, ENA, Ethiopia's official wire service, is the most poorly equipped technologically. Yet its 100 young and poorly trained journalists countrywide generate the bulk of the domestic and international news stories reported in government newspapers. During CPJ's tour of the ENA facilities, general manager Tekle Tesfahdet said that most of the wire service's journalists, who are recruited from local high schools and Addis Ababa University, have not received proper training, and are writing their news stories longhand because of a shortage of typewriters. Regional reports from international wire services, such as Reuters and AFP, are incorporated into the ENA English wire, but the source of most of the service's local-language output originates from 37 regional bureaus located throughout the country. The state's largest surviving newspapers--the English-language Ethiopian Herald, the Amharic-language Addis Zemen, the Orominga-language Berissa, and the Arabic Al Aleni--are little more than repositories for ENA wire stories. But in late 1995, in a reversal of its historical tendency to attack the independent media, the Ethiopian Herald began including excerpts from independent newspapers in its weekly overview of top stories.

Of those nine journalists, one is nearing completion of an 18-month prison term, and the rest were remanded to custody because they were unable to present personal guarantors for prohibitive bail amounts ranging from 8,000 birr (US$1,300) to 30,000 birr (US$4,800). Based on the comprehensive meetings held during the course of our mission, CPJ has identified several areas of continued concern. Improvements in these areas would contribute substantially to the creation of an environment within which members of Ethiopiaâs media can work freely and can develop into the skilled professionals that all of the journalists we met with aspire to become. To bring about these improvements, CPJ calls on the Ethiopian government to: Immediately and unconditionally release all journalists who have been imprisoned for exercising their internationally recognized legal right to report the news. Eliminate all criminal libel statutes in the Press Proclamation, particularly those pertaining to seditious libel, which criminalizes critical commentary on public officials and government policies. Restore the right of detainees to apply for habeas corpus, as granted by Art. 19, Sec. 4 of the 1995 Constitution, to prevent indefinite pretrial detention. Abolish excessive bail, which primarily serves to render private publications financially insolvent. Train police officers, the judiciary, and government officials on the internationally recognized rights of journalists, the role of the press in a democratic society, and general human rights issues. Establish an equitable system that permits private ownership of broadcast media. Grant the private press equal and unrestricted access to government press conferences, including joint press conferences with foreign diplomatic representatives and international figures. Establish the already promised government press office so that the media can be informed about government policies and activities. It should also be this officeâs responsibility to respond to all inquiries from the press. Continue to provide the private press with equal and unrestricted access to government training programs and facilities. Accredit members of the press, both state and private, so that they may freely cover parliamentary activities. The United States, which supports the Meles government and gives Ethiopia the second highest amount of U.S. aid allocated to sub-Saharan Africa, can greatly influence the development of a free press in this newly democratic society. CPJ calls on the U.S. government to: Give media training higher priority when allocating funds for democratization in Ethiopia. Issue a public statement granting the private press in Ethiopia equal and unrestricted access to all press conferences involving U.S. officials and to all official U.S. embassy functions. Publicly encourage the Ethiopian government to give the private press access to government activities and officials. Fund training for the Ethiopian judiciary, police force, and regional government officials on the internationally recognized legal rights of journalists, the role of the media in a democratic society, and general human rights issues. Encourage and coordinate media funding by other foreign government representatives in Ethiopia. Expand the media analysis section on Ethiopia in the U.S. State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.

There is no organized distribution system in place. Newspapers and magazines are primarily sold on the streets by children who earn a subsistence living for their work, and, to a lesser extent, by independent contractors and newsstands. The majority of the publications offered for sale cost 1.50 birr (US$.25) per copy. The street vendors pick up their newspapers and magazines in the morning, either at the printer or at a publicationâs editorial offices. According to one publisher, these young vendors "maintain strict control on the distribution business, and they can also influence the editorial content of the publications they sell. Sometimes they will tell you to put a photo of Mengistu on the cover, because the newspaper sells faster. And they will threaten to stop selling your publication if you do not comply." Street vendors can cut a publisherâs profits by arbitrarily lowering the cover price by as much as 30 percent. Occasionally, turf fights erupt among vendors. One U.S. Embassy official based in Addis Ababa expressed suspicions to CPJ that the fights may be provoked by the government to drive some private newspapers out of business. Private publishers charged that police regularly detain groups of young street vendors as a means of reducing their sales, although CPJ was unable to confirm these allegations. One publisher claimed that after one group of vendors was detained, his sales fell 25 percent when the usual 25 to 40 vendors did not show up to pick up his publication. Previously, the government has said that it also has targeted vendors of state publications in its effort to wipe out illegal vending of any kind. There is almost no distribution of private publications outside of Addis Ababa. When asked about this, government officials claimed that the private press has been granted equal access to regional distribution markets. But members of the independent press complain that their publications are effectively banned in the provinces, because of harassment of their vendors and confiscation of their newspapers by police. In April 1996, for instance, police detained Bekele Dissassa, a distributor of independent publications in the town of Nekemte, the capital of the west central province of Welega. Bekele was released without charge in June. To restrict their profit losses and create an alternative distribution network, a number of private publishers have already taken steps toward getting their own kiosks. But the establishment of a privately owned nationwide distribution system appears unlikely in the near future.

The stories, which ENA had received from the Panafrican News Agency and Agence France-Presse services, reported an assassination attempt in Harare on exiled former Ethiopian dictator Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam. Lullit called to verify the information with the Ethiopian ambassador to Zimbabwe, whom she quoted in a follow-up to the stories. He stated that he was unaware of the incident and asserted that the Ethiopian government was not involved. The day after her arrest Lullit appeared before a judge who refused to hear her comments. He said that he had not read the articles in question and remanded her to custody. After nine days of detention, she was released without charge on a 10,000 birr bond (US$1,600).

His observation says as much about speech as about the absence of speech--that once people began to use words to express themselves, there could be no turning back, no anti-evolutionary tendency that would have us keep quiet again. Words are weapons against oblivion. If the species were ever to revert to silence, that silence would be deafening, because everyone would remember the time that we made a sound. Journalism, at its best, sides with the Cro-Magnons. A tyrannical, oppressive government or group, having established silence somewhere, seeks to keep the unnatural peace by means of censorship, intimidation and murder; and the journalist seeks to break the silence with the truth. Their respective forces are ill-balanced; one side has guns, the other words. It is amazing to consider that, historically, the words have prevailed. I do not mean to accord any special nobility to journalists as people. By speaking out, or writing out, they are simply doing their jobs. It is where they do these jobs that sets certain journalists apart. Many American journalists drop in on dangerous places like Bosnia or Rwanda, stay a few weeks and go home. For most of the people in whom the Committee to Protect Journalists is interested, the dangerous places are home. They do not think of themselves as remarkable, so their colleagues in safer places must do that for them. Yet the work of CPJ is not merely to honor such people with recognition. The International Press Freedom Awards, given every year to a few of the bravest, are both symbols of admiration and signals to the worlds in which they operate that the freer world is watching. This is what CPJ said presenting the 1995 International Press Freedom Awards to Yevgeny Kiselyov, whose independent television network is threatened in Russia; to investigative reporter Veronica Guerin, who has been beaten and shot in Ireland; to JosÃ© RubÃ©n Zamora MarroquÃ­n, who, as editor of an independent newspaper in Guatemala, is continually under fire; to Fred M'membe, editor of Zambia's most important independent paper, who faces criminal charges that could sentence him to prison for 100 years; and to Ahmad Taufik, president of Indonesia's sole independent journalists union, who is already in prison for expressing "feelings of hostility" toward the government. In 1995, 51 journalists were killed in the line of duty. Forty-five were murdered outright; and six were killed covering a war, or as a result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The silence of those killed is doubled by the silence that results from their killing. It is where the truth has been silenced that the silence of death is most painful--the silence of Cambodia, or of Auschwitz, or of Babi Yar; the silence, these days, of Sudan. In his great book, Language and Silence, the English critic George Steiner wondered if anyone would have cared what Hitler did to the Jews if the Nazis had not ventured outside the borders of the Third Reich. "There would have been numerous pundits and journalists," wrote Steiner, "to assure us that rumors were exaggerated, that Dachau had pleasant walks." He assumed that journalists would be too stupid or corrupt to break the silence with the truth, and, from time to time, that has been the case. But today's journalists are a pretty honest lot, for the most part. And they have been encouraged by organizations like CPJ, which reassure them that if they make a sound, the world will listen. Steiner also said that there are some horrors too deep for words. That may be true for art, but not for journalism. The unwritten or unspoken report is good news for killers, and eventually it leaves a wasteland. The Committee to Protect Journalists did not create the journalists it seeks to protect. These people would tell their indispensable stories whether or not CPJ existed. And, in many if not most cases, CPJ cannot fulfill the promise of its own self-appointed mission. If the forces of silence want to do their dirty work, they will find a way, and then express ignorance of the event, or regret. But if CPJ did not cry out against such acts, who would make the noise? And if no one sounded the alarm, who would try to prevent the fire next time? Everywhere journalists work, someone strives to keep them quiet in the interest of silencing the world. People have come too far for that. Roger Rosenblatt is a prize-winning essayist and author. Executive Summary Attacks on the Press in 1995 analyzes the state of press freedom in 101 countries last year and examines more than 700 individual cases of journalists who were physically attacked, imprisoned, threatened or censored in retaliation for their work. Drawn from the research of CPJ's in-house staff of regional media experts, CPJ's annual Attacks on the Press reports are widely recognized as the most comprehensive and authoritative source of information on press freedom violations around the world. Major Findings At the end of 1995, a record 182 journalists were imprisoned in 22 countries. For the second consecutive year, Turkey, with 51 reporters and editors in jail, was the worst offender. Other countries with large numbers of journalists in jail at the close of 1995 were Ethiopia (31), China (20) and Kuwait (18); Vietnam, Peru, Myanmar (Burma) and Nigeria each held eight journalists in jail. 51 journalists were killed in the line of duty in 1995. Forty-five of the deaths were homicides; six were casualties in combat zones. For the second consecutive year, Algeria was the most deadly country for journalists--24 were murdered in 1995 by rebel terrorists who have been waging a campaign of death against members of the media since May 1993. To date, more than 50 Algerian journalists have been assassinated. CPJ has now confirmed 456 cases of journalists who were killed in the past decade (1986-1995) as a direct result of their profession. Most were murdered. The countries with the highest death tolls were Algeria, the former Yugoslavia, Colombia, Tajikistan and the Philippines. In the report's introduction, CPJ Executive Director William A. Orme, Jr. examines how these cases dramatize new dangers facing journalists around the world. Regional Trends Africa For the third consecutive year, Ethiopia held more journalists in jail--31 at year's end--than any other country in Africa. Most were detained without charges. Rwanda and Burundi again proved to be among the most dangerous places on the continent for journalists to work, as local and foreign reporters were threatened and harassed by government security forces and armed insurgents. Gen. Sani Abacha escalated his all-out war on Nigeria's independent press, as exemplified by the secret trial and conviction in July of four journalists for their coverage of an abortive coup plot. Upcoming elections in several countries, including Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire), Ethiopia and Chad, proved reason enough for governments to impose greater restrictions--if not all-out crackdowns--on the media. Constitutional guarantees of press freedom failed to keep journalists in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Zambia from being sent to jail for sedition, libel and defamation. In Sierra Leone, Nigeria and the Gambia, military leaders overrode court rulings and suppressed unfavorable press coverage with executive decrees. The Americas Attacks against journalists by drug cartels and other criminal organizations--many of them protected by elements of the local policy and military--were an escalating problem in Guatemala, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Paraguay. The democratically elected leaders of Argentina, Chile and Peru introduced legislation restricting press freedoms; in Argentina and Chile, the initiatives were withdrawn following strong local and international media reactions. With the June release from prison of dissident journalist Yndamiro Restano, Cuba appeared to be softening its hostility toward independent local journalists. But in the second half of 1995, Cuba's fledgling nongovernmental news agencies were relentlessly harassed by state security forces. In Costa Rica, the Supreme Court declared the licensing of journalists unconstitutional, setting a possible precedent for other Latin American countries where the Costa Rican licensing system has been adopted or proposed. Asia China again jailed two of its most prominent dissident journalists, Wei Jingsheng and Chen Ziming, bringing the total number of journalists in jail to 20. Beijing also ordered the closure of two provincial TV stations for broadcasting politically objectionable material. Indonesia accelerated its crackdown on the independent press, imprisoning Ahmad Taufik, the leader of the country's only independent journalists union. Taufik, a winner of CPJ's 1995 International Press Freedom Award, had his sentence increased on appeal, and is now serving out his three-year sentence in prison. Criminal libel charges threatened the survival of several newspapers in Cambodia, where a new press law allows authorities to shut down newspapers for 30 days and bans news reports that affect "national security and political stability." Two of East Asia's emerging democracies, Taiwan and South Korea, showed notable press freedom gains in 1995. Taiwan licensed the country's first private, pro-opposition television station, and South Korea's press called former and current political leaders to account in a mushrooming corruption scandal. Press freedom conditions deteriorated alarmingly in Pakistan, with a sharp increase in violent attacks on the media, police harassment, newspaper bans and defamation suits. In Sri Lanka, the People's Alliance government censored coverage of the war with Tamil separatists, introducing regulations three weeks before a major counterinsurgency offensive that required journalists to clear all war reports with the Media Ministry. Central Europe and the Republics of the Former Soviet Union In Russia, the government's continuing failure to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the murders of seven journalists had a chilling effect on reporting about organized crime and official corruption. In Tajikistan, the execution-style murder of a BBC Persian Service bureau chief was a chilling reminder of the deadly campaign begun in 1992 against independent and opposition journalists, which left 27 dead. Governments tightened controls over all news media in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. In Azerbaijan and other nations of the Caucasus region, prior censorship was often employed to suppress independent reporting. Journalists in Bosnia faced a high risk of being killed deliberately by snipers or accidentally by cross fire and land mines. The taking of journalists as hostages became a new method of retaliation against the international press by Bosnian Serb militias. Middle East and North Africa The shocking assassination death toll in Algeria increased by 24, accounting for more than half of all murders of journalists documented by CPJ in 1995. Turkey continued to jail more reporters and editors than any other country, with 51 journalists in prison at year's end. Reporters in Egypt faced new restrictions as Law 93 of 1995--dubbed the "Press Assassination Law"--imposed steep fines and long prison terms for loosely defined libel offenses. In areas now under the control of the Palestinian National Authority, journalists were hit with arbitrary detention orders and newspapers were forced to suspend publication. With the exception of Kuwait, independent news gathering remained strictly prohibited in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Authoritarian regimes in Syria, Iraq and Libya also continued to repress all forms of free expression, while Tunisia kept independent journalists from working in local media. The 10-Year Death Toll: Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty Between 1986 and 1995, 456 journalists were killed in 61 countries for reasons related directly to their profession, CPJ has confirmed. More than 300 of those deaths appeared to have been deliberate political assassinations. The countries with the highest death tolls illustrate the different kinds of threats now facing independent journalists around the world: Silencing the press in the name of religion and politics Algeria, 53 deaths: Reporters and editors in the press have been targeted for harassment, intimidation and murder by Islamist radicals. Targeting journalists in war zones The former Yugoslavia, 45 deaths: The internationally accepted norm of treating reporters as civilian noncombatants is increasingly ignored by armed factions in civil wars. Reporters covering civil wars are now targeted by armed belligerents who perceive journalists to be the enemy. Contract murders of reporters covering drug trafficking Colombia, 43 deaths: Drug cartels and organized crime syndicates are targeting journalists with growing frequency. In the coming decade, threats from such groups could well become an even more deadly problem than political persecution. Stamping out free expression in societies accustomed to tyranny Tajikistan, 29 deaths: The return to totalitarianism in a country that had briefly embraced democracy was accompanied by a campaign of murder and censorship against a small corps of independent journalists. Reprisals for investigations of human rights abuses and corruption The Philippines, 29 deaths: Though more common in the Marcos era, the murders of provincial reporters who uncovered human rights abuses and corruption continued through the Aquinos and Ramos governments as the restoration of democracy emboldened local publications to investigate such issues. Special Reports Attacks on the Press in 1995 features insightful, in-depth commentaries on the jailing, murder and censorship of journalists in: Algeria: The brutal campaign of assassination against Algerian reporters has been difficult to stop in part because local journalists failed to join together and fight for legal protections when the government liberalized press controls in 1989, says editor SÃ©lima Ghezali in her probing essay, "Algerian Journalism's Original Sin." Russia: Russian journalists are being murdered in record numbers, but they can expect little or no protection from their government: That is the central conclusion of CPJ staff expert David Satter's special report on his fact-finding mission to Moscow to investigate seven unsolved killings of local journalists. Satter shows how the Yeltsin administration has failed even to investigate most of these cases. Nigeria: Since Nigeria's independence, the local press has labored under a series of increasingly repressive military regimes. An entire generation of journalists has fled. In "The Retreat of Nigeria's Press: Tactical Withdrawal or Temporary Defeat?" an exiled Nigerian journalist discusses the plight of journalists under Gen. Sani Abacha's rule and prospects for the restoration of democracy and press freedom. Palestinian National Authority: The growing ranks of independent Palestinian journalists insist that their job requires them to be skeptical--a stance that the Arafat government has trouble accepting. Palestinian journalist Imad Musa analyzes the challenges facing reporters in Gaza and the West Bank, many of whom have been subjected to harassment, censorship and arbitrary detention by PNA officials. Bosnia: In "Hunting for Mass Graves Behind Serb Lines," U.S. reporter David Rohde recounts the ordeal of being held prisoner for two weeks by Bosnian Serbs as he sought to continue his reporting on mass grave sites. India: In a groundbreaking report on the extraordinary pressures faced by journalists in embattled Indian-ruled Kashmir, CPJ's Asia program coordinator, Vikram Parekh, documents the murderous assaults and severe official constraints on local reporters and editors. Parekh found that the Kashmir press endures constant threats of closure, intimidation and armed attacks by one or more of the warring parties: armed separatists, Indian security forces and government-backed militias. CPJ Actions Attacks on the Press in 1995 shows how CPJ took action on behalf of hundreds of journalists last year. Through diplomatic channels, grassroots efforts and media campaigns, CPJ brought international attention to these cases and helped secure the release of prisoners. In Cuba, dissident journalist Yndamiro Restano was released from prison last June, after a year-long international protest campaign led by CPJ. Walter Cronkite, CPJ's honorary chairman, met with the prime minister of Turkey in September to express CPJ's objections to charges filed against American reporter Aliza Marcus, a Reuter correspondent based in Istanbul, who faced up to three years in prison for her reports on Turkish counterinsurgency forays into Kurdish villages. Two months later, the charges against Marcus were dismissed. David Rohde, a correspondent in Bosnia for the Christian Science Monitor, was captured and held for two weeks by the Bosnian Serbs for pursuing his investigations into the mass executions of Muslim villagers. He was freed following direct personal appeals by CPJ Chair Kati Marton to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Introductionby William A. Orme, Jr. On March 1, 1995, Vladislav Listyev, one of Russia's best-known news broadcasters, respected universally for his integrity and independence, came home from his new job as head of a national public television network. As he entered his Moscow apartment building, he was shot dead. Listyev's killing provoked a national outcry. He was the fourth Moscow journalist murdered in nine months, but he was by far the most famous. Thousands marched in his funeral procession, demanding that authorities find and punish his murderers. The Yeltsin government promised to make the Listyev homicide one of its highest priorities. The deep public anger and spontaneous demonstrations of support for press freedom provoked by Listyev's tragic killing were heartening to journalists in Russia and abroad. But a year later, there is still no sign of a serious government effort to identify and prosecute those responsible for the crime: no suspects held, no charges filed, no evidence of any serious ongoing investigation. As with all unsolved homicides, the motives for Listyev's murder remain unclear: a common supposition is that entrenched interests objected to his cancellation of lucrative advertising contracts and to his commitment to editorial autonomy. But the killing itself, and the government's failure to find and arrest suspects, sent a message to Russian journalists that any one of them, no matter how prominent, could be murdered with impunity. It was an unsettling reminder of the fragility of press freedom in Russia and many other nations where democratic rights have shallow roots. New Freedoms Under Siege For most of the world, press freedom is an achievement of the late 20th century, the result (and often the catalyst) of democratic revolutions that ended both Soviet Communism and military rule by the anti-Communist right. The gains for journalists and journalism have been extraordinary. The ranks of independent reporters and news organizations working around the world have probably doubled in the past decade, and people from Moscow to Seoul to Soweto are getting uncensored information about national and world affairs for the first time in their lives. But the risks have increased commensurately as well. Almost everywhere, newly won freedoms are under siege. Journalists face violent reprisals from state security forces, from international drug gangs and from armed dissidents of diverse ideological stripes. Criminal libel suits and huge civil financial claims are filed by officials and their friends in an effort to frustrate coverage of government corruption. As 1995 drew to a close, at least 182 journalists--a record--were held in jails around the world because local authorities disapproved of their reporting. And, in the most chilling statistic of all, at least 51 journalists were killed last year in the line of duty, most of them by political assassins. This annual report of the Committee to Protect Journalists chronicles these assaults on press freedom. They range in seriousness from incidents of censorship to, at the extreme, in Algeria, a systematic campaign of assassination against all members of the working press. In most cases, CPJ did more than document these abuses. We worked to get detained journalists out of jail, sent letters of protest to offending governments (and to nongovernmental offenders), alerted the international press to abuses against journalists, helped journalists fleeing persecution to find asylum, provided practical safety information to reporters assigned to dangerous areas and tried to persuade the U.S. and other governments to make the defense of press freedom a diplomatic priority. This pressure can be effective. In June, Cuban journalist Yndamiro Restano was released from prison following a six-month international protest campaign spearheaded by CPJ's Americas program. The timely and highly public intervention in Turkey of CPJ Honorary Chairman Walter Cronkite was instrumental, we believe, in the successful fight for an acquittal of Istanbul-based Reuter correspondent Aliza Marcus, who faced three years in prison in Turkey (where more journalists are incarcerated than anywhere in the world) just for reporting the undisputed truth about counterinsurgency strikes against Kurdish rebels. Christian Science Monitor reporter David Rohde, taken into custody and held for trial in Serbian-controlled Bosnia, was released following CPJ Chair Kati Marton's direct and insistent appeals to Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic during the peace talks in Dayton, Ohio. But the bedrock of our work is the basic journalistic research evident throughout this volume: the timely, thoroughly sourced documentation of hundreds of cases of abuse, harassment and intimidation. CPJ staff experts confirm that each incident happened, that the victim was a legitimate working journalist, and that his or her professional activities appeared to be the only plausible reason for the attack. Given the strictness of our criteria and the difficulties of investigating cases in often-remote provinces that are also often in the throes of civil conflict, this catalogue of press freedom violations inevitably understates the dimensions of the problem. It remains, however, the most comprehensive survey of its kind. Where the Press Is the Opposition Most of the 720 incidents itemized in this book took place in countries that offer neither the best nor the worst national examples of press freedom. Because of our limited resources, CPJ's press-monitoring work does not cover the industrial democracies. Our work on behalf of the major Western news organizations is largely limited to the problems faced by foreign correspondents in civil conflicts and combat zones. We focus on countries where local journalists are most in need of international support (which also tend to be the countries where foreign correspondents get into trouble). Conspicuously missing from that list are the countries with the most severe press freedom problems of all--nations such as North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan and Myanmar, where there is no independent local press, and where access by foreign reporters is often also restricted. Though these countries are cited in our reports, there are few attacks on journalists in places where there are few or no journalists. The real battle for press freedom is being waged in societies that have only recently emerged from autocratic repression--places as culturally and politically diverse as Argentina, Russia and Cambodia. Such countries let independent publications circulate freely, but rarely investigate--much less prosecute--violent attacks against reporters, editors and publishers. Compounding the problem, many governments view the independent press as the de facto opposition, a perception with considerable basis in fact. In places where well-organized political parties are either a new phenomenon (as in Central Europe) or are widely dismissed as ineffectual and corrupt (as in much of Latin America), the daily press is often the only institution holding government officials accountable. Even when journalists are targeted by the government's declared enemies--armed separatists, nationalist zealots, drug traffickers--the chilling effect is sometimes quietly welcomed by those with the power to combat these crimes. A frightened reporter is rarely an aggressive reporter. The Ultimate Censorship: Assassination Ideologies of both the left and right remain a threat to independent journalism. During the Cold War, censorship was imposed in the name of Marx. Today it is often rationalized by invoking Confucius or Muhammad. The religious pretext cuts both ways: In countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, rulers cite their Muslim faith to justify tight controls on the news media; in Egypt and Uzbekistan, authorities say such strictures are essential to the containment of Islamic fundamentalism. In the 1970s, Argentine generals murdered nearly 100 reporters and editors in a crusade in defense of what they termed Christian values. In the 1990s, Algerian insurgents have assassinated more than 50 reporters and editors as part of their campaign for theocratic Islamist rule. Assassination is the ultimate form of censorship. CPJ confirmed 51 cases of journalists who were killed in the line of duty in 1995. Nearly half--24 in all--were Algerian reporters and editors murdered by the Armed Islamic Group and allied rebel factions, making Algeria the most dangerous country in the world for journalists for the second consecutive year. Since CPJ was founded in 1981, we have never witnessed a sustained campaign of terror against journalists on this scale. Six of the confirmed deaths last year--two in Chechnya and one each in Azerbaijan, Burundi, Croatia and Somalia--were combat-zone casualties. (Another four journalists who are missing in Chechnya are feared dead, but searches continue.) The other 45 cases appear to have been politically motivated homicides. CPJ is investigating another five deaths of journalists in 1995 that also appear to have been deliberate murders. Murder was the leading cause of job-related deaths for journalists in 1995, as it has been consistently for at least the past decade. Since 1986, CPJ has documented 456 violent deaths of journalists. More than 300 appear to have been deliberate political assassinations; the rest were apparently accidental deaths among foreign correspondents and local reporters covering armed combat and violent civil disturbances. In such countries as Bosnia and Somalia, however, even many such combat-zone casualties may have been deliberate sniper attacks on clearly identifiable journalists. The homicide rate among journalists is not, it should be stressed, the most accurate inversely correlating index of press freedom. In the most repressive societies, murders of journalists are extremely rare, because journalists are extremely rare. In the past decade CPJ has not had a single confirmed killing of a working reporter in North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Libya, Syria or Myanmar. Conversely, in countries with a large and aggressive press corps, there are abundant motives and opportunities for violent attacks on journalists; India, where 15 reporters were killed in the past 10 years, and Brazil, with 10 murders since 1986, are cases in point. And there are many countries, such as China, Ethiopia, Syria and Kuwait, where journalists are rarely killed, but are routinely imprisoned, often for near-life terms. A close look at the countries where these killings are most common offers a disturbingly representative portrait of the dangers faced by journalists today. Algeria, the most extreme case, with 53 journalists killed (all murders, and all since May 1993), is unique in scale but not in kind. Reporters and editors of the "secular" press are targeted for harassment and sometimes murder by Islamist radicals in Egypt and Turkey as well. It is unsurprising that the former Yugoslavia, in aggregate, had the second-largest number of press casualties in the past 10 years: 45 verified deaths. But it is not widely known that there were five more documented deaths in Croatia than in Bosnia, and that most of the victims were local journalists who appear to have been personally targeted because of their work. As in Rwanda, local journalists in the former Yugoslavia were singled out in the early stages of genocidal attacks because of their presumed prominence and influence. And of the 22 foreign reporters who are known to have died covering the war in Bosnia, a significant but ultimately unverifiable number were deliberately killed by armed belligerents who perceived the international press as their enemy. This, again, is increasingly the pattern in civil wars from Algeria to Somalia to Afghanistan. Colombia claimed the third-largest number of confirmed deaths over the past decade: 43, most (though not all) apparent drug-cartel contract murders. This number is certainly an underestimate: Many reported murders of provincial print and radio reporters in Colombia could not be confirmed, a problem tragically typical of a country with the highest reported homicide rate in the world. Most of these murders remain not only unsolved but uninvestigated. So inured is the Colombian press to these killings--and so intimidated are many local publishers--that these cases rarely make the papers, let alone the front page. The Colombian problem has spread to its neighbors: Journalists in Central America, Peru, Venezuela and elsewhere in the region now say their biggest fear is violent reprisals for reporting on drug trafficking. And suspected drug traffickers are also targeting journalists in Russia, Central Europe, Central Asia and Indochina. In the coming decade, threats to journalism from organized crime could well become an even more deadly problem than political persecution. In Asia, where autocrats of both the left and right condemn press freedom as inimical to indigenous Asian "cultural values," the dangers faced by journalists are typically imprisonment or legal harassment. Murders of journalists, in proportion to the size of the working press, are surprisingly rare. Yet the final two countries on this unhappy list are both Asian. In both the Philippines and Tajikistan, CPJ has confirmed 29 violent job-related deaths of journalists over the past decade, almost all of them apparently deliberate, politically motivated murders. In many other ways--politically, culturally--these countries are also atypical of Asia. The Philippines, with its legacy of Spanish colonialism and U.S. military rule, has a history and social structure arguably more akin to Latin America's, and the pattern of unprosecuted murders of provincial Filipino journalists who uncovered corruption and human rights abuses among local landowners and security chiefs is disturbingly similar to death-squad killings of reporters in Central and South America. (Another common denominator is a continuing counterinsurgency campaign against Marxist rebels, which has also claimed casualties in the press corps.) Though more common in the Marcos era, these homicides continued under the Aquino and Ramos governments--in part, it seems, because the restoration of democracy emboldened local publications to cover subjects they would have avoided in the past. The case of Tajikistan is more distinctive still. Though this neighbor of China is geographically Asian, it has never been part of the continent politically. Nominally independent since 1991, Tajikistan remains within Moscow's shrinking sphere of influence. A CPJ investigation demonstrated compelling circumstantial evidence of the government's complicity in most of the 29 verifiable murders of Tajik journalists over the past four years, and it is a government wholly dependent on Russian economic and military support. Yet Moscow is rarely taken to task for sustaining a regime that has ruthlessly eliminated all traces of an independent press. More disturbing, this lack of press freedom is fast becoming the norm throughout Central Asia. None of the five now-independent Central Asian republics permits truly independent local news reporting, and yet all receive support from foreign governments and aid donors who are ostensibly committed to freedom of expression and other democratic values. When journalists are murdered simply for doing their job, it often seems to all of us on CPJ's board and staff that we have manifestly failed at our central assignment--protecting journalists. But by reporting the stories of these slain journalists to their colleagues around the world, we can at least ensure that they will not be forgotten. And by pressing governments to treat the job-related murders of journalists as political assassinations, we hope to make top officials personally committed to prosecuting these crimes. We also seek to make them aware that failure to do so calls into question their avowed commitment to press freedom. By raising the stakes, of course, we also hope to deter future assailants. Ultimately, journalists cannot be completely protected. Journalism is a dangerous profession, entered voluntarily. In many if not most countries the "without fear or favor" formula remains a distant dream. But the fight of journalists around the world to do their jobs in the most difficult circumstances deserves active and engaged support, and this report attests to their remarkable tenacity, courage and professional dedication. --February 1996 William A.

Few leaders appeared willing to tolerate the free speech they promised fellow citizens on the campaign trail. As governments rushed to take pre-emptive steps before upcoming elections, draconian press laws were introduced, laws CPJ is carefully monitoring and protesting. The one bright spot in 1995 was South Africa, which has shown remarkable progress and encouraged democratic reform and free speech throughout the region. Crackdowns on the press were particularly harsh in Zambia, the Gambia and other countries with upcoming presidential and legislative elections. Many of the incumbents, former one-party rulers or military dictators, effectively outlawed free speech through the use of colonial-era sedition laws and criminal libel laws that make "insulting or offending" the president or other government officials offenses punishable by prolonged imprisonment. Foreign correspondents and journalists working for state-owned media were also targeted for perceived unfavorable coverage. For the benefit of donor nations in the West that are prone to criticize undemocratic methods, governments use the courtroom, rather than brute force, to curtail freedom of expression and to intimidate the press. In Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe, the judiciary is so compromised that it rarely decides in favor of the press despite the fact that press freedom is guaranteed by the constitution. And in the Gambia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, military regimes simply enact decrees to override judicial verdicts they deem unfavorable to the state. Nigeria's position as Africa's most populous and oil-rich nation lends particular significance to the actions of Gen. Sani Abacha's brutal regime. Abacha's systematic and unrelenting attack on members of the press and proponents of democracy escalated in 1995, with a chilling effect on the Nigerian people. The secret military trials for treason of journalists Christine Anyanwu, Ben Charles Obi, Kunle Ajibade and George Mbah; the executions of nine Ogoni human rights activists, including the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa; and the continued imprisonment of President-elect Moshood Abiola and thousands of pro-democracy campaigners and human rights workers ushered in a new era of political repression that threatens to erupt into full-scale civil war. CPJ is working closely with Lagos-based journalists and has started a campaign to keep the endangered Nigerian press in the international spotlight. Rwanda and Burundi continued to be the most dangerous places on the African continent for journalists to work. Targeted by the government, the military and citizens for perceived ethnic alliances past and present, some journalists fled into exile. "Hate radio" was still used to incite ethnic violence, and government's attempts to shut it down proved futile. To counterbalance its effects, alternate broadcasting facilities have been created to provide information that is more ethnically neutral to refugees throughout the region. Broadcast media remain state owned throughout most of Africa, and governments show no signs of relinquishing their control of the airwaves. Because of high illiteracy rates, low incomes in high-inflation economies and large numbers of citizens living in the countryside, radio is still the most effective medium for reaching the majority of the continent's population. Economic factors--such as skyrocketing printing costs, the scarcity of advertising and the high cost of libel suits, fines and other forms of state harassment--continue to deter the growth of pluralism in the press. The events of 1995 have left the press at an unwelcome crossroads. The coming year will determine whether Africa's independent press backtracks to its earlier position of compromise, or whether it continues to fight for true freedom of expression. Kakuna Kerina is the program coordinator for Africa. An editor, author and award-winning documentary filmmaker, she has lived and studied in Ghana and Botswana and traveled throughout Africa. From October 1994 to September 1995, Jennifer Pogrund was the program coordinator for Africa. Avner Gidron, CPJ's director of research and program coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, wrote the Sudan section of the report. Special thanks to Thomas R. Lansner. Azeen Salimi, Nana Yaa Ofori-Atta and Elizabeth Mermin, CPJ research assistants, contributed extensively to this report. Country-by-country reports of attacks on the press in this region are available at CPJâs Web site and in the print edition of this book. SPECIAL REPORT The Retreat of Nigeria's Press: Tactical Withdrawal or Temporary Defeat? by a Special Correspondent to CPJ The Nigerian independent press is in deep crisis. Famous as the most vibrant on the African continent, Nigeria's independent media--especially its scrappy private press--is in retreat. A sanguine view is that this is a tactical withdrawal in the face of a particularly brutish military regime, and that the independent press will outlast Gen. Sani Abacha. Perhaps, but there are serious questions concerning the viability of the press and its relevance to the body politic. In a 136-year history, the Nigerian news media have evolved from endorsing the colonial missionary catechism through the spirited advocacy of the struggle for independence and moved on to its post-independence mission, defining its role within the state. Since 1960, the press has been asserting its relevance to the evolution of the Nigerian state, although for 25 of those 35 years it has operated under the malevolence of increasingly repressive military regimes. Its vital tradition of lively reportage, remarkable on the African continent, was nurtured within a political culture that tolerated dissent, especially as a mechanism for balancing the various ethnic and political forces battling for the center of the Nigerian state. This center, then and now, remains the federal government of Nigeria. Structured as a 30-state federation, Nigeria's de facto mechanism of governance remains integrated into a unitary structure. This arrangement endows the federal government, and therefore whoever heads it, with virtually complete control of the Nigerian state--and unfettered access to its treasury. The Nigerian news media--especially privately owned presses--have also been subject to the government's pull. Atop the pile, for now, sits Gen. Abacha, buoyed by the two million barrels of oil produced daily. But it is to his immediate predecessor, Gen. Babangida, under whom Abacha served as head of the army for nearly a decade, that credit must go for the systematic assault on the press. Babangida's regime appropriated and centralized an unprecedented measure of executive powers, weakening the existing counterweights of civil society. The regime systematically stripped the judiciary of its effectiveness, appropriated all legislative functions and neutralized virtually all organized dissent by the political class with the tantalizing promise of elections and the full restoration of democracy. The Nigerian media, in their classic role as public watchdogs and instrument of checks against the government's excesses, were particularly targeted by Babangida. In a sophisticated carrot-and-stick strategy, the government co-opted senior members of the media, corrupted many, coerced others and terrified some--driving scores into exile. It was under this regime that a top editor, Dele Giwa, was assassinated by a letter bomb in March 1986 and various publications were proscribed by executive fiat. In 1993, in the aftermath of Babangida's nullification of the June 12 elections, the Nigerian news media's sustained campaign helped lead to the coup that unseated him. Babangida's successor, Abacha, takes a more ham-fisted approach to muzzling the press. This era may be the last for the generals, and his regime's survival depends on strategically silencing the last organized domestic opposition to military rule. Until today, conflicts between the media and the state were resolved through backdoor negotiations and/or judicial intervention. Although many journalists have been fined and, in a few instances, jailed for plying their craft in defiance of military regimes, social pressures have historically limited the degree to which the state could be punitive. Potential flash points were defused through the mediation of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (whose members include both government and independent press), as well as a handful of quasi-autonomous guilds and councils that regulated the media. This relationship between the government and the media, already badly frayed by the Babangida era, was obliterated in March 1995 when four journalists--Christine Anyanwu, publisher and editor in chief of The Sunday Magazine; Ben Charles Obi, editor of Weekend Classique; Kunle Ajibade, editor in chief of TheNEWS; and George Mbah, assistant editor of Tell magazine--were among 42 people (mostly military personnel) arrested and charged with attempting to stage a military coup against the Abacha government. The four were tried before a secret military tribunal and sentenced to 25 years to life imprisonment. Several prominent human rights and civil rights activists were also arrested and charged with participating in plotting the coup. They might well have been executed if national and international groups had not pressured the junta to commute their sentences. The Abacha regime, in its crude attempt at instituting a totalitarian order, has finally drawn the press into its vortex. This unprecedented infringement on the rights of civilians is the current military dictatorship's desperate attempt to secure its own survival by employing the full resources of the Nigerian government. But even the Abacha regime is not omnipotent. In today's exquisite political balancing act, the sentences of the journalists imprisoned for allegedly plotting the coup were reduced from life imprisonment or 25 years to 15 years. And in his October Independence Day address, Gen. Abacha removed the ban on the Punch Group and the Concord Group, two prominent news media chains that were put out of circulation for more than a year. A third, the Guardian Group, was unbanned in July only after its owners were forced to offer a personal apology to Abacha himself. Last November, seeming to defy world opinion, the regime executed the author and television producer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni human rights activists. But, with these acts, it was clearly playing to a domestic gallery--attempting to reassert control after backing down by commuting the sentences of those who allegedly plotted the coup. As the Abacha regime attempts to exercise control of the Nigerian polity, it is occasionally forced to retreat by the press, other remaining pockets of civil opposition and the uneven pressure of international sanctions. But the military blunders on. During Christmas week, State Security Service agents arrested Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of Tell magazine, Nigeria's leading newsweekly. (Igiebor was the recipient of the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award in 1993.) The agents also confiscated 55,000 copies of the magazine and forced its managing editor, Onome Osifo-Whiskey, into hiding. In a related incident, the office of the recently unbanned The Guardian was attacked and torched by men armed with machine guns. Tell magazine released a statement shortly after the arrests and attacks saying, "State terrorism and acts of brutal intimidation will not force us to compromise our belief in freedom, justice and the rule of law." This might well be the battle cry of the Nigerian news media. While the responsibility of the media to the polity remains clear, their ability to function effectively has been seriously compromised. In the best of times, the many structural inadequacies of the system were mitigated by the intellectual brilliance and commitment of a corps of top-notch journalists that kept the national debate lively and engaging. During the last decade, however, an entire generation of journalists fled Nigeria, alongside the country's best and brightest professionals in every field. Those who chose to remain behind, like Dapo Olorunyomi, editor in chief of TheNEWS, and Nosa Igiebor, in addition to facing off the military, must contend with a depleting stock of experienced and well-trained journalists. The rejuvenation of the press as an element of civil society is tied to the overall need to reinvent a democratic post-Abacha Nigeria, and hence a postmilitary era. The gradual erosion of democratic structures over a quarter-century of military misrule, cascading into an avalanche under this present regime, is the prevailing reason for the Nigerian news media's retreat. But the media's current position may be a tactical withdrawal: The Abacha regime has been forced to announce plans for a transition to democracy, but the full implementation of those plans might be well beyond this government's control and tenure. The author of this report, a Nigerian journalist based in New York, writes for international newspapers and magazines. | More | (c) 1996 Committee to Protect Journalists. All rights reserved.

But in doing so, the news media became targets of retaliation from the corrupt ruling classes, politicians and criminals who often were the focus of their stories. During the year, 10 journalists were killed because of their work, and one other murder is unconfirmed; and in at least 60 other incidents, journalists were imprisoned, beaten, shot at or threatened with death. The level of violence against the press was not as high as it had been in previous years, but the involvement of organized crime became a worrisome new trend, especially in Guatemala, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Paraguay. Even in Canada, where criminal biker gangs have built up a profitable market in barbiturates, a reporter was shot in the knees by gang members angered by his coverage of their drug dealing. In countries like Guatemala and Colombia, where criminals have acted with impunity for decades as a result of the judicial disorder caused by civil strife, many attacks against the press were carried out with the knowledge or participation of corrupt army and police officers. Guatemalan army officers known to have committed human rights violations during the civil war, for instance, have stepped into criminal rings of kidnappers, car thieves and drug traffickers. Journalists who took on these issues faced abuses that were sometimes filed away as common crimes but which ultimately were tied to their work. A similar pattern evolved along the U.S.-Mexico border, where cases of overnment officials are the suspected assassins or intellectual authors of the killings. All the murders occurred in the interior of the country--further evidence that although a free and robust press works unabated in principal cities, provincial reporters work with little protection. In Brazil, where four journalists were killed for uncovering corruption and environmental abuses, policemen and local government officials are the suspected assassins or intellectual authors of the killings. All the murders occurred in the interior of the country--further evidence that although a free and robust press works unabated in principal cities, provincial reporters work with little protection. The governments of Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile tried to introduce legislation restricting the news media. In Argentina and Chile, where the press has won considerable leverage, these efforts were thwarted by public protests from influential media organizations. At year's end, the government of Colombian President Ernesto Samper, who continued to rule despite serious allegations that he received money from drug cartels, imposed press restrictions that forbade the media from carrying any statements made by leftist guerrillas, drug traffickers and common criminals. By the end of 1995, Peru was the only country in the hemisphere with imprisoned journalists. Eight who were unfairly accused of collaborating with terrorists remain in jail, serving sentences of up to 20 years. Good news came from Costa Rica, where the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the licensing of journalists. The decision ended a 30-year reign by the Colegio de Periodistas, which had ruled that only journalists with a Costa Rican university degree could work legally in the country. Costa Rica's licensing model is one that has been in use or under serious consideration in several other Latin American countries, and it is hoped that the court ruling will encourage other nations to reconsider the licensing issue. In another positive development, journalists in several countries organized to combat attacks on the media. Most of these efforts were modeled after the Peruvian Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), which, since its inception in 1994, has helped reduce press abuses in Peru with timely intervention and international backing. In Colombia, a group of journalists led by Nobel laureate Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez created a press defense committee at a meeting co-sponsored by CPJ. And in Cuba, independent journalists created their own press agencies and fought for the right to publish their work outside the country since the state-run media will not accept stories from reporters blacklisted by the government. Ana Arana was program coordinator for the Americas from December 1993 until December 1995. Before coming to CPJ, Arana covered Latin America as a free-lance correspondent for several newspapers and magazines, including the Miami Herald, the Baltimore Sun and U.S. News & World Report. She also worked as a senior correspondent for the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel and was a staff reporter at the San Jose Mercury News. A native Spanish speaker, Arana has a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University. Mira Gajevic, the research associate for the Americas, researched and wrote the majority of the 1995 cases for the region. She has a master's degree in political science from the University of Mainz in Germany and has studied in Argentina. She is fluent in German and Spanish. CPJ's work in the Americas in 1995 was funded in part by a grant from the Robert R. McCormick Tribune Foundation. Country-by-country reports of attacks on the press in this region are available at CPJ's Web site and in the print edition of this book. SPECIAL REPORT Cuba: Seeds of a Free Pressby Ana Arana Ever since the Cuban revolution 36 years ago, the Castro government has viewed the press as its mouthpiece; media censorship has been as much a part of Cuban life as food lines. But that notion is being challenged by a group of out-of-work, independent journalists who were fired from their official jobs because of irreverent thinking about the revolution and its future. They have begun to market stories in the United States and Europe about their nation via the Bureau of Independent Press of Cuba (BPIC), a sort of clearinghouse that was founded by the journalist Yndamiro Restano, who was recently released from prison. Independent journalism, even for overseas audiences, remains a dangerous task. In October, as President Fidel Castro wined and dined in New York City during the United Nations' 50th anniversary celebrations, Olance Nogueras Roce, a 27-year-old reporter working for BPIC, was detained four times, placed under house arrest and threatened with a prison term for spreading news that allegedly undermined "international peace." Nogueras' offense was writing a story that was widely distributed by BPIC on the potential safety problems at Cuba's Juraguas nuclear plant. Nogueras was told to leave the country or face persecution. He refused, and his colleagues fear that his case will be used as a test by the government as it attempts to control them. Still, Restano maintains that Castro has given independent journalism some room to operate. "It is very small, but we must keep it open," he says. One thing that has changed, despite the danger, is the building of an esprit de corps among the journalists. In recent months, in an effort to create a semblance of a free press, they have formed or revitalized small, loosely organized journalists' groups with names like Havana Press and Cuba Press. And throughout the Nogueras episode, for example, Rafael Solano, who runs Havana Press, continued filing stories through BPIC about Nogueras' situation. (Solano had been at the pinnacle of Cuban journalism, writing news for Cuba's most important radio station, when he was fired in early 1995.) Restano's release from prison in June 1995 was the catalyst for the new solidarity among independent Cuban journalists. Back in 1985, Restano had challenged the concept of state-controlled media and was banished from official journalism, forcing him to work menial jobs. He went on to found Cuba's first nonofficial journalism organization in 1987. He later founded a human rights movement seeking peaceful political change and was sentenced to prison for distributing information about it. A campaign by the Committee to Protect Journalists and other press freedom organizations and the direct intercession of Danielle Mitterrand, wife of France's former president, led to his release. Afterwards, Restano traveled in Europe and Latin America and found there was great interest in the little-known world of dissident Cuban journalists. At the annual meeting of the Inter American Press Association (IAPA) on Oct. 15, leading Latin American and U.S. publishers accepted the journalists' application for membership. Several IAPA members have since published articles by the dissidents. "We believe that our support for their cause at this moment is elementary for their future survival," says David Lawrence, Jr., publisher of the Miami Herald and the new president of IAPA. Restano and his colleagues hope that eventually they will be able to launch an independent radio station or newspaper inside Cuba. "That's the goal that keeps us going," he says. Cubans in general have lost respect for state news, but the alternatives are generally not politically independent either. Most of the population listen to Miami radio stations, which are often owned or operated by hard-line Cuban exiles. Even the U.S. government-sponsored Radio MartÃ­ has as its chairman Jorge Mas Canosa, the controversial Cuban exile who opposes any opening to Cuba while Castro is in power. Can an independent press project survive in Cuba? Restano and his colleagues believe so. "It is the only way we can help change our system from an authoritarian government to a democratic one, without violence," he says. "A free press could help keep the good things the revolution brought to our society and get rid of the bad ones." Ana Arana was the Americas program coordinator from December 1993 to December 1995.

Volatile situations became more so, and authoritarian regimes lived up to their reputations; but journalists in the few nascent democracies reaped the benefits of continued liberalization. Conditions deteriorated most dramatically in Pakistan, where a large and vibrant press community faced violent attacks, police harassment, newspaper bans and defamation suits. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto quickly decried several of the more glaring assaults but did little to stop the abuses. A case in point was the vandalizing of the BBC's Islamabad offices and the assault on its correspondents. Although a fundamentalist party acknowledged responsibility for the attack, authorities took no steps to prosecute the perpetrators or their leadership, which supports the ruling party in Punjab province. The press fared little better in neighboring Indian-held Kashmir. Journalists there were subjected to raids and interrogations by Indian troops; they also faced kidnappings, threats and forced shutdowns by militant separatists and an allegedly Indian-backed counterinsurgency force. Because so many are party to the conflict, accountability is easily evaded. Both a bomb explosion in the BBC's Srinagar offices that killed a local photojournalist and the abduction and shooting of a prominent Kashmiri reporter remained unresolved at year's end. Despite two years of multiparty government, Cambodia became increasingly autocratic. Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, the country's emerging strongman, spoke approvingly of a mob that attacked an opposition newspaper, and his government initiated criminal defamation suits that threatened to close several others. Underscoring these actions was a new press law. Widely condemned by local and international press groups, it allowed authorities to temporarily shut down newspapers and incorporated an ill-defined national security clause that exposed virtually all political writers to criminal prosecution. Indonesia closed the door on an experiment of its own. A crackdown on the country's independent press that began with the June 1994 ban of three leading newsweeklies continued with the conviction and sentencing of three journalists for publishing underground magazines that were critical of the Suharto regime. One of the writers, Ahmad Taufik, president of the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI), was given a 1995 International Press Freedom Award by CPJ. AJI has been at the forefront of defending press freedom in Indonesia, and more than 80 of its members have lost their jobs due to government pressure on their editors. China, equally indifferent to international opprobrium, reincarcerated two of its most prominent dissident writers: Wei Jingsheng and Chen Ziming. Both had defended freedom of expression during their brief periods out of jail. The country's leaders also seized control of financial information channels, forcing Western news wires to distribute their business reports through the official Xinhua News Agency. The move followed a purge of the country's increasingly autonomous television stations, two of which were shut down, with warnings issued to several others. Singapore's Orwellian government continued to keep its domestic press firmly in line. But its rancorous relationship with the foreign media soured further with local courts twice fining the International Herald Tribune for publishing opinion pieces that questioned the government's claims of judicial independence and bureaucratic meritocracy. Authorities also took on the Internet, which provided a rare forum for dissidence in Singapore. Rather than restricting access to the Net, however, they flooded it with pro-government postings. East Asia's two emerging democracies, Taiwan and South Korea, offered unheeded models to their neighbors. While government control over much of the broadcast media in Taiwan and a repressive national security law in South Korea limited press freedom in both countries, both showed notable gains during the year. Taiwan ended a 10-month crackdown on pirate radio broadcasters, after a protest by CPJ, and licensed the country's first private, pro-opposition television station. Meanwhile, South Korea's press called former and current political leaders to account in a mushrooming corruption scandal. Vikram Parekh is the program coordinator for Asia.

SPECIAL REPORT On a Razor's Edge: Local Journalists Targeted by Warring Parties in Kashmir by Vikram Parekh For half a century, Indian newspapers and magazines have enjoyed a degree of real independence unrivaled in the developing world. Literally thousands of ideologically and ethnically diverse periodicals circulate freely with little or no official interference. Yet in the embattled northwestern state of Jammu and Kashmir, press freedom is under attack. Local reporters covering the decades-old secessionist movement there routinely face legal harassment, physical assaults, abductions and the threat of assassination. They work under a state of siege: News offices resemble bunkers, and journalists live in fear of Indian troops, armed separatists and, more recently, counterinsurgency forces. Put simply, there is no freedom of the press in Kashmir today. That is the central conclusion of a 1995 CPJ report, which documents dozens of cases of intimidation, arbitrary detention, physical assault and murders of local Kashmiri reporters. The following is an updated excerpt from that report, which is based on extensive firsthand research by Asia Program Coordinator Vikram Parekh, including his three-week fact-finding trip to the region in the spring of 1995. [For a copy of the complete report, please contact CPJ.] On Sept. 7, 1995, an unidentified woman clad in an enveloping black burkha delivered a package to the office of Yusuf Jameel, the Srinagar correspondent for the BBC and Reuters. Jameel was on the phone at the time, and his colleague Mushtaq Ali, an Agence France-Presse photographer, opened the package for him. The helpful gesture proved deadly. The parcel exploded, severing Ali's left hand, disfiguring his face and severely injuring his right hand and abdomen. He died of his wounds three days later. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, and the case remains unresolved. Ali was the fifth Kashmiri journalist to be murdered since 1990, when a long-running dispute over sovereignty in Kashmir escalated into an all-out war between separatist militants and Indian government forces. The warring parties have often viewed local journalists and the news outlets they work for as mouthpieces of their adversaries and have made it a part of their offensive to intimidate the media into reporting their particular view at the expense of all others. This tug-of-war over the press has resulted in a variety of attacks against journalists, the most brutal of which has been assassination. Each of the five murders of journalists since 1990 has had a profound impact on the local press community. Two of them involved journalists working for local branches of the broadcast media, which, as entirely state-owned enterprises, are frequent targets of militant attacks. The 1990 murder of Lassa Kaul, director of the government-owned Doordarshan television station in Srinagar, prompted the station's closure for a three-year period, while the 1993 slaying of Radio Kashmir news reader Mohammad Shafi Bhat sparked a wave of resignations by his colleagues. The unsolved April 1991 murder of Al-Safa editor in chief Mohammad Shaban Vakil served to mute local journalists' criticism of Kashmiri militants, whom many suspect killed him. And the August 1994 murder of stringer Ghulam Mohammed Lone has had a chilling effect on stringers working in outlying areas of the Kashmir Valley, where most human rights abuses by Indian troops are said to occur. Lack of Access and Transparency Other forms of abuse by both government forces and insurgent militias have proved equally debilitating for the local press. Indian troops regularly subject print journalists to raids, detentions and interrogations, both to identify their contacts within militant groups and to reprimand them for disclosing human rights violations by military and police forces. In a few cases, journalists have even reported being beaten and tortured while in official custody. Local journalists also charge that security forces deny them access to several key areas, notably towns within five kilometers from the line of control between India and Pakistan, places where cordon-and-search operations are being conducted, and areas where government and militant forces are at a standoff. Indian human rights activists echo their complaints, saying the access restrictions prevent reporters from independently verifying many alleged human rights abuses. "One of the ways of ensuring transparency, we have argued, is to allow press people to be present during crackdowns," said Tappan Bose of the Delhi-based Committee for Initiative on Kashmir. The destruction in May 1995 of the Sufi shrine at Charar-e-Sharif, a town located about 25 kilometers from Srinagar, offers perhaps the best illustration of Bose's point. In mid-March, authorities banned all reporters from visiting the town, where, since January, Harkat-ul-Ansar and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militants had been occupying the 15th-century shrine. The shrine was besieged by Indian army troops soon after the militants set up camp. The siege ended, however, in the second week of May, when fires of undetermined origin gutted the shrine and most of the surrounding town. Because of the ban on reporting in the area, no independent accounts of the shrine's destruction were available. In the tragedy's immediate aftermath, reporters were allowed no closer than one kilometer from the town's ruins and then only under army escort. And at week's end, a curfew effectively confined visiting reporters to their hotel during a fact-finding visit by Indian Home Minister S.B. Chavan and Finance Minister Manmohan Singh. Authorities were also extremely sparing in their disclosures to the press. During CPJ's visit to Kashmir, a wire-service correspondent said that the government had issued only one statement on the Charar-e-Sharif tragedy, "and that was an announcement that they were giving safe passage to the militants." This paucity of real information from officials has been long-standing, according to another reporter. "Since 1991, the police department has issued handouts that give you half-truths or lies regarding the security developments," he said. "We don't get anything else." Forced to Please a Thousand Masters The Kashmiri separatist movement embraces nine major--and over 100 minor--militant groups, all of whom have attempted to intimidate local journalists. Militant groups periodically fire rockets at radio and television stations and have coerced most of the Kashmiri staff to leave their posts. And through threats, circulation "bans" and forced closures, militants also compel local newspapers to publish their groups' statements on a daily basis. But because of the intense rivalries within the militant movement, which includes pro-Pakistan Islamists--many of whom are reportedly armed and trained by Pakistan--and proponents of an independent, secular Jammu and Kashmir, the press must carefully negotiate the conflicting demands of these parties. Until recently, mediation was possible through a separatist umbrella group, the All-Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC), to which most of the leading militant parties belong. Now, however, the pot has been stirred by the emergence of militias that many observers believe are allied with the Indian army, if not outrightly supported by it. Their main targets have been hard-line Islamist militants, especially the pro-Pakistan Hizb-ul-Mujahideen. The best known of these "counterinsurgency" forces is the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon, led by a former timber smuggler known as Koka Parray. The emergence of militias like Parray's has made it more difficult to assess responsibility for recent attacks on the press. And, more critically, it has offered the Indian army and the armed separatists a convenient excuse to absolve themselves of accountability. A case in point is the December 1995 shooting of Zafar Meraj, a respected print and broadcast reporter. Meraj was abducted by gunmen, shot in the abdomen and abandoned by the roadside in a remote part of the Kashmir Valley. At the time of his abduction, Meraj was returning from an interview with Parray for the Hong Kong-based Zee Television--a fact that led some to view Parray as the guilty party. But Meraj told colleagues that his abductors faulted him for allowing "an Indian informant" to air his views. Still others suggest the possibility that it was Parray's men who seized Meraj and that they had defamed their leader in order to cast suspicion elsewhere. When the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon abducted two Srinagar editors in July, it did not release them until the entire Srinagar press agreed to print a statement by Parray criticizing the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen. Local newspapers and their readers paid a high price for that decision: an enraged Hizb-ul-Mujahideen forcibly closed one of the local printing presses and seized copies of local dailies in which the statement appeared. The press community promptly launched a protest strike, and for nearly one month no papers were printed in the capital. Throughout those four weeks, Kashmiri journalists had nowhere to turn but to the antagonists themselves. The APHC was reluctant to restrain its most powerful constituent in the face of a challenge from a group that it saw as an Indian front. And, despite reports to the contrary in the Indian and Western presses, the Indian government denied having any links to, or influence over, the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon. Defying a History of Abuse One person who symbolizes the predicament Kashmiri journalists face is the doyen of Kashmir's Urdu-language press, Khwaja Sanaullah Bhat, founder and editor in chief of the daily Aftab. His newspaper is the oldest in the Valley and has steadfastly maintained its independence over a 38-year period. The small, nondescript building housing Aftab, which is at some remove from Srinagar's residential journalist compound, resembles a bunker, much like those set up by Indian troops throughout the city. Entry to the paper's offices is blocked by a desk in the main doorway and a phalanx of staff members. Beyond them lie still more desks strategically placed to obstruct access to a maze-like corridor that ultimately leads to Bhat's office. In April 1990, the governor of Jammu and Kashmir ordered Aftab closed after the paper reported at length about a series of massacres by Indian forces. And even though a court ruling overturned the governor's order 10 days after it was issued, Bhat has continued to work under great duress, suffering frequent raids on his offices by Indian troops and the burning of his house by militants in August 1993. Bhat's perseverance and the survival of Aftab are not unusual in Kashmir, which, despite the pressures imposed by the conflict, remains home to a flourishing press community. Within Srinagar, a city of only 650,000, there are 12 major dailies, 30 smaller ones and 20 weekly newspapers. The Urdu-language press, which includes 10 of the major dailies, saw a mushrooming of new publications after the 1989 uprising, and consequently many of them have a broadly pro-militant cast, as does the valley-based English-language daily Greater Kashmir and its recently launched sister publication, The Mirror. The state's two other English dailies--the politically independent Kashmir Times and the pro-government Excelsior--are both published in the winter capital of Jammu; of these, only the Kashmir Times boasts a statewide readership and a Srinagar news bureau. What makes the survival of the Kashmiri press all the more remarkable is that it has regularly faced attempts to suppress it during the state's nearly 50-yearlong struggle over sovereignty. And some of the tactics now used to intimidate the press, including the repressive Public Safety Act under which a journalist may be detained without charge for up to two years, clearly echo past abuses. According to veteran Kashmiri journalist O.N. Kaul, his newspaper, the New Kashmir Post, was banned at the outset of the administration of G.M. Sadiq in 1964, and Kaul was jailed for 92 days immediately thereafter under the Defense of India Rules. Accused of "conspiring with the enemy," Kaul says his only offense had been pointing out how minimal the changeover in personnel had been between Sadiq's regime and that of his predecessor, which Sadiq had charged with corruption. Sadiq's heavy hand was the result, in part, of the power accorded him by India's central government, which appointed Sadiq as well as several other state leaders since 1953. Most of the elections that the state has managed to hold, including the last in 1987, have been widely denounced as fraudulent. And with the dismissal of Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah in January 1990, and the simultaneous dissolution of Jammu and Kashmir's legislative assembly, the state was once again placed under federal rule. Since then, periodic proposals to hold elections have been shelved due to continued unrest in the valley. In November 1994, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao transferred decision-making authority over Kashmir from the Home Minister's office to a newly established Department of Jammu and Kashmir Affairs, headed by Rao himself. Major policy decisions about Kashmir are now made by the prime minister, with input from the Department's Joint Secretaries Madhukar Gupta and C. Phunsog, as well as the federally appointed state governor, former Indian Army Chief K.V. Krishna Rao. Federal control in Kashmir is also exercised through the Indian Parliament, which plays a significant role in determining the extent of civil liberties in Kashmir through its power to designate regions within the state "disturbed areas." Among other emergency measures, such a designation allows police and army officers to conduct warrantless raids on newspaper offices as well as the private homes of journalists and other citizens. Taking Steps to Improve Working Conditions for Kashmiri Journalists Whatever the outcome of the conflict in Kashmir--be it autonomy under Indian rule or a plebiscite to determine sovereignty--all of the parties acknowledge the need for a transition to self-government in some form. If the transitional process is to be free and fair, the norms of press freedom must prevail in the state as they do in the rest of India. It is therefore imperative that all parties to the conflict act immediately to end the attacks and restrictions on the local press. The Indian government, which claims that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India, must accordingly ensure that Kashmiri journalists enjoy the same rights and privileges as their counterparts in the national press. CPJ therefore calls on the Indian government to: Lift all access restrictions immediately; Cease warrantless raids on journalists' homes and offices and honor their right to maintain the confidentiality of their sources; Bring disciplinary action against Indian security officers who have threatened or attacked journalists for their work, which includes reporting on the activities of militants; Revoke Jammu and Kashmir's Public Safety Act (PSA), which can be used to detain journalists (or anyone else) without charge for two years; and Sever all ties to counterinsurgency forces that attack the press. Reports indicate that the government of Pakistan aids militant groups that have repeatedly harassed and intimidated the local press community. CPJ therefore calls on the government of Pakistan to: Cut off all forms of military and political aid to militant groups that perpetrate attacks on print or broadcast media. The all-party hurriyat Conference (APHC), an umbrella organization of more than 30 separatist parties, should endorse the principle of press freedom and work to ensure that its constituent groups honor the right of journalists to pursue their profession. Hence, CPJ calls on the leadership of the APHC to: Issue an unequivocal statement condemning threats to, attacks on and forced closures of print and broadcast media alike; and Promptly expel from the APHC parties whose militant wings continue to harass and intimidate the local press. Lastly, and most fundamentally, what is called for from all parties is a basic shift in perspective. Underlying the problems of accountability and transparency is the manner in which the combatants perceive the local news media. Indian government forces and militant groups regard the Kashmiri press and broadcast media, respectively, as aiding and abetting their principal adversaries. Rather than seeing local reporters and editors as accessories in the Kashmir conflict, all sides need to recognize them as working professionals, regardless of who their employers might be. Otherwise, Kashmiri journalists will continue to live and work, as several put it, "on a razor's edge."

But this victory for free expression and the people's right to know has been heavily qualified nearly everywhere as governments have sought to influence the newly independent media, and journalists have been put at risk by the hazards of war and the growing pressure of organized crime. The press is clearly the most democratic institution in Russia, but in 1995 journalists received repeated ominous reminders that they are physically and politically vulnerable and cannot rely on the protection of the law. Vladislav Listyev, perhaps the most popular television personality in the country, was murdered in the hallway of his apartment building on March 1 in what was almost certainly a contract killing. And Natalya Alyakina, a free-lance correspondent for German news outlets, was shot dead in June by a soldier after clearing a Russian checkpoint near the southern Russian city of Budyonnovsk. In both cases, there are indications that the authorities are making no serious attempt to bring those responsible to justice. The Russian press was further threatened by government pressure and the power of commercial interests as its own economic position grew steadily worse. NTV, Russia's largest financially and editorially independent television network, was threatened with losing its license over its unflinching reporting on the Chechen conflict. A criminal case was also opened against the NTV political satire show "Kukly" (Puppets), over a program in which government leaders were depicted as mendicant tramps. In some cases, the Russian press found itself beholden to sponsors or wealthy benefactors who tried--often successfully--to "buy" positive coverage for projects in which they were financially interested. In Central Asia, the situation for journalists was dire. In Tajikistan, a rash of murders of journalists that left 27 dead since May 1992 appeared to have ended with the last killing in November 1994. But then on Dec. 12, 1995, Mohyedin Alempour, the head of the BBC's Persian Service bureau, was killed in Dushanbe with a single shot to the head. In Uzbekistan, censors operating through the State Committee on the Press eliminated critical articles and screened newspapers for anything else that might be interpreted as anti-regime. In the Caucasus region, the press was frequently subject to prior censorship. But even in cases where the circulation of a newspaper was so low that the publication was not censored in advance, its contents were monitored carefully. In Azerbaijan, four journalists working for Chesme, a satirical newspaper with a very limited print run, were arrested and sentenced to jail terms for "insulting the dignity" of President Geidar Aliyev by publishing caricatures of him. Although journalists in the European republics of the former Soviet Union and in Central Europe were less likely to face physical attacks, they were often exposed to government pressure. In Belarus, for instance, newspapers continued to appear with blank spaces because of censorship, and the government deprived several independent newspapers of printing rights at state-run facilities. In Romania, criminal proceedings were started against two journalists in connection with the publication of articles in which they alleged that President Ion Iliescu was recruited as a KGB agent while he was a student in Moscow. And in Albania, publication of the monthly humor magazine Hostini was halted after the secret police learned that the magazine was preparing to publish a caricature of President Sali Berisha. In the former Yugoslavia, both the Croatian and Serb governments tried to put pressure on newspapers and other media outlets through bureaucratic means. And in Bosnia, journalists continued to be at high risk of being killed either by land mines, in the cross fire or as a result of deliberate targeting. There were also several cases of journalists being captured and used as hostages by Bosnian Serb fighters. David Satter is the program coordinator for Central Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union. A former Moscow correspondent for the Financial Times of London, he has written widely on Russia and the former Soviet Union for many years and is fluent in Russian. His book, Age of Delirium: The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Union, will be published in the spring of 1996 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. Amanda Onion, the research associate for Central Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union, researched and wrote the majority of the 1995 cases for the region and several of the country summaries. Previously she worked as a free-lance journalist in Moscow and New York. She has a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University and is fluent in Russian. Leonid Zagalsky was the program coordinator for the region from October 1993 until June 1995. Yalman Onaran, a research associate until June 1995, researched and wrote several of the cases for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Yugoslavia.

SPECIAL REPORT Hunting for Mass Graves Behind Serb Lines by David Rohde The following article is Christian Science Monitor reporter David Rohde's chronicle of how he was captured by the Bosnian Serbs in October 1995 as he was investigating sites of mass executions near Zvornik. Charged with illegally entering Bosnian Serb territory and falsifying documents, Rohde was the first journalist to be tried and convicted of crimes by the Bosnian Serbs in retaliation for his reporting. After two weeks in captivity, he was pardoned and released on Nov. 8 as a result of efforts by several parties, including his family, the U.S. State Department, the Christian Science Monitor, the United Nations, the International Red Cross and CPJ's chair, Kati Marton, who met with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic three times at the Dayton, Ohio, peace talks to pressure him to secure Rohde's freedom. This article first appeared in the December 1995 issue of the OPC Bulletin, the monthly publication of the Overseas Press Club. It has been slightly amended and is reprinted with permission. At the first Bosnian Serb checkpoint, everything started to go wrong. The Serb soldiers who normally let foreign journalists drive on their own to the nearby military barracks and request a press accreditation insisted they ride with me. I said I knew the way, but one young soldier circled around the car and opened the passenger side door. I shouted, "I know ... I know" in Serbian. He shrugged, shut the door and waved me through. I had no intention of stopping at the barracks. I didn't want a new Bosnian Serb press accreditation--a small, flimsy, unlaminated cardboard card with the name and date of issue and expiration filled in with ball point pen. An old accreditation that I had changed the date of issue on was hidden in the car. I had never doctored an accreditation before, but the Bosnian Serbs had turned down repeated requests from the United Nations, the International War Crimes Tribunal and journalists for free access to the areas around Srebrenica and Zepa since the two U.N.-declared "safe areas" fell in July. And a U.S. intelligence source told me the Bosnian Serbs had been seen tampering with--and possibly destroying evidence of--one of the mass graves I wanted to investigate. There was no other way to get to the graves and I had been told by Serb friends that I was on a Bosnian Serb "blacklist" for my past reporting and would never be allowed to enter their territory again. In August, I visited the site of two possible mass graves near Srebrenica identified by U.S. aerial photos. I found a decomposed human leg, a diploma and personal photos with Muslim names on them and documents from Srebrenica. In September, I'd found nine credible survivors of mass executions who had made it from Srebrenica to Muslim-held Central Bosnia. They described the mass execution of thousands of prisoners at a half-dozen locations. A few days before my trip in October, an intelligence source had given me the exact locations of four other possible mass graves around Srebrenica identified by U.S. spy planes and satellites. Landmarks the survivors said were near the execution sites--such as dams and railroad tracks--matched the locations the intelligence source had given me. After the problems at the first checkpoint, the three-hour drive to the sites went smoothly. I was forced at one checkpoint to give a Bosnian Serb soldier a ride for 30 miles, but made it to the first site near the village of Sahanici by early afternoon. I found a school whose layout and surroundings exactly matched a school survivors said was used to hold prisoners before they were taken in groups of 10 to 15 to the execution site. A half-mile away, I found two large areas of fresh digging on either side of railroad tracks--exactly where my intelligence source and the survivors had said they would be. More than 100 civilians' jackets with no bullet holes in them were hidden in the woods 100 feet away. There were no indications of a battle being fought. An ID from Srebrenica, an ID and photos with Muslim names on them and three canes were found in the pile of jackets. One of the areas of fresh digging reeked of rotting flesh. U.S. intelligence officials said the graves I had visited in Nova Kasabs could have held approximately 600 bodies. These appeared slightly larger and held probably 800 bodies. I took photos, hid the IDs in the car and headed for a second execution site next to a nearby earthen dam, according to two other survivors I interviewed. I fruitlessly searched an area east of the dam for 30 minutes, found nothing, and then saw an old man walking in the distance with a dog. I decided to check one last area--a second gravel plateau--which fit the survivors' description of where the massacre took place. I pulled up onto the plateau and saw two human femurs lying on the gravel and other small objects in the distance. As I stepped out of the car to take a photo of them, I heard the old man--who I thought had simply walked by the dam--shout. He was on top of the dam pointing a rifle at me. I was finished. The old man, who I then realized was guarding the dam, arrested me and called the local police. Five days of interrogation at a local police station followed, with the Bosnian Serbs convinced I was a spy sent by the Muslim-led Bosnian government or NATO to take pictures of or blow up the earthen dam. The detailed U.N. military maps they found on me had marks indicating where the graves were. I knew carrying the maps would be dangerous but also knew being able to quickly find the graves was crucial. I carried all of my press accreditation cards--including numerous Bosnian and Croatian government ones that angered the Serbs--but they ended up being crucial to countering the espionage suspicions. Most importantly, they bought me time. The maps quickly became my biggest problem. The Serbs were convinced only a spy could obtain and read military maps and penetrate so deeply into their territory. Even after I admitted I was looking for mass graves and the Serbs told me they knew of my past stories, they insisted I was also on the CIA payroll. It wasn't until after they had developed my film, found the Muslim IDs and conducted five days of interrogation--which included one night of not allowing me to sleep--that the Serbs publicly admitted they were holding me. In the end, the photos of mass graves--not of military installations as the Serbs suspected--may have saved my life. I made many, many mistakes, but by far the biggest was going on the trip alone. I had never traveled on my own in Bosnia and deeply regret a decision that I did not fully think through. I did not take a translator because it would be unfair to place anyone in so much danger, and I could get by with my Serbian. I also turned down an opportunity to bring a reporter from the New York Times with me for competitive reasons. In retrospect, I should have waited and found a British or French reporter to accompany me. But Sarajevo was empty at the time, and I was eager to make the trip on Sunday, Oct. 29--the day before peace talks began in Dayton, Ohio. I reached the graves I wanted to, and the Serbs again followed their long-running pattern of harassing, but not harming, Western civilians, as I hoped. In the end, it was a calculated risk worth taking. SPECIAL REPORT Murdering with Impunity in Russia: Authorities Fail to Prosecute the Murders of Seven Journalists by David Satter In post-Communist Russia, journalists are no longer threatened with long labor camp sentences for writing freely. But they risk their lives if they report on organized crime or corruption in the armed forces or if the financial interests of their media organization bring them into conflict with a corrupt group. In the last two years, at least seven Russian journalists were deliberately murdered and six of these murders had the hallmarks of contract killings, a category of murder in which Russia now leads the entire world. More unsettling than the killings themselves, however, has been the attitude of the Russian authorities. Despite the fact that a number of the murdered journalists have been national celebrities, there has been little effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. Instead, after a journalist is murdered, an investigation begins, sometimes with considerable fanfare, and the effort then fades amid signs that investigators are being hampered by interference at a high official level. Presently, nearly all legitimate private business in Russia is controlled by or forced to pay extortion money to organized crime. There are an estimated 5,000 criminal gangs, 300 mob bosses and 150 illegal organizations with international ties in the country. The prevalence of corruption and organized crime, in fact, means that investigative journalism is very necessary to Russia but little is carried out. The reason is simple, said Yevgenia Albats, a reporter for Izvestia and the author of the book A State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia, Past, Present and Future. "If you do journalism that deals with certain sensitive issues, you can easily get killed." According to Shod Muladjanov, editor of Moskovskaya Pravda, "We [journalists] are in a fight against the gangs. They have a hand on us wherever they are, in the Kremlin, in the government, in the television industry.... And no law enforcement body in the country protects our rights." On Oct. 17, 1994, Dmitry Kholodov, a 27-year-old investigative reporter for Moskovski Komsomolets, Moscow's largest daily newspaper, entered the paper's offices with an attachÃ© case left for him at the Kazan Station. "Vadim," he shouted, to Vadim Poegli, the newspaper's deputy editor, "I think I've got something." Moments later, in the room where Kholodov had gone to study the contents of the briefcase, the attachÃ© case exploded, leaving Kholodov mortally injured, the lower part of his body shattered by the force of the blast. The death of Kholodov stunned Russian journalists, who were horrified not only by the crime itself but by the brazen way it was carried out--with a bomb obviously intended to go off in a crowded newspaper office. It was sheer chance that prevented other people from being killed. In the aftermath of the crime, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that he would personally supervise the investigation. More than 5,000 people attended Kholodov's funeral, where speakers, including Russia's most prominent democratic leaders, denounced the crime as an attack on free speech. But in the months since Kholodov was killed, little progress has been made in arresting those responsible for his death. Pavel Gusev, the editor of Moskovski Komsomolets, told CPJ in November that after 13 months, the investigation of the Kholodov murder was "running in place." He said he was convinced that the investigators already had identified the thread capable of leading them to the people who ordered the journalist's killing, but further progress was being blocked by high-ranking officials. Virtually all of the paper's staff members have been interviewed by the prosecutor, and they are prevented from discussing the case while the investigation is proceeding. That is an obligation that they say they will ignore once they are completely convinced the investigation is going nowhere. In the meantime, Gusev said, the newspaper has carried out its own investigation, and if the official inquiry does not make progress soon, the paper is prepared to print what it knows. Gusev told CPJ that he and at least 14 other people are familiar with the results of the paper's investigation and, in the event of his untimely death, a plan is in place for the paper's findings to be published immediately. No one, however, underestimates the difficulty of bringing the perpetrator or perpetrators to justice. "The killing was prepared for a long time," said Natalya Yefimova, the paper's deputy editor, "and the killer was someone Dima trusted. Several months before the explosion, Dima received a tip and avoided danger by hiding himself for several days. This happened after he wrote an article about corruption in the Western Group of Forces [stationed in East Germany]." Since November 1995, there have been fewer and fewer contacts between the prosecutor and the staff of Moskovski Komsomolets, and when investigators have come to the newspaper, it has been mostly to go over old ground. Kholodov's colleagues say that there is growing sentiment at the paper in favor of going public. Nonetheless, there are dangers in publishing the results of the paper's investigation. "It could be dangerous to reveal our cards," said Yefimova. "The people who are guilty have alibis, and the people in the special services who helped them carry out the murder know how to disappear." On June 17, 1995, Natalya Alyakina, a free-lance correspondent for RUFA, a German radio news service, and Focus, a weekly magazine, was shot dead by a Russian soldier minutes after being waved past a Russian checkpoint outside the city of Budyonnovsk in southern Russia at the height of a hostage crisis. As in the Kholodov murder, the investigation in this case has been slow, inconclusive and seemingly intended to shield the perpetrator rather than to solve the crime. According to Alyakina's husband, Gisbert Mrozek, who also worked for RUFA and Focus and was riding in the car with his wife when she was killed, he and Alyakina had left Moscow on June 16 for Mineralnaya Voda to cover the hostage crisis. They were on their way to Budyonnovsk the next day in a car driven by Vladimir Martirosian when they were stopped at a Russian checkpoint about 250 meters outside the city. Mrozek had heard reports of Russian soldiers' hostility toward the press but he and Alyakina passed through the checkpoint without incident. The soldiers on duty looked at their press documents and waved them on with the words "Happy journey." Minutes later, however, as they were driving away in the direction of Budyonnovsk, two shots rang out, and Alyakina, bleeding heavily from a neck wound, slumped over and said to her husband, "They killed me. I'm dying. Don't leave my son, Artyem. I love you." She lost consciousness about a minute later. Mrozek helped Alyakina out of the car and began shouting, "Why did you kill my wife?" Almost immediately, an armored car arrived from the checkpoint, and Alyakina was put in the vehicle along with Martirosian, who was also hit. Mrozek was then driven by the police into Budyonnovsk. He was taken to a hospital where he was told that Martirosian was seriously injured and his wife was dead. In the months since Alyakina was killed, Mrozek has watched with dismay as the military prosecutor has investigated the case in a manner that demonstrates both indifference and incompetence. Even though Alyakina was struck through the rear window of her car, the glass from the window was thrown away. The machine gun that fired the fatal shot was not fixed in place, and no photographs were taken of the scene. In fact, there was little attempt even to begin an investigation until Sept. 7, when, under pressure from the German government (Alyakina held dual Russian-German citizenship), the authorities assigned a special prosecutor, Lt. Col. Andrei Kondratkov, to the case. At the request of Mrozek and Alyakina's relatives, a re-enactment of the shooting took place in early October. The soldier who fired the fatal shot, Sergei Fedotov, has claimed that the shooting was inadvertent and that he accidentally activated a machine gun with his foot while climbing into an armored personnel carrier. At the re-enactment, Fedotov showed how he climbed down into the armored vehicle and touched the trigger of the machine gun with his foot. Mrozek requested that Fedotov actually fire the weapon, which was controlled by a double lever specifically to prevent an accidental firing. But because the scene of the re-enactment was near Budyonnovsk, for safety reasons the demonstration was transferred to a nearby training field. At the field, however, Fedotov was no longer present. Instead, a Russian officer took his place and succeeded in firing two shots from the machine gun with his foot. The demonstration, however, left open a critical question. The officer knew in advance that he was to perform the complicated maneuver, and his performance did nothing to convince Mrozek that the same thing could have been done by a young recruit by accident. Mrozek told CPJ that he will ask for a new re-enactment of the shooting, in which Fedotov himself demonstrates how he was able to fire the machine gun. The widower said that he will also ask for a psychologist's testimony on the plausibility of the soldier's story. "I don't think that someone wanted to kill Natalya," said Mrozek. "I think it was intended as a joke, to force journalists to hit the ground. There were other cases of shooting at cars by internal troops. Some of the passengers were killed and that was all. "This was the result of hatred of journalists. The soldiers fired in the direction of the car not caring whether they killed someone or not." Vladislav Listyev, the executive director of Russia's newly formed public television station ORT, and, in the opinion of many, the most popular television journalist in the country, was murdered in the hallway of his apartment building in the center of Moscow on March 1, 1995. The murder apparently was connected to his role in the reorganization of the state-owned Ostankino television company as ORT, a joint stock venture. In this case, too, there has been little progress in the investigation, and there are widespread fears that the authorities are not really interested in finding the killers. At the end of 1994, Ostankino was reconstituted as ORT by a decree from Yeltsin that granted 51 percent of the shares in the new independent company to the state and 49 percent to Russian banks. Listyev was named the executive director of the station, and the transition was set to take place on April 1, 1995. The first few months of 1995 provided an opportunity for a re-examination of many aspects of the station's operation, and one of Listyev's first acts after becoming director was to order the suspension of all advertising on the station beginning April 1. In fact, a re-evaluation of the station's advertising policies was long overdue. The advertising was being brokered through 12 mafia-controlled intermediary firms, which sold it at vastly inflated prices. The channel, capable of reaching 100 million people, was extremely attractive for advertisers, and the value of advertising time on Ostankino grew from virtually nothing in 1992 to $30 million a month today. Some time slots on the station were booked until the year 2000. Listyev's decision raised the prospect of massive losses for the nation's advertising syndicates and possible bankruptcy for some agencies. Listyev was murdered one month before his suspension order was to take effect, and it is widely believed that an Ostankino advertising syndicate ordered his death. But even with such obvious leads to follow, official investigators have made no progress in the case. Most people believe Listyev's killers will never be found, said Boris I. Uvarov, a senior special investigator in the Internal Affairs Ministry. Uvarov headed the group that investigated the case from March until June, when he was fired for failing to follow an order from his superiors. Higher-ups in the prosecutor's office asked Uvarov to sanction the arrest of an employee of the Federal Security Service (FSB) in connection with the Listyev killing. He refused because the employee was not, in fact, connected to the case, and it became obvious to him that the prosecutor's office wanted to use the arrest to put pressure on the FSB, which, at the time, was investigating a case involving some relatives of Alexei Ilyushenko, the general prosecutor. The staff of the investigative group in the Listyev case has now been changed three times, hampering the effectiveness of the probe. There have also been repeated rumors about arrests, many of them printed in newspaper articles quoting "competent sources." Many investigators, however, believe the rumors originate in the prosecutor's office and are intended to distract attention from the lack of progress in the case. They believe that the authorities are not really interested in finding the killers and do everything possible to muddle the investigation. In addition to the well-known cases, there have been a number of murders of less well-known journalists, sometimes outside of Moscow, and these, too, show every sign of not having been seriously investigated. On Feb. 13, 1995, Viatcheslav Rudnev, a free-lance reporter who had written stories for the local press in Kaluga about corruption and the criminal underworld, was found with a fractured skull in the entryway to the apartment building where he had lived for years. He died four days later. Although it had been established that Rudnev had not been drinking that evening, after a brief investigation the local police ruled that his death was an accident and that Rudnev fell on the stairway and hit his head. This version of events leaves several unanswered questions. Before his death, Rudnev told friends that his life had been threatened, but no attempt was made to learn the source of these threats either at the time he reported them or after he died. Journalists in Kaluga believe that Rudnev was struck on the head and then left at the bottom of the stairwell to make it look as if he had fallen. On Feb. 1, 1994, Sergei Dubov, the publisher of the advertising newspaper Vsyo Dlya Vas, was shot dead in front of his apartment building. Since his murder, which was preceded by weeks of death threats, no one has been arrested or charged. Dubov, who was the first publisher of the complete works of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, had also created a publishing house in association with the Russian weekly magazine New Times. The affiliation allowed him to use the magazine's name, building, correspondents and infrastructure for a variety of commercial and publishing ventures. In the months before his death, he had obvious financial difficulties and was unable to pay either rent or salaries. In December 1993, Dubov began to tell colleagues that he thought he might be killed, and before his death the vice presidents of his publishing house cashed in their shares in the company. Despite possible leads to the identity of the killer in Dubov's tangled financial affairs, there has been no progress in solving the case. Alexander Pumpiansky, the editor of New Times and a friend of Dubov's, said that Dubov's deputy was briefly arrested and accused of financial manipulations but then freed. On June 12, 1994, Yuri Soltis, a crime reporter for the Interfax News Agency, was found beaten to death at a train station in the Stroitel district on the outskirts of Moscow. He was so badly beaten that it took the police three days to identify him. Soltis' colleagues told CPJ that his murder was linked to his investigations of Moscow's criminal underworld but no suspects have ever been identified. On Dec. 27, 1995, Vadim Alferyev, a crime reporter with Segodnyashnyaya Gazeta in the Siberian industrial city of Krasnoyarsk, was beaten to death in the entrance to his apartment building. Alferyev was writing about economic crimes in the region and had received repeated threats. At this writing, no suspects have been arrested, and there is no reported progress in the investigation. The failure of Russian authorities to vigorously investigate the murder of journalists is now part of the reality of the post-Communist epoch. Just as in the past, when investigators were forced to desist once a crime probe led to a high-ranking party official, they now find themselves restrained when they uncover the trail of high-ranking military figures or leaders of organized crime. In fact, however, the murderers of journalists can be found and prosecuted. Gangsters in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union are so convinced of their invulnerability that they do little to disguise their identities. The authorities in Lithuania this year arrested and convicted the killers of Vitas Lingis, a reporter for the newspaper Respublika who had written about the activities of the Lithuanian mob. One of his murderers has been sentenced to death. But bringing those who kill journalists to justice requires a commitment to the rule of law. So far, there is no such commitment in Russia. And ultimately, it is only with the protection of the law that a free press can hope to survive.

For the second year running, this region saw the worst violations of press freedom in the world. In Algeria, 24 journalists were assassinated, accounting for nearly half the world total of murdered journalists in 1995. And Turkey continued to hold the largest number of reporters and editors in prison--51 at year's end. Algerian journalists, entering their third year as prime targets of political terrorism, faced an escalation in violence and government censorship. In Turkey, dozens of journalists were jailed under the notorious Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law. An amendment of that law, implemented at year's end after intense international pressure, brought the release of some reporters but failed to address the central issue: journalists are being imprisoned for writing about the Kurdish issue. In Egypt, journalists faced a serious challenge to their right to practice their profession: Law 93 of 1995. Opposition journalists tried under the new law face prolonged imprisonment. This does not bode well for the future of the profession in the Middle East. The Palestinian National Authority's (PNA) actions against the press are equally disturbing, for they indicate the type of state the PNA may become. The detention without charge of Palestinian journalists by the PNA's various security branches is common. Newspapers have been arbitrarily suspended for periods ranging from one day to several months. A flawed law designed to protect the press was hastily promulgated in July and then ignored by the authorities. The Israeli government, which maintains a stranglehold on the areas under PNA control, is accountable in some cases. But many of the PNA's anti-press actions are clearly its own. In Jordan the government has increased pressure on the press: King Hussein, objecting to criticism of the peace with Israel, has signaled his disapproval of what he deemed irresponsible journalism, prompting efforts to produce a tougher version of the 1993 press law. In Yemen, where the experiment with press freedom felt the aftershocks of the south's attempted secession in 1994, opposition journalists work under threat of physical harassment by undercover agents; independent publications suffer more subtle coercion. The fate of journalists in Iran, where an important radical opposition daily was shut down in March, is still subject to the power struggles between President Mohamed Hashemi Rafsanjani and his opponents. Throughout the region, government monopolies on broadcasting remain in place. Lebanon, with dozens of private radio and television stations, remains an anomaly. There are no signs that its neighbors regard its pluralistic media as a model. Morocco's only private television and radio stations are owned by King Hassan II's son-in-law. In the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, with the exception of Kuwait, no critical media have emerged. In Bahrain, the domestic media's coverage of violent clashes between the opposition and government security forces adhered to the official line. The new emir of Qatar lifted prior censorship but soon after suspended a newspaper. Authoritarian regimes in Syria, Iraq and Libya continue to repress all forms of expression. The Tunisian government continues to repress its critics and forbids independent journalists to work in the domestic media. Some events of 1995, however, should give rise to hope. Journalists from Mauritania to Iran are standing up for their rights. In Egypt the journalists union has fought the draconian new press law. Jordanian journalists are braced to resist further government curtailment of press freedoms. Members of the press in Yemen have mobilized on behalf of imprisoned colleagues. And Algerian journalists continue to report under impossible conditions. Increasingly, journalists in the Middle East and North Africa, who realize they will not be handed press freedoms, have displayed a willingness to face danger and resist tremendous pressure as they work to inform the public.

SPECIAL REPORT Algerian Journalism's Original Sinby SÃ©lima Ghezali The following is an edited excerpt of an October 1995 presentation by SÃ©lima Ghezali, the editor of a leading Algerian weekly newspaper, La Nation. She spoke to an audience of journalists, human rights activists and educators in New York at a meeting cosponsored by Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists. The original text of her presentation was translated from the French by Zohra Kherief. Much has been said about the killing of journalists in Algeria, and there is very little I can add. Radical Islamists--many of whom are terrorists--think that killing is a form of punishment for what they view as Algerian journalists' allegiance to the regime and its policies. The response of the regime is remarkably Machiavellian: It uses these assassinations as an excuse not to open a dialogue with the opposition. Indeed, the government points out that what the Islamists are doing precludes any negotiation, and thus justifies the state's policy of confrontation. We know that protests against these killings are being mobilized abroad, and that these protests are something we need. At the same time, every outcry over the assassination of a journalist endangers us a little more. Algerian newspapers that support the regime give the protests very prominent coverage to show that there's support for the government abroad. And the terrorists know that they will get into the paper if they kill a journalist. Due to the government's censorship of any news related to security issues, rebel attacks on army or police forces are not reported, and no Islamists are allowed to publicly express themselves. Killing journalists, then, becomes a way for the terrorists to tell you they are there. It is also very important that Algerian journalists have mobilized to denounce these killings and to discuss the necessity of reinforcing security for journalists. But they do not debate the root cause of the assassinations, the situation prevailing in the country. This silence reflects, in part, Algerian journalism's original sin. The impetus for a new, independent press in 1989 did not come from dissident journalists fighting against censorship under the one-party regime but from the government's decision to liberalize the press. Indeed, the first so-called independent newspapers were created not by private capital but by journalists who were paid three years' salary by the government to leave the public sector and establish privately run newspapers. As those newspapers proliferated between 1989 and 1991, journalists failed to organize to fight for the legal guarantees necessary to practice their profession. Nor did they engage in a constructive debate on the professional ethics and standards of an independent press. These shortcomings can be explained by the fact that under the one-party regime, from independence in 1962 until 1988, real journalism was not practiced. Newspapers reported official propaganda, not facts and information. Lacking legal protections and a sense of professional solidarity, Algerian journalists were in no position to defend their rights when, after it became clear the Islamists would win, the military canceled the parliamentary elections in January 1992. Most of the press, in fact, endorsed the cancellation of the elections and the repression of the Islamists. Only one newspaper condemned the banning of the Islamist press and the opening of detention camps in the south. And not one questioned what the government meant when it threatened to prosecute anyone whose reporting could be construed as an incitement to violence. The weakness of the Algerian press and the divisiveness within it have had severe repercussions. Journalists are unable to effectively counter government repression and murderous attacks by radicals. Response to the arrest of Djamel Fahassi, a journalist with Alger ChaÃ®ne III, the state-owned French-language radio station, is a case in point. Fahassi had contributed regularly to Islamist newspapers and, for this, he was arrested in 1992 and sent to a detention camp in the south. He was released later that year only to be abducted in May 1995 by security forces. The government has denied holding him in custody. The Algerian Journalists Association did not protest his arrest. His family and my newspaper, La Nation, tried to get some support for him. But after La Nation published several articles on his case, the pro-government newspaper Horizons ran a story claiming that Fahassi was well and vacationing abroad. No source was cited, of course. He is still missing. The problems of the press's own internal conflicts are compounded by the restrictions enforced by the government. Since the state of emergency was declared in February 1992, information has been tightly controlled. That is to say, almost no information can be published on what every one of the 26 million Algerians wants to hear about: the state of war in their midst. Consequently, it's a hidden war. Every day Algerians are killed, either by the security forces or by terrorists, but this news does not get out. No information can be published without the approval of the Commission of Information in the Ministry of Interior. As journalists, we can witness a murder, a police operation or an arrest but are not allowed to write about it. Any newspaper that tries to publish independent information on security issues faces prolonged suspension. For the last six months in Algiers, we have heard loud explosions every evening. There's gunfire, and there are mass arrests. But we don't see these things in the newspapers. So people know the press is unable to report what is happening. You cannot really protect journalists when they are just one part of the population against whom a war is being waged. The best way to protect journalists is for the government to decide it is time for this war to stop. SPECIAL REPORT Palestinian Journalism: New Era or More of the Same? by Imad Musa The phone rings at 2:30 a.m. in the home of a Gaza journalist. The man on the line identifies himself as Abu Hasan, his code name. He says he is with the Palestinian General Intelligence and wants to see the journalist now. "Why? What's wrong?" asks the bewildered journalist, but Abu Hasan won't give details. The journalist asks if this is an official summons; Abu Hasan insists that it is not. After some give and take, Abu Hasan agrees to wait till 9 a.m. for the "visit." The journalist spends the next hour trying to remember if he did anything, the slightest thing, that could be construed as offensive to the newborn Palestinian National Authority (PNA). He taxes his brain, but he can't think of anything. So what could this "visit" be about? Would he be accused of some sort of treason for working for the Israeli and foreign press, for telling them what's going on in Gaza? Has he written anything critical lately? Could he be detained on such charges? Since sleep is the last thing on his mind at this point, he decides to dress and get to General Intelligence headquarters. When he gets there, Abu Hasan greets our journalist, tells him he just wanted to meet him, and that concludes the matter. This story sums up many aspects of the state of journalism in the Palestinian areas since the advent of autonomy. Just as nothing happened to the Gazan journalist (except for the nuisance of a late-night phone call), nothing has happened to the vast majority of Palestinian journalists. This is not to deny that Palestinian newspapers--including the most loyal--have been closed for periods of varying length without explanation. But in this observer's opinion, the dilemma is deeper than a jailing here or a newspaper shutdown there. While most journalists are supportive of the new PNA, they insist that their job requires them to be skeptical. Meanwhile, the authority argues that it is in a very unstable position, with pressure to obtain funding from the international community (led by the United States) and pressure from Israel to fulfill the Palestinian side of the peace agreements, regardless of how unpopular they might be. Bad press, the authority argues, can decrease support for the authority in this tight situation, and if the authority can't deliver its promises it will find itself broke and will find its partner, Israel, unwilling to deliver its side of the bargain. Compared to journalists in other countries, Palestinian journalists are relatively well off. One doesn't read about journalists being killed here, as they are in Algeria or South America. Most of the time violations of press freedoms are nothing to write home about in the eyes of the foreign media. What happens usually is that a journalist is arrested after writing reports considered "subversive" by a very insecure governing authority. Since there is no constitution or set of laws in place, no one can guess what might be deemed harmful to state security by a high-ranking official. But if something is, the journalist is apprehended by any of eight security apparatuses set up by the authority, questioned/berated and possibly held in prison for an indefinite amount of time (rarely more than 10 days). If the police are asked about a journalist in their charge, they will usually deny that he or she is in detention. Rather, the journalist is "visiting" fellow Palestinians who work in the intelligence services and will return shortly, after a few things are cleared up. Only one editor/political activist has faced official charges; all the others have been released without charge. Their peers, and the public in general, are left to speculate on the reasons for each arrest. Most recently, a top editor in the leading daily Palestinian newspaper, Al-Quds, was detained for a few days for placing a pro-Arafat news piece on Page 8 instead of Page 1. This charge was never made officially, since there is no law on placing stories, but the accusation spreads by word of mouth. As for newspapers, they have been denied publication for a myriad of similarly unofficial reasons: undermining the PNA's position on East Jerusalem (Al-Nahar, summer 1994), and publishing an advertisement paid for by the opposition (Al-Quds, summer 1995). One of the first things that can be done to improve the situation is to enact legislation to govern media/authority relations. As of this writing there was no Palestinian legislature, but elections are scheduled that could create one. If the laws are fair and the judiciary is separated from the executive branch, journalists would have a chance to defend themselves against flimsy allegations, and much progress would be made for press freedom. Of course, it is not enough for journalists to wait for change. They have to start programs to make themselves more professional, to put their commitment to fair and accurate reporting before ideologies and agendas. In the occupation days this was tolerated because the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and Palestinians in general, wanted to focus on getting rid of occupation instead of internal problems. Today, this means that journalists who were supporting the PLO before it became the authority are still turning a blind eye to the faults of the new government and so are failing to offer constructive criticism during this period of nation building. And journalists who were anti-PLO before it became the authority still hope to thwart its program, so they refuse to report in a balanced way. The perception that Palestinian journalists are still just political activists in disguise allows the PNA to punish them as political dissidents, not as journalists fighting for the truth. This is the same reason some international organizations have hesitated before coming to the aid of a detained journalist. For journalists to become more aggressive in pursuing serious stories, they must also be empowered by editors and publishers who are willing to take the risks. So far, these changes have been slow in coming. Publishers are content with the way they have done business over the past years and see no reason to rock the boat. The ideals of journalism or public service are not part of the Palestinian heritage. Of course the situation has improved since occupation, and no Palestinian journalist prefers Israeli occupation over Palestinian rule. For the first time, the Gaza Strip has placed itself on the media map with its own weekly newspapers. The Palestinian opposition has obtained licenses to publish as well, although at times the licenses are suspended. And finally the Palestinians can confront their own social, political and economic ailments instead of focusing completely on Israeli occupation. In the Palestinian view, the Arab world has a golden opportunity to build a new media system, one that will be an improvement over the system in which, uncomfortably, it now finds itself. Perhaps this is what is so significant about the Palestinian situation, what sets it apart from that of Egypt or Jordan, for example. Progress must be made while the situation is still fluid. Allowing the current state of affairs to go on will set it in stone, leaving Palestinian journalists to join their colleagues in the Arab world in their uphill battle for the most basic press freedoms.

An often undocumented motive, though increasingly common, is homophobia. Gay and lesbian journalists are frequently physically attacked or slapped with lawsuits for reporting news of concern to the gay and lesbian communities. That was one of the major findings of a CPJ report documenting attacks against gay and lesbian journalists between 1990 and 1995 in countries as politically and culturally disparate as Canada, Russia and Zimbabwe. These press freedom violations have rarely been reported, and CPJ undertook the project to draw attention to the problem. As with all of the cases CPJ reports on, the attacks were a direct consequence of a journalist's or news organization's work. Following is an excerpt from that report. To obtain a copy of the complete report, please contact CPJ. There is almost no place in the world where journalism is a safe profession. And nowhere in the world is it safe to be homosexual. Gay and lesbian journalists, because of their visibility, are easy targets for much of the abuse directed toward the gay and lesbian communities. Homophobia pervades all layers of society, and those who seek to silence journalists or news outlets that cover gay and lesbian issues range from heads of state to criminal extortionists. The weapons they use may differ: Attacks by authorities are most likely to involve censorship laws and other measures of legal restraint, whereas attacks by nongovernmental forces are more likely to take the form of physical abuse, though at times police have resorted to similar brute tactics. But the result of their efforts are the same: a chilling effect on coverage of gay and lesbian issues and on the distribution of gay and lesbian publications. No matter the transgressor or the act, however, law enforcement agents, journalists and human rights groups have often failed to recognize these attacks as press freedom violations. This failure stems in some instances from deeply ingrained prejudices against homosexuals and in other cases from resignation, a belief that those prejudices will be acted out without fear of retribution. Attacks by Authorities In countries all over the world, homosexuals are subject to legal persecution. In addition to imposing flat-out bans on gay sex and press coverage of homosexuality, authorities have often invoked laws against child exploitation to silence gay and lesbian journalists. In Canada, for instance, Joseph Couture, a reporter for CBC Radio and the Toronto gay and lesbian biweekly newspaper XTra! had to battle efforts to frame him on charges of child pornography after he produced a radio documentary and wrote a series of articles that were critical of the police force's relationship with the gay and lesbian community and of its enforcement of child pornography laws. In Romania, opposition editor and publisher Bozdog Ovidiu was imprisoned by local authorities for purportedly having sex with minors. Authorities in several countries also admit to keeping "pink lists" of known homosexuals, which often include journalists because of the public nature of their work. These lists are often used to target and threaten them with prosecution for crimes they did not commit. Such cases have generally escaped the attention of press freedom and human rights organizations. In part, this stems from the marginal position of much of the gay and lesbian press and the de facto exclusion of gay and lesbian journalists from mainstream professional journalistic communities. Partly, too, established groups have been reluctant to take on such cases because they raise uncomfortable questions about whether the organizations should stand up for the right to engage in sexually explicit speech or defend a journalist accused of a crime as hideous as child exploitation. In addition, official forces hostile to the gay and lesbian media have long capitalized on the mainstream media's discomfort with issues of sexuality to engage in attacks that are nothing more than attempts to limit press freedom and intimidate reporters. Attacks by Nongovernmental Forces When a gay journalist or news outlet is attacked by a nonofficial source, such as an extremist group or urban gang, accountability rests not only with the perpetrators but also, in instances where the police or other law enforcement agents fail to prosecute them, with the state. Without official cooperation in the prosecution of such crimes, gay and lesbian journalists will continue to work under hostile conditions. Many gay journalists consider a certain amount of violence and harassment a natural attribute of their work. During interviews for this report, editors of gay and lesbian publications would often say, "Oh, nothing happens to us. Just the usual hate mail and phone calls." This resignation stems from a pattern of neglect by authorities, as illustrated by two cases in India and Russia, where the police failed to adequately pursue the criminals. Despite the continuing hostilities around the world, there is some good news to report. U.S. journalists say that harassment has decreased significantly over time. For example, one of the first gay and lesbian newspapers, Boston's Gay Community News, was the victim of arson three times between 1972 and 1981, as was one of the first lesbian publishing houses, Daughters Inc. in Plainfield, Vt. But in the 1990s, with gay and lesbian newspapers operating in all major U.S. cities and many smaller towns, no instances of arson have been reported. Publishers of relatively long-lived newspapers, such as Chicago's 12-year-old Windy City Times, say that they now face far less harassment in the way of hate mail, phone calls and threats of violence than they did in the 1980s. Censorship and Related Harassment It stands to reason that the largest number of cases documented for this report can be classified as censorship. Censorship mechanisms, such as obscenity and anti-pornography statutes, pose one of the greatest threats to press freedom anywhere, and are certainly the greatest and most consistent threat to publications with gay and lesbian content.* Legal authorities everywhere say the same thing: Obscenity statutes protect the moral standards of local communities. Given that in most areas of the world gays and lesbians are seen as threatening the moral fabric of society, obscenity statutes are turned against them again and again, ultimately suppressing not only sexually explicit writing but any coverage of gay and lesbian issues. So, too, are broad-stroke laws employed to prohibit the "promotion" of homosexuality--the censorious state's answer to the increasing visibility of gays and lesbians and the growing influence of their media outlets. Clause 28 of the United Kingdom's Local Government Act of 1988, for instance, prohibits local government authorities--who control significant public funds--from intentionally promoting homosexuality or teaching the acceptability of homosexuality. Though Clause 28 has not resulted in any court cases to date, all reports indicate that its impact has been pervasive. A library in York, for instance, excluded two articles about homosexuality from an exhibit for fear of violating the prohibition. Halfway across the world, in Nicaragua, there is a four-year-old law on the books that is similar in spirit to the United Kingdom's clause but far broader in scope. Fear also drives the decisions of private distributors who, wary of legal trouble under obscenity statutes or other legislation, often resist carrying gay and lesbian publications. The weekly newsmagazine Gay Times in London, for instance, struggled for years to be accepted by the large private chains that distribute most of England's magazines. As a result of such resistance, many gay and lesbian newspapers have opted to distribute free of charge, which in most instances means they have to fight for the legal protections that would be accorded them if they provided a product with a stated commercial value. There has been some progress made on this issue in parts of the United States. The governor of Maryland, for instance, in 1994 signed into law a bill that makes it a crime of theft to take copies of a free newspaper with the intent of preventing others from reading it. But such legal recourse is far from the norm in most countries, where obstacles to distribution are one of the many problems the gay media must face as a result of the deeply entrenched homophobia at work in the creation and application of censorship laws today. The cases CPJ has documented are only a small sampling of the press freedom violations that continue to plague gay and lesbian journalists. There are doubtless many more that have yet to be reported, but we hope that with the publication of this work, journalists will become more attuned to these injustices--to recognize them as more than gay-bashing and to report them to the Committee to Protect Journalists and other press freedom and human rights groups around the world. *The Committee to Protect Journalists does not take a position on the substance of a country's morality and obscenity statutes but rather investigates cases where they have been applied in a discriminatory manner, hindering a journalist's right to report without persecution or obstructing the free flow of news across borders. Masha Gessen is a Moscow-based journalist who is a frequent contributor to CPJ's work and a former board member of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. She writes for a number of publications, including The New Republic and the U.K.-based New Statesman and Society. Journalists in Jail A Record 182 Cases of Reporters Imprisoned At the end of 1995, at least 182 journalists in 22 countries were in prison for their reporting. In many cases, they were being held without charge or trial. Officially, these journalists may have been charged with or convicted of committing offenses ranging from disseminating separatist propaganda to expressing contempt for the head of state or insulting an official. But, in truth, the only crime these journalists committed was publishing or broadcasting something their governments didn't like. This year's count is the largest ever documented by CPJ. At the end of 1994, 173 journalists in 23 countries were behind bars. Two years ago, CPJ documented 126 cases of imprisoned journalists in 28 countries. By region, the 1995 count breaks down as follows. In the Middle East and North Africa, 86 journalists were in prison, more than half of them in Turkey; and there were 47 imprisoned journalists in Africa, 41 in Asia and eight in the Americas. No journalists are in prison in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, where governments are using economic pressure to keep the press in line. For the second consecutive year, Turkey had the largest number of incarcerated journalists, 51. This number is down from last year's 74, due in part to a revision (thanks to European pressure) of Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, which had been used to prosecute journalists who wrote about the Kurdish issue. There were 31 journalists in prison in Ethiopia, following a post-election crackdown on the independent media. China had 20 journalists behind bars. Kuwait has held the same 18 journalists prisoner since 1991; all of them were accused of collaboration for having worked on a newspaper published during the Iraqi occupation. Vietnam, Peru, Myanmar (Burma) and Nigeria each held eight journalists in jail. All eight journalists in Nigeria, which has had a proud tradition of press independence, were arrested as part of a 1995 campaign by the military junta to quash all dissent. Among those arrested and imprisoned was Nosa Igiebor, editor of Tell magazine and a 1993 CPJ International Press Freedom honoree. Another CPJ awardee, Ahmad Taufik, president of Indonesia's Alliance of Independent Journalists, began serving a three-year prison term during the year. Three other Indonesian journalists are also imprisoned. Syria's three longest-held journalists were released in 1995. But six others remained in prison, including three who have been in jail for 10 years or more. In Algeria, journalists, who live in fear of assassination by religious extremists, had to contend with government repression as well. The government had imprisoned four reporters in 1995, the most ever documented by CPJ in Algeria. And Libya still held the world's longest-imprisoned journalist, Abdallah Ali al-Sanussi al-Darrat, who has been in prison since 1975. International pressure can help set these journalists free. In 1995, after an international campaign led by CPJ and others, Cuba released Yndamiro Restano, a founding member of the Cuban Association of Independent Journalists and a 1994 winner of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award. We ask you to take the time to write to at least one of the leaders listed below, respectfully urging them to release these prisoners immediately. Countries Holding Journalists in Prison ALGERIA (4) Abdelkader Hadj Benaamane, Algerian Press Service (APS) Imprisoned: February 28, 1995 Benaamane, a correspondent for the official Algerian Press Service (APS) in the southern town of Tamanrasset, was arrested by security forces. The reasons for Benaamane's imprisonment are unclear, but reports indicate that he was charged with "attacking the security of the state and national unity" in connection with an internal APS news wire report he filed on the whereabouts of Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) who had recently been transferred from Janan al-Mufti prison to a detention center in the desert. Benaamane appeared before a Tamanrasset military court on July 10. He was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison. Saghir Bouhadida, El Khabar Imprisoned: June 14, 1995 Bouhadida, an assistant lecturer at the Institute of Social Sciences and the Institute of Information and Communication, both in Algiers, and a former journalist at the daily El Khabar, was arrested by members of the security forces in the Chevalier district of the city. He and two students were detained on the way home from the Institute of Social Sciences. The two students were released after three days. Bouhadida's whereabouts are unknown. Djamel Fahassi, Alger ChaÃ®ne III Arrested: May 7, 1995 Fahassi, a reporter for French-language Algerian radio and formerly a contributor to Al-Forqane, a weekly organ of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) that was banned in March 1992, was arrested by state security services. Officials have refused to acknowledge his arrest. His family believes he is in a secret detention center and fears for his life. Mohamed Zaaf, ANSA Arrested: January 14, 1995 Fifteen masked policemen raided the home of Zaaf, a stringer with Italy's ANSA news agency, and arrested him while they kept his wife locked in another room. According to the official Algerian Press Service, Zaaf was arrested for harboring a suspected Muslim guerrilla.

He was imprisoned in mid-August. Mbawa is contesting the conviction on the grounds that he was never presented a summons to the July 13 hearing. Mbawa's defense was hampered when his attorney, Julius Achu, dropped the case due to pressure from his older brother, Prime Minister Simon Achidi Achu. The Cameroon Post is still being published, albeit irregularly.

The "secrets" in question included unpublished interest rate changes on savings and loans at the People's Bank of China, as well as information on the bank's international gold transaction plans, both of which were provided to Xi by a bank official named Tian Ye. Wei Jingsheng Imprisoned: April 1, 1994 Wei, one of the most prominent dissidents in China and former co-editor of the pro-democracy journal Tansuo (Explorations), was convicted on Dec. 13, 1995, by the Beijing Intermediate People's Court of "conspiring to subvert the government." Foreign reporters were barred from attending the trial. The dissident's 14-year prison sentence was upheld on Dec. 28, following a closed appeal hearing. Wei has been held incommunicado since police detained him on April 1, 1994, shortly after he met with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck. However, he was not formally arrested and charged until Nov. 21, 1995. Wei had been released on parole on Sept. 14, 1993, after serving 14 1/2 years of a 15-year sentence for "counterrevolutionary" activities that included writing essays strongly criticizing the government and calling for democratic rule. Following his release, Wei wrote several op-ed pieces for publications abroad and concluded a deal with a Hong Kong magazine for the publication of his prison memoirs--actions that prompted an official warning that he was violating the terms of his parole. Chen Ziming Imprisoned: June 26, 1995 Chen, the former publisher of Economics Weekly, was rearrested in June 1995, after being released in 1994 on medical parole from prison, where he was serving a 13-year sentence for his role in the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. His rearrest was believed to be linked to his 24-hour fast on the sixth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, and to his endorsement of a petition in May 1995 calling for freedom of expression and the release of political prisoners. Chen, a 1991 recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award, was originally arrested in October 1989, labeled one of the "black hands" behind the Tiananmen Square demonstrations and convicted of conducting counterrevolutionary activities. He was released on parole for treatment of cancer, hepatitis and heart disease. Wang Dan Imprisoned: May 21, 1995 Beijing police detained Wang, a former student leader and frequent contributor to overseas publications, after he signed petitions calling for the release of Tiananmen Square-era political prisoners and for new legal protections of human rights. The Hong Kong daily Lien Ho Pao reported in late July 1995 that Beijing authorities planned to prosecute Wang for inciting citizens to conduct anti-government activities, openly attacking the socialist system, disrupting public security and undermining social stability. The newspaper also reported that public security officials had collected all of Wang's "offensive" articles published abroad as evidence against him.

Six confirmed deaths--one each in Azerbaijan, Burundi, Croatia and Somalia, and two in Chechnya--were combat casualties. The other 45 cases all appear to have been homicides. For the second consecutive year, Algeria was the most dangerous place in the world for journalists. The 24 Algerian reporters and editors murdered by rebel terrorists in 1995 accounted for nearly half the job-related deaths of journalists in the world during the year. Since May 1993, when Islamist rebels began targeting local reporters and editors, 53 journalists have been assassinated in Algeria--the largest number of press corps casualties CPJ has recorded in any country over the past 10 years. In other disturbing developments, three provincial magazine publishers and an editor were murdered in separate and unrelated incidents in Brazil, where violent crimes against journalists had been rare. In three of the cases, the journalists had been covering corruption and human rights abuses by local government officials and police. The breakdown of CPJ's confirmed cases is as follows: 24 journalists killed in Algeria; 7 journalists killed in Russia; 4 journalists killed in Brazil; 3 journalists killed in Colombia; and 1 journalist killed in each of the following countries--Angola, Azerbaijan, Burundi, Canada, Croatia, Dominican Republic, India, Mexico, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uganda and Ukraine. Staff researchers at CPJ are investigating another nine deaths of journalists in 1995. In some cases, it has not yet been determined if their deaths were directly related to their profession. And in four of the cases, regarding journalists who are missing in Chechnya, the subjects are feared dead but searches continue. In 1994, 73 journalists were killed. Fifty-nine of these deaths were homicides and 14 were combat casualties. This report also includes an account of journalists killed in the line of duty in the past decade.

Natalya Alyakina, RUFA News Agency and Focus magazine Date of Death: June 17, 1995 Place of Death: Budyonnovsk Alyakina, a Russian journalist with the German weekly newsmagazine Focus and the RUFA News Agency, was killed by a Russian soldier. She had been given permission by Russian soldiers to cross a Russian army checkpoint leading into the southern city of Budyonnovsk, where she was going to report on a mass hostage-taking by Chechen rebels, but she was shot shortly after passing through the roadblock. Shamkhan Kagirov, Rossiskaya Gazeta and Vozrozheniye Date of Death: December 13, 1995 Place of Death: Near Grozny Kagirov, a reporter for the Moscow daily newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta and the local paper Vozrozheniye, was shot and killed in an ambush in Chechnya. Kagirov and three local policemen were traveling in a car near Grozny when they were attacked. The three policemen were also killed. Vadim Alferyev, Segodnyashnyaya Gazeta Date of Death: December 27, 1995 Place of Death: Krasnoyarsk Alferyev, a crime reporter with Segodnyashnyaya Gazeta in Krasnoyarsk, was beaten to death in the entrance of his apartment building. Alferyev was writing about economic crimes in the region and had received repeated threats. SOMALIA Confirmed: 1 Marcello Palmisano, RAI Date of Death: February 9, 1995 Place of Death: Mogadishu Palmisano, a cameraman for the Italian public television station RAI, was shot and killed on the road to the Mogadishu airport, where he and reporter Carmen Lasorella were to cover the withdrawal of U.N. troops. It is believed the attack on the two Italians was part of a dispute called the "banana war" between two rival banana export firms, Somalfruit and Sombana. The journalists were riding in a car belonging to Somalfruit when they were attacked by gunmen riding in Sombana's "technical"--a vehicle mounted with heavy weapons. Witnesses report that Palmisano was mistaken for a Somalfruit executive. TAJIKISTAN Confirmed: 1 Mohyedin Alempour, BBC Date of Death: December 12, 1995 Place of Death: Dushanbe Alempour, head of the BBC's Persian Service bureau in Tajikistan, was found dead near the University of Tajikistan in Dushanbe with a bullet wound to his head. Nothing had been stolen from him, even though he was wearing a gold ring and carrying his documents. Alempour was the 28th journalist to be killed in Tajikistan since mid-1992. TURKEY Confirmed: 1 Sayfettin Tepe, Yeni Politika Date of Death: August 29, 1995 Place of Death: Bitlis Tepe, a correspondent for the banned Yeni Politika newspaper in the southeastern city of Batman, was taken into custody on Aug. 22. Four days later he was moved to the Bitlis Security Directorate. He died in custody on Aug. 29. His family was told that he committed suicide, but rejects that official explanation. UGANDA Confirmed: 1 Hussein Musa Njuki, Assalaam Date of Death: August 28, 1995 Place of Death: Kampala Njuki, editor of the opposition weekly newsletter Assalaam, died in police custody in a hospital. He had been arrested three days earlier and was immediately taken to the Criminal Investigations Division (CID). While CPJ has received several different reports regarding his arrest and death, it is certain that he was taken into custody by a group of plainclothesmen from the Anti-Robbery Squad, an extension of the government's Internal Security Organization (ISO). One source claimed that Njuki had been suffering from a debilitating illness, the effects of which were fatally exacerbated by the shock of the ambush by the ISO squad. Another source reports that Njuki was in perfect health before the arrest and was beaten to death by ISO agents. Yet another report contends that he collapsed during an attempt to escape and died in the hospital of a heart attack. A police guard remained in Njuki's hospital room throughout his stay. UKRAINE Confirmed: 1 Vladimir Ivanov, The Glory of Sebastopol Date of Death: April 18, 1995 Place of Death: Sebastopol Ivanov, editor in chief of the Sebastopol local daily The Glory of Sebastopol, was fatally injured when a bomb, triggered by a remote control, exploded in a garbage can outside his home on April 14. He was taken to a local hospital where he underwent three operations and had his legs amputated. He died of his wounds four days after the explosion. Ivanov was an ethnic Russian, and his paper's editorial line supported greater autonomy for the predominantly Russian population of Crimea. Shortly before the attempt on his life, Ivanov had begun a campaign in his newspaper denouncing the Crimean Mafia and protesting the construction of an oil refinery by a Ukrainian-Swedish company. His newspaper had also recently published several articles supporting the creation of a free trade zone in Sebastopol, a plan that was expected to strengthen Crimean autonomy. Unconfirmed Deaths BOSNIA and HERZEGOVINA Unconfirmed: 1 Sasa Kolevski, Bosnian Serb Television Date of Death: September 23, 1995 Place of Death: Mount Ozren Kolevski, a cameraman for Bosnian Serb Television in Banja Luka, and the station's driver Goran Pejcinovic, disappeared on Sept. 23 while covering fighting on Mount Ozren. The Bosnian Foreign Ministry issued a statement claiming that the two were killed in cross fire during the fighting. The Bosnian Serb news agency, SRNA, claims that they were killed while in custody of Bosnian Muslims. According to a Bosnian Serb Television reporter who was riding with them at the time of the incident, Bosnian troops shot at their vehicle, seriously wounding or killing Kolevski and Pejcinovic. The body of Pejcinovic was returned to Bosnian Serb authorities on Oct. 25. BURUNDI Unconfirmed: 1 Pamphile Simbizi, RTNB Date of Death: June 7, 1995 Place of Death: Bujumbura Simbizi, director of the French radio section of the state-run National Radio and Television of Burundi (RTNB), was stabbed to death by soldiers of unknown affiliation in the Gasenyi district of Bujumbura. Simbizi was part of the moderate Hutu movement. GUATEMALA Unconfirmed: 1 Alberto Antoniotti Monge, El GrÃ¡fico Date of Death: January 29, 1995 Place of Death: North of Guatemala City Monge, columnist for the daily El GrÃ¡fico and president of the Broadcasters Association, was gunned down by five unknown men in front of his home north of Guatemala City. Monge, a former correspondent of "ECO," a television news program of the Mexican Televisa chain, was also a press attachÃ© for Public Prosecutor Ramses Cuestas GÃ³mez, who has been investigating top military officials for alleged corruption and criminal activity. RUSSIA Unconfirmed: 4 Maxime Chabalin, Nevskoye Vremya Felix Titov, Nevskoye Vremya Date of Death: Unknown Place of Death: Unknown Chabalin, the assistant political editor of the St. Petersburg daily Nevskoye Vremya, and Titov, a photographer for the paper, were reported missing in Chechnya. They left Nazran on Feb. 27 for their fifth trip to the breakaway republic since fighting there began. According to Nevskoye Vremya's editor in chief, the journalists were due back on March 4. But they have not been heard from since, and are feared dead. Sergei Ivanov, Nevskoye Vremya Date of Death: Unknown Place of Death: Unknown Ivanov, a correspondent for Nevskoye Vremya, a St. Petersburg daily, was last seen by his colleagues on June 16 when he left for the Oryokhnov region of Chechnya. Ivanov was going to look for Nevskoye Vremya journalists Maxime Chabalin and Felix Titov, who had not been heard from since Feb. 27. By year's end, Ivanov's colleagues still had not heard from him, and they fear he may have been killed.

Andrew Shumack, Free-lancer Date of Death: Unknown Place of Death: Unknown Shumack, an American free-lance journalist, was last seen on July 28, when he left the Chechen capital of Grozny and headed toward the surrounding mountainous area. The St. Petersburg Press, an English-language newspaper, had provided Shumack with a letter of introduction on July 20 to help him obtain press credentials. In return, Shumack was to provide them with photographs and stories for three months. He is feared dead because no one from the newspaper has heard from him since, and U.S. Embassy officials have not been able to locate him despite repeated trips to the region. UKRAINE Unconfirmed: 1 Viktor Frelix, Independent journalist Date of Death: June 2, 1995 Place of Death: L'vov Frelix, an independent journalist and a founder of the ecological group Green World of Ukraine, died in L'vov of poisoning. He had been investigating the military's connection with an epidemic in the city of Chernovtsy, in the central oblast of Bukovina, and had alleged that the illnesses resulted from the city's proximity to a military base. The Ukrainian prosecutor stated that Frelix's death was the result of a terrorist act. Colleagues report that the day before his death, Frelix obtained further evidence relevant to his investigation. The autopsy concluded that the cause of the publisher's death was kidney failure caused by poisoning. UNITED KINGDOM Unconfirmed: 1 Tarsem Singh Purewal, Desh Pardesh Date of Death: January 24, 1995 Place of Death: London Purewal, editor and publisher of Desh Pardesh, was shot and killed near his newspaper's office in London's Southall neighborhood.

HONORED FOR THEIR EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE Journalists Receive 1995 International Press Freedom Awards The International Press Freedom Awards are given annually by CPJ to journalists around the world who have courageously provided independent news coverage and viewpoints under difficult circumstances. To defend press freedom, award winners have risked arrest, imprisonment, violence against themselves and their families, and even death. The 1995 Awards were presented on Dec. 6 in New York City to the following people: Yevgeny Kiselyov is cofounder of NTV, Russia's first financially and editorially independent television network, and anchor of its uncompromising news show "Itogi." Under Kiselyov's leadership, NTV has proved to be a reliable and unbiased news source. Its reputation--both in the minds of the viewers and the Kremlin--was cemented by its unflinching coverage of the Chechen conflict. Kiselyov was warned that he risked losing NTV's license if he did not present the government's policy in a more favorable light. Presenting the award, ABC News' Peter Jennings said of Kiselyov, "He was the one who took the phone call from the Kremlin and ignored it. And it was Kiselyov who went on the air when his colleague Vladislav Listyev was murdered and called it what it was--an act of intimidation." Kiselyov accepted the award on behalf of all Russian journalists who have resisted threats of censorship and other government pressure to provide the Russian public with balanced coverage of the Chechen conflict and other matters of public interest. JosÃ© RubÃ©n Zamora MarroquÃ­n is founder and editor in chief of Guatemala's most daring newspaper, Siglo Veintiuno (21st Century). In a country where at least 50 journalists of Zamora's generation have been killed for their work, his paper is known for its exposÃ©s of corruption, drug trafficking and human rights violations. In May 1993, when the president suspended the constitution, shut down the legislature and sent state censors under military guard to all newspaper offices, Zamora altered the paper's masthead to Siglo Catorce--14th Century--and ran solid blocks of ink in place of censored stories about the president's actions. "Without the power of the word, there was only the power of silence," said award-winning photojournalist Susan Meiselas presenting the award. "Zamora believed that silence could be heard." Readers understood, and while army troops seized copies and burned them in the streets, Zamora faxed the original uncensored newspapers around the world. The daily's coverage of the president's actions helped fuel an international protest, ultimately forcing him to quit and flee the country in disgrace. "You may think that we are courageous," Zamora told the guests at the awards dinner, "but in my country, many people think we are crazy. This award proves to us that we are the sane ones." Fred M'membe, editor in chief of Zambia's leading independent newspaper, The Post, faces criminal charges that could result in up to 100 years in prison for his paper's exposÃ©s of drug trafficking, abuses of power and government corruption. The Post became a defiant voice as Frederick Chiluba, the country's first democratically elected president, began to renege on his promises for reform. "As M'membe has written,the bitter truth is that free and fair elections do not guarantee the end to human rights violations," said NBC's Jane Pauley presenting the award. Chiluba has demonstrated his intolerance by invoking colonial-era statutes against M'membe for criminal libel, treason and "ridicule of the president"-- a charge for which truth is not a defense. In anticipation of the October 1996 presidential election in Zambia, Chiluba seems determined to silence M'membe by jailing him or closing down The Post, whose offices have been raided frequently by the military and by government-supported thugs. M'membe still stands strong. "I have always believed that there are supporters of press freedom, but I didn't know there were so many," he told guests at the awards dinner. "This to me is a big encouragement, that we are not on our own. We've got friends who do not face the same threats we face every day but are equally committed to the cause for which we stand. I will go back home more committed than ever before." Ahmad Taufik is president of Indonesia's only independent journalists union and the unofficial leader of the country's free press movement. He is serving three years in prison for publishing an unlicensed magazine, Independen, and for expressing "feelings of hostility, hatred or contempt toward the government." The 30-year-old Taufik helped found the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) in August 1994 as an alternative to the state-sponsored union, which had acquiesced in the government's decision to ban three leading investigative newsweeklies. AJI led public protests against President Suharto's crackdown on the press and began publishing Independen. The magazine ran investigative stories on government corruption that provoked the ire of officials such as Information Minister Harmoko, who, according to the magazine's reports, forced newspapers to issue him shares in their companies in return for granting them publishing licenses. Taufik was presented his award in absentia by New York Times columnist William Safire, who read a statement Taufik wrote in his prison cell: "To the [Indonesian] government, the press is something to be feared, to be regarded as an enemy to be crushed. The press is therefore subject to censorship and intimidation. Fellow journalists, I thank you for this award. I feel that it is not just for myself but for my colleagues at AJI, for other Indonesian journalists and for all those whose goal is freedom of the press." CPJ has initiated a letter-writing campaign to secure the release of Taufik and three of his AJI colleagues. Veronica Guerin, Ireland's leading investigative reporter, covers the criminal underworld for the Sunday Independent, the country's most widely read newspaper. As a result of her work, she has been the target of death threats and has been physically assaulted. In January 1995, the day after she published an article profiling the man suspected of masterminding the largest robbery in Ireland's history, she was shot and wounded in her home by a masked intruder. The attack was believed to be a warning from organized crime bosses. But in an article she wrote about the incident, Guerin vowed to continue her investigations and said, "I am letting the public know exactly how this society operates." "Guerin is known not only for her fearless reporting but for her accuracy," said the award presenter, Lesley Stahl of CBS' "60 Minutes." "Her commitment to defending the public's right to read the truth is impregnable." In September 1995, Guerin was attacked again, this time by a businessman who slammed her head against her car and threatened to kill her if she wrote about him. Her plight is a grim reminder that Western journalists sometimes face great risks in their own backyards simply for doing their jobs. Benjamin C. Bradlee was honored with CPJ's Burton Benjamin Memorial Award for his lifelong dedication to press freedom. As executive editor of the Washington Post from 1968 to 1991, Bradlee oversaw reporting that profoundly affected the public's perception of pivotal events in U.S. history and forever changed how Americans view government. In 1971, despite the threat of legal action by the Nixon administration, Bradlee published the Pentagon Papers, the classified Defense Department history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The next year--at great risk to all involved--the Post began the investigations that exposed the Watergate scandal, ultimately leading to President Nixon's resignation in 1974. "Ben had the courage to offend," said one of his star investigative reporters, Bob Woodward, who presented him with the award. "He never edited the Washington Post for his friends or for a set of ideas, political or otherwise."

He was jailed for his critical coverage of the countryâs military dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha. Though he was placed in solitary confinement, Igiebor was hardly alone. In fact, a record 182 journalists around the world were in jail at the end of 1995, all of them in retaliation for their reporting. That is one of the major findings of CPJâs annual report Attacks on the Press in 1995: A Worldwide Survey. The 300-page report, which was released March 14 at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., documents in compelling detail hundreds of attempts to silence reporters and news organizations around the world last year.

Bilello had just returned from Havana, where she was interrogated and deported after four days of meetings with representatives of the countryâs five independent news agencies. "These are journalists whose sole aim is to carve out a livelihood that is independent of state-controlled media and yet a comfortable distance from organized factions at home and abroad," she told members of the Congressional subcommittees on international relations and the Western hemisphere. "[They] face significant internal obstacles, including a lack of the most rudimentary supplies, inadequate financial resources and virtually no exposure to the workings of independent media. In addition, fax machines and modems are illegal unless authorized by the state." Bilello herself experienced some of the governmentâs intimidation tactics when she was arrested in her Havana hotel room and interrogated by Cuban Interior Ministry and Immigration officials on June 19. "During the eight hours I was detained, I got a taste of the Kafkaesque ordeal that many independent journalists have experienced," Bilello told Congressional representatives. "All of my personal notebooks, phone lists, business cards, and personal letters the journalists had given to me to mail in the United States were confiscated." On June 20, Bilello was expelled from Cuba on charges of "fomenting rebellion" --for meeting with independent Cuban journalists and bringing them modest gifts of supplies, such as pens and notebooks, and small donations for their news-gathering efforts from U.S. news organizations and other private sources. At the end of her testimony, Bilello submitted for the record a CPJ report on the plight of Cubaâs independent journalists and a list of CPJ recommendations for U.S. policy toward Cuba.

The student-run station Radio Index is also able to broadcast again. Dec. 3, 1996: Radio B-92 is taken off the air by Serbian authorities. In a letter delivered to the radio station, the Federal Ministry for Transport and Communication of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia declares that the station does not have a valid license to operate. B92's journalists remain on the premises of the radio station and continue to gather news and disseminate it by its Internet site on the World Wide Web: http://www.opennet.org/ B92 editor in chief Veran Matic points out in a letter to the Ministry that the station has repeatedly applied for a license since 1991, but its petitions have been rejected or ignored. He notes further that the radio transmissions were broadcast by a separate legal entity, Radio Television Serbia (RTS), the owner of the transmitter, which has an agreement with B92 to rebroadcast its programming. Dec. 3, 1996: The student-run independent station Radio Index, which shared a transmitter with Radio B92, is taken off the air by Serbian authorities. Dec. 3, 1996: The radio station Boom 93 in the town of Pozarevec is banned from broadcasting by government authorities. The private radio station owned its own transmitter and was operating under a temporary license. Nov. 29, 1996: In Podgorica, Montenegro, authorities threaten not to extend the frequency license of Antenna M, Montenegro's only independent radio station. Antenna M had also been broadcasting reports from Radio B92. Nov. 29, 1996: The Yugoslav Federal Inspector for Traffic and Communications bans five radio stations (Radio Ozon, Radio Soliter, Dzoker Radio, Radio 96, and Star FM) in Cacak, one of the cities in Serbia where the opposition defeated supporters of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in the recent local elections. Some of the stations had been broadcasting news programs from Radio B92. Nov. 27, 1996: The state-owned Borba publishing house refuses to print more than 70,000 copies of the independent daily Blic, which had started to print 250,000 copies after the onset of the demonstrations. The entire editorial board of the newspaper resigns after it is told to stop reporting on the demonstrations. Nov. 19, 1996: Radio B92's transmission is jammed regularly as the independent radio station begins coverage of widespread demonstrations to protest Milosevic's nullification of the opposition candidates' victories in most Serbian cities in the Nov. 17 municipal elections. By Nov. 28 the broadcasts of B92's entire program from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. the next day are completely jammed. Oct. 18, 1996: Milovan Brkic, an investigative journalist for the opposition-owned monthly journal Srpska rec, and a current candidate for the city assembly, is escorted from his office by two plainclothes state security policemen into a car. The policemen drive him to an undetermined location outside Belgrade, where other state security policemen are waiting. The officers then undress Brkic, beat him with sticks, and kick him. Brkic is eventually released and taken to a hospital, where doctors determine he has suffered three broken ribs, a damaged spleen, and a concussion. In the latest issue of Srpska rec, Brkic had published an article discussing the links between state security and organized crime. July 7, 1996: Slobodan Rackovic, a free-lance journalist based in Petrovac, Montenegro, is arrested and detained for more than three hours at a police station in Petrovac. Police do not bring formal charges against him, but rather describe the incident as an "informal talk." Rackovic's house is searched during his detention and the "talk" is continued the next day. At a press conference earlier, Rackovic had called for the removal from office of Montenegroâs public prosecutor and others responsible for the arrest of Bosnian refugees in Montenegro. May 29, 1996: City officials in the Serbian industrial town of Smederova take majority control of Radio Smederova, which had been the region's only independent broadcaster, and install members of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) on the station's executive board. The city government installs a new station manager and cuts off electricity at the station's offices to ensure the success of the takeover. April 7, 1996: Six policemen enter the printing offices of Koha, an Albanian-language weekly magazine in Pristina, and order printing to stop until they have examined the issue's contents. The prosecutor's office takes offense at a satirical composite photograph depicting President Milosevic alongside men in Nazi uniforms. The incident results in a three-day publication delay. March 9, 1996: During a live broadcast of an opposition party rally, the transmission of Radio B92 is blocked. The transmission jams about 40 times while speeches of two opposition leaders are being broadcast. Radio B92 believes police caused the transmission problems because signals can be blocked only from police stations. B92 reporters say that jamming occurs every time the station covers events about the opposition party. Feb. 15, 1996: Police from the SPS enter the offices of NTV Studio B in Belgrade and shut down its broadcast equipment. The Commercial Court annuls Studio B's registration as a joint stock company, allowing Belgrade's Municipal Assembly to gain control of the station. Most of Studio B's employees are replaced by members of the Municipal Assembly or the SPS. CPJ urges Milosevic to allow Studio B to resume broadcasting without state interference.

Since the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords on Dec. 14, 1995, the Committee has been particularly concerned about the dire state of press freedom in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are writing to express our great concern regarding both the constraints on press freedom and the free movement of journalists that we have observed in the period leading up to the Sept. 14 elections, and the future of independent local journalists and news media following the scheduled departure of international troops in December. By definition, no election can be considered truly free and fair unless the news media is able and willing to report fairly and openly to the entire electorate on the campaigns of all major contending parties, and all reporters, local and foreign, are free to cover the news without restrictions on their movements or justified fears of reprisals. With few exceptions, throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, these standards have not been met in the weeks leading up to the Sept. 14 elections. Despite guarantees of press freedom in the human rights annexes of the Dayton Accords, as well as separate agreements on accreditation procedures and the rights and duties of journalists, print and broadcast media are heavily restricted, particularly in Republika Srpska (Serb-controlled territory) and in Herzeg-Bosna (Croat-controlled territory) in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Muslim-Croat Federation, as distinct from the Sarajevo-based government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina). As CPJ and other international groups have confirmed, despite IFOR (Peace Implementation Force) press passes theoretically allowing freedom of movement, the few local reporters brave enough to drive from one ethnic enclave to another are intercepted on the roads and sometimes beaten, their ethnic identity easily determined from the residence codes on their license plates. Correspondentsâ submissions are rejected for âharming the national interest.â Journalists who cover the opposition are subjected to the same violence directed against rival political parties by those in power. Independent radio stations are drowned out by more powerful state-run programs and television screens go blank during critical debates. Air time reserved for opposition parties is either withheld in practice or used by the ruling parties to denounce their competitors. CPJ has received many other credible reports from foreign and domestic journalists about serious restrictions on their ability to work and travel, although they are reluctant to put such complaints on the record for fear of compromising their access to sources or opening themselves up to further recriminatory measures. The international community, charged with promoting and monitoring press freedom, has been slow to address these critical problems. Local and foreign journalists covering the election say the NATO alliance and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), charged with implementing the Dayton Accords, have been seemingly unwilling or unable to enforce compliance from the signatories to the Dayton agreement. Local governments have instead been blatantly obstructionist, preventing opposition parties from access to the media and harassing independent or opposition publications and broadcasts. Serb authorities expel reporters covering controversial stories; the Bosnian government has withheld permission for international satellite television; and Croat authorities threaten outsiders attempting to scrutinize corrupt local government. As an organization devoted exclusively to the defense of journalists and press freedom around the world, CPJ does not monitor the content or quality of local news coverage of election campaigns. In Bosnia, this important task has been undertaken by such respected organizations as the London-based International Crisis Group and the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, Media Plan, the Bosnian research institute, and the Swiss organization Medienhilfe Ex-Jugoslawien. Their findings about the discriminatory and obstructionist tactics of the ruling parties vis-a-vis media content dovetail with CPJ's findings about the mistreatment of journalists and the constraints upon the independent media. The attached briefing paper contains 1) summaries of the obligations assumed by all parties in the region on media freedom; 2) examples of harassment and intimidation of the print and broadcast media; and 3) comments by Western correspondents and monitors as well as local journalists. Monitors on the scene, as well as foreign and local reporters attempting to cover the news, quickly discovered months ago that there is no press freedom in Bosnia except for what is artificially created from the outside, and to some extent from the inside by the scarce number of independent journalists-- all at considerable difficulty, risk, and expense. All the major television, radio, and large-distribution newspapers are state-controlled, essentially the mouthpieces of the ruling parties of the SDS (Serbian Democratic Party of Republika Srpska), the SDA (Party for Democratic Action of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic), and the HDZ, (the Croatian Democratic Union of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. Efforts to inject alternatives into this extremely rigid situation have foundered. CPJ and other press freedom organizations have received numerous reports of anonymous intimidation of news media, dismissals or censorship of reporters for ethnic or political reasons; "power outages" that seem timed to controversial radio and television broadcasts; beatings of outspoken journalists in retaliation for their reporting; and near total obstruction of freedom of movement. A symbol of the region is what reporters have dubbed the "ghost bus" of Mostar, running between the divided sides of the city, empty except for the driver, accompanied by anIFOR patrol car -- and only once by a daring film crew. Most local reporters refuse to take advantage of even the rare escorted outings across ethnic borders organized by IFOR and OSCE. In most cases, both foreign and domestic correspondents do not want to publicize their difficulties, fearing reprisals. IN-TV, known colloquially as "Carl Bildt's televisionâ after the High Representative of the international community, an effort to patch together five local independent stations through satellite uplinks to provide unbiased campaign reporting for a majority of the population, is not scheduled to go on the air until Sept. 7 -- only a week before the elections. While the project has been plagued with financial and staffing difficulties, the Bosnian Government has been the main obstacle, refusing to grant the necessary broadcast frequency, and using police force and threats of violence to pressure the station into compromise. In a conversation on Sept. 2 with CPJ chair Kati Marton, High Representative Bildt acknowledged the problem of reaching rural audiences and recognized that the station's impact would be limited to major cities. He expressed concern for the future of the station, and has urged that its structures be used as a foundation for a more far-reaching and independent news broadcasting operation in the months and years ahead. The OSCE-sponsored FERN [Free Election Radio Network] radio station has persisted in broadcasting despite a recent ban from Republika Srpska authorities. While enormous international effort has been devoted to persuading Radovan Karadzic to step down from political life, his daughter, Sonja Karadzic, head of the government-controlled International Press Center in Pale, notorious for its exorbitant fees for foreign press accreditation and the imposition of "bodyguards" on foreign journalists, has quietly proceeded to invest heavily in a powerful new radio station, Orthodox Radio St. John. Western monitors are concerned that another newly established independent station, Radio Drina, with less technical capability, will be drowned out. Meanwhile Radio Zid, a popular independent station based in Sarajevo, has discovered that Radio St. John is broadcasting on its frequency, so that it can no longer reach its listeners. Radio Zid's efforts to get a new frequency assigned by the Ministry of Culture and to obtain intervention by IFOR or OSCE have been fruitless to date. A veteran foreign correspondent with international support and funding tried to help start an independent election daily in Banja Luka, the opposition base in Republika Srpska, but was unable to find independent editors or reporters willing to assume the risk. In conversations with CPJ, correspondents and media monitors expressed a great sense of discouragement with the international community. The failure to guarantee freedom of movement and of communication for local news media before the election bodes ill, as NATO forces are planning to withdraw by the end of the year and OSCE may not be financed for a continued presence after the elections. "You have to remember that we already went through a war. Our human and financial resources are exhausted, and we are on the edge of existence," commented one leading news executive, summarizing the sentiments of many. None of the local governments can be counted upon to enforce press freedom guarantees without constant outside pressure, experienced local journalists say. The OSCE's Media Experts Commission and subcommissions in regional centers, charged with ensuring freedom of information and movement and the unhindered work of the media, as well as free and equal access to the media, have not been functioning effectively. They must greatly improve their record of staying informed and rapidity of response. The Commission may require a different composition, since local journalists say they have been discouraged by the presence of Serb and Bosnian police chiefs in the Commission. While Interior Ministers are supposed to use their clout to foster freedom of movement, they are helping to institutionalize the notion that permission must be granted for travel across ethnic borders. As the international community assesses its response to the elections, we urge you to give serious consideration to the severe problems of journalists and press freedom in Bosnia. We urge that mechanisms be put in place to ensure that after the elections and after the withdrawal of IFOR troops, freedom to travel regardless of ethnic background will be enforced; the bias of state-controlled media will be monitored and exposed; forceful intervention will be made with regional authorities on behalf of struggling independent and opposition media; and rapid financial and technical assistance will be provided to private print and broadcast organizations. After the elections, the international community must continue to fund IN-TV and work to guarantee its autonomy and professionalism, while encouraging the emergence of other independent broadcast outlets as examples for the development of free media throughout the region. Thank you for your attention and we await your comments. Sincerely, William A. Orme, Jr. Executive Director cc: High Rep. Carl Bildt Hon. Herve de Charette Hon. Warren Christopher Amb.

I work for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization based in New York City. Our board of directors includes some of the most distinguished figures in the U.S. news business and is dedicated to the defense of the professional rights of journalists around the world, regardless of ideology or nationality. We are funded entirely by private donations, and accept no funds directly or indirectly from any government. CPJâs sole mandate is the promotion of press freedom: Our job is to document, protest and publicize physical and legal attacks on journalists and other violations of press freedom. Our organization has no position on the broad questions of U.S. policy toward Cuba, or indeed toward any other country, except to the extent that those policies have an impact on the ability of independent reporters, editors and broadcasters to do their jobs without official interference or fears of reprisal. As CPJâs program coordinator for the Americas, I am responsible for all our research and advocacy projects in the United States and Latin America. Before joining the CPJ staff , I have written about Latin America for several U.S. news organizations, including Newsday and The Dallas Morning News. As you would expect, Cuba is a priority for me, as it remains the one country in the Western Hemisphere where there is no press freedom at all. There is, however, a small but growing group of independent Cuban journalists who are trying to work outside the confines of state media. Because no nongovernmental news outlets are permitted within the island, these journalists must work exclusively for clients outside the country. SECTION I: Cubaâs Independent Journalists Struggle to Establish a Free Press An independent press is struggling to establish itself in Cuba. Dozens of independent journalists who were fired from their official jobs because of irreverent thinking about the revolution and its future are behind Cubaâs struggling free press movement. In just over a year, five upstart news agencies have been formed in Cuba. These agencies market stories about Cuba to news outlets in the United States and Europe. Since their founding, many of the agenciesâ journalists have endured waves of harassment. Several have been detained on charges ranging from "dangerousness"and "disrespect"to spreading "enemy propaganda."These are journalists whose sole aim is to carve out a livelihood that is independent of state-controlled media yet a comfortable distance from organized factions at home and abroad. The catalyst for Cubaâs fledgling independent press movement was the release of Yndamiro Restano from prison in June of 1995. Back in 1985, Restano had challenged the concept of state-controlled media and was banished from official journalism, forcing him to work in menial jobs. He went on to found Cubaâs first nonofficial journalism organization in 1987. He later founded a human rights movement seeking peaceful political change and was sentenced to prison for distributing information about it. A campaign by the Committee to Protect Journalists and other press freedom organizations, and the direct intercession of Danielle Mitterrand, wife of Franceâs former president, led to Restanoâs release. At the annual meeting of the Inter American Press Association (IAPA) on Oct. 15, 1995, leading Latin American and U.S. publishers accepted the journalistsâ application for membership. Those in Cuba who are trying to establish a free press face significant internal obstacles, including a lack of rudimentary supplies, such as pens and notebooks, inadequate financial resources and virtually no exposure to the workings of independent media. In addition, fax machines and modems are illegal unless authorized by the state. And most importantly, independent journalists face the absolute opposition of Fidel Castro. In recent months, the Castro government has intensified its campaign of harassment and intimidation of these independent journalists. We have repeatedly expressed our outrage at these incidents. Mr. Castroâs stepped-up anti-press campaign coincided with a crackdown on the dissident group Concilio Cubano and the shooting down of two planes piloted by the Miami-based, anti-Castro organization Brothers to the Rescue. In a visit to Cuba last week, I was able to learn more about these problems firsthand in discussions with the independent journalists there, and in my own encounters with Cuban authorities. I traveled to Cuba on June 16 to speak with representatives of all five news agencies. Four days after I arrived, however, I was arrested in my hotel room by Interior Ministry and immigration officials and taken in for interrogation. During the eight hours I was detained, I got a taste of the Kafkaesque ordeal that many independent Cuban journalists have experienced. It was chilling. One of my captors said, "We will never allow to happen here what happened in Eastern Europe when groups of a so-called civil society brought down those regimes.â All of my personal notebooks, phone lists, business cards and personal letters that journalists had given me to mail in the United States were confiscated. In addition, the names, addresses and phone numbers of members of the five news agencies as well as the names of people who are collaborating with these agencies but still work for state print and broadcast media were also taken. Although my trip was cut short, I did manage to meet and talk with dozens of the countryâs independent journalists, their families and colleagues. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today to pass along the thoughts and concerns of these brave and beleaguered journalists. One of the most formidable barriers facing the Cuban journalists currently struggling to establish an independent press is that they have been labeled dissidents by political forces in both in the United States and Cuba. And their effort has become a tool in the arsenal of both political sides. It is important for U.S. policy-makers to keep in mind that Cubaâs independent journalists do not think of themselves as dissidents. The willingness of these men and women to sacrifice so much stems from their desire to establish a free, objective, independent, uncensored press in their island-nation. SECTION II: Incidents of Harassment and Intimidation Against Cubaâs Independent Journalists on the Rise As I mentioned earlier, incidents of harassment and intimidation against Cubaâs independent journalists have increased since February, when the government initiated a crackdown against an internal dissident group and shot down two planes flown by the Miami-based Brothers to the Rescue. The following list, which unfortunately includes my own experience, contains the cases that were reported to the Committee to Protect Journalists and then verified by our own independent research. June 20, 1996, Suzanne Bilello, Committee to Protect Journalists Cuban Interior Ministry officials detained, interrogated and deported from Cuba a visiting staff expert from the Committee to Protect Journalists, accusing the U.S.-based press freedom organization of "fomenting rebellion"through its support for Cubaâs independent journalists. Suzanne Bilello, CPJâs program coordinator for the Americas, was arrested in her hotel room in Havana at 10:30 p.m. June 19 by two plainclothes Interior Ministry officials and a uniformed Immigration officer. She was brought for interrogation to Interior Ministry offices, where she was questioned for three hours about her activities and contacts in Havana. Cuban police interrogators seized all of Bilelloâs notebooks, personal papers, and other private documents, along with rolls of exposed film and other possessions. June 4, 1996, Roxana Valdivia, Bureau of Independent Press in Cuba (BPIC) Valdivia, a BPIC reporter, arrived in Miami with her family after being forced to emigrate. (See March 1, 1996, case.) The Committee to Protect Journalists sent a letter to Cuban President Fidel Castro, protesting what it considers to be the defacto expulsion of independent journalists from Cuba. May 31, 1996, Joaquin Torres Alvarez, Havana Press Torres, president of the independent news agency Havana Press, was threatened by two members of the state security police who went to his home and told him that he would be incarcerated if he continued to write for that agency. The police had initially informed him that he had received authorization to emigrate and should prepare to leave the country. However, Torres said that he never sought to emigrate, and told authorities that he had no intention of leaving Cuba. May 24, 1996, Lazaro Lazo, Bureau of Independent Press in Cuba (BPIC) Lazo, interim president of the Bureau of Independent Press in Cuba (BPIC), was arrested in Havana by two agents of Cuban State Security. He was detained for four days in Villa Marista, the main prison of the State Security. Upon being released, Lazo was warned to vacate his position at BPIC and to leave Cuba. May 2, 1996, Yndamiro Restano, Bureau of Independent Press in Cuba (BPIC) State security agents detained the father of Yndamiro Restano and held him for approximately 10 hours at Villa Marista, the central prison of Cuban State Security, before releasing him. Suarez was ordered to stop letting his home be used as the office of BPIC and was told that BPIC should cease its work immediately. Restanoâs father, who is in his 70s, is not involved in any journalistic or political activities. April 26, 1996, Bureau of Independent Press in Cuba (BPIC) Nine policemen ransacked the BPIC office for about four hours. They searched the office and confiscated files, correspondence, two typewriters, an antiquated word processor, a computer printer, and office supplies. In a letter to Cuban President Fidel Castro, the Committee to Protect Journalists stated that it considered the action tantamount to shutting down the news operation of BPIC and requested that all confiscated property be immediately returned to BPIC. April 23, 1996, Olance Nogueras, Bureau of Independent Press in Cuba (BPIC) Nogueras, a reporter for BPIC, was detained by agents of the political police in the city of Cienfuegos, where he planned to meet with Danielle Mitterrand, president of the French human rights organization France LibertÃ©. In a letter to President Fidel Castro, the Committee to Protect Journalists requested that Nogueras be released immediately. He was released two days later, after Mitterrand had left the country. March 13, 1996, Maria de los Angeles GonzÃ¡lez, Omar Rodriguez, Bureau of Independent Press in Cuba (BPIC) De los Angeles, a journalist and office worker for BPIC, and Rodriguez, a photographer for BPIC, were arrested and detained for seven hours. Both journalists were going to interview dissident Vladimiro Roca AntuÃ±ez of the Democratic Socialist Movement. March 6, 1996, Bernardo Fuentes, Bureau of Independent Press in Cuba (BPIC) Fuentes, a reporter for BPIC, was arrested by State Security agents on his way to attend a mass for the pilots who were killed when two planes from the United States were shot down by Cuban authorities on Feb. 24. The journalist was held for over three hours and released on the outskirts of Camaguey. State Security had detained Fuentes twice on Jan. 15 , saying independent journalism had no business in Camaguey. They also threatened him with arrest for "enemy propaganda" if he did not cease his journalistic activities. March 1, 1996, Roxana Valdivia, Bureau of Independent Press in Cuba (BPIC) Valdivia, a BPIC reporter, was given a verbal ultimatum by Cuban authorities at the beginning of March warning that if she did not secure a visa to emigrate by the end of the month she would be incarcerated on charges of refusing to obey orders to stop her work as an independent journalist. On March 20, she was granted a visa by the U.S. government, and on June 4, she left for the United States. During the three weeks in March that Valdivia was seeking a visa, her phone lines were frequently cut, at one point for as long as a week. On March 19, State Security agents surrounded her home. In October 1995, she was detained for one day by State Security in Havana and then was forced to return to her home in Ciego de Avila. After that, she was kept "confined"and under police surveillance, unable to leave her province without securing official permission. She was also not allowed to have any form of communication with BPIC. In a March 12 letter to Cuban President Fidel Castro, the Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the harassment of Valdivia and urged Castro to allow independent journalists to operate freely without the threat of harassment and imprisonment. (During the same time that Valdivia was kept under police surveillance, three other journalists were also "confined" in other provinces: Olance Nogueras in Cienfuegos; Hector Peraza in Pinar del Rio; and Bernardo Fuentes in Camaguey.) February 27, 1996, Rafael Solano, Havana Press Solano, president of the independent news agency Havana Press, was arrested by State Security on charges of alleged "association with persons with the intent to commit a crime." A request by his lawyer to free him on bail was denied by Cuban State Security even though, according to his lawyer, there were no legal grounds for his imprisonment. During Solanoâs detention, his health deteriorated seriously. He lost a considerable amount of weight and was running a high fever. On March 12, the Committee to Protect Journalists wrote to President Fidel Castro to express its concern about the continued incarceration of Solano and the pattern of harassment against Cubaâs independent journalists. On April 8, a day after the New York Times ran an article on his case and the challenges facing the Cuban independent press, Solano was freed, but the case against him was still pending. The Committee to Protect Journalists sent another letter to President Castro, welcoming the release but urging him to drop the charges against Solano and to close the case. Solano said that upon his release from jail he was given an ultimatum; emigrate or face a possible prison sentence. On May 8, he left Cuba for exile in Spain. February 21, 1996, Independent Journalists in Cuba In the week preceding the meeting of Concilio Cubano scheduled for Feb. 24, more than a dozen independent journalists were detained and held for interrogation. Among them were Ana Luisa Lopez Baeza, Juan Antonio Sanchez, Norma Brito, Rafael Solano, Maria de los Angeles, Hector Peraza Linares, Orlando Fondevilla, Lazaro Lazo, Nicolas Rosario Rosabal, Luis Solar Hernandez. All were released the same day or shortly after. SECTION III: Fidel Castro Presents Greatest Obstacle to Free Press in Cuba While there are as many personal opinions about Cuba and Fidel Castro as there are people in this room, we all share one core belief: we are all proponents of democratic change in Cuba. The Committee to Protect Journalists sees establishment of a free and independent media as a fundamental first step in that process. Castro remains the chief obstacle to freedom in Cuba for local and foreign journalists alike. Today, Cuba stands alone in the hemisphere as the only country that tolerates no independent newspapers, magazines or news broadcasts. That brings frequent U.S. criticism in international human rights forums, and it has earned Castro a spot on the Committee to Protect Journalistsâ enemies list of world leaders who pose the gravest threat to press freedom. Under increased international scrutiny and sorely in need of economic partners, Cuba is poised for historic change. Whether the transition is to democracy hinges largely on whether Cuba has a free press that gives it citizens the basis for informed decisions about how they want to be governed. CPJ works to support the efforts of Cubaâs independent journalists and news operations. In addition to our letters of protest regarding individual cases of censorship, harassment, imprisonment, or expulsion, we continue to appeal to the Cuban government to reform its policies toward journalists. We have called on President Castro to allow: Independent journalists to receive funds from overseas news organizations; Independent journalists to own fax machines, computers, and other tools of their trade; Independent journalists to operate freely without the threat of harassment or imprisonment; Cuba to open its doors to American news bureaus; and Foreign news organizations to employ and pay Cuban employees directly. SECTION IV: U.S. Policy Inadvertently Limits Growth of Free Press in Cuba It is clear that Fidel Castro is the major obstacle to a free press in Cuba. Ironically, the United States has become an unlikely ally in Castroâs efforts to justify keeping independent journalists isolated and vulnerable, subject to the whims of the state and cut off from potential foreign patrons. Essentially, independent journalism and its practitioners in Cuba are being held hostage to the political conflicts between the United States and Cuba. CPJ is concerned that Americaâs policies are doing more harm than good in the fight to establish the most fundamental democratic institution of all -- a free press. U.S. policy should support independent Cuban journalists in their struggle to be autonomous, unfettered by the political demands of any government. To this end, CPJ urges Congress to ensure that U.S. policy: Makes it easier for Western journalists and news organizations to work in Havana and employ Cuban citizens; Recognizes that Cubaâs independent journalists are not dissidents and should not be supported by U.S. aid.; and Ensures that Radio and TV Martiâs editorial content not compromise Cuban journalistsâ credibility and independence. A. Reexamine Section 114 of The Cuba Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, (Libertad Act). In October of 1995, following a major campaign by CPJ and other news organizations and press freedom groups, the Clinton Administration rescinded the 26-year-old ban on Cuban news bureaus in the United States and lifted Treasury Department restrictions on expenditures in Cuba by U.S. news-gathering organizations. CPJ urged President Castro to follow suit and permit U.S. news organizations to reopen bureaus in Cuba. We urged President Clinton to take this action because, in the words of CPJ Honorary Chairman Walter Cronkite, "It could lead to huge dividends in the most valuable of all commoditiesï¿½information, in this case about a neighbor on the brink of fast and far-reaching changes.â Unfortunately, a little-noticed provision in The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 overrides President Clintonâs executive order. Section 114 of the law authorizes the president to establish and implement an exchange of news bureaus between the U.S. and Cuba, if certain conditions are met: The exchange is fully reciprocal; The Cuban government agrees not to interfere with the establishment of news bureaus or with the movement in Cuba of journalists of any U.S.-based news organization, including Radio Marti or TV Marti; The U.S. Department of Treasury is able to ensure that only accredited journalists regularly employed by a news-gathering organization travel to Cuba; and The Cuban government agrees not to interfere with the transmission of telecommunications signals of news bureaus or with the distribution of publications of any U.S.-based news organization that has a news bureau in Cuba. Under the rubric of "reciprocity,"The Cuba Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 allows President Clinton to authorize a mutual reopening of news bureaus only if Cuba permits "distribution"on the island of all print or broadcast reports by news organizations stationed there. Since President Castro will not likely allow the distribution of all these materials as long as he is in power, the ultimate impact of this condition will be to prohibit the operation of U.S. news bureaus in Cuba. As a further assurance that an exchange of reporters would be "fully reciprocal,"the law sets as a precondition the opening of a Cuban office of the U.S. governmentâs Radio and TV Marti. For Mr. Castro, this is unthinkable, given that the ultimate goal of Radio and TV Marti is to destabilize his government. The lawâs supporters contend that Radio and TV Marti are the only functional equivalents of Prensa Latina, Cubaâs official international news agency. But in the U.S. system, as a matter of principle as well as law, it is the private media, not state-run information services, on which we rely for news. Another facet of Section 114 that hinders the advance of press freedom in Cuba is the requirement that U.S. Treasury officials determine which bona fide "accredited"journalists will be allowed to work in the island-nation. Only people "regularly employed with a news-gathering operation"need apply. This provision excludes free-lancers, including the distinguished writer Tad Szulc, Castroâs biographer. This sets a dangerous international precedent. In Latin America and elsewhere, leftist media unions backed by Cuba have fought for years for similar state licensing procedures, failing only because of the effective resistance of private journalism organizations backed strongly by the U.S. government. Whatever the broader merits or demerits of The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, the inadvertent impact of Section 114 is to hinder the exposure of Cubans (journalists and non-journalists) to the peaceful workings of a free and independent media, and to limit the information about Cuba available to Americans. Many of the Cuban journalists I spoke with last week agreed with CPJâs position that the establishment of U.S. news bureaus in Cuba would bring about a radical improvement for the islandâs independent journalists. The creation of job opportunitiesï¿½for stringers, reporters, editors, cameramen, soundmen, and other newsroom positionsï¿½would give Cubaâs independent journalists much-need training in how to operate as effective and objective professionals. CPJ urges Congress to reevaluate Section 114 of The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 in light of our analysis of its impact on the establishment of a free press in Cuba. B. Ensure Editorial Independence of Radio and TV Marti The Committee to Protect Journalists does not take a position on the political content of Radio and TV Marti. We recognize that Radio Marti fills a void in providing news and information to citizens of Cuba. Our fundamental concern is for the independent journalists in Cuba who work as stringers for Radio Marti. In my meetings in Cuba, journalists raised several concerns about Radio Marti. It should be noted that the station does not pay any of these independent journalists for news reports. Several complained to me that Radio Marti is almost exclusively interested in news about detention of dissidents. In fact, they said they experienced outright censorship from the stationâs editors. Others remarked that they felt the tone of some of the broadcasters was patronizing, making fun of the daily plight of Cubans. Anthony DePalma of The New York Times correctly characterized the political dangers for Cuban stringers for Radio Marti in an article published on April 17, 1996. DePalma writes, "The Cuban Government considers Radio Marti an American attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro. Cuban officials said men like Mr. Solano (one of Cubaâs leading journalists who formed Havana Press, an independent news agency, in May of 1995) are subversives, not journalists, and their association with Radio Marti constitutes a crime against the state.â The journalists I met with expressed fear that, in its pending move from Washington, D.C., to Miami, Radio and TV Marti could become more overtly political. If so, Cubaâs independent journalists who provide stories for the news organization can expect even greater vilification by Castroâs government. From CPJâs perspective and that of many of the independent journalists I met with in Cuba, Radio and TV Marti will be a more effective agent of democratization if its editorial content remains balanced. We urge Congress to closely examine the current editorial control policy of Radio and TV Marti to ensure that, following the move to Miami, the station continues to provide credible, professional information to the citizens of Cuba. This is more important than ever since Radio Marti is virtually the only source of information for Cubans about events in Cuba as well as the world. C. Forego U.S. Aid to Independent Journalists Section 109 of The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 authorizes the U.S. government to furnish assistance, financial and other support, for individuals and independent nongovernmental organizations to support democracy-building efforts for Cuba. The intention of this provision is to support the dissemination of information in Cuba on democracy, human rights, and market economies, and to support the individual dissidents and their families, and dissident groups, which circulate this information. CPJ is concerned that this provision will be broadly interpreted to include Cubaâs independent journalists. It would be a serious mistake -- and one with significant consequences -- to consider these men and women dissidents and therefore eligible for U.S. aid. CPJ urges the United States to refrain from offering this type of assistance to independent journalists. As I learned firsthand on my recent visit, Cubaâs independent journalists do not consider themselves dissidents. Their aim is to carve out a livelihood that is independent of state-controlled media yet a comfortable distance from organized factions at home and abroad. Financial assistance from the United States government to Cubaâs independent journalists will endanger their safety and discredit their effort to establish an independent press. Moreover, these payments would compromise the small press freedom gains already attained. I personally learned how grave a matter this is. I carried with me a modest amount of cash, raised exclusively from private funds, as well as reporters notebooks, pens and medicine, to distribute to the journalists I met with. After my arrest, however, my Cuban interrogators seized on the donations. Again and again, I was asked about their source and purpose. Despite what I told them, they were of the unshakable belief that these donations came from U.S. government funds, and that the recipients of those funds are clients of U.S. interests. Some critics of CPJâs position may argue that Cubaâs independent journalists do not have to accept these private donations if offered. But given the state of Cubaâs economy and the difficulty people face in trying to make a living as independent journalists, the offer of financial assistance is hard to turn down. Conclusion Fidel Castro remains the chief obstacle to freedom in Cuba for local and foreign journalists alike. However, some aspects of existing U.S. policies inadvertently promote Mr. Castroâs campaign to silence independent journalists and destroy the fledgling free press in Cuba. While these U.S. policies seek to promote the cause of freedom and democratic change in Cuba, they could have the opposite effect. The Cuban journalists I have spoken with tell me that the most important step the United States can take is to help create "free market opportunities"for journalists in Cuba. Removing the potential U.S. obstacles to the establishment of U.S. news bureaus in Cuba and ensuring the editorial independence of Radio and TV Marti will produce radical improvements for the islandâs independent journalists. Cuban journalists want the opportunity to work with and for independent news organizations. This will help accomplish four important goals: It will professionalize Cuban journalism through exposure to experienced, dedicated Western reporters and editors. It will economically empower independent journalists by creating real job opportunities with highly regarded politically- independent news organizations. It will advance the cause of press freedom by ensuring the presence of a politically independent news gathering operation in Cuba. And, last, it will help these journalists establish their credibility as independent observers in the eyes of their countrymen.

Please sign it and send it by E-mail (europe@cpj.org) or fax (212-465-9568) to Catherine Fitzpatrick, CPJ's program coordinator for Central Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union. His Excellency Boris Yeltsin President of the Russian Federation Moscow, Russia Fax: (7095) 206-0033 Your Excellency: I am writing to express my alarm at the recent rash of murders of journalists covering the war in Chechnya. At least five have been assassinated since the conflict began, three of them in 1996 alone. One appalling example is the execution-style killing of Obshchaya Gazeta correspondent Nadezhda Chaikova, who was killed in Gekhi, about 20 kilometers outside of the Chechen capital of Grozny. I join the Committee to Protect Journalists in their call for you to order a thorough investigation into Chaikova's assassination and to bring to justice those responsible. Chaikova, who was on assignment since March 6 in the Chechen Republic, was last seen by colleagues in Sernovodsk on March 19 and 20. Reporters who went in search of her in early April found photographs at the Urus-Martanovsky District prosecutor's office showing that she had been beaten, blindfolded, forced into a kneeling position and shot in the back of the head. The prosecutor explained that her body had been discovered on the outskirts of Gekhi near a sewage pipe but that a forensic exam indicated that she had been murdered elsewhere and her body dumped outside the village. Chaikova, who had frequently traveled to Chechnya and the surrounding regions, was known for her hard-hitting coverage of the war and issues such as Russian authorities' use of special "filtration" prison camps to control the population. I also call on you to prosecute those responsible for the murders of four other journalists killed covering the war in Chechnya: Nina Yefimova, a 25-year-old reporter for the Russian-language Chechen newspaper Vozrozhdeniye [Revival] who resided in the breakaway republic, was found dead on May 9, 1996, from a pistol shot to the back of the head. According to ITAR-TASS, both Nina and her mother, who was also murdered, were abducted from their apartment on the outskirts of Grozny on the night of May 8. Journalists in Grozny and Moscow believe that Yefimova's murder was related to stories she had published on crime in Chechnya. On May 10, the deputy interior minister of Chechnya told the radio station Ekho Moskvy that an investigation was opened and that suspects had been identified, but no further statements have been made. On March 11, 1996, Viktor Pimenov, a cameraman for Vaynakh, the national Chechen television station controlled by the pro-Moscow government, was killed in Grozny. ITAR-TASS reported that day that "Pimenov was shot in the back by a sniper hiding on the roof of a 16-floor building on Lenin Street." He was killed while filming the aftermath of the Chechen insurgents' raid on Grozny from March 6 to March 9, during which time Russian military officials kept all journalists out of the city. On June 17, 1995, Natalya Alyakina, a free-lance correspondent of dual Russian-German citizenship who worked for the German radio news service RUFA and the weekly magazine Focus, was shot dead by a Russian soldier just minutes after being waved past a Russian checkpoint outside the city of Budyonnovsk at the height of the hostage crisis. Her driver was seriously injured. Sergei Fedotov, the soldier who fired the shot, claimed it was an accident, but circumstances suggest that it was not, and serious blunders were made in the official re-enactment of the crime during the investigation. The military court in Stavropol announced that the trial would open in May, but the hearing was cancelled when some of the state's witnesses failed to appear. The next session has been postponed until after the June 16 elections. Farkhad Kerimov, a cameraman with Associated Press TV was shot dead in Chechnya. He was reported missing on May 27, 1995, and his body was found on May 29. Thirdly, I urge you to order complete investigations into the disappearances in Chechnya of four journalists: Maxim Shabalin, the assistant political editor of the St. Petersburg daily Nevskoye Vremya, and Felix Titov, a photographer for the paper, have been missing in Chechnya for more than a year. They left Nazran on Feb. 27, 1995, for their sixth trip to the breakaway republic since the fighting began. According to Nevskoye Vremya's editor in chief, the journalists were due back on March 4. But they have not been heard from since and are feared dead. Colleagues at Nevskoye Vremya heard word in September that the bodies of two journalists were found in February in the Achoy region of the republic. However, no documents or photographs were located to confirm the identities of the bodies. Nevskoye Vremya's Sergei Ivanov traveled to Chechnya on June 16, 1995, to look for Shabalin and Titov. He has not been heard from since. Andrew Shumack, an American free-lance journalist from Pennsylvania, was last seen on July 28, 1995, when he left Grozny and headed toward the surrounding mountainous area. The St. Petersburg Press, an English-language newspaper, had provided Shumack with a letter of introduction on July 20 to help him obtain press credentials. In return, Shumack was to provide them with photographs and stories for three months. He is feared dead because no one from the newspaper has heard from him since, and U.S. Embassy officials have not been able to locate him despite repeated trips to the region. And lastly, I join CPJ in their call for the release from jail of two Turkish journalists: Ali Tekin, managing editor of the Turkish Islamic weekly Selam, and Talip Ozcelik, a reporter with the weekly, were arrested on Nov. 2, 1995, while trying to enter Chechnya. Russian authorities told their colleagues at Selam that they are being held for "illegal entry." The pair was first held in Derbent and are now believed to be detained in Makhachkala, capital of Dagestan. According to the Anatolia News Agency, on April 10, 1996, a court in Dagestan sentenced the two men under Article 83 of the Russian Penal Code to three years in prison--the maximum sentence permitted under the law--for illegal border-crossing. In order for a free press to survive in Russia, journalists must be allowed to travel and report freely without fear for their safety or fear of arbitrary jailing. I respectfully request that you take all measures to ensure that security. Thank you for your attention. I welcome your comments and reply.

Sani Abacha Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces State House Abuja, NIGERIA Your Excellency: I support the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonpartisan press freedom advocacy group, in its campaign to obtain the release from prison of Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of the Lagos-based Tell magazine and a recipient of CPJâs 1993 International Press Freedom Awards. Igiebor was arrested on Dec. 23, 1995, by agents of the State Security Service. He continues to be held in solitary confinement without charge and has been denied legal counsel and family visitation rights. Igieborâs imprisonment is a clear violation of Article 19 of the United Nationsâ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states, âEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers.â Nigeria is a signatory to this declaration. Also in violation of Article 19 is the imprisonment of journalists Kunle Ajibade (TheNEWS), Christine Anyanwu (The Sunday Magazine), George Mbah (Tell) and Ben Charles Obi (Weekend Classique). They continue to be held in deplorable and life-threatening conditions, and have been denied the internationally recognized human right to medical care, legal representation and family visitation. I respectfully call on Your Excellency to order the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Igiebor and his colleagues and to allow them to resume their journalistic work. Until the time of their release, I also request that you grant them their rights to medical care, legal representation and family visitation. Lastly, I respectfully call on you to intervene on the side of press freedom and to uphold your public proclamations of support for an independent press by establishing an environment in which journalists may work freely and safely.

Fitzpatrick Committee to Protect Journalists INTRODUCTION Regardless of who wins the Russian elections, the press is likely to lose. The national Russian media have opted to rally--unabashedly--behind Boris Yeltsin, sparking charges of bias and unprofessionalism from Western journalists. Yet Yeltsin himself has been no press freedom champion. His government's failure to investigate the 13 documented murders and four disappearances of Russian journalists over the past two years is the most telling indication of its unwillingness to value and foster a free press. It is no surprise that the mainstream Moscow media have shunned or vilified Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. Ever since the Bolsheviks seized the first telegraph station, the Communists have strangled the press. Memories are still fresh of prior censorship and Central Committee press directives, of prison and exile for the most intrepid reporters. The neo-Communists have fueled journalists' fears with threats to nationalize private property and place a hard-liner in charge of state television. And Zyuganov, in response to the pro-Yeltsin coverage, has vowed to place the media under state control if he wins the election. But the prospect of another Yeltsin presidency bodes ill for Russia's vulnerable free press. Although independent newspapers, radio and television have thrived during Yeltsin's five years in office, they have done so despite his intolerance and even punishment of critics. Since the 1991 coup, Moscow's television and national newspapers have impressed the world with their hard-hitting coverage of the president's worst sins--the war in Chechnya, increasing poverty and rampant crime. But journalists have had to display incredible persistence and bravery to report honestly. Throughout the Chechen conflict, for instance, Russian troops have kept journalists out during the worst battles, jammed satellite transmissions, stolen reporters' cameras, exposed their film, and fired on their cars. And the Yeltsin government made several attempts to legally harass Russia's first independent television station, NTV, for its unflinching coverage of the carnage. (Despite the pressure, the station has kept up its grim nightly reporting on the war and has displayed skepticism about the latest peace accord.) More disturbing, however, is that under Yeltsin, the press has suffered its most violent attacks in decades, For some journalists, probing sensitive topics like corruption in the army or in business has led to their deaths in mafia-style contract killings. In 1996 alone, three journalists were gunned down in or near their homes and three were assassinated in Chechnya. At least two others were brutally beaten; and several have reported attempts on their lives or anonymous threatening phone calls. The deaths and beatings follow similar figures for previous years--and Yeltsin's government has failed to bring a single perpetrator to justice. These attacks do not necessarily emanate from the president, but stem from his lack of control over the so-called "power ministries" (i.e., the military, police, and security forces) and from their failure, in turn, to control violent groups in society. In 1994, Dmitry Kholodov, a reporter at the feisty daily Moskovsky Komsomolets who was investigating army corruption, was killed by an exploding briefcase that he picked up after receiving an anonymous telephone tip. In May of this year, a journalist at the same paper received anonymous death threats by phone and mail for her exposes on army corruption. The KGB's successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has been known to spread rumors discrediting journalists who have most closely covered Chechnya or other security-related issues. And summonses for "chats" at the FSB, invitations to collaborate, and demands to reveal sources--or face career difficulties--are still a fact of life. One reporter was warned by the FSB to stop covering a certain controversial story "or else your personal security cannot be guaranteed." Others have been urged by the military prosecutor to "share their information." Through his inaction, Yeltsin has sent a clear message that those who wish to threaten, attack, or even murder journalists may do so with impunity. CPJ calls on President Yeltsin to investigate and prosecute these crimes against journalists, and we urge President Clinton to stress the importance of press freedom in discussions with the Russian government. ----------- This briefing details the numerous murders, attacks and other difficulties Russian journalists have endured under Yeltsin's rule, highlights potential threats to a free press posed by a Communist victory and offers background on the economic hardships of the Russian media that foster a continued dependence on the government. Whoever wins the presidential elections must address these and other press-related issues, and it is up to the international community to hold the next president of Russia accountable for the violations of press freedom documented in this report.

The "fourth estate" in Russia is considered the most liberal, democratic institution in the country, in contrast to the government and the parliament, which have often reverted to Soviet-style information control. Journalists reporting the truth now play the role once limited mainly to dissident writers and scientists. But that independence, brought about in part by privatization of property following the 1992 market reforms, is very loosely defined and vulnerable to government and economic pressure. Jamey Gambrell, an American journalist based in Moscow who writes frequently on the Russian media, told CPJ in an e-mail interview on April 11: "Independent" is a tricky concept these days. Does it mean "founded on private capital"? Free-thinking? Founded after the fall of the U.S.S.R. (i.e. not started on the basis of one of the old dinosaurs)?" In fact, there are very few media outlets that are entirely financed independently. The Russian Media Institute reported in 1995 that almost 90 percent of the media are estimated to rely to a greater or lesser extent on government subsidies (Post-Soviet Media Law & Policy Newsletter, Issue 29, April 1996). The national press, in particular, is faced with new headaches as a result of privatization: loss of state subsidies for newsprint, drastic falls in subscription rates, and spiraling taxes and postage. As for broadcast media, even privately owned stations, like the country's most fiercely independent channel NTV or the partially private station ORT, depend on state-controlled transmitters and satellites. In this severe economic climate, both television and the print media have been forced to seek investment from business groups with close ties to the government and strong editorial preferences. Media owners make no secret of their preference for Yeltsin. Indeed, one prominent owner of TV stations and other independent media outlets, Boris Berezovsky, was among the group of 13 businessmen who in May publicly called for a postponement of the elections as a solution to the Yeltsin vs. Zyuganov dilemma. Meanwhile, the public has grown distrustful of the media. Some hard-pressed newspapers have been criticized for using underworld connections to sell advertising or accused of publishing dzhintsa, paid political or business puff pieces (so named for the once coveted items on the black market, dzhintsy, or blue jeans). The Economic Plight and Political Dependence of Media in the Provinces Last year's Communist victory in the parliamentary elections revealed that even Yeltsin's grip on national television stations and papers may not guarantee a victory for his side. Surveys show that most Russians in the provinces--where the presidential elections will be decided--get their news from local state-owned television stations and papers, many of which are pro-Communist. And many new Communist supporters among the pensioners and the recently unemployed do not believe what they hear on television and are too poor to pay for the more expensive, independent newspapers and magazines. The real news of the upcoming presidential elections may be that the Communists never left power, particularly in Russia's "Red Belt," the poorest areas of the country where subsidized factory directors and local apparatchiks still rule. Some provincial editors used to be district officials in the Communist Party, and newspapers in the provinces survive on subsidies from district or regional governments. The papers there are "careful not to write about too many potholes," one provincial journalist told CPJ, or they may face lawsuits for not being "objective." Most regional governors are Yeltsin appointees and have sometimes forcefully brought the media in their areas to heel. As can be seen from reports about Kostroma, Kaluga, Orenburg, and other cities in Choice of the Regions, a Russian e-mail bulletin on the media published by the Russian-American Press and Information Center in Moscow, "balanced coverage" is largely the artificial result of editors trying to keep two masters happy. Eric Johnson of Internews in Moscow told CPJ in an e-mail discussion on May 30, how this works: "Ten years ago, each republic, region, country, and city of any size had its own paper, totally controlled by the [local] governments (in effect, the Party). Starting five years ago the newspapers in many cases squirmed out from under government control ... [through their own efforts to gain outside revenue or investment]. But in many cases the papers have found they can't really make it on their own. By far their largest costs are paper, printing, and distribution, and the sources of all three of these services are still for the most part government-owned. And the prices they charge have been rising quickly ... far faster than ad revenue and subscribers' ability to pay. ... So the governments were asked to, and assented to, subsidize the local, formerly governmental newspapers." This support usually has been given in exchange for editorial consent to publish materials the local government feels are important.

Soviet "journalists" were mainly government information officers, and those who attempted to provide independent coverage, such as the editors of the samizdat publication The Chronicle of Current Events, were imprisoned or exiled. Memories of Soviet-era repression--prior censorship, government-imposed content, government press directives, and orchestrated campaigns of character assassination through the media--are still fresh in the minds of many editors today, some of whom experienced such methods firsthand. So it is little wonder that the media have reacted negatively to the prospect of a Zyuganov victory. When they haven't ignored him entirely, they have been vehement in their criticism. Russian columnists, for instance, pounced on Zyuganov for his hypocrisy in claiming tolerance for dissent when orthodox Communist journalist Nadezhda Garifullina of Sovetskaya Rossiya was fired in February 1996 for having criticized Zyuganov as too soft. The Communists have further fueled journalists' fears with frequent statements about their intent to renationalize private property, including the media. At a March 12 meeting of Communist academic consultants, who gathered to define strategy if the Communists come to power, there were calls for muzzling the press. A transcript obtained by Izvestia and published on April 17 quotes an economist who urged that the "media be prevented from mocking our military people." Presidential candidate Zyuganov went further: "The media are sitting on everyone's necks and dictating everything to the public. They distort the truth about laws passed, and impudently lie about ... the Russian Federation Communist Party [CPRF]. We will place the media under state control." If Zyuganov wins, it is clear journalists will have to battle to preserve the fragile freedoms they have won.

The hypothesis that the media, in a frightened scurry into the Yeltsin camp, would begin to parrot official Information Department statements that "there is no war" has generally proven false. The print media have generally kept up their critical coverage of the war. On April 5, for example, the state wire service ITAR-TASS interviewed the villagers of Shalazhi, which was destroyed by a federal forces air raid despite a peace agreement with the Kremlin-installed government of Doku Zavgayev. The interviews forced the government's information officers to issue contorted justifications: "Although in accordance with the president's decree, large-scale military operations in Chechnya have ceased, we must respond to provocations from the fighters and conduct special operations to destroy them." Also in April, Komsomolskaya Pravda noted, "The intensity of the fire has not lessened in the slightest along the entire line of resistance." And night after night, Russian television continued to contrast pictures of the shelling and blockading of Chechen villages with official pronouncements about seeking a peace process. But both state-owned and independent television stations have suffered reprimands, harassment and personnel shake-ups widely believed to be related to their critical coverage of the Chechen war and the president's performance: RTR--On Feb. 15, 1996, Oleg Poptsov, head of the state-owned station RTR was dismissed because, as President Yeltsin explained in remarks quoted by ITAR-TASS that day, "His channel painted everything black ... [broadcasting] a load of rubbish ... morbid stuff. ... There are corpses here, corpses there. This is wrong." Poptsov had long been under pressure to resign because of RTR's unfettered broadcasting of the carnage in Chechnya. NTV--In 1995, the government threatened to pull NTV's license over its coverage of Chechnya, and for a time, was attempting to prosecute a satirical puppet show called "Kukly" for "insulting" leaders. (The charges were eventually dropped in October 1995). In July 1995, the prosecutor opened up a case against NTV correspondent Elena Masyuk after she refused to reveal the whereabouts of a Chechen leader she had interviewed. The charges were ultimately dropped, but Masyuk was threatened again by authorities in December 1995 when she covered the story of a Chechen fighter's deposit of a cesium cylinder in a Moscow park. On Feb. 12, 1996, NTV was barred from news conferences in the Kremlin and prevented from covering Yeltsin's campaign trip to Yekaterinburg. The harassment stemmed from NTV's airing of hostile remarks made by Yeltsin's former press secretary. Ultimately the flap died down, and NTV regained access to the Kremlin. Since Igor Malashenko, president of NTV, the only privately owned Russian television station, joined the Yeltsin re-election campaign in April as chief media advisor, many have been concerned that his station's coverage of controversial issues would be toned down. In May, the station continued its excellent coverage of the war, but muted its previous caustic remarks about the president--a change some independent observers believed was necessary anyway, because the station's past record of ad hominem attacks occasionally raised questions about its objectivity. When Yeltsin arranged the signing of a cease-fire to commence June 1, NTV's broadcasts displayed skepticism. Malashenko's support of Yeltsin appears driven not just by fear for the media's independence after a Communist takeover, but by a promise that he could obtain all of Channel 4's bandwidth, which is currently divided between NTV and state television. In letters to the president obtained by Izvestia, Malashenko claimed he could achieve more for the campaign if he had the whole channel. Malashenko denies any such "deal," but has stated for the record on Radio Liberty: "Although I have not conducted any negotiations on that score, my new civic assignment [i.e. the Yeltsin campaign] will not prevent me from turning down Channel 4 if it will in fact be offered to NTV. I believe the channel should be entirely NTV's, entirely independent of the fact that I am the president's consultant ..." Izvestia believes that such close and repeated contact with Yeltsin is bound to increase Malashenko's chances of getting the channel--if his advice works in the campaign. The entire affair underscores the enormous degree to which even the most independent media rely on the government's good graces. ORT--Independent observers have noted that ORT, the public television station in which the government has 51 percent ownership, has moved noticeably to the right in the weeks before the campaign. One obvious indication was the hiring of notorious reactionary television host Alexander Nevzorov from St. Petersburg television. Nevzorov, a nationalist parliamentary deputy, was apparently brought on to help Yeltsin attract the nationalist vote with a new tabloid television program called "Days." Ratings were poor, however, and the show's name (and time slot) were soon changed to "Nights." (Izvestia, April 13, 1996). The Yeltsin Campaign's Manipulation of the Media Using the power of his office, President Yeltsin and his campaign aides have made several unveiled efforts to influence and control media coverage of the election race. Aware of the dwindling influence of the print media, Yeltsin's campaign managers have not focused their pressure on mainstream newspapers but instead have orchestrated a mass distribution to 10 million homes of a lavishly published anti-Communist broadsheet called God Forbid! The tabloid, which is published without a masthead, carries lurid stories of the horrors of communism and has falsely claimed that a popular Hollywood soap-opera star favors Yeltsin in the elections. Yeltsin's representatives commandeered Roskompechat, the nation's largest news distributor, to circulate the paper, and they have been on hand everywhere to make sure this publication is distributed "properly." By contrast, Izvestia, now a respectable, privately owned daily of record that is read widely throughout the former Soviet Union and abroad, has a circulation of less than half a million. During the election campaign, the Yeltsin administration set up a regional press agency under its jurisdiction on the initiative of Yeltsin's chief of staff, Nikolai Yegorov. Provincial journalists have been invited for weeklong, all-expense-paid trips to the capital and given access to top officials. The first group included 80 television and 60 radio correspondents who met with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in May. On May 6, Newsweek reported that it had obtained a letter dated March 21 from Yeltsin's chief of staff to local news services in Orel (a town known for heavy support of the Communists), advising that Yeltsin's staff was sending e-mail reports on the president's activities "for obligatory publication in the local state press [and for] broadcasting by local radio and television companies." In May, at a conference of journalists' organizations in Rostov-on-Don, concern was expressed about pressures on the media during the presidential campaign, according to the May 6 issue of Choice of the Regions, a weekly electronic publication of the Russian-American Press and Information Center. Local Yeltsin campaign organizers came to the meeting unannounced and hijacked the agenda to proclaim to local reporters that "reduction in state support to the mass media during the reform years had engendered a drive to publish all information that might grab the reader's interest." The campaigner called on the region's journalists "not to forget their professional duty during the upcoming election campaign: to be objective." According to the May 13 issue of Choice of the Regions, the Orenburg Region administration, made up of staunch Yeltsin supporters, vowed to become a co-founder of virtually every regional and city newspaper. Co-founders are needed for a newspaper to obtain and keep its registration status, which is essentially a license to publish. And government co-founders are needed to continue the flow of subsidies.

Obshchaya Gazeta correspondent Nadezhda Chaikova was found murdered execution-style on March 30, 1996, in the village of Gekhi, about 20 kilometers outside Grozny. In a follow-up to a conversation in early May, Chaikova's colleagues reiterated to CPJ on June 11 that the federal Russian prosecutor's office still has not opened an investigation into her death and that the local Chechen village prosecutor who originally took up the case is unlikely to get far because of limited resources. The editors of Obshchaya Gazeta, a respected weekly with a circulation of about 10,000, have mounted their own investigation and have sent reporters to the scene to check various hypotheses of her murder. A statement by a local official and a note by Chaikova point to federal troops as the suspects. But other clues indicate that Chechen leaders themselves may have ordered her death, believing that she was a spy and perhaps acting on rumors spread by the KGB's successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB). No firm allegation can be made because no central Russian investigation has been opened. Chaikova was seen in Sernovodsk on March 19 by Jaromir Stetin of the Czech news agency Epicenter, when she filed her report from the blockaded village, and on March 20 by Komsomolskaya Pravda reporter Alexander Yevtushenko. They reported that Chaikova was headed for Samashki and had plans to disguise herself as a Chechen peasant woman in order to cover the news there. She was often known to dress in a kerchief and long black skirt to appear "just like a local," according to Obshchaya Gazeta correspondent Alexander Trushin. Trushin and colleagues from the Russian wire services ITAR-TASS and Postfactum went to Chechnya in early April to look for Chaikova after she had been missing for more than 10 days and had failed to make a scheduled phone call to the newspaper's editorial offices in Moscow. The journalists started their search in Grozny, showing crowds of demonstrators Chaikova's picture, then worked their way through Chechen villages, some recently bombed by federal troops, interviewing residents there and placing ads about her disappearance on local commercial television stations. In Samashki, a local government official reported that Chaikova had spent the night of March 20-21 in his village, then had left with refugees through a safe corridor made by the Russian military and was reportedly headed toward Zakan-Yurt-Kulary. "Go look for her at the federals' [Russian federal troops' base]," the official instructed Trushin. "She had a camera and photographed everything they committed here." At the time, Russian troops were surrounding Samashki while they completed mop-up operations, detaining many civilians suspected of harboring guerrillas. Chechen fighters then told Trushin and his colleagues that an unidentified woman had been buried in a neighboring village and advised them to inquire at the Urus-Martanovsky District prosecutor's office. There the reporters discovered photographs that clearly indicated that Chaikova had been beaten, blindfolded, forced into a kneeling position, and shot in the back of the head. The prosecutor explained that her body had been discovered on the outskirts of Gekhi near a sewage pipe, but that a forensic examination indicated that she had been murdered elsewhere and her body dumped outside the village. Villagers buried her in their local cemetery in a Muslim ceremony. The body was exhumed April 12, and the Moscow correspondents made a positive identification. Nina Yefimova, a 25-year-old Russian reporter who resided in Chechnya, was found dead on May 9, 1996, from a pistol shot to the back of the head. According to ITAR-TASS, both Nina and her mother were abducted from their apartment on the outskirts of Grozny on the night of May 8. Yefimova's body was found the following morning in Grozny's Leninsky District, while her 73-year-old mother was found dead on the night of May 9 in a deserted canned food factory in Grozny. A local law enforcement official who declined to give reporters his name claimed that Yefimova's murder was committed "for private reasons," but journalists in Grozny and Moscow believe that her assassination was related to stories she had published on crime in Chechnya. On May 10, the deputy interior minister of Chechnya told the radio station Ekho Moskvy that an investigation was opened and that suspects had been identified. Yefimova was a contributor to Vozrozhdeniye [Revival], a Russian-language newspaper distributed in Chechnya. Although owned by the Moscow-installed government of Doku Zavgayev, Vozrozhdeniye was described as relatively independent by the Glasnost Defense Foundation (GDF), a Moscow-based media watchdog group. On March 11, 1996, Viktor Pimenov, a cameraman for Vaynakh, the national Chechen television station controlled by the pro-Moscow government, was killed in Grozny. ITAR-TASS reported that day that "Pimenov was shot in the back by a sniper hiding on the roof of a 16-floor building on Lenin Street." He was killed while filming the aftermath of the Chechen insurgents' raid on Grozny from March 6 to March 9, during which Russian military officials kept all journalists out of the city. Throughout the war, Russian soldiers have been known to fire on vehicles duly identified as carrying journalists. One such incident had a deadly outcome. On June 17, 1995, Natalya Alyakina, a free-lance correspondent of dual German-Russian citizenship who worked for the German radio news service RUFA and the weekly magazine Focus, was shot dead by a Russian soldier just minutes after being waved past a Russian checkpoint outside the city of Budyonnovsk at the height of the hostage crisis. Her driver was seriously injured. Sergei Fedotov, the soldier who fired the shot, claimed it was an accident, but circumstances suggest that it was not, and serious blunders were made in the official re-enactment of the crime during the investigation. On Feb. 13, 1996, the investigation was closed and the case was handed to a military judge in Stavropol to try the soldier on the minor charge of "misuse of a weapon." Eyewitnesses, including Alyakina's husband, Gisbert Mrozek, a German correspondent for RUFA, have repeatedly protested to Russian officials the slow and inept handling of the case. Last year, information released to Mrozek and a colleague by Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Medvedev, indicated that a different soldier may have been the perpetrator, or that two soldiers may have been involved. Currently the judge is postponing any examination of this latest hypothesis. And only through the strenuous efforts of his lawyer has Mrozek himself been called as a witness in the trial. He had been sitting next to his wife in the car when she was shot. The military court in Stavropol announced that the trial would open in May, but the hearing was cancelled when some of the state's witnesses failed to appear. The next session has been postponed until after the June 16 elections. Currently four correspondents, including one American photojournalist from Pennsylvania, are missing and presumed dead in Chechnya. Maxim Shabalin, the assistant political editor of the St. Petersburg daily Nevskoye Vremya, and Felix Titov, a photographer for the paper, have been missing in Chechnya for more than a year and are presumed dead. The two experienced war correspondents had left Nazran on Feb. 27, 1995, for their sixth trip to Chechnya since the fighting began. According to Nevskoye Vremya's editor in chief, the journalists were due back on March 4 but were never heard from again. Colleagues at Nevskoye Vremya received word in September that the bodies of two journalists were found in February in the Achoy region of the republic. But there were no documents or photographs to confirm the identities of the bodies. Nevskoye Vremya reporter Sergei Ivanov traveled to Chechnya on June 16, 1995, to look for Shabalin and Titov, but he never returned, and no trace of him has been found. In recent months the newspaper's correspondents have repeatedly queried high-ranking Russian and Chechen officials about their three lost colleagues but have not been given any concrete information about their fate. One top Russian official commented to a reporter, "We know everything, but we are not telling." The newspaper has since stopped its on-site coverage of Chechnya. Andrew Shumack, an American free-lance journalist from Pocono Pines, Pa., was last seen on July 28, 1995, when he left the Chechen capital of Grozny and headed toward the surrounding mountainous area. The St. Petersburg Press, an English-language newspaper, had provided Shumack with a letter of introduction on July 20 to help him obtain press credentials. In return, Shumack was to provide them with photographs and stories for three months. He is feared dead because no one from the newspaper has heard from him since, and U.S. Embassy officials have not been able to locate him, despite repeated trips to the region, where they have circulated a flyer with his photograph to humanitarian organizations. In addition to the murders and disappearances of journalists covering the Chechen war, there was one recent failed attempt on the life of Alexander Minkin, a Moskovsky Komsomolets commentator known for his bitter satirical accounts of Yeltsin, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, and the government's actions in Chechnya. On Feb. 20, 1996, at 4:20 a.m., Minkin and his wife were awakened by the sound of breaking glass from the balcony of their second-story apartment. As two pipe-wielding masked intruders stumbled over television wires and a crate of apples near the doorway, the Minkins were able to escape and call the police. This was the second attack on Minkin; in September 1995, he suffered a fractured nose in a beating by unknown assailants near his home. On March 18, 1996, The Los Angeles Times quoted Minkin as saying: "Everyone is afraid because it is obvious who is behind this. Who else besides the leadership could be interested in killing me?" At least two journalists are known to be imprisoned in Chechnya for attempting to enter the region: Ali Tekin, managing editor of the Turkish Islamic weekly Selam, and Talip Ozcelik, a reporter with the paper, were arrested on Nov. 2, 1995, while trying to enter Chechnya. Russian authorities told the journalists' colleagues that they were detained for "illegal entry." The pair were first held in Derbent and are now believed to be detained in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan. According to the Anatolia News Agency, on April 10, 1996, a court in Dagestan sentenced Tekin and Ozcelik under Article 83 of the Russian Penal Code to three years in prison--the maximum sentence permitted under the law--for illegal border-crossing. Reporting Conditions in Chechnya* In general, reporting conditions in Chechnya have been dangerous--at least four journalists have been killed by cross fire--and difficult. Correspondents must file stories from poorly working, government-controlled phone lines; and foreigners who attempt to get around this obstacle must rent costly satellite telephones. In order to obtain accreditation and permission to move around in the area, reporters are heavily dependent on the good graces of the Moscow-installed Chechen government and the Russian federal troops. Those who disobey the rules are vulnerable to attack. In January 1996, journalists attempting to follow the Chechen hostage crisis that spilled over into neighboring Dagestan were held at bay, attacked by guard dogs, shot at, detained, and fed misinformation by Russian soldiers and officials. Initially, on Jan. 10, officials only allowed crews from state-controlled television and a small, arbitrarily chosen group of reporters access to the site of the hostage seizure in the village of Pervomayskoye. On Jan. 16, Peter Ford of the Christian Science Monitor encountered a road block five miles outside of the village, and when he attempted to ask a militiaman a question, the militiaman let loose a German shepherd, who bit Ford, seriously wounding him above his right knee. An ABC correspondent and cameraman were also attacked by guard dogs. When a New York Times reporter attempted to drive by a checkpoint, his car was fired upon by soldiers in a Russian military jeep. On the previous day, a Worldwide Television News agency producer and cameraman gained entry into Pervomayskoye, but authorities detained the journalists and confiscated their equipment. Russian officials repeatedly told journalists that the reason for the attack on the village was that two policemen had been hanged; this turned out to be untrue. In May, prosecutors sent a terse reply to CPJ's letter protesting these incidents. They wrote that the investigation had been discontinued because no perpetrators were able to be identified.*For more information about the dangers of reporting from Chechnya, see the "Correspondent's Safety.Net" Contract Killings in Moscow and the Provinces In addition to the slayings and attacks related to the war in Chechnya, CPJ is gravely concerned about the unsolved murders of eight journalists who were killed for their reporting in Moscow and the provinces. These have had a chilling effect on the behavior of Russian journalists and have left the stage open for future attacks. Whether or not the Yeltsin government is involved, through their inaction, Russian authorities are tacitly signaling would-be attackers that they can murder journalists with impunity. As David Satter, a former Moscow correspondent for the Financial Times and a former CPJ program coordinator, wrote in CPJ's Attacks on the Press in 1995: "[Russian journalists] risk their lives if they report on organized crime or corruption in the armed forces or if the financial interests of their media organization bring them into conflict with a corrupt group. ... More unsettling than the killings themselves, however, has been the attitude of the Russian authorities. Despite the fact that a number of the murdered journalists have been national celebrities, there has been little effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. Instead, after a journalist is murdered, an investigation begins, sometimes with considerable fanfare, and the effort then fades amid signs that investigators are being hampered by interference at a high official level." When CPJ or domestic press freedom groups raise the issue with Russian officials, we are told that law enforcement offices are overwhelmed in general by the wave of organized crime in the country. A widely cited government report claims that 80 to 90 percent of private business in Russia is controlled by or forced to pay extortion money to organized crime groups. According to ITAR-TASS, Valery Serebryakov of the Chief Directorate for Organized Crime reported that there were 5,000 criminal gangs in Russia with 32,000 members, and that of those 5,000 gangs, 100 have international ties. According to a Reuter dispatch on April 12, 1996, Interfax quoted Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov as saying that 35 percent of crimes that took place in 1995 have not been investigated, including 8,000 murders. Skuratov told the lower house of parliament in a hearing that investigators, overloaded with work and underpaid, even fail to register two out of every three crimes. The newspaper Trud reported on May 18 that of the nation's murders, some 500 were identified as contract killings, of which only 61 were solved. Skuratov has met with the Russian media watchdog group Glasnost Defense Foundation to discuss the cases, and his subordinates have politely--but not substantively--replied to CPJ's letters of concern. CPJ, which conducted a fact-finding mission to Russia in November 1995, notes that in most of the murder cases it has documented, the journalists appear to have been writing about the very issue the government is trying to cope with--the underworld and its heavy influence on Russian business and politics. Investigative journalism is clearly needed in Russia, but it can be lethal to carry out. In May, yet another journalist was killed in a gangland-style hit: Viktor Mikhailov, a reporter for a leading daily regional newspaper, Zabaikalsky Rabochy [Trans-Baikal Worker], was killed in Chita, a city in southeastern Siberia. His mutilated body was found on May 13, 1996. According to Interfax and AP dispatches on May 13, Mikhailov covered law enforcement and crime agencies in Siberia. Some of the cases still not brought to trial are as follows: On Oct. 17, 1994, Dmitry Kholodov, 27, an investigative reporter for Moscow's largest daily Moskovsky Komsomolets, was killed in his office when he opened a briefcase that exploded and shattered the lower part of his body. He had picked up the attachÃ© case at Kazan Station after receiving an anonymous telephone tip about a story he was working on involving corruption in the armed forces. Yeltsin said he would personally supervise the investigation, but Pavel Gusev, editor of the paper, told CPJ in November 1995 that the investigation was "running in place." Gusev and his colleagues have conducted their own investigation and said they would print their allegations if they became completely convinced that the official inquiry was going nowhere. Seven months later, the official investigation has not progressed, and Gusev has not made any public statements, a fact that has drawn criticism from journalists outside the newspaper. On March 1, 1995, Vladislav Listyev, the executive director of Russian Public Television (ORT), was shot dead as he entered his apartment block. The murder was apparently connected to his role in the reorganization of the state-owned Ostankino television company as ORT, a joint stock venture. One of Listyev's first actions after assuming his position was to suspend all advertising at the station in order to re-examine the station's controversial and corrupt dealings with mafia-controlled intermediary firms selling advertising time at inflated prices. It is widely believed that an Ostankino advertising syndicate contracted Listyev's killing, but even with such obvious leads, no real progress has been made. The investigation has been riddled with personnel changes, infighting between the prosecutor's office and the Federal Security Service (FSB), claims that suspects already in custody from other investigations are related to the case, and periodic rumors released to the press from "competent sources" stating falsely that arrests have been made. Boris Berezovsky, owner of the Logovaz group, has a large share of the investment in the partially private stations ORT and TV-6 and in two leading independent periodicals, the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta and the magazine Ogonyok. He himself was the victim of an attack in 1994 that forced him to seek medical treatment and temporary refuge abroad.

Despite the mediaâs progress in the last five years, they continue to operate in a climate where the government has the power to intervene in their work. In accordance with the Press Law, the State Inspectorate for Defense of Freedom of the Press and Mass Information (previously known as Glavlit, the state censorship agency) operates under the Russian federal governmentâs Committee for the Press. The Inspectorate, which has branches in provincial cities, is empowered to give warnings to media outlets that allegedly violate the law. In addition, every regional administration (i.e., provincial government) in Russia has a Committee for the Media that can decide matters relevant to funding and news content. The Glasnost Defense Foundation has documented numerous incidents where inspectorates in the provinces violated procedure when attempting to enforce press regulations. Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes: Government Enforcer of "Balance" In an ostensible effort to mediate the numerous conflicts that arise with the emergence of a free press, the Arbitration Information Court was formed in 1993. The "court"--an ad hoc, extrajudicial body of prominent legal scholars and media professionals--was given a mandate to "secure equal access to the mass media for all participants in the electoral process and to bring about functional solutions to disputes and conflicts arising in this regard," as one of its members, lawyer Viktor Monakhov, wrote in Sreda [Medium] in March 1996. At first, the "court" was viewed as a positive but temporary effort by the reform elements of the government to handle controversial questions like the granting of air time to political parties during the 1993 parliamentary elections. The organization was subsequently renamed the Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes and placed under the administration of the Russian president. The Judicial Chamber was then given a permanent mandate to enforce "balanced" coverage of controversial issues and legal measures regarding inflammatory content. Some journalists and other independent observers soon began to express doubts about the increasing influence of the extra-judicial body on press issues. Writing in the Cardozo Arts and Entertainment Law Journal (vol. 13, no. 3, 1995), Jamey Gambrell commented: "While in theory it is an innovative and needed institution, and indeed served a fruitful purpose during the December [1993] elections, it has insufficient legal status to enforce its decisions, and its actual effect on journalistic practice is so far unclear." Several journalists writing on controversial issues have found that the Judicial Chamber plays a negative role: Svetlana Alexeyich, a Belarus journalist noted for her critical coverage of the Afghanistan war and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, frequently contributes to Izvestia because she is often unable to publish in her own country. Alexeyich told CPJ on April 26, 1996, that she had been notified by the Judicial Chamber of the need to address a problem of "imbalance" that resulted from what was seen as her one-sided portrayal in Izvestia of the partisan movement in Belarus during World War II. Izvestia was then ordered to carry material with the partisan veteransâ point of view. A protest statement signed by the veterans was run in the May 5 issue of Izvestia with an editorial comment that the group had appealed to the Judicial Chamber and "had the right to its own truth." In 1993, Yaroslav Mogutin, one of the countryâs few openly gay journalists, was arrested, held overnight in jail, and charged with "hooliganism" for using profane language in an interview with a prominent gay dancer that was published in Novy Vzglyad, a weekly nationalist newspaper distributed as a supplement to Moskovskaya Pravda. Charges were also filed against the weekly, even though the use of profane language had become quite common in many papers, including the high-circulation Moskovsky Komsomolets. The case was eventually dropped, but not before Mogutin and his partner were harassed by local policemen who would repeatedly come to their apartment in the middle of the night to extort money, threatening the couple with criminal prosecution if they did not comply. In 1995, after Mogutin published an article on the war in Chechnya in the January issue of Novy Vzglyad, the Judicial Chamber held two hearings on his writings and accused Mogutin of violating Article 74-1 of the Penal Code, which calls for a prison term of up to 7 years for "incitement of ethnic hatred, corruption of public morals and defamation of the Motherland." The Chamber recommended that the state shut down Novy Vzglyad, revoke its publishing license, and launch a criminal case against Mogutin. Based on this recommendation, the prosecutorâs office opened an investigation against him in April 1995. As a result of the continuing harassment, Mogutin went to the United States to seek asylum. Independent journalists pointed out in regard to the 1995 case involving Mogutin that although at least 50 openly fascist journalists are allowed to publish in Russia--some tied to armed extremist groups--the Judicial Chamber had not moved against them, nor had the Russian courts, with the exception of four cases in the last two years, two of which follow: In 1994, the Chamber had concluded that the virulently nationalist and anti-Semitic newspaper Kolokol [The Bell], which supports Zyuganovâs candidacy, was inciting ethnic intolerance in violation of the constitution and the Press Law, although nothing came of its recommendations to local authorities to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law. The central district court in Volgograd, where the paper is published, had earlier ruled in favor of the Union of the Russian People, the organization that publishes Kolokol and which sued another local paper, Gorodskiye Vesti, for slander when it carried criticism of the extremist group. The court ordered that Gorodskiye Vesti print a retraction and acknowledge that its characterization of the group was "incorrect." Editor in chief Anatoly Karman told Izvestia, "The very fact that the suit of the Black Hundreds was won can only be viewed as a form of insurance [by the local government]. What if [the nationalists] really come to power as they say they will ?" In April 1996, prompted by complaints from the Russian Union of Journalists and the parliamentâs Committee on the Press, the Judicial Chamber decided to go after the notorious figure Eduard Limonov, publisher of Limonka (circ. 6,000-8,000). The Judicial Chamber charged him with violating "international and Russian law, and Article 4 of the Law on the Mass Media, which prohibits the propagandizing of mass terror and hatred, and the damaging of Russiaâs international reputation." They sent a recommendation to the Moscow city prosecutorâs office, which will determine whether to prosecute Limonov for "incitement of ethnic hatred" under Article 74-1. On March 2, 1996, Novy Vzglyad reprinted material that Limonov had published in Limonka in 1995 which claimed that Stalinâs brutal deportation in World War II of entire peoples, like the Chechens, were "actions of justified prevention" and that, regrettably, "he didnât finish the job." The Judicial Chamber did not accept Limonovâs defense that he was reacting emotionally to the Chechen hostage-taking crisis in Budyonnovsk. In explaining their ruling, experts summoned to the hearing found that "the actions of individual criminals should not be ascribed to the entire nation." The Judicial Chamber recommended that The Russian Federation Committee for the Press, the government press regulation body, give Limonka an official warning. (After two such warnings the paper could lose its registration status, i.e., its license to publish.) Limonov is also being investigated by the prosecutor generalâs office in Ukraine for calling for a "violation of territorial integrity" by urging that the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol be annexed to Russia. CPJ does not take a position on the content of these papers, but we note that we do not defend persons whose writings explicitly advocate violence. The point here is to illustrate the troublesome nature of the Chamber as an extrajudicial but extremely influential body that may not work in favor of press freedom in every instance. Provincial journalists, however, have welcomed the Chamberâs extensive intervention in disputes between repressive local governments and struggling independent media. Still, the continued existence of this body is largely a function of the weakness of the unreformed judicial system and the complexities inevitably introduced by the governmentâs attempts to enforce extensive, intrusive, and often ill-defined press laws. Libel Suits As in many countries dealing with an emerging free press, libel suits are clogging the Russian courts. When public figures--many of them die-hard nationalists or Communists--are angered by the mediaâs unfavorable portrayal of them, they appeal to the courts for defense of their "honor and dignity." Several leading newspapers are fighting slander suits on behalf of their correspondents, but they have not been very public about their struggles. Slander accusations and suits clearly bedevil many journalists and are so much a part of their working lives that they rarely bother to complain about them as any kind of "pressure" or "harassment." But it is clear that they are a significant drain on their time and resources, and ultimately these cases may have the effect of curbing journalistsâ frank characterizations of odious figures. Even providing a forum for critical comments made by prominent figures, such as reform economist Yegor Gaidar or former Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, can land a newspaper or TV station in court on charges of slander. Both Gaidar and Kozyrev have lost libel suits and been compelled to publish retractions to their comments in newspaper articles and television interviews. Although in most instances journalists are forced to react to accusations of defamation from various political figures, ranging from Yeltsin to extremist Vladimir Zhironovsky, at least one editor attempted to turn the tables. Globus Syndicate reported in V zashchitu Svobody Slova (no. 9/96) that in September 1995, Kronid Lubarsky, deputy editor of the weekly magazine Novoye Vremya, sued the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, in defense of his "honor and dignity." The suit was brought in response to comments made by Stanislav Govorukhin, head of a parliamentary commission investigating the Chechen war. Govorukhin claimed that the mass media had "launched a colossal disinformation campaign" inspired by Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, who, Govorukhin alleged, had paid large sums of money to a number of journalists, including Lubarsky. To prove that his sole desire in bringing suit was to set the record straight, Lubarsky set the amount for damages at one ruble. Since the parliament as a body cannot be sued under Russian law, Lubarsky was then forced to sue Govorukhin personally in the district where the parliamentarian resides. The Gagarin District Court repeatedly postponed the hearing, most recently until June 17, the day after the Russian elections, apparently wishing to determine first how the political winds will blow. On the advice of his lawyer, Lubarsky also tried to sue the other members of the Govorukhin Commission for "inaction" in setting the record straight, but the Supreme Court ruled that while unlawful acts of the government can be appealed, "inaction" by such bodies could not be the subject of a suit. Lubarsky appealed to the chairman of the Supreme Court to review the handling of his complaint, but sadly, the journalist died in May of a heart attack at the age of 61 before his case could be heard.

Already Zyuganov is filing formal complaints with the Central Electoral Commission about unfair media coverage and lack of television access, and revenge will certainly be on his mind if he loses. Fending off angry charges of election fraud, Yeltsin may be inclined to limit coverage of the Communist opposition on television or temporarily close Communist newspapers as he did after suppressing the 1993 parliamentary rebellion. Since then, faced with an even more contentious parliament and an unending war in Chechnya, Yeltsin has strengthened the president's security apparatus and allowed the FSB, Interior Ministry and military to harass journalists unchecked. Meanwhile, investigations have languished or have not even been started on 13 assassinations--sending a grim signal to would-be assassins dissatisfied with journalists' work. CPJ urges the Russian government to fully investigate the murders and disappearances of the following journalists, and to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice.

Reporting ugly truths in Russia CPJ honors Yevgeny Kiselyov By Jeanne Sahadi The Russian governmentâs efforts to control coverage of the Chechen conflict were, in the end, futile. Public opinion turned against Boris Yeltsin, and he found himself fighting not only to put down a rebellion but to salvage his political career. For that reason, the name Yevgeny Kiselyov is not a favorite one in the Kremlin. Kiselyov, a co-founder of the countryâs first editorially and financially independent television network, NTV, led the campaign to bring the Russian public factual, objective information about the Chechen uprising. Kiselyov, one of the winners of CPJâs 1995 International Press Freedom Awards, had been warned that if he did not present the governmentâs policy in the breakaway republic in a more favorable light that he risked losing NTVâs license. He refused to bow to official pressure, and his successful resistance encouraged even the state-run broadcasters to take a more balanced approach in their coverage. In awarding Kiselyov, CPJ is honoring all Russian journalists-- especially those in television-- who resisted government harassment in their efforts to provide objective news reports on the conflict. NTV has also proven to be a critical government watchdog in the run-up to the countryâs December parliamentary elections and the 1996 presidential elections. The now-ousted acting general prosecutor Alexei Ilyushenko learned that the hard way. As part of an effort to crack down on Yeltsinâs critics, he launched criminal cases against an NTV reporter for interviewing a Chechen commander and against the stationâs satirical puppet show for slandering prominent figures of state. In response, the popular news show âItogi,â (Wrap-Up), which Kiselyov anchors, ran a thoroughly investigated exposÃ© on Ilyushenkoâs career that raised serious questions about the prosecutorâs honesty and judgment. Defiantly hard-hitting reporting in the face of pressure from state and nongovernmental forces is also what distinguishes the other winners of this yearâs International Press Freedom Awards. And it is what has made legendary the career of The Washington Postâs Ben Bradlee, CPJâs Burton Benjamin Memorial Award honoree. JÃ³se RubÃ©n Zamora MarroquÃ­n, Guatemala When JÃ³se RubÃ©n Zamora Marroqu&iacuten convinced leading businessmen to invest in his independent newspaper, Siglo Veintiuno (21st Century), he began down a road on which at least 50 journalists before him have been murdered for their efforts to cover both the countryâs civil war and the various parties that have kept its fires burning. Since its inception in 1990, Siglo Veintiuno has shaken Guatemala, unearthing official wrongdoing and naming names in the process. When President Jorge Serrano suspended the constitution in May 1993 and began to systematically censor all independent coverage of his actions, Siglo Veintiuno was the first newspaper to challenge his orders, and it led a civic campaign that eventually deposed the president. Zamoraâs paper also has broken ground in human rights reporting. It was the first daily to publish an investigation into the murder of anthropologist Myrna Mack, who was killed in 1989 on orders of a high-level military officer. Thanks in part to Siglo Veintiunoâs investigation, the killers and military officer who ordered the murder are in jail or will face trial soon. Zamora and his staff have had to pay a price for their fearlessness. In the last year, pressure to soften their hard-line reporting has intensified. The editor in chief points to a series of articles linking leading military officers to drug trafficking and car theft rings to explain the militaryâs all-out hate campaign against his paper. In February, heavily armed men driving a vehicle belonging to an army officer drove Zamora off the road and threatened to kill him. And in May, several of his reporters received telephone death threats. If the pressure does not cost Zamora his life, it may cost him his job. This year, despite the paperâs financial success, he barely survived a vote of confidence from the paperâs board of directors who, he explained, are âconcerned about the dailyâs future.â Acknowledging the stress he is under, Zamora said, âIt is difficult to remember whatâs right when one is the only person saying it.â Ahmad Taufik,Indonesia Ahmad Taufik, president of Indonesiaâs only independent journalists union, will be conspicuously absent from CPJâs awards dinner on Dec. 6. Locked up in an Indonesian prison, he is serving a three year jail sentence for publishing an unlicensed magazine and for expressing âfeelings of hostility, hatred or contempt toward the government.â The 30-year-old Taufik helped found the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) in August 1994 as an alternative to the state-sponsored union, which had acquiesced to the governmentâs decision to ban three leading newsweeklies. Like Taufik, many AJI members are young and had worked for the banned magazines, which were known for their independent coverage of Indonesiaâs military and political affairs. AJI led public protests against President Suhartoâs publication bans and documented the crackdown in a timely and independently produced book. Under Taufikâs leadership, AJI also began publishing the influential Independen, a limited-circulation magazine that ran investigative stories on government corruption and other subjects that raised the ire of Suharto and his information minister, Harmoko. Following AJIâs formation, authorities, with the support of the state-sponsored union, pressured editors to fire any AJI members on their staffs. As a result, more than 80 have lost their jobs. Taufik has been held in prison since March 16, when he and several other colleagues were arrested at an AJI gathering. Two--Eko Maryadi and Danang Kukuh Wardoyo--were also sentenced to prison for three years and 20 months, respectively. To help speed the release of Taufik and his colleagues, CPJ has initiated a letter-writing campaign on their behalf. Fred Mâmembe, Zambia Thereâs only one thing to do when youâre facing criminal charges that could earn you up to 100 years in prison. Continue to publish the newspaper that got you into trouble in the first place. That has been the decision of Fred Mâmembe, the editor in chief of the leading independent Zambian daily The Post. Charged with treason, criminal libel, defamation of the president, contravention of the State Security Act and violation of the Drug Act, Mâmembe has proven a favorite target of the Chiluba government, which has erupted over The Postâs coverage of government corruption, drug trafficking and sex scandals allegedly involving the president. The acrimonious relationship between the government and The Post began soon after Chiluba, the countryâs first democratically elected president, came to power in 1991. The Post became a critical voice when Chiluba failed to deliver promised reforms. The Postâs offices have been subjected to military raids on several occasions and its printer, which is government-controlled, was recently ordered to stop the paperâs presses. Undaunted, Mâmembe purchased his own printing facilities. The road ahead for Zambiaâs leading editor is treacherous. The government has been particularly eager to stamp out unfavorable coverage as competition for dwindling international aid increases. And with elections upcoming in 1996, President Chiluba is anxious to find a scapegoat for what many say is his losing hand. Even if Mâmembe survives the fallout from the election year unscathed, there is no telling his future: The candidate expected to win, Kenneth Kaunda, has already demonstrated his intolerance for opposing views during his 30-year rule of Zambia under a one-party system. Veronica Guerin, Ireland âHis gloved hand lifted the gun up towards me. I shifted my eyes up to his, I think maybe to appeal to him, but he had no eyes, just a black motorcycle helmet.â Veronica Guerinâs silent plea may have saved her life. Rather than shoot Irelandâs leading investigative reporter in the head, her assailant lowered his gun and shot her in the thigh. He then left her lying in the entryway to her home. The day before, on Jan. 29, 1995, the Sunday Inde- pendent had run Guerinâs story profiling the man suspected of masterminding a Â£3m Brinkâs-Allied robbery, the largest in Irelandâs history. Her shooting was widely believed to be a warning from organized crime bosses to rethink her career path. The Irish justice minister has launched a police investigation into the attack, but no one has been arrested. A week after the shooting, Guerin published her account of the experience and vowed to continue her investigations. âIn deciding to continue . . . I am simply doing my job,â she wrote. âI am letting the public know exactly how this society operates.â Guerin has also been attacked or threatened on several other occasions. In October 1994, shots were fired at her home after she wrote about the slaying of gangster Martin Cahill. And in September 1995, an Irish businessman from whom she was seeking an interview slammed her head against her car and threatened to kill her if she wrote anything about him or his family. Guerinâs precarious situation is a grim reminder that Western journalists sometimes face great risks in their own backyards simply for carrying out their work.

Orme, Jr., executive director In May 1993, Guatemalaâs increasingly unpopular president decided that he had had enough of democracy. He issued decrees suspending the constitution, shutting down the legislature and muzzling his most obstreperous adversary, the daily press. State censors were dispatched under military guard to all newspaper offices. Some papers quietly acquiesced, substituting innocuous filler for stories the censors ordered killed. Others, however, bravely spotlighted the censorship by leaving gaping holes on the page and notifying readers that the missing copy had been deleted on government orders. One feisty daily, Siglo Veintiuno (21st Century), took its protest a step further. Almost all its stories dealt directly with the presidentâs power grab, obliging the government to censor virtually the entire edition. The editor, JÃ³se RubÃ©n Zamora Marroquï¿½n, replaced every excised story with a solid block of ink. He then slyly altered the masthead to Siglo Catorce--the 14th Century--and shipped the conspicuously blacked-out paper to newsstands. The authorities were not amused: Army troops seized copies and burned them in the streets. Simultaneously, Zamora was faxing to hundreds of local opinion leaders and to news organizations around the world the original uncensored version of the paper, led by its editorial denunciation of this âreturn to the dark ages.â The dailyâs thorough coverage of the presidentâs actions helped fuel an international campaign of protest, ultimately forcing the president to quit and flee the country in disgrace. Equally important, Siglo Veintiuno and a few other combative newspapers set a new standard for press freedom in the country. In any nation with a history of authoritarian rule, this response to official censorship would be considered courageous. But in Guatemala, where at least 50 journalists of Zamoraâs generation have been murdered by army-linked death squads, Siglo Veintiunoâs defiance represented an enormous calculated risk. That the gamble paid off is of historic consequence, and not just for Central America. In many countries now moving shakily from dictatorship to democracy, the press is playing the lead role in holding governments accountable for their actions, and in defending citizensâ newly won freedoms. Zamora, a winner of CPJâs 1995 International Press Freedom Awards, has counterparts today in dozens of developing nations--people like fellow award-winner Fred Mâmembe of Zambiaâs The Post. Mâmembe is constantly fighting criminal libel charges designed to frustrate his combative coverage of official corruption. As readers of The Post will attest, this harassment has been manifestly unsuccessful. If Zambia succeeds in a transition from governing-party domination to genuine multiparty pluralism, Mâmembe and his colleagues in the local press will deserve much of the credit. The emergence of independent news media is having a deep and seemingly lasting impact on societies with no tradition of tolerance for dissenting opinions and uncensored information. There is no more dramatic example than Russian television coverage of the war in Chechnya, led by award-winner Yevgeny Kiselyovâs NTV. The very fact that there were broadcasters reporting openly, and even caustically, about a domestic military adventure shows how profoundly Russia has changed, and how its increasingly free press is playing a key role--if not the key role--in making those changes permanent. American journalists, zealously and properly protective of their status as independent observers, may question the very concept of editors playing a conscious role in the basic tasks of nation-building. But the historical context is radically different. Zamora, Mâmembe and Kiselyov should perhaps be compared not to a Ben Bradlee (another distinguished 1995 award recipient), but to a John Peter Zenger. They are pioneers and, in the most profound sense, patriots.

Reuters reporter targeted in Turkeyâs censorship campaign By Jeanne Sahadi U.S. reporter Aliza Marcus, the Istanbul correspondent for Reuters, thought she was simply doing her job when she reported on the forced evacuation of Kurdish villages in November 1994. Turkish authorities thought differently. Her story, which appeared in the Kurdish paper ÃzgÃ¼r Ãlke, caught their attention. In July 1995, well past the six-month statute of limitations under which formal charges may be brought, they charged Marcus with âinciting racial hatredâ under Article 312 of the Penal Code, a provision frequently used to quell open discussion of the Kurds. Those convicted face up to three years in jail. Fortunately for Marcus, who is the first American to become ensnared by this censorship campaign, Istanbulâs State Security Court acquitted her of all charges on Nov. 9. But not before the reporter waged a time-consuming legal battle, and CPJ spearheaded an international campaign on her behalf. In addition to sending protest letters, arranging editorial board meetings between Marcus and the press, and lobbying influential U.S. congressmen to urge Turkish authorities to drop the charges against her, CPJ went straight to Turkeyâs prime minister. Walter Cronkite, CPJâs honorary chair, met with Tansu Ciller in Ankara in September. âAs I explained to the prime minister, Turkeyâs international image as a democratic nation would have been badly battered if the prosecution of Ms. Marcus moved forward,â Cronkite said. That image is one Ciller has been eager to maintain as the country is anxiously seeking membership in the European customs union. In October, the Turkish parliament voted to reduce the penalties called for under Article 8, a part of the countryâs anti-terror law that broadly defines âseparatist propaganda,â a charge that has been used frequently to jail journalists writing about the Kurds. At the end of 1994, CPJ documented the imprisonment of 74 journalists in Turkey--more than any other country in the world. Ciller said the changes to Article 8 âwill help insure that Turkeyâs citizens enjoy full freedom of expression, along with safeguards against terrorism.â Short of throwing out Article 8 and Article 312 altogether, however, any such incremental changes are inadequate to bring about real improvement in the treatment of the press in Turkey. After she was acquitted, Marcus said: âI was really happy to see all the support I got from CPJ and other groups. I hadnât realized how much pressure I had been feeling. Now I look forward to getting back to work without having to worry about this case.â (c) 1996 Committee Protect Journalists | Front Page| CPJ Website |                                                                        WT01-B01-145IA023-000251-B032-146http://www.cpj.org:80/pubs/newsletter/fall1995/ghezali.html 169.132.35.44 19970108122723 text/html 4125HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 12:26:50 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 3954Last-modified: Thu, 02 May 1996 03:55:12 GMT CPJ Dangerous Assignments Quarterly Fall 1995 Internet Edition No. 49 Selima Ghezali, editor, La Nation Murder as expression in Algeria By Jeanne Sahadi When Islamist extremists first began murdering journalists in Algeria in 1993, it was thought that the victims were chosen for their political beliefs. Now that 50 have been assassinated and the spectrum of those targeted has fanned out to people from all political persuasions, it has become clear that there is no logic to the assassinsâ vengeance save one thing: the desire to be heard. That is the conclusion of Selima Ghezali, the editor of the leading Algerian weekly La Nation. Ghezali, who was visiting the United States in October, told participants in a meeting sponsored by CPJ and Human Rights Watch/Middle East that killing journalists has become a form of expression for the Islamist extremists in Algeria since Islamists are prohibited from publicly expressing themselves. âItâs a hidden war. Every day there are Algerians being killed either by the security forces or by terrorists, but this news does not get out because the government completely controls the information,â Ghezali said. âBut whenever a journalist or intellectual is killed, the information appears. It becomes a method for the terrorists to tell you they are there by killing public figures and people covered in the news.â Furthermore, Ghezali said, the murders of journalists serve as good public relations for the government. âYou have a regime that is much more Machiavellian than one could have imagined, that uses these assassinations for its own benefit. We know that there is mobilization abroad over the killings, and that is something we need. At the same time, when these protests come out, the Algerian newspapers that support the regime put these protests very prominently in the paper to show that thereâs support for the regime abroad.â Ghezali has come under fire from the government for advocating political dialogue with the Islamists. La Nation has been suspended or seized on several occasions in 1995 and most recently was placed under the disciplinary control of the judiciary for printing an interview with an Islamist leader who did not make any calls for violence during the course of the interview. The leader has since gone into hiding to escape the police. The Algerian public, like other societies under a one-party system, have learned to be skeptical about what the media report, Ghezali said. âFor the last six months, every evening there have been loud explosions that we hear. Thereâs gun fire and mass arrests. But we donât see it in the newspapers. So people know the press is unable to report the things that are happening. But in an oral culture such as ours, information gets around.â (c) 1996 Committee Protect Journalists | Front Page| CPJ Website |                                                                        WT01-B01-146IA023-000251-B032-210http://www.cpj.org:80/pubs/newsletter/fall1995/bradlee.html 169.132.35.44 19970108122800 text/html 4238HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 12:27:32 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 4067Last-modified: Thu, 02 May 1996 03:55:14 GMT CPJ Dangerous Assignments Quarterly Fall 1995 Internet Edition No. 49 Ben Bradlee reviewing the next dayâs headline: âNixon Resigns.â Photo by David R. Legge, The Washington Post. Ben Bradlee: Stories from a good life in journalism The highest points of Ben Bradleeâs career were born from some of the lowest in the U.S. government. Under Bradleeâs editorship, The Washington Post provided coverage that in many instances profoundly altered the publicâs perception of pivotal events in U.S. history and forever changed how Americans view government. The following excerpts from his memoirs, A Good Life: Newspapering and Other Adventures (Simon & Schuster, 1995), demonstrate the depth of his commitment to press freedom, for which he is being honored by CPJ with the Burton Benjamin Memorial Award. The Pentagon Papers, June 1971: âWith the Times silenced by the Federal Court in New York, we decided almost immediately that we would publish a story the next morning. . . . Failure to publish without a fight would constitute an abdication that would brand the Post forever, as an establishment tool of whatever administration was in power. . . . What I didnât understand, as [Katharine Grahamâs] 'Okay. . . . Letâs publishâ rang in my ears, was how permanently the ethos of the paper changed, and how it crystallized for editors and reporters everywhere how independent and determined and confident of its purpose the new Washington Post had become. . . . A paper that stands up to charges of treason, a paper that holds firm in the face of charges from the president, the Supreme Court, the Attorney General, never mind an assistant attorney general. A paper that holds its head high, committed unshakably to principle.â On being asked by Assistant Attorney General William Rehnquist to cease publication of the papers: âThe charge of espionage did not fit my vision of myself, and all I knew about Title 18 spelled trouble. Thatâs the Criminal Code. But with as much poise as I could muster, I said, 'Iâm sure you will understand that we must respectfully decline.â He said something like he figured as much, and we hung up.â Watergate, 1972-74: âI suspected our telephones were probably being tapped, that our taxes were surely getting a world-class audit, but I had never felt physically threatened. Now they were saying that our lives were in fact in danger. . . . âIt is a formidable task to convince the public that officials often--more often than not, in my experience--use the claim of national security as a smoke screen to cover up their own embarrassment. Those of us who heard Richard Nixon claim he could not explain Watergate because matters of national security were involved will never automatically accept claims of national security.â (c) 1996 Committee Protect Journalists | Front Page| CPJ Website |                                                                        WT01-B01-147IA023-000251-B032-262http://www.cpj.org:80/pubs/newsletter/fall1995/world.html 169.132.35.44 19970108122837 text/html 13452HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 12:28:13 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 13280Last-modified: Thu, 02 May 1996 03:55:31 GMT CPJ Dangerous Assignments Quarterly Fall 1995 Internet Edition No. 49 Around the World Reporting on Iraqi connections in Jordan proves risky business Salameh Ne'mat, the Amman correspondent for London's Al-Hayat newspaper, was arrested on Oct. 3 and spent three days in jail after he was refused bail. Ne'mat is accused of violating two articles of Jordan's Press and Publications Law: publishing an article that is harmful to national unity and writing an article without consideration to objectivity, fairness and accuracy. The charges against Ne'mat stem from a controversial article he wrote for Al-Hayat on Sept. 20 in which he alleged that 42 Jordanian businessmen, journalists and officials were on the Iraqi government's payroll. The article, which did not name the 42 individuals, cited unnamed Jordanian officials as saying that the government is investigating the extent of Iraqi influence in media and business circles. Al-Hayat is standing behind the accuracy of the story. King Hussein, who supported the Iraqi regime during the Persian Gulf war and its aftermath, has distanced himself from Saddam Hussein since the August defection of two of Saddam's sons-in-law to Jordan. On Oct. 22, Jihad al-Khazen, the editor in chief of Al-Hayat,was also named in the case. The trial is scheduled to begin in November. --Avner Gidron Journalist killed as rivals battle to control the press in Kashmir Mushtaq Ali, a photographer for Agence France-Presse and camera operator for Asian News International, was fatally injured on Sept. 7, when a parcel bomb addressed to Yusuf Jameel, Srinagar correspondent for the BBC and Reuters, exploded in his hands. Jameel and Habibullah Naqash, a photographer for Asian Age and United News of India, sustained minor injuries in the explosion, and Jameel's office was damaged extensively. No one claimed responsibility for the bomb. Jameel's coverage of the Kashmir conflict has often drawn criticism from both militant groups and the Indian government. The attack was condemned by CPJ, State Governor K.V. Krishna Rao, and the separatist All-Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC), which called a three-day general strike in the Kashmir Valley in protest. Kashmiri journalists went on strike again on Sept. 20, after a split in a leading militant group, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, left the local press subject to conflicting ultimatums from the rival factions. The strike was called off on Sept. 28, after APHC leaders successfully mediated between the two factions and the local press community. While the second strike was under way, government pressure on journalists continued as well. On Sept. 26, Border Security Force troops detained Ashraf Shaban, editor in chief of the Urdu daily Al-Safa, for nine hours, and according to press accounts, accused him of meeting with militants on a regular basis. Shaban's father, former Al-Safa editor Mohammad Shaban Vakil, was slain by gunmen in April 1991, in an as-yet unresolved case. Vakil's death and previous attacks on Yusuf Jameel are documented in CPJ's report On a Razor's Edge: Local Journalists Targeted by Warring Parties in Kashmir. --Vikram Parekh Detention, harassment still threaten Cuban journalists In November, 19 freedom of expression organizations, led by CPJ, issued a joint statement expressing concern over the recent wave of detentions and harassment of independent journalists in Cuba. In retaliation for a story about safety hazards at a nuclear power plant, state security officials detained reporter Olance Nogueras Roce four times in two weeks. They gave Nogueras, who writes for the Bureau of Independent Press of Cuba (BPIC), the choice between imprisonment or exile and warned him against continuing to work for BPIC. Nogueras was released from his last detention on Oct. 31, but as of this writing remains under house arrest and is forbidden from traveling to Havana, where the BPIC's offices are located. He has rejected exile to gain his freedom and faces rearrest. To date, Cuban officials have accused Nogueras of "dangerousness," "usurping the role of a journalist," and "spreading false news that could endanger international peace." His family has been threatened against making statements to the BPIC about his fate, and the BPIC Havana offices remain under surveillance. BPIC was founded in September by formerly imprisoned journalist Yndamiro Restano, who was released in June 1995 after a protest campaign led by CPJ and other international press freedom and human rights groups. --Ana Arana U.S. publisher may face criminal charges in Cambodia Cambodia's two co-prime ministers, Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Ranariddh, have lodged a criminal complaint against the Phnom Penh Post,a highly regarded English-language weekly. The complaint accuses the paper of disinformation, incitement and creating political instability. The claims stem from an article by Nate Thayer in the paper's March 24-April 6 issue, which described security measures taken by the two prime ministers to prevent a coup from occurring while they attended an aid meeting in Paris. The publisher, Michael Hayes, a U.S. citizen, faces up to nine years in prison and heavy fines if he is convicted on charges of disinformation under Article 62 of the criminal code, a holdover from the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The government has already relied on the criminal code to muzzle several Khmer-language newspapers. On Oct. 6, for instance, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction of Chan Rotana, editor of Samleng Yuvachun Khmer (Voice of Khmer Youth). Chan had been sentenced on Feb. 27 to one year in prison and fined 5 million riels (US$2,058) for printing an article that accused Ranariddh of naively following Hun Sen's dictates. In a highly irregular move, the appeals court approved a government request to change the charge against Chan from disinformation to defamation shortly after the hearing began. But even though he was convicted of a lesser offense, the court retained the sentence imposed in February--a move of dubious legality, which Chan plans to contest before the Supreme Court. --Vikram Parekh Brazilian police and city officials suspects in journalist murders Four journalists have been killed in Brazil since March 1995. Evidence in all the cases suggests that they were killed as a result of the stories they were either investigating or had already published on local corruption. A policeman pulled the trigger on Marcos Borges Ribeiro, owner of the magazine O Independente, who was shot four times at point-blank range in his home on May 1. His wife said that Borges had received death threats after his paper reported on alleged human rights abuses by the local police and other city officials. The police are also suspects in the Aug. 29 murder of Reinaldo Coutinho da Silva, owner of the weekly Cachoeiras Jornal in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Unidentified assassins intercepted the journalist's car and pumped 14 shots at close range. His paper had linked members of the police force with corruption. At the time of his death, he had also been investigating a local politician's role in an environmental scandal. --Ana Arana UNESCO meeting in Yemen to focus on Arab media In January 1996, journalists from all over the Arab world will gather in Sana'a, Yemen, for UNESCO's Seminar on Promoting Independent and Pluralistic Arab Media. The conference is taking place at a time of crisis for Arab journalists. In Algeria, the media is experiencing an unprecedented existential threat. Fifty journalists and dozens of other media workers have been hunted down and killed by religious extremists. In Egypt, Tunisia and the Palestinian National Authority, journalists are under assault by governments that use the threat of Muslim fundamentalism as an excuse for cracking down on all critical reporting. And in much of the Arab world, hereditary regimes and secular dictatorships permit no independent media whatsoever. Even journalists in countries that have made significant strides towards expanding press freedom, such as Jordan and Yemen, still suffer from arbitrary abuse of power by officials who cling to their authoritarian roots. Lebanon continues to boast the region's only pluralistic broadcast media, but both print and broadcast journalists there must work under the watchful eye of big brother Syria. The Yemen conference will be the fourth in a series of biannual meetings on regional media. Previous ones have been held in Namibia, Kazakhstan and Chile. Participants at the Sana'a gathering will assess the independence of the media in the region, focusing on topics such as censorship, self-censorship, public-service media, press law, media training, women in the Arab media and press freedom monitoring. It is unrealistic to expect that any conference could even begin to address all the difficulties facing the Arab media. But it is reasonable to hope that independent Arab journalists attending the seminar will gain strength to continue fighting for their rights when they meet like-minded colleagues from other countries. And the presence of CPJ and other international press freedom groups will remind them and their governments that the world is watching. --Avner Gidron CPJ secures release of ex-pat journalist in The Gambia In an October rally, Gambian leader Captain Yahya Jammeh accused journalists of sowing confusion in the country in the name of human rights and selling newspapers merely to profit from sensational stories. Two reporters from neighboring Sierra Leone--which has the highest recorded incidence of press freedom abuse in sub-Saharan Africa this year--learned the hard way that their expatriate status could not protect them against Jammeh's wrath. On Oct. 12, Chernor Ojukwu Sesay, who had fled to The Gambia in April, was deported back home after being held incommunicado for two days. His expulsion stemmed from two stories he published in Banjul's independent Daily Observer in which he reported on a police beating of two Sierra Leonean nationals. When Sesay was returned to Freetown, Sierra Leonean police arrested him and held him in the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) headquarters for six days. No official reason was given for his arrest, but CPJ had reason to believe it was due to his work for the Observer. In addition to sending protest letters to the governments of both countries, CPJ called the head of the CID and--in coalition with the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists--secured Sesay's release on bond and without charge in less than 24 hours. CPJ also worked on behalf of Ernest Brima, a reporter for the independent Gambian newspaper The Point. Brima was detained for four days in March for his work on an article about prison riots, for which his paper was charged with sedition. In October, soon after the sedition charges were dropped, Brima was pursued by immigration officials and was forced into hiding for a week to avoid deportation. He managed to escape to a neighboring country and, after a collective international effort, was granted a visa to a safe third country. CPJ is currently facilitating his application for asylum. In both cases, Gambia violated not only international guarantees of press freedom, but U.N. protections against nonrefoulement--the forcible return of people to a country when they have a well-founded fear of persecution. The country also violated the terms governing freedom of movement agreed to by members of the Economic Community of West African States. --Azeen Salimi (c) 1996 Committee Protect Journalists | Front Page| CPJ Website |                                                                        WT01-B01-148IA023-000251-B032-316http://www.cpj.org:80/pubs/newsletter/fall1995/satter.html 169.132.35.44 19970108122906 text/html 6818HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 12:28:42 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 6647Last-modified: Thu, 02 May 1996 03:55:20 GMT CPJ Dangerous Assignments Quarterly Fall 1995 Internet Edition No. 49 Tajikistanâs prosecutor general, Amirkul Aziev, meets with CPJ representatives. ARTE photo. A land without news: CPJ returns to Tajikistan By David Satter Not much happens in Tajikistan. At least not according to the local press. A virtual blackout on news of the three-year-long civil war has made it nearly impossible for Tajik citizens to learn about events in their own country. And, as a CPJ report documented last year, reporting the facts or expressing dissident views is a deadly venture for journalists -- 27 have been murdered since 1992, most of them by paramilitary forces that once counted as their field commander the countryâs president, Emomali Rakhmonov. Except for the murder rate, which has dropped off largely due to the fact that journalists have been terrorized into silence, things have not improved much, according to Leonid Zagalsky, who led a CPJ mission to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in September. He was accompanied by New Times and Radio Liberty correspondent Arkady Dubnov and a TV crew from the German-French channel ARTE, which will air a documentary on CPJâs trip in November. In Tajikistan, the group met with Russian and Tajik journalists in Dushanbe as well as with the countryâs prosecutor general, Amirkul Aziev, and the culture, information and press minister, Bobokhon Makhmadov. The portrait that emerged from CPJâs visit is of a regime determined to brook no opposition. Nearly all of the independent Tajik journalists have been driven into exile. In light of this situation, one official in the prosecutor generalâs office admitted to reading Charoghi Ruz, the opposition newspaper that is printed in Moscow and sold clandestinely in the country. âAt least, he told Zagalsky, âthat is a real newspaper.â According to the prosecutor general, however, press freedom does exist in Tajikistan, and as proof he cited the only independent newspaper in the country, The Evening Courier. The Courier, which is privately owned, is on the brink of closure because Tajik authorities have imposed on it a fine of 1.6 billion Russian rubles (US$320,000) for slighting âthe honor and dignity of the president of Turkmenia Niyazov.â When asked about this, Press Minister Makhmadov said, âWe cannot spoil relations with the Turkmen leader at the moment when Turkmenia is preparing to agree on the delivery to us of natural gas.â The co-editors of the Courier also learned that criticizing economic policies can be lethal: After one such story ran in September, they were abducted and threatened with death and the deaths of their children if they published further criticism of the government. âAttempting to overthrow the governmentâ -- a charge that carries the death penalty -- has been used frequently against opposition journalists since the present regime came to power in 1992. The general prosecutor assured CPJ that this type of persecution is no longer being carried out. But one official in his office said that there is a safe full of arrest warrants, many of them for journalists. Among them is one for Charoghi Ruz editor Dodojony Atovulloev. The Rakhmonov regimeâs efforts to silence the independent and opposition media have not stopped at the curbing of reporters and editors. In the case of Charoghi Ruz, for instance, CPJ learned of one case where a teacher was killed by a policeman after he was found reading the paper. Others found possessing copies run the lesser risk of being charged with âcirculation of slanderous fabrications and being sent to prison. As for broadcast media, Tajik citizens have few options. They receive Channel One, a Moscow public television station, and Tajikistanâs state-run network, which broadcasts for only three hours a day, with just 15 minutes allotted to news. After visiting Tajikistan, CPJâs representatives traveled to Uzbekistan, where they found that press freedom conditions are, if anything, worse than they were under the Soviet regime. Even though the Uzbek constitution bans censorship, the State Committee on the Press serves as a de facto censorship body. The vice chair, Omon Matchan, told Zagalsky that the committee is concerned only with the protection of state secrets. There is, however, no list of such classified information, and, in practice, censors describe as secrets anything they do not want to see in print. Use of the words dictatorship, opposition, crisis and economic catastrophe are forbidden in the press, and Russian newspapers printed in Tashkent are censored in advance. Uzbek authorities are also given to reading between the lines. An editor from the newspaper Molodezh Uzbekistan was questioned by the State Committee on the Press about whether he was making a veiled reference to Russia in an article about the weather that carried the headline âThe Wind Is Blowing from the North.â Independent papers exist in name only. They are primarily the publications of the official political parties and serve no opposition function. As Babakhan Sharipov, the main editor of The Uzbekistan Voice, told CPJ, âThe main task of journalists in our republic is to help the State and president, to educate the people to work in peace and assure the great future of Uzbekistan.â (c) 1996 Committee Protect Journalists | Front Page| CPJ Website |                                                                        WT01-B01-149IA023-000251-B032-354http://www.cpj.org:80/pubs/newsletter/fall1995/yuenger.html 169.132.35.44 19970108122921 text/html 2952HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 12:29:10 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 2781Last-modified: Thu, 02 May 1996 03:55:44 GMT CPJ Dangerous Assignments Quarterly Fall 1995 Internet Edition No. 49 Photograph of James Yuenger. Fund established in memory of James Yuenger By Todd Wiener When award-winning Chicago Tribune senior writer James Yuenger died of a heart attack this summer, his widow, Catherine Henry, requested that CPJ start a memorial fund in his name. Yuenger, who had been a valued supporter of the Committee, was 56. During his tenure at theTribune, which began in 1963, Yuenger held several posts, including that of foreign correspondent and foreign editor. Working out of news bureaus in Moscow, Warsaw and London, Yuenger covered a wide range of stories, including apartheid in South Africa and the death of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel, both of which earned him the Edward Scott Beck award, the Tribune's highest honor for journalistic excellence. Familiar with the risks faced by journalists abroad, Yuenger himself was expelled from Iran in 1980 for his coverage of the Shiite Muslim revolution. When he became foreign editor at the Tribune, his concern for those he sent into the field was unwavering. Following up on the publication of CPJ's first edition of a survival guide for journalists covering Yugoslavia, Yuenger met with CPJ representatives to discuss the need for training young journalists for combat reporting. Soon after the James L. Yuenger Memorial Fund was established, the Robert McCormick Tribune Foundation donated $60,000 in his name to support CPJ's program in the Americas, and the Chicago Tribune Foundation announced it would match donations to the fund made by its employees.

Turning the lens on homophobic attacks on the press A special CPJ report on press freedom violations against gay and lesbian journalists was released in October. Double Jeopardy: Homophobic Attacks on the Press, 1990-1995 was researched and written by Moscow-based journalist Masha Gessen, a frequent contributor to CPJâs work and a former board member of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC). CPJ undertook the project because too often journalists and press freedom groups either have been unaware of such attacks or have classified them strictly as gay and lesbian issues but not as deliberate attempts to silence reporters. In part, Gessen writes, âthis stems from the marginal position of much of the gay and lesbian press and the de facto exclusion of gay and lesbian journalists from mainstream journalistic communities.â From her representative sampling of 21 cases from 14 countries worldwide, Gessen demonstrates that in nations as politically and culturally disparate as Canada, Russia and Zimbabwe, censorship is imposed selectively against gay journalists and news outlets covering gay issues. Authorities censor coverage using a variety of tools, including bans on the âpromotionâ of homosexuality, broadly worded obscenity and pornography statutes and laws against child exploitation. In Canada, for instance, CBC Radio reporter Joseph Couture, who also works for the Toronto gay biweekly XTra! had to battle efforts to frame him on charges of child pornography after he produced stories critical of the London, Ontario, police forceâs relationship with the gay community and its enforcement of child pornography laws. Several of the cases reported in Double Jeopardy also demonstrate that as a result of homophobia at all levels of society, extremist groups and other nongovernmental forces physically attack or otherwise harass gay journalists knowing that law enforcement officials often fail to thoroughly investigate such incidents. The report was distributed at two conferences: the International Tribunal on Human Rights Violations Against Sexual Minorities, which was sponsored by the IGLHRC and the Community United Against Violence, and the annual conference of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.

Reuters/Dan Eldon More journalists jailed than ever CPJâs 1995 report surveys 101 countries By Jeanne Sahadi Independent Nigerian journalist Nosa Igiebor has been languishing in prison since his arrest in December 1995. He was jailed for his critical coverage of the countryâs military dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha. Though he was placed in solitary confinement, Igiebor was hardly alone. In fact, a record 182 journalists around the world were in jail at the end of 1995, all of them in retaliation for their reporting. That is one of the major findings of CPJâs annual report Attacks on the Press in 1995: A Worldwide Survey. The 300-page report, which was released March 14 at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., documents in compelling detail hundreds of attempts to silence reporters and news organizations around the world last year. Drawn from the research of CPJâs in-house staff of regional media experts, the annual Attacks on the Press reports are widely recognized as the most comprehensive and authoritative source of information on press freedom violations internationally. This latest report analyzes the state of press freedom in 101 countries and examines more than 700 individual cases of journalists who were physically attacked, imprisoned, threatened or censored in retaliation for their work. Most of the journalists whose stories are chronicled in the survey are not foreign correspondents dispatched to distant wars, but local reporters working under corrupt and repressive governments. âMany American journalists drop in on dangerous places like Bosnia or Rwanda, stay a few weeks and go home. For most of the people in whom CPJ is interested, the dangerous places are home,â writes prize-winning essayist Roger Rosenblatt in the preface. Among the bookâs major findings: For the second consecutive year, Turkey, with 51 reporters and editors in jail, had the worst record of imprisoning journalists than any other country. âThe new Turkish government should demonstrate its commitment to democracy by releasing our imprisoned colleagues and abolishing Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of the Penal Code, which are inherently incompatible with press freedom,â said CPJ Chair Kati Marton. Other countries with large numbers of journalists in jail at the close of 1995 were Ethiopia (31), China (20) and Kuwait (18); Vietnam, Peru, Myanmar (Burma) and Nigeria each held eight journalists in jail. 51 journalists were killed in the line of duty in 1995. Forty-five of the deaths were homicides; six were casualties in combat zones. For the second consecutive year, Algeria was the most deadly country for journalists--24 were murdered in 1995 by rebel terrorists who have been waging a campaign of death against members of the media since May 1993. CPJ has now confirmed 456 journalists were killed in the past decade (1986-1995) as a direct result of their profession. Most were murdered. The countries with the highest death tolls were Algeria, the former Yugoslavia, Colombia, Tajikistan and the Philippines. Attacks on the Press in 1995 shows how CPJ took action on behalf of hundreds of journalists last year. Through diplomatic channels, grassroots efforts and media campaigns, CPJ brought international attention to these cases and helped secure the release of prisoners. In Cuba, dissident journalist Yndamiro Restano was released from prison last June, after a yearlong international protest campaign led by CPJ. Walter Cronkite, CPJâs honorary chairman, met with the prime minister of Turkey in September to express CPJâs objections to charges filed against American reporter Aliza Marcus, a Reuters correspondent based in Istanbul, who faced up to three years in prison for her reports on Turkish counterinsurgency forays into Kurdish villages. Two months later, the charges against Marcus were dismissed. David Rohde, a correspondent in Bosnia for the Christian Science Monitor, was captured and held for nearly two weeks by the Bosnian Serbs for pursuing his investigations of mass grave sites near Zvornik. He was freed following diplomatic efforts by the U.S. government and direct personal appeals by CPJ Chair Kati Marton to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.

Orme, Jr., executive director On April 3, 1981, three New York journalists filed incorporating papers for a new organization called The Committee to Protect Journalists, dedicated to the defense "of the human and professional rights of journalists around the world." The members of CPJâs founding triumvirate were Michael Massing, then the editor of the Columbia Journalism Review; Laurie Nadel, a CBS News producer; and Victor Navasky, editor of The Nation. Aryeh Neier of Human Rights Watch signed on as treasurer, and offered astute organizational and fund-raising counsel. A short while later, Walter Cronkite volunteered to serve as honorary chairman, bringing CPJ instantaneous credibility and clout. The Alicia Patterson Foundation lent desk space for a volunteer assistant, and CPJ began to take shape. At our most recent semiannual board meeting, held just one week after CPJâs 15th anniversary, it was striking to see how many of the organizationâs founding members remain committed and active. Victor and Michael both attended, as they have regularly since the beginning. So did Tony Lewis and Peter Arnett, also among CPJâs first recruits, and two of CPJâs three former chairmen, Josh Friedman and Jim Goodale. The original goal of CPJ was to use the power of the U.S. media on behalf of their threatened colleagues abroad. The incorporating documents sketched out clearly what is still our basic mandate: the protection of journalists through "the compilation and verification of the actual or threatened violations of the professional rights of journalists; the mobilization of public opinion throughout the world for the prevention of [....] such violations; and the dissemination of information concerning the status and treatment of journalists throughout the world." It was an ambitious agenda, but not unrealistic. Since 1981, CPJ has grown into a vitally important institution to journalists and news organizations worldwide. It is the only U.S. organization devoted solely to documenting, publicizing and responding to specific cases of press freedom violations wherever they occur. We now have a million-dollar yearly budget--an unthinkable sum in CPJâs early years--and a full-time staff of 12, plus five part-time regional press specialists. Yet we still feel stretched to the breaking point. Paradoxically, the expansion of press freedom after the Cold War has made CPJ more important than ever. Jailings and murders of journalists increase virtually every year. So do the calls for CPJâs help. Last year alone, CPJ responded directly to more than 250 press freedom violations and documented 500 other such incidents. This trend is not all bad news: Many cases took place in countries where there was no independent press whatsoever when CPJ was founded. Though we do most of our work by phone, fax and e-mail, direct personal visits are still the most effective way of demonstrating our concern to our colleagues and their nemeses alike. In response to requests for support and assistance, we have sent staffers and board members on recent missions to Colombia, Russia, Tajikistan, Ghana, India, Turkey, Slovakia, Serbia, Croatia and Mexico. An independent press is stubbornly sinking roots in dozens of formerly totalitarian societies. This is a difficult and dangerous process, and journalists in these countries are routinely jailed, harassed and attacked. They need international support, which, to be effective, must be swift, concerted and backed up by accurate reporting. On an almost weekly basis, CPJâs timely intervention is the critical factor in securing the release of an imprisoned reporter, or in protecting a journalist against the threat of violent reprisal. Fifteen years later, it is clear that CPJ is here to stay.

His observation says as much about speech as about the absence of speech--that once people began to use words to express themselves, there could be no turning back, no anti-evolutionary tendency that would have us keep quiet again. Words are weapons against oblivion. If the species were ever to revert to silence, that silence would be deafening, because everyone would remember the time that we made a sound. Journalism, at its best, sides with the Cro-Magnons. A tyrannical, oppressive government or group, having established silence somewhere, seeks to keep the unnatural peace by means of censorship, intimidation and murder; and the journalist seeks to break the silence with the truth. Their respective forces are ill-balanced; one side has guns, the other words. It is amazing to consider that, historically, the words have prevailed. I do not mean to accord any special nobility to journalists as people. By speaking out, or writing out, they are simply doing their jobs. It is where they do these jobs that sets certain journalists apart. Many American journalists drop in on dangerous places like Bosnia or Rwanda, stay a few weeks and go home. For most of the people in whom the Committee to Protect Journalists is interested, the dangerous places are home.... In his great book, Language and Silence, the English critic George Steiner wondered if anyone would have cared what Hitler did to the Jews if the Nazis had not ventured outside the borders of the Third Reich. âThere would have been numerous pundits and journalists,â wrote Steiner, âto assure us that rumors were exaggerated, that Dachau had pleasant walks.â He assumed that journalists would be too stupid or corrupt to break the silence with the truth, and, from time to time, that has been the case. But todayâs journalists are a pretty honest lot, for the most part. And they have been encouraged by organizations like CPJ, which reassure them that if they make a sound, the world will listen. Steiner also said that there are some horrors too deep for words. That may be true for art, but not for journalism. The unwritten or unspoken report is good news for killers, and eventually it leaves a wasteland. The Committee to Protect Journalists did not create the journalists it seeks to protect. These people would tell their indispensable stories whether or not CPJ existed. And, in many if not most cases, CPJ cannot fulfill the promise of its own self-appointed mission. If the forces of silence want to do their dirty work, they will find a way, and then express ignorance of the event, or regret. But if CPJ did not cry out against such acts, who would make the noise? And if no one sounded the alarm, who would try to prevent the fire next time? Everywhere journalists work, someone strives to keep them quiet in the interest of silencing the world. People have come too far for that.

More than 300 of those deaths appeared to have been deliberate political assassinations. In his introduction to Attacks on the Press in 1995, CPJâs executive director William A. Orme, Jr., outlines how the countries with the highest death tolls illustrate the different kinds of threats now facing independent journalists around the world: Silencing the press in the name of religion and politics Algeria, 53 deaths: Reporters and editors in the press are being targeted for harassment, intimidation and murder by Islamist radicals. Targeting journalists in war zones The former Yugoslavia, 45 deaths: The internationally accepted norm of treating reporters as civilian noncombatants is increasingly ignored by armed factions in civil wars. Reporters covering civil wars are now targeted by armed belligerents who perceive journalists to be the enemy. Putting out contracts on the lives of reporters covering drug trafficking Colombia, 43 deaths: Drug cartels and organized crime syndicates are targeting journalists with growing frequency. In the coming decade, threats from such groups could well become an even more deadly problem than political persecution. Stamping out free expression in societies accustomed to tyranny Tajikistan, 29 deaths: The return to totalitarianism in a country that had briefly embraced democracy was accompanied by a campaign of murder and censorship against a small corps of independent journalists. Retaliating against those who investigate human rights abuses and corruption The Philippines, 29 deaths: Though more common in the Marcos era, the murders of provincial reporters who uncovered human rights abuses and corruption continued through the Aquinos and Ramos governments as the restoration of democracy emboldened local publications to investigate such issues. On May 20, 1996, The Freedom Forum, a nonpartisan, international foundation committed to free press and free speech, will dedicate a memorial to journalists who have died in the line of duty since 1812. CPJ provided the foundation with its lists of journalists killed in the last 10 years and will continue to work with The Freedom Forum to update the memo-rial, which will be rededicated every year.The memorial will be located in the newly created Freedom Park, adjacent to the foundationâs headquarters in Arlington, Va.

Igiebor, a 1993 recipient of CPJâs International Press Freedom Award, had just resurfaced after months in hiding. While he was being arrested, SSS agents confiscated over 20,000 issues of Tellâs Christmas Day edition with the cover story "Abacha is Adamant: Terrorizes the Opposition." Nosa IgieborTo Igieborâs colleagues, this two-pronged attack was not only a calculated move to silence the regimeâs most vocal critic and cripple the publication financially, but a sign that the new year would usher in yet another wave of terror aimed directly at the independent press. In January, the federal government announced that Igiebor was being held under Decree 2 of 1984 for acts prejudicial to state security. In February, police arrested Igieborâs lead attorney without charge shortly after he filed a US$1,400,000 lawsuit against the government challenging the confiscation of an additional 100,000 copies of Tell. At this writing, Igiebor remains in solitary confinement and has been denied visits with family and legal counsel as well as access to medical care. On March 18, CPJ announced the launch of its media and letter-writing campaign to aid Igiebor and his colleagues. In addition to sending out a sign-on letter of protest on Igieborâs behalf to hundreds of human rights and free press advocates around the world, CPJ representatives continue to send out up-to-date media information kits and meet with U.S. State Department officials and policy-makers to draw attention to the dire situation for the Nigerian independent press. The Committee is also working to put Lagos-based journalists in direct contact with colleagues from international media outlets and other press freedom organizations. Fred M'membeLike Igiebor, Zambiaâs Fred Mâmembe, editor in chief of the independent daily The Post, has been a regular target of legal harassment for his outspoken criticism of President Frederick Chilubaâs government, which has rapidly become one of the worst violators of press freedom in southern Africa. Mâmembe, a 1995 recipient of CPJâs International Press Freedom Award, is fighting a barrage of sedition and criminal libel suits in Zambiaâs Supreme Court, where colonial-era laws are being used to enforce the governmentâs case. Using criminal law as a form of censorship to protect Chiluba from unfavorable coverage, the government has hauled employees of the Post into court so often that Mâmembe and his colleagues have lost count of the numerous charges filed against them. The confrontation between the Post and the government climaxed when Chiluba banned the Feb. 5 issue of the newspaper as well as that dayâs on-line edition, making it the first ban of an Internet publication in Africa. Later in the month, Mâmembe and two colleagues were forced into hiding after being charged with contempt of parliament for publishing articles critical of proclamations issued by members of parliament. The journalists had been sentenced by The National Assembly Standing Orders Committee, not a court of law, to indefinite detention until they publicly apologized. After subsequently surrendering to the authorities, Mâmembe was put in a maximum security prison where he was held until a judge ordered his conditional release in March. With elections scheduled for October, journalists anticipate that the Chiluba governmentâs efforts to silence them will continue, with manipulation of the judiciary being just one of the methods employed. As with Nigeria, CPJ launched a Zambia campaign in March to bring world attention to the abuse directed against the countryâs independent press. To help Nosa Igiebor and Fred M'membe Write to the Nigerian and Zambian governments and to their U.S representatives to register your protest of the abusive treatment these journalists have received from authorities in retaliation for their work.For letters of appeal, please contact:CPJ's Africa desk (c) 1996 Committee Protect Journalists |Front Page|CPJ Website |WT01-B01-156IA023-000251-B034-129http://www.cpj.org:80/pubs/newsletter/spring1996/french.html 169.132.35.44 19970108123521 text/html 5861HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 12:35:11 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 5690Last-modified: Thu, 02 May 1996 03:39:34 GMT CPJ Dangerous Assignments Quarterly Spring 1996 Internet Edition No. 50 Press Faces Hard Times in Africa: Repression Persists in Many Countries This article first appeared in the New York Times on Jan. 14, 1996. Copyright Â© 1996 by The New York Times Company. Reprinted by permission. By Howard W. French Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Jan. 13--When this country opened the way for an independent press at the turn of the decade, the blossoming of newspapers of nearly every political persuasion was widely hailed as a critical stepping stone toward true multiparty democracy. But here, as elsewhere in Africa, rather than marking a clean break with an authoritarian past, the era of multiparty politics has been a time of increased hardship and repression for journalists who dare criticize powerful incumbents. Since Henri Konan BÃ©diÃ© became president in 1993, the government has repeatedly jailed journalists and fined publications that are judged too critical under press laws that international human rights experts say give the authorities unusually free rein to crack down on enemies.In one example, a leading opposition newspaper, La Voie, recently published a headline saying Mr. BÃ©diÃ©âs presence at a continent-wide soccer championship brought bad luck to the Ivory Coast side, which lost the match. The government imposed two-year prison sentences on the editor and two reporters and suspended the newspaper for "offense to the head of state." "Since BÃ©diÃ© came to power, journalists sleep with one eye shut," said DiÃ©gou Bailly, president of the Ivory Coast Journalists Union, and editor of the independent paper Le Jour. "Arrests, beatings, insults and scorn have become the daily lot of the press. This does nothing to honor the government, which ought to think about changing its strategy." Beyond the outcry among local journalists, the move against La Voie and another critical paper, Le Republicain, provoked swift condemnation from diplomats and international press groups. "Among diplomatic observers, patience is definitely beginning to fray, and informed sources will be looking with interest at the forthcoming human rights reports to be issued on Ivory Coast," one Western diplomat said. "In the beginning, there was a very big benefit of the doubt here waiting to see the democrat buried deep down inside this man. We havenât seen it yet." In an exchange of New Yearâs greetings with the diplomatic corps, Mr. BÃ©diÃ© urged foreign diplomats to invite "your journalists" to witness the workings of an opposition press that he said had confused "their mission with the organizing of public disturbances." Journalists in the pro-government press here have defended Mr. BÃ©diÃ©âs stance toward the press, using an argument that has long served as a justification for some of Africaâs most ruinous dictatorships. "Our small nations are still fragile and require a lot of serenity to develop," said Venance Konan, editor of Ivoire Soir, a pro-government tabloid. "Liberty of the press, as seen by a Westerner, is different from what we see as Africans. We still have ethnic problems that can explode at any moment, for example, and when a journalist incites tribal hatred, it is better to put him in jail." International press watchdogs say the crackdown here reflects a much broader trend in Africa, where multiparty systems are still typically headed by leaders who cut their political teeth during long years of one-party rule and have never reconciled themselves to being called to account by a critical press. In Ethiopia and Zambia, which have have been widely praised for democratic and economic reforms after years of corrupt and repressive government, press experts say critical journalists have nonetheless been the target of frequent and sometimes violent witch-hunts. In Kenya, which is preparing to hold multiparty elections, the authorities recently announced that they were contemplating new rules governing press behavior, including that of foreign journalists. In Nigeria, which long had what was arguably the most vibrant press in Africa, the military authorities have recently arrested dozens of journalists, ransacked their offices and closed their publications. "In one country after another we have seen the press lose many of its top editors, as papers have been closed down, reporters jailed and people forced into exile," said Kakuna Kerina, the Africa coordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based press group. "Under the one-party dictatorships, people at least knew where they stood. Nowadays, when we have these supposed rights, every time a journalist takes a step toward claiming them, they are yanked two or three steps backward."

Most were detained without charges. Rwanda and Burundi again proved to be among the most dangerous places on the continent for journalists to work, as local and foreign reporters were threatened and harassed by government security forces and armed insurgents. Gen. Sani Abacha escalated his all-out war on Nigeriaâs independent press, as exemplified by the secret trial and conviction in July of four journalists for their coverage of an abortive coup plot. Upcoming elections in several countries, including Ivory Coast (Cote dâIvoire), Ethiopia and Chad, proved reason enough for governments to impose greater restrictions--if not all-out crackdowns--on the media. Constitutional guarantees of press freedom failed to keep journalists in Kenya, Zimbabwe and Zambia from being sent to jail for sedition, libel and defamation. In Sierra Leone, Nigeria and the Gambia, military leaders overrode court rulings and suppressed unfavorable press coverage with executive decrees. The Americas Attacks against journalists by drug cartels and other criminal organizations-- many of them protected by elements of the local police and military--were an escalating problem in Guatemala, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Paraguay. The democratically elected leaders of Argentina, Chile and Peru introduced legislation restricting press freedoms; in Argentina and Chile, the initiatives were withdrawn following strong local and international media reactions. With the June release from prison of dissident journalist Yndamiro Restano, Cuba appeared to be softening its hostility toward independent local journalists. But in the second half of 1995, Cubaâs fledgling nongovernmental news agencies were relentlessly harassed by state security forces. In Costa Rica, the Supreme Court declared the licensing of journalists unconstitutional, setting a possible precedent for other Latin American countries where the Costa Rican licensing system has been adopted or proposed. Asia China again jailed two of its most prominent dissident journalists, Wei Jingsheng and Chen Ziming, bringing the total number of journalists in jail to 20. Beijing also ordered the closure of two provincial TV stations for broadcasting politically objectionable material. Indonesia accelerated its crackdown on the independent press, imprisoning Ahmad Taufik, the leader of the countryâs only independent journalists union. Taufik, a winner of CPJâs 1995 International Press Freedom Award, had his sentence increased on appeal and is now serving out his three-year sentence in prison. Criminal libel charges threatened the survival of several newspapers in Cambodia, where a new press law allows authorities to shut down newspapers for 30 days and bans news reports that affect "national security and political stability." Two of East Asiaâs emerging democracies, Taiwan and South Korea, showed notable press freedom gains in 1995. Taiwan licensed the countryâs first private, pro-opposition television station, and South Koreaâs press called former and current political leaders to account in a mushrooming corruption scandal. Press freedom conditions deteriorated alarmingly in Pakistan, with a sharp increase in violent attacks on the media, police harassment, newspaper bans and defamation suits. In Sri Lanka, the Peopleâs Alliance government censored coverage of the war with Tamil separatists, introducing regulations three weeks before a major counterinsurgency offensive that required journalists to clear all war reports with the Media Ministry. Central Europe And The Republics of the Former Soviet Union In Russia, the governmentâs continuing failure to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the murders of seven journalists had a chilling effect on reporting about organized crime and official corruption. In Tajikistan, the execution-style murder of a BBC Persian Service bureau chief was a chilling reminder of the deadly campaign begun in 1992 against independent and opposition journalists, which left 27 dead. Governments tightened controls over all news media in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. In Azerbaijan and other nations of the Caucasus region, prior censorship was often employed to suppress independent reporting. Journalists in Bosnia faced a high risk of being killed deliberately by snipers or accidentally by cross fire and land mines. The taking of journalists as hostages became a new method of retaliation against the international press by Bosnian Serb militias. Middle East and North Africa The shocking assassination death toll in Algeria increased by 24, accounting for more than half of all murders of journalists documented by CPJ in 1995. Turkey continued to jail more reporters and editors than any other country, with 51 journalists in prison at yearâs end. Reporters in Egypt faced new restrictions as Law 93 of 1995--dubbed the "Press Assassination Law"--imposed steep fines and long prison terms for loosely defined libel offenses. In areas now under the control of the Palestinian National Authority, journalists were hit with arbitrary detention orders and newspapers were forced to suspend publication. With the exception of Kuwait, independent news gathering remained strictly prohibited in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Authoritarian regimes in Syria, Iraq and Libya also continued to repress all forms of free expression, while Tunisia kept independent journalists from working in local media. Firsthand look at challenges facing reporters in Algeria, the PNA, Russia, Nigeria and Bosnia Excerpts from CPJâs 1995 worldwide survey ALGERIA: The brutal campaign of assassination against Algerian reporters has been difficult to stop in part because local journalists failed to join together and fight for legal protections when the government liberalized press controls in 1989, says editor SÃ©lima Ghezali in her probing essay, "Algerian Journalismâs Original Sin." "The weakness of the Algerian press and the divisiveness within it have had severe repercussions. Journalists are unable to effectively counter government repression and murderous attacks by radicals. Response to the arrest of Djamel Fahassi, a journalist with Alger ChaÃ®ne III, the state-owned French-language radio station, is a case in point. Fahassi had contributed regularly to Islamist newspapers and, for this, he was arrested in 1992 and sent to a detention camp in the south. He was released later that year only to be abducted in May 1995 by security forces. The government has denied holding him in custody. The Algerian Journalists Association did not protest his arrest. His family and my newspaper, La Nation, tried to get some support for him. But after La Nation published several articles on his case, the pro-government newspaper Horizons ran a story claiming that Fahassi was well and vacationing abroad. No source was cited, of course. He is still missing." RUSSIA: Russian journalists are being murdered in record numbers, but they can expect little or no protection from their government. That is the central conclusion of a special report by David Satter, a CPJ staff expert. Satter wrote about his fact-finding mission to Moscow to investigate seven unsolved killings of local journalists and shows how the Yeltsin administration has failed even to investigate most of these cases. "Despite the fact that a number of the murdered journalists have been national celebrities, there has been little effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. Instead, after a journalist is murdered, an investigation begins, sometimes with considerable fanfare, and the effort then fades amid signs that investigators are being hampered by interference at a high official level. "Presently, nearly all legitimate private business in Russia is controlled by or forced to pay extortion money to organized crime. There are an estimated 5,000 criminal gangs, 300 mob bosses and 150 illegal organizations with international ties in the country. The prevalence of corruption and organized crime, in fact, means that investigative journalism is very necessary to Russia but little is carried out. The reason is simple, said Yevgenia Albats, a reporter for Izvestia and the author of the book A State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia, Past, Present and Future. "If you do journalism that deals with certain sensitive issues, you can easily get killed.â" PALESTINIAN NATIONAL AUTHORITY (PNA): The growing ranks of independent Palestinian journalists insist that their job requires them to be skeptical-- a stance that the Arafat government has trouble accepting. Palestinian journalist Imad Musa analyzes the challenges facing reporters in Gaza and the West Bank. "The phone rings at 2:30 a.m. in the home of a Gaza journalist. The man on the line identifies himself as Abu Hasan, his code name. He says he is with the Palestinian General Intelligence and wants to see the journalist now. "Why? Whatâs wrong?â asks the bewildered journalist, but Abu Hasan wonât give details. The journalist asks if this is an official summons; Abu Hasan insists that it is not. After some give-and-take, Abu Hasan agrees to wait till 9 a.m. for the "visit.â "The journalist spends the next hour trying to remember if he did anything, the slightest thing, that could be construed as offensive to the newborn Palestinian National Authority. He taxes his brain, but he canât think of anything. So what could this "visitâ be about? Would he be accused of some sort of treason for working for the Israeli and foreign press, for telling them whatâs going on in Gaza? Has he written anything critical lately? Could he be detained on such charges? "Since sleep is the last thing on his mind at this point, he decides to dress and get to General Intelligence headquarters. When he gets there, Abu Hasan greets our journalist, tells him he just wanted to meet him, and that concludes the matter." BOSNIA: In "Hunting for Mass Graves Behind Serb Lines," U.S. reporter David Rohde recounts his ordeal of being taken prisoner by Bosnian Serbs for his reporting on mass grave sites of slain Muslims. Rohde was later awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his investigations. "I decided to check one last area-- a second gravel plateau--which fit the survivorsâ description of where the massacre took place. I pulled up onto the plateau and saw two human femurs lying on the gravel and other small objects in the distance. "As I stepped out of the car to take a photo of them, I heard the old man--who I thought had simply walked by the dam-- shout. He was on top of the dam pointing a rifle at me. I was finished. The old man, who I then realized was guarding the dam, arrested me and called the local police. Five days of interrogation at a local police station followed, with the Bosnian Serbs convinced I was a spy sent by the Muslim-led Bosnian government or NATO to take pictures of or blow up the earthen dam.... "I carried all of my press accreditation cards, including numerous Bosnian and Croatian government ones that angered the Serbs, but they ended up being crucial to countering the espionage suspicions. Most importantly, they bought me time." NIGERIA: Since Nigeriaâs independence, the local press has labored under a series of increasingly repressive military regimes. In "The Retreat of Nigeriaâs Press: Tactical Withdrawal or Temporary Defeat?" an exiled Nigerian journalist discusses the plight of his colleagues under Gen. Sani Abachaâs rule and the prospects for the restoration of democracy and press freedom. "While the responsibility of the media to the polity remains clear, their ability to function effectively has been seriously compromised. In the best of times, the many structural inadequacies of the system were mitigated by the intellectual brilliance and commitment of a corps of top-notch journalists that kept the national debate lively and engaging. During the last decade, however, an entire generation of journalists fled Nigeria, alongside the countryâs best and brightest professionals in every field.... "The rejuvenation of the press as an element of civil society is tied to the overall need to reinvent a democratic post-Abacha Nigeria, and hence a postmilitary era. The gradual erosion of democratic structures over a quarter-century of military misrule, which has cascaded into an avalanche under this present regime, is the prevailing reason for the Nigerian news mediaâs retreat. But the mediaâs current position may be a tactical withdrawal: The Abacha regime has been forced to announce plans for a transition to democracy, but the full implementation of those plans might be well beyond this governmentâs control and tenure."

Certain events in a countryâs history mark a national loss of innocence, a brutal public awakening ushered in by an inhumane act. In Ireland, that occurred on June 26. Five or six major Dublin criminals are leading suspects in the murder, but Irish police are gathering information on about 150 of the cityâs criminals. The murder left Ireland and the international community outraged. Guerin, a 1995 recipient of CPJâs International Press Freedom Award, was one of the first reporters to make public the workings of Irelandâs criminal underworld. Since 1994, several attempts had been made to silence Guerin. Frequently threatened with death, she was once beaten by a man she sought to interview and shot by another in her home. But after each incident, she reaffirmed her commitment to her work. âIn deciding to continue . . . I am simply doing my job,â she told her readers. âI am letting the public know exactly how this society operates.âHer murder, like her exposÃ©s, let the public know just that. Guerin leaves behind her husband, Graham, and a 6-year-old son, Cathal, without whose support, she had said, her work would not have been possible. Though Guerin is one of the few Western European journalists ever to be killed for her reporting, her fate is one shared by many journalists who report on crime in other countries. CPJ has documented that since 1991, at least 37 have been murdered for their reporting on criminal activities ranging from official corruption to drug trafficking. But in no other country has a journalistâs assassination spawned as much sustained public outrage as Guerinâs. Following is a sampling of the thousands of letters that have been sent to Irish newspapers since June 26: Today I plant a shrub rose. It is an old-fashioned one with a lovely scent and is called âMadame Hardy.â ... Itâs in memory of a person who gave her life for me that I could be safe in my home and garden, and free to treasure the life I enjoy and the peace I value. Thank you Veronica.--Jean T. Evers Veronica Guerin was a patriot in the fullest meaning of the word. --Mary Rourke What a sick, sick world this has turned out to be. Please donât let her work die with her--what a brave lady she was. Itâs like as if someone in my family has been killed. --Ahearne family A brilliant and revealing star of truth is no more, but the indomitable light she turned on what corrupts and desecrates our society survives, even in her death. She has done this state much service in a short life. Ar dheis DÃ© go raibh a anam dilis. (May your soul be on the right-hand side of God.) --Eoin Neeson We view this assassination as a fundamental attack on the free press which is essential to the democratic process.

Inside, the stained glass stations of the cross are standard-issue â60s-modern, the altar a simple slab. Built for the hurried but devout traveler, it is a church without a parish, charmless and devoid of history. By William A. Orme, Jr. But this was Veronica Guerinâs chosen house of worship. It was convenient: Sunday mass was just a mileâs drive from home. And its stark functionality suited her no-airs-and-graces North Dublin style. Her family knew this was where she would have wanted her services held. On the morning of June 29, the airport chapel was as crowded--and as somber--as it has ever been. Veronica Guerinâs murder had shocked a nation, and her funeral mass had become a virtual affair of state. The president, prime minister, and head of the armed forces sat silently in the left front pew. Other dignitaries vied with television crews for standing room. The archbishop spoke. But most of the mourners were her friends, relatives, and newspaper colleagues. The overwhelming feeling was that of a close-knit and immensely bereaved family. Her husband, Graham Turley, stood facing the casket flanked by their 6-year-old son Cathal and three slightly older nephews, who struggled to contain their tears. At the midpoint of the mass--the offertory--Cathal and his cousins were ushered into the corner vestry. A tin whistler began an air. The small boys filed slowly back, each cradling one of Veronicaâs prized possessions. One by one, they placed them on the altar: Her wedding album. A ball autographed by Irelandâs World Cup team. A photograph of Veronica with Manchester Unitedâs star striker. (She was a famously obsessed soccer fan.) And finally, the etched glass CPJ International Press Freedom Award plaque she had been presented in New York just six months before. Since 1991, CPJ has presented 23 of these awards to journalists who have demonstrated exemplary courage and dedication to their craft in the face of threats and violence. We hope the plaques will serve not just as a deserved honor, but as a kind of shield. By surrounding the awardees with eminent U.S. news figures and getting their stories spotlighted in the press, we want to show their nemeses that these journalists have many friends, and that their friends will let the world know should any harm befall them. The shield is imperfect, of course. Zambian editor Fred Mâmembe also received an International Press Freedom Award in December, but that didnât keep the Chiluba government from jailing him in January. Nosa Igiebor, an award recipient in 1993, was imprisoned without charges for six months this year by Nigeriaâs military rulers. Never before, though, had an International Press Freedom Award winner been murdered. Veronica Guerinâs death was a stunning, sobering reminder of the Committeeâs ultimate inability to carry out our self-appointed mission of protecting journalists. Nearly every week, a journalist somewhere in the world is killed. Veronica Guerin was the 24th journalist to die in the line of duty in 1996. All but seven of these cases were deliberate murders. The assassins have in almost every instance escaped detection, or at least prosecution. But few of these killings received much international attention. This death had a special impact--in part because it occurred in a generally peaceful (and English-speaking) corner of democratic Western Europe, and in part because Guerin, as a tenacious and fundamentally nonideological crime reporter, was an instantly recognizable character type to anybody in the news business. Her award was also a factor. The ceremony in Manhattan last year widened the circle of those who felt personally shocked and angered by her murder. Her death was covered by the leading American news organizations and had reverberations outside the United States as well. Russiaâs most prominent anchorman, Yevgeny Kiselyov, a fellow 1995 award winner, spoke in Moscow about the crime. Mâmembeâs daily in Zambia, The Post, headlined the killing of Veronica Guerin. Her Irish colleagues told us they had seen her award as a kind of vindication. They were gratified that her courage and her sacrifice were recognized beyond Irelandâs shores. And as a practical political fact, foreign coverage intensifies the already acute pressure on Irish authorities to locate and prosecute her killers. The stories about Veronica Guerin also brought overdue attention to the brazen willingness of criminal gangs from MedellÃ­n to Moscow to murder reporters and editors who get in their way. Mâmembeâs press freedom prize didnât protect him fully from Zambiaâs jailers, but it helped CPJ mount an ultimately successful international campaign for his release. Journalists and human rights activists around the world were similarly mobilized on behalf of Igiebor, who was finally freed in June. CPJâs award did not deter Guerinâs killers, but it ensured that their crime and its victim wonât be forgotten.

These changes held great promise for the press, as evidenced by the explosion into existence of independent media in 1992, as well as the passage of a press law and a first-ever democratic constitution that guarantee the rights to free speech and free press. Yet, for three years running, Ethiopia has imprisoned more journalists than any other country in Africa--31 were jailed at the beginning of 1996. Many are detained in retaliation for their reporting and held for weeks or months without charge, only to be released on bails set so high that a journalistâs newspaper or friends and family have to go into debt to pay the bond. To investigate the situation further and to help free those who have been imprisoned for their reporting, CPJ Africa Program Coordinator Kakuna Kerina and CPJ board member Josh Friedman of Newsday went to Ethiopia at the end of May. They met with the countryâs prime minister, justice minister, and speaker of parliament, as well as with journalists in all sectors of the media, representatives of local nongovernmental organizations, and members of the international diplomatic community. Friedman and Kerina found that in addition to being targeted by the government for critical reporting, Ethiopian journalists are at risk of detention because of the police forceâs profound lack of understanding of journalistsâ rights and the role of a free press. "The police force is in its infancy. Many were soldiers who protected the government, not the people," said Justice Minister Mahteme Solomon in a meeting with the CPJ team. In November 1995, for instance, Lullit G. Michael, the editor of the independent newspaper The Monitor , was arrested in connection with an article she reprinted from the state-run Ethiopian News Agency (ENA). The article reported on an assassination attempt on former Ethiopian dictator Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam. Michael said she had to explain to the police who arrested her that ENA was a government news service. When she appeared in court, the judge refused to hear her comments, stated that he had not read the article in question, and remanded her to custody, where she remained without charge for nine days. She was released on a 10,000 birr bond (US$1,600), but not before the court ordered The Monitor to suspend publication for three weeks. Michaelâs case remains open. Following up on their meetings with Ethiopian officials, Kerina and Friedman sent a letter to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and his cabinet ministers, calling again for the immediate and unconditional release of all journalists imprisoned for exercising their legal rights. At this writing, a total of 10 remain behind bars. In September, CPJ will publish its report on the mission that will provide analysis and documentation of the problems facing Ethiopian journalists. The report will also put forth recommendations to the Ethiopian and U.S. governments to improve the situation. Among them, CPJ recommends that the Meles government: Eliminate all laws criminalizing slander against public officials; Grant the private press equal and unrestricted access to government press conferences; and Train police, judicial and government officials on the rights of journalists, the role of the press in a democratic society, and general human rights issues.

By Catherine A. Fitzpatrick Paradoxically, while the independent media have thrived under Yeltsin in many ways--to the point where lionizing the president was considered a free editorial decision--the press has suffered its most violent attacks in decades. CPJ has confirmed that 13 journalists have been assassinated since 1994, and four are missing and presumed dead, making Russia one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists. Through his governmentâs failure to fully investigate, let alone prosecute, these cases, Yeltsin has signaled that reporters may be killed with impunity. These attacks do not necessarily emanate from the presidentâs office, but stem from his historical lack of control over the "power ministries" (army, police, and security), and from the ministriesâ failure, in turn, to control violent groups in society. The much ballyhooed "clean sweep" of corrupt ministries by new security chief Gen. Alexander Lebed is no substitute for the institutionalized watchdog function of a free press. Nor does it address the dangers faced by journalists who probe topics like corruption in the army or in business. In 1996 alone, three journalists were gunned down in or near their homes, and three were assassinated in Chechnya. Several more were brutally beaten, and others narrowly escaped assaults or were threatened. In 1995, RUFA correspondent Natalya Alyakina was shot by a Russian soldier after being waved through an army checkpoint during a Chechen hostage crisis. Following a bungled investigation, the soldier received a suspended two-year jail sentence for "involuntary manslaughter through negligent use of a weapon." Yeltsin and other high officials failed to make good on their highly publicized promises to see justice done. In March of this year, Nadezhda Chaikova, a prominent Obshchaya Gazeta war correspondent known for her exposÃ©s of Russian military atrocities and her close contacts with the Chechen resistance, was found murdered execution-style in a Chechen village. Russian federal troops are suspects, but Chechen leaders themselves may have ordered her death, believing she was a spy and acting on rumors spread by the KGBâs successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB). Many journalists confirm the FSBâs role in discrediting those who report on Chechnya or other security-related topics. Summonses for "chats" at the FSB and invitations to collaborate--or face career difficulties--are still a fact of life, which journalists fear publicizing. One reporter, for instance, was warned to stop covering a controversial story "or else your personal security cannot be guaranteed." The military is notorious for pressuring journalists. Izvestia correspondents have been coerced to "share information" with military prosecutors and other authorities. Editors at the feisty Moskovsky Komsomolets have yet to make public their allegations about the murder of fellow reporter Dmitry Kholodov, killed by an exploding briefcase in 1994 while following up on a tip about army corruption. And Juliya Kalinina, another journalist from the same paper, recently received anonymous threats for reporting on military officersâ abuse of power. So it is not surprising that journalists have greeted Lebedâs personnel purges with skepticism. Without the prosecution of reportersâ attackers, and a credible guarantee of safety from law-enforcement officials, journalists in Russia will not be free to provide the kind of probes into official corruption so necessary to a democratic society. Those in government who stand aside while reporters are killed with impunity cannot be credited with sincerely addressing the crisis facing Russia today.

The day he was freed, he said, a director of the State Security Service (SSS) advised him that "adversary journalism" helps no one. And, when he got out of prison, he found that his phone lines at home and at work were cut. Russian journalist released from prison in Samara Yerofeyev, editor of the weekly Vremya-Iks, was arrested on Sept. 25, 1995, after publishing a series of critical articles entitled "People on the Sidewalks" about prostitution and police corruption. Although the prosecutor asked for the maximum sentence of five years in labor camp, Yerofeyev was sentenced to 10 months in prison, exactly the term he had already served in pre-trial detention. Independent Guatemalan editor target of grenade attack Siglo Veintiuno Two days prior to the attack, Zamora had resigned as editor in chief of Siglo Veintiuno over conflicts with the board of directors. Zamora told CPJ that he believes the attack was intended to deter him from launching another newspaper in Guatemala. He also believes that the attack was a warning to his yet-to-be-named successor at Siglo Veintiuno. 'Press Assassination Law' repealed in Egypt Law 93, dubbed the "Press Assassination Law" by journalists, assigned stiff prison sentences and heavy fines to offenses such as libel and abolished a previous law proscribing the preventive arrest or administrative detention of journalists under investigation for their work. Censorship looms in Hong Kong: China to prohibit journalists from 'advocating action' In a speech at Japan's National Press Club on June 5, Lu said press freedom would be guaranteed after the handover. But he drew a distinction between reporting news and advocating action, saying that "advocating itself is not press freedom and is different from objective reporting." Conditions in Nigerian prison dire, says released editor After six months in detention without charge, Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of Nigeria's independent magazine, was set free on June 24. In a letter to CPJ, Igiebor, a 1993 recipient of the Committee's International Press Freedom Award, wrote that his release "would not have been possible without the relentless international press battle waged on my behalf by the Committee to Protect Journalists." Igiebor's release coincided with talks in London between Nigeria and the 56-member Commonwealth. Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth following the November 1995 execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight fellow activists for the Ogoni people. Awalu Yadudu, the legal adviser to Nigeria's military dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, said that Igiebor's release was granted in deference to the United Nations. A U.N. mission went to Nigeria in April, and, at CPJ's urging, met with Igiebor in prison and with Nigerian authorities to discuss government attacks on the press. The mission's report condemned Decree 2, under which Igiebor was detained. The decree allows for detention without trial for "acts prejudicial to state security." In what was believed to be a face-saving gesture by authorities, Valery Yerofeyev, a Russian journalist in Samara who was on trial for allegedly "pandering," was released from prison on July 29. Pressure from CPJ and other press freedom organizations are credited with securing his release. -- By Catherine Fitzpatrick Guatemala's JÃ³se RubÃ©n Zamora Marroquin, former editor in chief of the independent daily and a recipient of CPJ's 1995 International Press Freedom Award, was dining at a Guatemala City restaurant on May 15 when three unidentified assailants in a moving vehicle threw two grenades at his car, which was parked out front. One exploded, damaging the car. The assailants escaped. --By Mira Gajevic After a yearlong struggle, Egyptian journalists have successfully fended off government efforts to radically curtail press freedoms. On June 17, the People's Assembly of Egypt approved new press legislation that repealed the notorious Law 93 of 1995. Faced with vehement opposition from press freedom supporters, including many journalists writing for official papers, the government agreed to form a committee to draft a new press law. Despite official promises to the contrary, however, Law 93 remained in effect as the committee of 34--which included only four opposition journalists--slowly worked on a new draft. As a result, at least 20 journalists were tried or prosecuted under the draconian measure, and dozens more were placed under investigation. The government's "compromise" bill, passed by the upper house of parliament on June 9, reduced some of the punishments mandated by Law 93, but maintained the prolonged prison sentences and heavy fines for crimes of publication. It also included articles that prohibit publishing news that "abuses public officials," "insults the parliament, the army, courts, authorities, or public agencies," "vilifies foreign heads of state," "insults the president of the republic," or "damages the nation's reputation." Journalists responded with a sit-in at Egypt's Press Syndicate and threatened a strike, prompting the personal intervention of President Hosni Mubarak. The government then introduced new legislation in the lower house of parliament that revoked Law 93, thereby restoring press freedoms in Egypt to the status quo of just over a year ago--a situation that is far from ideal. Yet the repeal must be considered a victory for Egyptian journalists, who showed remarkable solidarity and persistence in fighting the Law 93 restrictions. -- By Avner Gidron In a May 31 interview on CNN, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of China's State Council, said that Hong Kong's media would not be allowed to advocate independence for Taiwan or for Hong Kong after China assumes sovereignty over the colony in July 1997. Lu's remarks generated widespread alarm in the Hong Kong press, with many journalists questioning China's commitment to the Basic Law of Hong Kong, which contains a guarantee of press freedom. The document was negotiated by China and Great Britain for governance of Hong Kong after the handover. China's Information Minister, Zheng Jianhui, echoed Lu in a July 11 interview with the Far Eastern Economic Review and suggested that Hong Kong journalists follow the example of their mainland counterparts: "If [Taiwanese President] Lee Teng-hui stands up and says something, you can report it--just like we do. As long as someone else says it, that's okay." -- By James Bucknell (c) 1996 Committee to Protect Journalists | Front Page| CPJ Website |WT01-B01-163IA024-000253-B035-308http://www.cpj.org:80/pubs/newsletter/summer1996/4dayton.html 169.132.35.44 19970108124102 text/html 6806HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Wed, 08 Jan 1997 12:40:45 GMTServer: Apache/1.1.1Content-type: text/htmlContent-length: 6635Last-modified: Thu, 05 Sep 1996 14:56:09 GMT CPJ Dangerous Assignments Quarterly Summer 1996 Internet Edition No. 51 CPJ Chair Kati Marton meeting with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman in April.Photograph: Feral Tribune Key to Balkans: A free press By Kati Marton They donât shoot reporters--or even jail them anymore--in postwar former Yugoslavia. Today, the authoritarian governments of the Balkans use more subtle measures to control the media. After a 10-day fact-finding trip to Sarajevo, Belgrade, and Zagreb and talks with the leaders of all three countries, I am convinced a healthy democratic opposition will not take root here without stronger Western pressure on Serb, Croatian, and Bosnian leaders. All three leaders--Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman, and Alija Izetbegovic--promised to uphold the right to free speech and free press in Dayton, but all three are falling far short of delivering on that promise. The Balkan mediaâs plight goes much further than the issue of the populationâs legitimate rights of free speech and free press. It was the media in Belgrade, Zagreb and, to a much lesser degree, Sarajevo that fueled the ethnic passions that unleashed the war. It is now essential for the security of Europe and the United States that we insist on the establishment of free media in Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia. The situation is critical in Bosnia. In September, nationwide elections will be held that will anchor the fragile new entity of Bosnia-Herze govina to a new central government. Without a free press, the dream of reviving a multiethnic society after years of savage violence will fade. Although the guns that killed 45 reporters during the war are quiet now, it is still too dangerous for Bosnian journalists to cover more than a sliver of the country. The brave ones who try come back shaken from the experience, with stories of being pulled off the road when Serb militia loyal to the indicted war criminal who still heads the Bosnia Serbs--Radovan Karadzic--spotted their Sarajevo plates and hauled them in for "questioning." In Bosnia, like elsewhere, television is how most people get their news. What limited television there is (only one of nine transmitters survived the war) is under the control of President Alija Izetbegovicâs ruling party. This makes it difficult for opposition candidates like former Prime Minister Haris Silajdic to get their message out in the election campaign. Ironically, Radio Free Europe, deemed a relic of the Cold War elsewhere and never before heard in Yugoslavia, has become the most popular radio in Bosnia, as close as most people think theyâll get to the straight story. In Belgrade and Zagreb, independent media are controlled by the use of "financial police": government accountants who swoop down on opposition press and find their bookkeeping wanting. On April 25, such "accountants" swept into the office of the Croatian weekly Panorama and ordered all staff to leave in 15 minutes. The magazine remains shut.* The reason: alleged "failure to meet technical, health, and ecological standards necessary for operating." When I asked President Tudjman why his government is suing another independent paper, Novi List, for a ruinous sum, Tudjman ordered an aide to fetch the cover of the satiric weekly Feral Tribune, which featured Tudjmanâs face atop Ramboâs body. "Would any other world leader put up with this?" he asked. "All leaders in democracies," I replied, but without much effect on him. Another technique both Milosevic and Tudjman use to quiet the voices of dissent is to claim that formerly state-controlled media were "improperly privatized." Using that device, Serbian police entered Belgradeâs Studio B and pulled the plug. Now all Serb television is under Milosevicâs control. But Milosevic assured me, revealingly, that he has instructed the media to tamp down their former anti-Muslim and anti-Croat fervor and get behind the Dayton Accords. Milosevic also controls newsprint, the lifeblood of newspapers, and thus manipulates the independent dailiesâ circulation. Nasa Borba, the major independent daily in Serbia, struggles to reach more than 10,000 readers, whereas Politika, the pro-Milosevic paper, never suffers from a newsprint shortage and reaches 300,000 readers. To go from Nasa Borbaâs shabby offices to Politikaâs high-tech home, bristling with security men, is to understand the effective uses of press control in Serbia. Politikaâs colorful editor, Hadji Antic, who described his editorial policy as "inclined toward the official story," said if the other papers have circulation problems itâs because theyâre no good. But the Balkan leaders are not the implacable dictators of the past. There are many pressure points. Serbia badly wants the remaining sanctions lifted. Bosnia, the real victim in the war, as well as Serbia and Croatia, need Western investment, IMF loans, European Union membership, and respectability. In their need is our opportunity. A price must be exacted for all those things, and part of that price should be the one ingredient that separates a democracy from every other form of government: a free press.

Following are excerpts from the testimony of Mort Zuckerman, editor in chief of ; Ted Koppel, anchor of ABCâs "Nightline"; and CPJ board member Terry Anderson, formerly of the Associated Press (AP), who was falsely accused of working for the CIA by the Islamic fundamentalist group Hezbollah, which held him hostage for seven years in Lebanon. MORT ZUCKERMAN: The press in America is unique. It is a constitutionally recognized instrument. Its constitutional protection lies precisely in its independence from government. American journalism does not represent the government but their readers, and their duty is to gather the information that they can and report it truthfully to their readership. ... It is in that independence from government that journalism renders to government its greatest service. ... Since it is my view that untainted journalism ... is likely to do more good for Americans and perhaps save more lives and resources than anything that the occasional journalistic agent might accomplish, I believe that there should be an absolute prohibition that should spell out that U.S. spies do not pose as reporters, that there should be an absolute prohibition against paying and working with accredited journalists for intelligence work, and that a public policy statement should make it specifically clear that journalists will have no role in intelligence work. TED KOPPEL: I am unalterably and categorically opposed to the notion of the CIA having the legal option of using journalism as a cover for its officers or agents. ... As things already stand, most governments, police and intelligence agencies around the world assume that many, if not most American journalists working overseas are, at the very least, sharing information with the CIA and probably work for the agency. Since that is the way that most of them operate, it is only natural that they should assume that we do also. Until now, we have at least been able to point to American law; to insist that we would be breaking the law if we worked simultaneously as journalists and intelligence operatives. ... It will be much easier for those foreign governments and agencies if we give them yet another opportunity to assume that the United States is, after all, just like them. ... It will also place an even greater strain on the worn thread of credibility that exists between American journalists and our readers and viewers .... Those of my colleagues who have devoted a lifetime of striving for fairness and objectivity in their work, who have genuinely reported without fear or favor, will now have to settle for the assumption that they were just maintaining their cover. TERRY ANDERSON: My captors ... interrogated me a number of times and quite roughly. To give you an example of the way their minds work: One of the questions put to me quite often was, 'Give us the name of the CIA agent at the AP who you report to. ... I have on other occasions had loaded weapons pointed at my head by screaming militia men shouting, Spy! Spy!... A great deal of damage has already been done by the discussion of this issue. The only way of repairing it is to institute an absolute and flat ban on the use of any journalist by any intelligence agency or any intelligence agency using journalistic cover. A statement of a formal exception--no matter how hedged or restricted--would simply be an acknowledgement to those who suspect us of being spies that "yes, on occasion, youâre right."

Independent press in Cuba struggles to stay alive A few days before World Press Freedom Day (May 3), nine Cuban security police ransacked the modest Havana offices of the Independent Cuban Press Bureau, a struggling nongovernment news agency. They hauled away almost the entire contents--two typewriters, an antiquated word processor, files and books, even the pens and pencils. By Suzanne Bilello Joaquin Torres, a journalist with the Havana Press independent news agency there, termed it "a reminder that they are there, and they can silence us whenever they like." Cuba stands alone in the hemisphere as the only country that tolerates no independent newspapers, magazines or news broadcasts. That brings frequent U.S. criticism in international human rights forums; it earned Fidel Castro a spot on CPJâs enemies list of world leaders who pose the gravest threat to press freedom. Under increased international scrutiny and sorely in need of economic partners, Cuba is poised for historic change. Whether the transition is to democracy hinges in part on whether Cuba has a free press that gives its citizens the basis for informed decisions about how they want to be governed. Castro no doubt knows that in many countries, the transition to democracy began when individuals reported what anyone could see, but few had dared to say. And whether the United States continues to see Cuba as a nondemocratic menace to national and hemispheric security has far-reaching implications for how Washington is using your tax dollars. Only a year ago, four upstart news agencies were founded in Havana. Since then, many of their journalists have endured waves of harassment. Several were detained on charges ranging from "dangerousness" and "disrespect" to spreading "enemy propaganda." Many of those journalists worked for government media until they were sacked for "ideological incompatibility" and now are trying to eke out a living free-lancing for foreign news organizations. Their aim is to carve out a livelihood that is independent of state-controlled media yet a comfortable distance from organized dissident factions at home and abroad. Paradoxically, the United States has become an unlikely ally in Castroâs efforts to justify keeping independent journalists isolated and vulnerable, subject to the whims of the state and cut off from potential foreign patrons. The anti-Cuba Libertad Act sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., and signed by President Clinton, includes troubling provisions that in effect prohibit U.S. news organizations from sending resident correspondents to Cuba--even if Castro were to welcome them. It requires that Cuban authorities grant resident work permits not only to correspondents from private U.S. news organizations but also to employees of the U.S. governmentâs Radio and TV Marti service, the principal broadcast medium for Castroâs most bitter enemies among U.S. exiles. If a U.S. news organization wants to hire Torres or other Cuban journalists on retainer, as a few have, the U.S. Treasury Department has to approve the transaction. This practice--tantamount to licensing, prohibited here by the First Amendment--puts Cuban journalists in the precarious position of needing official U.S. approval to work there. Castro remains the chief obstacle to freedom in Cuba for local and foreign journalists alike. But the U.S. governmentâs meddling with press freedom and personnel decisions by U.S. media could set a troubling precedent for U.S. regulation of news media--U.S. or foreign--elsewhere. While policy-makers in Washington posture about the threat of a Communist Cuba, Torres and other independent journalists will spend this World Press Freedom Day much like any other: straining to hear telephone conversations through the echoes of wiretaps, scrounging for pens and paper and worrying that if three journalists get together to talk, they could be charged with "delinquent association."

HonorÃ©. CPJ presents legal brief in trial of satiric Croatian newsweekly A criminal trial against two journalists accused of defaming Croatian President Franjo Tudjman in the satirical newspaper Feral Tribune was unexpectedly adjourned on its opening day, June 14. The judge adjourned the trial until Sept. 25 in order to call new witnesses, he said. By Amanda Onion The move was hailed by observers as a victory for the defense and a response to the international outcry over President Tudjmanâs efforts to muzzle Croatiaâs independent media. The charges against Viktor Ivancic, Feral Tribune's editor in chief, and Marinko Culic, a reporter with the weekly, stem from an April 29 article criticizing the presidentâs proposal to rebury the remains of World War II Fascists alongside their victims. If convicted, the journalists face up to three years in prison. CPJ board member James C. Goodale, an attorney and expert on press freedom issues, traveled to Zagreb to present the judge with a legal brief, prepared at the request of defense counsel. The CPJ brief condemned the prosecution, which is based on the notion of seditious libel, or the criminalization of slander against public officials, a legal concept that the Committee characterized as " fundamentally antithetical to the values of a democratic society." Since there are no procedures in the Croatian legal system to file such documents, however, the judge was unable to enter the brief into the record. The case against Ivancic and Culic is the first application of a law passed by the Croatian parliament on March 29, which effectively criminalizes any critical reporting or satirical commentary on the president, the prime minister, the parliament speaker, or the chief magistrates of the supreme and constitutional courts. After the hearing, Goodale and other representatives from press freedom groups and local NGOs held a public meeting and press conference in Zagreb, where they denounced the statutes used to prosecute the journalists and cited international practice regarding criminal libel. The Croatian laws being used to prosecute Ivancic and Culic " have no place in any country, and are especially to be condemned in a self-proclaimed democracy such as Croatia," notes CPJâs brief, which was distributed at the press conference. "No journalist in any Western democracy is in prison as a result of a conviction of seditious libel." The CPJ brief extensively documents the opinions of the highest courts in Western democracies that the concept of seditious libel is an unacceptable constraint on freedom of expression. Croatiaâs new statutes are an example of seditious libel laws because they shield only high government officials from criticism.

The 28-year-old reporter for the left-wing Turkish daily Evrensel had just been beaten by policemen until his face was beyond recognition when he posed the question to Fikret Kayacan, one of the 11 officers charged with his murder. Later that same day, Jan. 8, 1996, Goktepe died from a brain hemorrhage. Goktepe never got a response from Kayacan, but his words stuck in the policemanâs mind. Kayacan recounted Goktepeâs question to a parliamentary commission investigating the case. He is also expected to testify at the trial, which, after one postponement, is now due to begin in September. The commissionâs findings shocked the nation: Goktepe was stopped by police while trying to cover the funeral of two leftist inmates killed during a prison riot. He was then taken to an Istanbul gym, where 1,053 mourners from the service were being detained, and he was ordered to lie face down on the floor. Hundreds of people then witnessed 11 policemen kicking him and beating him with their batons and fists. When Goktepe lost consciousness, the trainer at the sports complex was asked to look at him. He gave the reporter some painkillers and cleaned the blood from his face. Officer Kayacan and another officer, Tuncay Uzun, then brought him some food. When Goktepeâs condition failed to improve, Kayacan and Uzun took him outside and placed him on a bench. Uzun went to his captain and warned about Goktepeâs condition, offering to take him to the hospital. âWe canât spend that much time with each one of them,â the captain, Battal Kose, allegedly said. The journalist was left to die on the bench. According to officers who testified before the commission, the police first tried to cover up the fatal beating by announcing that Goktepeâs body had been found after an apparent fall from a garden wall near the gym. His name was removed from arrest documents by a high-ranking police officer who ordered that Goktepeâs ID card--which had been confiscated--be placed on the dead body. Evrensel led a media campaign calling for prosecution of the officers involved. In all, 48 policemen, some high-ranking, have been charged in relation to the attack. The 11 officers charged with murder face a penalty of up to 15 years in prison if convicted. No one, however, has been arrested, even though minor offenders in Turkey are often held in custody for trial. The Goktepe murder trial, when it does begin, is expected to last for months, perhaps years. It is rare, however, that police get punished for such acts. Meanwhile, since January, authorities have cracked down on Evrensel, issuing four closure orders totaling three months. The paper had often faced legal harassment before Goktepeâs murder but had been acquitted in every instance.

AESOP 2000 features the most intuitive interface available, the ability to understand a surgeonï¿½s voice commands. This allows the surgeon to use spoken English to precisely maneuver and position a laparoscope (a specially designed optical tube which, when connected to a medical video camera and light source, is passed into the body to allow the surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor). AESOP 2000 (pronounced "eesop") is the second generation of the companyï¿½s flagship product, and was cleared by the FDA in May 1996. A clinical advisory team comprised of leading endoscopic surgeons has worked closely with the company throughout the development of the surgical robotï¿½s voice control interface. Clinical validations have been successfully completed at over 15 institutions across the nation. "Surgeons have been asking for an easy way to control their field of vision during surgery. Our research has confirmed that voice control is the ideal interface. We are delighted to offer this advanced solution today," said Gene Wang, CEO & President of Computer Motion. "We plan to apply our voice control technology across a broad range of surgical devices to create an industry standard surgeon-to-machine interface for the operating room." AESOP (an acronym for Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning) was first introduced in October 1994. Over 15,000 minimally invasive surgeries have been successfully assisted by AESOP in over 150 hospitals and surgery centers around the world. "I love it [AESOP 2000]!" said Dr. Carlos Gracia, a leading endoscopic surgeon at San Ramon Regional Medical Center, San Ramon, CA. "Itï¿½s quiet, it does what you tell it to do, it doesnï¿½t complain, it doesnï¿½t fatigue and has a precision that I canï¿½t even duplicate when Iï¿½m holding the camera for someone else." Computer Motionï¿½s core development team, led by Chief Technical Officer and Founder, Dr. Yulun Wang, has worked together for over ten years and holds several key patents in robotics for medical applications. Computer Motion is currently developing robotic and computer enhanced devices for new surgical applications which leverage the core technologies underlying the AESOP family of products. Founded in 1989, Computer Motion is the world leader in medical robotics. The companyï¿½s mission is to enhance surgeonsï¿½ capabilities and improve outcomes while reducing costs in the operating room using computers and robotics.

These institutions have agreed to help perfect the companyï¿½s robotically assisted microsurgery systems and participate in the studies necessary for the systems to receive FDA clearance. These systems will be used in endoscopic cardiac surgery procedures such as the Endoscopic Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (E-CABG), to allow multiple vessel coronary artery bypass grafting through holes smaller than the diameter of a pencil. Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United States and most industrialized nations. More than 700,000 coronary artery bypass grafts and 200,000 heart valve replacements are performed annually worldwide. Greater than 99 percent of these procedures are performed as open-heart surgeries, requiring a patientï¿½s breast bone to be cut in half to allow access to the heart. This practice is necessary, as todayï¿½s technology is not capable of supporting the clinical demands of a fully endoscopic surgical approach. Computer Motionï¿½s robotically assisted microsurgical systems enable surgeons to videoscopically perform delicate, precise surgical maneuvers through endoscopic ports. With the assistance of robotics, new procedures such as the E-CABG, will be performed safely and with consistent high quality. Dr. Yulun Wang, Computer Motionï¿½s Chief Technical Officer and Founder, believes that "computers and robotics can enhance the surgeonï¿½s dexterity in the same way that the microscope enhances the surgeonï¿½s ability to view the detail of small objects." "We are seeing the proliferation of minimally invasive techniques in all the surgical specialties, including cardiac surgery. The benefits canï¿½t be ignored ï¿½ shorter hospital stays, decreased pain for the patients, faster recovery times," said Joseph F. Hahn, M.D., Chairman of the Cleveland Clinic Foundationï¿½s Division of Surgery. "However, as we work with smaller incisions and smaller vessels, we test the limits of human physical capabilities and require the assistance of new technology, such as Computer Motionï¿½s robotically assisted microsurgical systems." "With conventional surgical instruments, we are not able to achieve an acceptable method for treating multiple vessel coronary artery disease in an endoscopic fashion," said Ralph J. Damiano, M.D., Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Penn State Universityï¿½s Hershey Medical Center. "However, with the advent of computer controlled medical robotics, we now have a platform of technology that will enable us to devise innovative minimally invasive procedures to reduce the morbidity and cost associated with these operations." Thomas M. Krummel, M.D., John W. Oswald Professor and Chairman of the Department of Surgery at Penn State Universityï¿½s Hershey Medical Center comments, "This builds on our long standing commitment to technology development and validation to enhance our missions of patient care, education, research and service." Mike Rowan, Chief Operating Officer of Sarasota Memorial Hospital, said, "Over the past year we have studied the opportunities for realistic success in minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafts. We believe that robotic surgery offers the best opportunity to marry advanced technology with our surgeonï¿½s skills to make the clinical leap to successful minimally invasive cardiac surgery that can be duplicated in centers around the country." Dr. James L. Cox, Chief, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine, said, "I believe that the use of robotically assisted microsurgical systems in minimally invasive cardiac surgery will advance our surgical capabilities far beyond anything that is now possible. Never has the future of cardiac surgery been more promising or exciting, largely because of innovations such as this one by Computer Motion." "Our mission is to enhance surgeon capabilities, improve outcomes and reduce costs using computers and robotics," said Gene Wang, CEO and President of Computer Motion. "We are honored to be participating with some of the worldï¿½s finest cardiac institutions to enable the E-CABG procedure and to pioneer the next frontier in minimally invasive surgery using robotically assisted microsurgical systems."

The main driver of this interest is the needto leverage the expertise of surgical specialists to facilitategreater training and adoption of laparoscopic procedures. Themajor laparoscopic instrument makers have made significant investmentsin this area and have established tele-surgery networks wheretwo-way video and audio equipment connect surgical suites withteaching facilities. To date, telesurgery has consisted of two-way audio and videocommunications allowing surgeons in the OR to consult with surgeonsat remote areas. Robotic devices will allow surgeons to activelyparticipate in the surgery from a remote location. AESOP is thefirst step in that development, allowing the surgeon to activelycontrol the video picture. We have configured a system that can be easily integrated intoan existing tele-surgery communications network. The AESOP TS Telesurgery System includes the following equipment: an AESOP system with communication card to be used in the"local" OR additional AESOP TS Controller, Hand Control and communicationscard to be used at the "remote" site. The AESOP System can use the existing communications link to sendand receive commands or use its own dedicated modems for communication. The AESOP TS System is not FDA cleared for use insurgery. Its applications at this point are in research only.

This system allows all ofthe command modes of the standard AESOP 1000 System, but alsoadds the flexibility of PC communication directly with the AESOPController. The flexibility of the DS System allows a platformfor building new robotic applications and laparoscopic research. System Usage The DS System, like the AESOP 1000, is intended for use in a laparoscopicsetting where the robot's end effector is attached to a fixed-pivotlaparoscope. The DS System is not intended for clinical use andrequires a PC connection to function. The user is provided witha disk containing the AESOP System software, a file transfer program,and a library of movement and data collection routines. To use the System, AESOP is connected to the PC through the serialport. The file transfer software is loaded on the PC and the Systemsoftware can then be loaded through the serial port. Once thisis done, the System can be used within the standard AESOP commandmodes (e.g. using the Foot and Hand Controls, Manual Mode, andmemory positions). The user can also send and receive additionaldata from the PC through the serial port. Research Applications With the serial port, users can send data to and receive datafrom the AESOP System. A library of commands is provided on afloppy disk. For example, the robot's individual joints can becommanded to move to specific locations. The system can send backinformation about joint positions and movement histories. In addition, other interfaces may be used to control therobot. For example, the robot could be moved through voice commands,head tracking or any other directional input signals.

The company is committedto developing, marketing, and selling robotic devices that enhancethe surgeon's capabilities and improve outcomes while reducingcosts. CMI's product development strategy leverages from its initialproduct, the AESOP System, and leads to a family of products thatenable new minimally invasive surgical procedures in a more cost-effective environment. The company's vision for the "ORof the Future" includes robotic devices that provide bettervisualization for minimally invasive techniques, improved dexterityfor the surgeon, intuitive human-machine interfaces, and telesurgicalcapability. The Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning (AESOP)is a robotic system that approximates the form and function ofa human arm and positions the laparoscope during laparoscopicsurgery. It is the only robotic system which has been clearedby the US Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for usein surgery. Laparoscopic surgery frequently requires the surgeon to useboth hands to manipulate the surgical instruments, and the taskof controlling the laparoscope is relegated to someone other thanthe operating surgeon. AESOP returns direct control of the visualfield to the surgeon, eliminates the need for a human scope holder,and provides a rock-steady image. AESOP was introduced during the fourth quarter of 1994. As ofDecember 1995, over 100 medical institutions have incorporatedAESOP into their operating room suites and over 13,000 surgicalprocedures to date have been performed in Gynecology, GeneralSurgery, and Urology. Computer Motion was founded by Dr. Yulun Wang in 1989 forthe purposes of developing advanced robotics and high performance,real-time computer hardware. The Company has performed roboticsresearch and built application-specific robots for a number ofgovernment agencies, including NASA, the National Science Foundation,the National Institute of Health, and the United States Navy. With the core technical team assembled, the Company added sales,marketing, finance, and operations personnel and is now 100% focusedon the development and commercialization of medical robots. Computer Motion, located in Goleta, CA (just outside ofSanta Barbara), is a privately held company.

As health care providers, we must focus on providing quality care as the fundamental goal, while always keeping an eye on the bottom line. In our efforts to reduce costs, the primary efforts have been to re-engineer work flow and to strategically reduce materials and supply costs. Historically, technology has primarily served a clinical role in the OR often with little regard to cost. More recently, however, technology is emerging which can help health care institutions provide quality care at lower costs. Our hospital performed a detailed study of one such technological advancement, the Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning (AESOP), a robotic arm which gives the surgeon the ability to control the operative field of view using simple voice commands. The results of our study indicate improved OR productivity, a positive budget impact measured in hard dollars, and a high level of surgeon satisfaction1. Specifically, we were able to convert the productivity improvements attributable to AESOP into a savings of 0.74 FTEs. Coupled with a cumulative return on incremental billings, the system produced a hard dollar net improvement to our bottom line of $49,000 per year. This represents animmediate ROI of 391% based on current monthly rental pricing. In an outright purchase a 100% ROI would be achieved in 11 months, and an institution with similar utilization rates would stand to gain over $200,000 over 5 years. A Changing Paradigm in Health Care Our nationï¿½s health care system has undergone significant change under the presence of managed care. "Employers, stung by spiraling health care premiums, know the system has excess capacity (itï¿½s said half of hospitals could close tomorrow without displacing any patients) and are determined to squeeze it out."2 On a regional basis employers and insurers have adopted a group purchasing behavior, buying services from only a few large integrated networks, and creating new control over significant volumes of patient services. This market strategy has dramatically increased competition and forced health care providers to join these networks. Capitated payment plans based on per diem, per case, or per member per month (pmpm) rates also shift much of the financial risk to the providers of health care services. Thus, this decade has been marked by unprecedented competition and decreasing reimbursement rates. What may appear as geographical inconsistencies in the progression of managed care is in reality the result of strategic MCO penetration into markets based upon population density and physician organization. HMOs have moved quickly through California and now into the metropolitan cities of the Northeast, Southeast and Midwest. The spread of managed care throughout the majority of community and teaching hospitals seems inevitable. Hospital institutions electing to play a reactive role to this phenomenon may very well find themselves victims in this era of ongoing consolidation and increased competition. As payers continue to compare the performance results of their member hospitals (e.g., procedural costs, complication rates, patient follow-up data and outcomes) against national data and norms, the health care provider is being forced to do more with less. Productivity enhancing technology has become increasingly strategic as we search for new ways to improve outcomes while further reducing the cost per patient visit. Case Study: San Ramon Regional Medical Center San Ramon Regional Medical Center (San Ramon, CA) is a 123-bed community hospital that is situated in one of the most advanced managed care regions of the nation, the highly competitive Stage III to Stage IV market serving the densely populated San Francisco Bay area. Our goal is to be able to demonstrate that we can be a low cost provider of high quality surgical services. Our efforts to reduce costs have been focused primarily on the two most significant cost components in providing surgical services -- labor and materials. As part of this strategy, we have already implemented a computer information system that enables better scheduling and the detailed tracking of surgical case lengths, utilization and costs. We have put forward efforts to minimize procedure delays, cancellation rates and turnaround times. Our personnel have also taken a shift toward cross-trained teams to allow for increased flexibility. To help bring materials costs down, we are procuring supplies from an approved vendor base through negotiated agreements. One of the surgical specialties that our institution is strategically focused on providing is minimally invasive surgery (MIS). With reduced patient stays, faster recovery times and high patient demand, the compelling clinical and economic benefits make MIS attractive to both ourselves and the payers. To help us further position ourselves to win with MIS in managed care, we have elected to invest in a new technology having a relatively modest cost investment, the Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning (AESOP), manufactured by Computer Motion, Inc. (Goleta, CA). AESOP is a new device that automates the arduous human task of holding an endoscope with a computer-controlled, robotic positioning arm. This surgical robot is capable of maneuvering and positioning an endoscope under the direct control of the surgeon. Our two years of experience with AESOP have demonstrated that the robotic arm is very safe, user friendly, and clinically effective. Our surgeons report that the improved stability of the image and their ability to control the field of view significantly enhances the efficiency of their operating environment. Dr. Carlos Gracia, a general and vascular surgeon performing endoscopic surgery at our hospital stated, "I love it [AESOP]! ï¿½it has a precision that I canï¿½t even duplicate when Iï¿½m holding the camera for someone else." For every dollar saved, more than a dollar is earned Reducing Surgical Case Time Several studies including our own have documented a reduction in surgical case time resulting from the use of AESOP in a variety of procedures1,3,4. There are two strategic points to consider when overall surgical case time can be shortened. First, two operating room staff are "freed" to do other tasks for that duration. Some areas where staff time may be redirected include lunch relief, reducing overtime, optimizing marginal daily staffing, maximizing the use of surgical specialty teams, operating room turnaround, and attention to special projects. Second, the OR suite becomes available sooner for the next procedure, and occasionally an additional procedure can be squeezed in without any additional staffing requirements. Together, these translate into more efficient scheduling and a decrease in staff hours per unit of surgical case time (productive hours per unit). At our institution, an average of 40 endoscopic cases per month are performed where AESOP can be utilized. Two of our surgeons perform a relatively higher volume of these general surgery procedures and typically account for 25 of the 40 endoscopic procedures that utilize AESOP. Once these two physicians committed to using AESOP, the rate of utilization was as low as 63% (25 of 40 cases) and as high as 100% with the participation of additional surgeons. With our experience, an OR suite can be freed for about 6 to 10 hours per month and OR staff can be freed due to shorter cases for 12 to 20 hours per month. The following chart reflects the average reduction in surgical case times with the use of AESOP. For every dollar billed, only a fraction of that dollar is reimbursed... Return On Incremental Billings Due to the regional differences in cost containment pressures, some facilities still operate in a largely fee-for-service (FFS) environment. FFS reimbursement rates will vary widely and depending on your region can be as high as 80 to 85%. However, these rates are on a decline and managed care payment plans are progressively gaining in popularity among health care payers. Managed Care Progression Estimated ROIB Stage I 85% Stage II 65% Stage III 40% Stage IV 17% The idea of shortening case times might threaten to decrease the revenues generated by billing FFS payers on a per-minute basis in the OR. In this situation, the administrator must carefully consider the nature of FFS revenue and the value of emerging early as the local low cost health care provider. The overall objective, however, should be to collect Return On Incremental Billings (ROIB) where possible, while continuously striving toward the ability to demonstrate a cost conscious approach to providing quality care. Conservatively, a facility might charge $100 per case for the use of AESOP. Based on our average of 40 endoscopic cases per month and an ROIB of just 17%, the net return would range from $425 per month if AESOP were used in 63% of these cases to $680 per month if 100% utilization were achieved. Progressing Toward "Solo" Surgery "Solo" surgery refers to the presence of only one surgeon in the OR suite during a given procedure. On a regional basis we have seen health care insurers significantly decrease their payments to the assistant surgeon, and many cases are now being done without an assistant. This has become common in several markets for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and laparoscopic herniorrhaphy procedures. It is often left up to the hospitalï¿½s OR facility to replace the assistant with one of their own staff. AESOP is able to fill this gap by lending the surgeon a hand with the scope. In the more complex endoscopic procedures a second assistant is often required to hold the scope. This demand falls heavily on the hospital as well as on the individuals trying to provide a steady field of view for the surgeons. Before AESOP, staff substitutions in these lengthy procedures were commonplace. AESOP has allowed us to staff one less person and simultaneously provide a more efficient operating environment for our surgeons. By substituting AESOP for a human scope holder, we have been able to free 34.5 to 54.8 hours per month of staff resources. Furthermore, we were able to insure against encroachments on our staff as reimbursement rates plummeted. The pressure to adapt "solo" surgery staffing models is typically inversely proportional to the level of FFS presence in a particular market. Many facilities who still enjoy reasonable FFS reimbursement rates have not felt much pressure in this area. Unfortunately, as a facility begins to experience the impact of managed care, pressure is likely to build to fill the shoes of the assistant surgeon who may no longer have an incentive to participate in certain cases. The chart below conceptualizes the relationship between reimbursement and staffing dynamics. Despite the many changes we face in health care today, two factors remain constant: increasing competition and decreasing reimbursement rates. Our goal is to stay ahead of the predominant market forces by strategically taking a proactive stance. Rather than reacting to a falling ROIB, we began early by restructuring our staffing models, studying our costs and investing in productivity enhancement technology in anticipation of these burdening market pressures. The Cost of Productivity Enhancing Technology The cost of productivity enhancing technology is best measured in terms of its impact on operational expenses. By using AESOP to automate the scope holding task, we were able to improve operative efficiency in the OR and get better mileage out of our surgical staff and facility resources. Through effective use of the OR suite and freed staff resources we were able to achieve a measurable reduction in our productive hours per unit from 5.55 to 5.33, resulting in a 4% decrease. The key factor to this accomplishment can be attributed to the successful conversion of increased productivity and freed resources into measurable improvements in marginal staffing, staffing for special projects and additional cases. Our study results show an improvement in OR productivity and a positive budget impact measurable in hard dollars. Specifically, we were able to convert productivity improvements attributable to AESOP to a savings of 0.74 FTEs valued at $43,000 per year. Marginal reimbursement from payers for use of the system further generates approximately $6,000 per year in net revenue. Balanced against an AESOP rental cost of $1045 per month, these would represent an immediate return on investment of 391%. Based on the current purchase price of $44,900 for AESOP, a capital investment would be recovered in 11 months, and over 5 years an institution would realize financial benefits totaling over $200,000. We also estimate that, on a monthly basis, with an OR suite freed for close to 10 hours we can potentially add 3 to 4 cases without the need for additional staffing. Our study results can be further summarized as follows. Soft Dollar Impact OR suite freed for close to 10 hours per month with significant value to our institution. OR staff freed to accomplish more important tasks; allows nurses to focus on nursing. A 4% reduction in productive hours per unit. Very high surgeon satisfaction with AESOP. Potential to add 3 to 4 surgical cases per month without the need for additional staffing. A unique win-win situation where both the administrator and surgeons can benefit. Hard Dollar Impact A 0.74 FTE reduction in marginal staffing having an annual recurring savings of $43,000. Based on an ROIB of just 17%, an annual $6000 net reimbursement can be collected. Together, these benefits stand to offset the cost of AESOP with a positive cash flow of $36,460 annually. Based on a $1045 monthly rental price, an immediate 391% return on investment can be realized. Pay back on a capital investment purchase of $44,900 can be achieved in 11 months. Based on the $44,900 purchase price, an institution with a similar case load and utilization rate would stand to gain over $200,000 over five years. It may be more financially viable for some institutions to rent or lease than to purchase AESOP. AESOP can often be acquired using operational funds, thus avoiding a lengthy capital equipment approval cycle. Based on the monthly rental expense, the system cost can be broken down to an hourly rate. When weighed against the value of improving the overall productivity of surgery, the decision to "hire" AESOP at $1.50 per hour was not difficult. Furthermore, the manufacturerï¿½s service and upgrade program included with the device rental agreement protected our hospital against any rapidly evolving changes to the technology. The decision to rent or lease must be weighed against the value of purchasing AESOP, which may yield a better financial return in the long run. Discussion: Embracing Change AESOP is well suited for institutions taking a proactive stance in positioning themselves for the managed care marketplace. However, as with any new technology, especially one that changes a userï¿½s operating basis, there will be a spectrum of acceptance. The innovators and early adopters in any group are quick to embrace new technologies that fit their vision of progress. The majority, however, may wait until there is a consensus of acceptance and the compelling reasons to use the technology are well defined. In the increasingly competitive health care environment, we need to continue to explore new types of technology as tools to help us maintain quality while lowering costs. There is a learning curve with AESOP, thus users should not expect immediate benefits when first using the system. Typically, a surgeon can become comfortable with AESOP in one to five procedures. Our experience has shown that if both surgeons and staff are open-minded and willing to embrace technological advances, they will overcome the learning curve and realize the wealth of benefits that the device has to offer.

Peter Geis, M.D., FACS Director, Minimally Invasive Surgical Training Institute (MISTI), St.Joseph Medical Center Baltimore, MD 21204 ABSTRACT-Resource allocation, including manpower and other expenses, havelimited the evolution of minimally invasive surgical proceduresto provide humanism and to improve surgical care for patients.Robotic enhancement has been proposed as a mechanism to improvethe cost-benefit relationship for patients. To this end, we haveused the robotic arm enhancement to minimize resource and personnelutilization during minimally invasive procedures. Phase I of ourstudy has included the use of the robotic arm in 24 laparoscopichernia repairs, cholecystectomies, and nissen fundoplicationswith the surgeon as a solo-surgeon, i.e., the primary surgeonis the only participant in the operative sterile field. The scrubnurse did not participate in the procedures. During this study,there were no technical mishaps, no complications related to thesolo-surgeon - robotic arm concept, and the operative times werestatistically similar to equivalent procedures utilizing multiplepersonnel. The hernia repair is least complex and most amenableto solo-surgery due to the use of only three access ports; cholecystectomyoccasionally requires four access ports increasing its complexityto a measurable degree. Nissen fundoplication, however, requiresfive access ports and proved to be the most complex of the proceduresto adapt successfully to solo-surgery utilizing robotic arm enhancement. Phase II of our study has involved theuse of a combination of technologically complex and sophisticatedtechnology to improve outcomes in complex laparoscopic procedures.The Head-Mounted Display, AESOP, the robotic arm, and the HarmonicScalpel have been used in 140 complex minimally invasive procedures;the procedures were laparoscopic spine surgery (24 cases), laparoscopicgastric surgery (28 cases), and laparoscopic colon resection (88cases). The use of these sophisticated technologies added safety,improved versatility, and did not increase the length of the operativeprocedures. The use of multiple technologies had an additive effecton the benefits. There were no experiences in which the technologiescontributed to a technical complication or an adverse result forthe patients. However, the successful use of these technologiesrequires an in-depth educational experience for the surgeon andfor the operating room team. In a further effort to improve efficiencyand control of the visual fields during minimally invasive surgery,we have tested a new prototype voice activation and instrumenttracking control method for the robotic arm in order to createa nearly seamless method to control the visual field. Prototypevoice activation and deactivation also allows instruments to beused in the visual field for the surgical procedure while notbeing used for tracking of the visual field. Tracking with theinstrument utilizing a color-coded tracking system has been 100%effective in our hands, has not induced errors in technical performanceof procedures, and has shortened the time required for performanceof specific procedural tasks. Further, this process improves versatilityfor the surgeon, increases concentration, reduces fatigue anddoes not interfere with the position of the surgeon. Areas forimprovement which have been observed utilizing these techniquesare (1) the use of appropriate and consistent voice activationterminology, and (2) the proper positioning of the instrumenttracking unit in the most appropriate locations on the video screenand on the instrument within the visual field. We have concluded from these experiencesthat the robotic technology will continue to reduce costs andminimize risk for patients undergoing minimally invasive surgicalprocedures; moreover, safety, versatility, and diminished useof resources will accrue utilizing the additive benefit of sequentialsophisticated technologies requiring a simultaneous educationalinvestment in team development. Further, we conclude that withfurther development that voice activation and instrument trackingof robotically enhanced minimally invasive surgical procedureswill improve efficiency, effectiveness, and will diminish risk,resource utilization and cost. INTRODUCTION Surgical care of patients has heretofore enjoyedimproved quality of care and diminished risk to patients due tocontinuous technological advancements and similar improvementsfor the operating room environment. Improvement associated withsophisticated technology has, however, historically been associatedwith an increase in resource utilization (most often measuredby increased cost). The current medical economic environment,however, tends to slow the progress elucidated by technology dueto the intense focus on minimizing cost and resource utilizationin the healthcare environment. As a result, new and evolving technologycarries a new burden; not only must the technology improve theefficiency and productivity of the surgeon and simultaneouslydecrease risk to the patient but it must also reduce cost and/orresource utilization in order to be considered a viable productfor the current surgical operating theater. In an attempt to address this issue, we have chosento use robotic arm enhancement as the key technology to reducecost in the operating theater while simultaneously diminishingpatient risk and improving productivity and quality of patientcare. The robotic arm is most often used in minimally invasivesurgery to hold the laparoscope and camera. It moves the visualsurgical field with precision under the direct control of thesurgeon1. Thus, one personnel resource (a physician'sassistant or assistant surgeon) is no longer required for theoperative procedure allowing the individual to provide healthcare for other patients. Further, control of the visual fieldby the surgeon diminishes the need for communication between personneland improves the focus and concentration of the surgeon. Moreover,the robotic arm maintains the optical field stable and motionlessproviding the surgeon with an environment for improved precisionand efficiency during the surgical task(s). A further benefitof the stable, motionless image occurs in conjunction with theuse of the robotic arm and 3-D technology for minimally invasiveprocedures. The motionless image improves the quality of the 3-Dimage dramatically when compared to the hand-held 3-D image. Thus,the cumulative benefit of two technologies enhances the visualfield with resultant improved quality and efficiency by the surgeonas well as a concomitant diminution in the risk of error duringthe procedural tasks. Other sophisticated technologies which synergisticallyimprove efficiency and thereby diminish risk as well as shortenoperating time (with a commensurate decrease in costs or operatingroom utilization) include the Head-Mounted Display (HMD), theHarmonic Scalpel, and the Zoom Camera Lens. The HMD provides the surgeon with a relaxed positionand binocular vision thus further improving the stability of thevisual surgical image2. The HMD specifically allowsthe surgeon to always work in a normal hand-eye axis thus avoidinginefficient and dangerous paradoxic motion3. It alsoenhances the benefits of 3-D technology with the addition of binocularvision4 providing a circumstance to further improveefficiency and decrease risk thus improving outcome. The Harmonic Scalpel is a versatile laparoscopicinstrument which cuts, coagulates, acts as a retractor, grasper,pointer, sharp dissector, and blunt dissector5. Itsuse diminishes instrument exchanges and thereby increases thefocus of the surgeon, diminishes the need for intermittently changingoperative visual fields for instrument exchange, with resultantcumulative benefits in the areas of efficiency, operative time,patient risk, and ultimate resource utilization. The zoom camera lens adds the opportunity for thesurgical operative field to be a fish-eye panoramic view versusa very close detailed view being under the direct control of thesurgeon and changeable by the turn of a switch. This added versatilityin the size of the visual field adds a magnitude of versatilityto the use of the robotic arm. The robotic arm technology currently is controlledby the surgeon with a foot pedal. While the foot pedal providesreasonable control by the surgeon, other foot pedals compete forspace and attention in the operating theater. Other forms of controland activation of the robotic arm and subsequent control of thevisual field would seem to be beneficial. To address these issues, we have designed a three-partstudy; the first is the performance of solo-surgeon procedures(solo-surgery) using robotic enhancement6 as the aid;the second is the cumulative and synergistic benefits of multiplesophisticated technologies (along with the robotic arm) to enhanceefficiency in complex minimally invasive procedures; and the thirdphase is to investigate the use of prototype instrument trackingand voice activation to control the robotic arm and subsequentlycontrol the visual laparoscopic field of view. METHODS Phase I: We performed solo-surgeon surgery for 24patients who were electively undergoing either laparoscopic herniarepair, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or laparoscopic nissen fundoplication.In all cases, solo-surgery was defined as "performance ofthe operative procedure without the help of an assistant, a nurse,or another surgeon." The scrub nurse did not help the surgeonduring the procedure. In all cases, the time of the operativeprocedure, operative technical mishaps, and the number of occasionsthat the laparoscope was removed from the abdomen to clean thetip were recorded. The laparoscope was affixed to the roboticarm in all cases and control of the robotic arm, the laparoscope,and the subsequent optical surgical field of view were controlledby the surgeon using a foot pedal control. These data were comparedto similar data collected from patients undergoing these threeminimally invasive procedures in circumstances in which roboticarm enhancement was not used and the surgery was not performedby solo-surgeon. During each of the laparoscopic solo-surgeon procedures,a second surgeon or a Physician's Assistant was immediately availableto help the solo-surgeon in circumstances of necessity. Phase II: To assess the cumulative benefits of therobotic arm plus other sophisticated technologies in improvingefficiency during highly complex minimally invasive surgical procedures,we utilized robotic arm enhancement plus a combination of HMD,3-D Optics, the fish-eye Zoom Lens, the Harmonic Scalpel, andthe ergonomic sitting position during 140 elective procedures.The procedural experiences were laparoscopic anterior spine surgery(24 cases), laparoscopic gastric surgery (28 cases), and laparoscopiccolon resection (88 cases). The number of operative technicalmishaps, the category of the first assistant (surgeon vs. physician'sassistant), and the number of times the scope was removed to cleanthe tip were recorded. These data were compared to comparabledata recorded for patients undergoing these procedures in theabsence of sophisticated technologies. Phase III: The porcine model was used to study instrumenttracking and voice activation of the robotic arm in order to movethe operative field of view by the surgeon. For instrument tracking,computer activation of a color sensor by a blue tape on the shaftof the surgeon's instrument in the operative field was used. Oncethe field of view was moved to a new location by the device trackingthe blue shaft on the surgeon's instrument, the tracking was de-activated.Complex laparoscopic skills were performed including running thebowel, suturing, tying, and dissecting adhesions using the instrumenttracking device. The ability or inability to move the visual fieldappropriately during the performance of complex skills was recorded.To determine the ability of voice activation to control the operativefield of view using the robotic arm, the surgeon imprinted thefollowing words on the voice activation device: "in","out", "left", "right", "up","down", "stop". The use of each command activatedthe robotic arm to move the visual field in the direction describedby the command. The command "stop" de-activated therobot resulting in a stable motionless field of view. Complexlaparoscopic tasks were again used during activation and de-activationusing voice commands. RESULTS Solo-Surgery: The 24 patients who underwent solo-surgeryusing robotic arm enhancement and minimally invasive approachall experienced successful completion of their operative procedures.There were no incidents of technical mishap in any of the procedures.The cholecystectomy procedures had an average operating time of54 minutes compared to 61 minutes for other laparoscopic cholecystectomypatients. The solo-surgery laparoscopic herniorrhaphy procedureshad an operative time of 76 minutes compared to 84 minutes fornon-solo surgeon laparoscopic herniorrhaphy procedures. The solo-surgerylaparoscopic nissen fundoplication procedures had an average operatingtime of 112 minutes compared to an operating time of 160 minutesfor comparable non-solo surgery operative procedures. The numberof times the laparoscope required cleaning per 60-minute intervalfor cases involving solo-surgery and the robotic arm were 1.4compared to 9.1 per 60-minute interval for comparable cases whenthe robotic arm was not used. Complex Laparoscopic Procedures Using CumulativeSophisticated Technologies: Of the 140 patients undergoing complexminimally invasive surgery utilizing a combination of roboticarm enhancement, the Harmonic Scalpel, the Head-Mounted Display,3-D technology, and the ergonomic sitting position all were successfullycompleted utilizing the minimally invasive approach. There wereno technical mishaps either related or unrelated to the technologies.Operating times were 155 minutes for gastric procedures, 153 minutesfor colectomy procedures, and 125 minutes for anterior spine procedures.Each being comparable to operative times for comparable procedureswhen not using the additive benefits of these technologies. Theaverage number of times the laparoscope was removed to clean itstip per 60-minute interval during these procedures was 1.0 comparedto 7.7 per 60-minute interval for comparable procedures when notusing the robotic arm technology. Instrument Tracking and Voice Activation: The useof the instrument tracking mechanism to move the visual operativefield by a color-coded instrument shaft was entirely successfulutilizing motions to the left, to the right, in an upward direction,or a downward direction. However, the ability of the instrumenttracking mechanism to move the field inward and outward was lesssuccessful. Further, the use of complex skills with instrumentationall were successfully accomplished when the tracking was inactivated.However, if the surgeon required movement of the visual fieldduring the performance of a complex skill utilizing this instrumentation,then instrument tracking was unable to accomplish movement ofthe visual field. Voice activation of the robotic arm to accomplishmovement of the visual operative field of view was entirely successful.Motions to the right and left, up and down, as well as in andout, were all successfully accomplished with ease. However, twovoice commands were always necessary; the command to start themotion of the robotic arm and the command to "stop".Further, the use of voice activation as a mechanism to move thevisual field in small increments when necessary - especially duringperformance of laparoscopic complex skills, provided a solutionto movement of the visual field during the performance of skillswith the surgeon's instruments. DISCUSSION The use of the robotic arm to enhance minimally invasiveoperative procedures is identified and delineated in these studiesin a variety of ways. Use of robotics to enhance the opportunityfor a surgeon to perform solo-surgery without increasing the lengthof the operative procedures is delineated in Phase I of our studyusing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic hernia repair,and laparoscopic nissen fundoplication. Further, there were notechnical mishaps and no technical complications either relatedor unrelated. This data diminishes cost and resource utilizationby allowing either a surgeon-first assistant or a physician'sassistant to not be utilized, thus allowing these medical personnelto be free to perform other healthcare interventions for otherpatients. It should be noted that no additional equipment wasrequired to perform solo-surgery, thus the resource "trade-off"is the robotic arm in exchange for versatile medical personnel. In circumstances in which laparoscopic nissen fundoplicationand cholecystectomy were performed utilizing the solo-surgeonmethodology, the procedures usually involve four ports (cholecystectomy)or five ports (nissen fundoplication). In these circumstances,there are often three personnel participating in the operativeprocedure. These include the surgeon, the first assistant andthe camera holder. As a result, these latter two procedures mayactually be modified by the solo-surgeon concept in order to exchangetwo medical personnel for a modified preoperative setup and roboticarm enhancement. The solo-surgeon experiences have raised two importantissues to the surgeon's consciousness. The first is that the useof the robotic arm diminishes the number of occasions per 60-minuteinterval that the laparoscope must be removed and cleaned at thetip. Since each occasion of removal and defogging uses time andalso defocuses the surgeon, then the reduction in these cleaningmaneuvers should result in a shortening of the operative timeas well as diminishing risk due to defocusing of the surgeon'sattention during a procedure. Further, since the robotic arm holdsthe position of the scope and the surgeon's optical field of viewmotionless and perfectly stationary, it allows for a much morestable and concentrated field of view for the surgeon to work.This phenomenon would seem to eventually translate into shortenedoperating time, increased concentration, decreased fatigue, anda diminution in risk of operative error. The use of the robotic arm to enhance the efficiencyand safety of complex minimally invasive procedures along withthe synergistic benefits of other sophisticated technologies clearlyis practical and imminently possible. In our series, the additionof multiple complex technologies did not lengthen the operativeprocedures and did not result in technical mishaps. Further, thereduction of medical personnel from three individuals to two personnelinvariably occurred diminishing cost and human resource utilization.The robotic arm itself maintained a stable and motionless operativefield for the surgeon throughout the cases and minimized the numberof scope cleaning events. Both of these factors increased theconcentration and focus of the surgeon providing continuity tothe procedure without interruption. The use of the HMD in allcircumstances allowed the surgeon to maintain a normal hand-eyeaxis allowing the work to be in front of the surgeon with his/hervisual field exactly in the same plane as the laparoscopic procedurebeing performed. This benefit diminished fatigue, accommodateda non-paradoxical approach to the procedural tasks and eliminatedthe risks and inefficiencies associated with paradoxical motion(either related to a disparity in the location of the visual monitoror a disparity in the location of the relationship between thesurgeon and his work7). A further benefit perceived by the surgeon when usingthe HMD is the binocular vision which occurs because of the dualliquid crystal displays in the HMD. The left-sided display providesa visual field for the left eye and the right-sided display providesa visual field for the right eye. This binocular vision givesthe surgeon a perception of depth and allows the eyes to fix ona very distant focal point to reduce eye fatigue. When coupledwith 3-D technology, the HMD brings the surgeon binocular visionand depth. As a result, a "normal" three-dimensionalfield is perceived as opposed to an "exaggerated" three-dimensionalfield as perceived when the active 3-D glasses are used alongwith the 3-D active monitor. It might also be noted that the costof the HMD in exchange for the active 3-D glasses and the 3-Dmonitor provides a major savings as well as technical safety andefficiency. Three-dimensional technology itself adds depth tothe visual operative field diminishing the risk of technical errorinherent when working in a two-dimensional field. Further, thesurgeon is not required to spend time and excess motions developingtactile clues to accommodate for the lack of depth in the two-dimensionalfield. This phenomenon can be translated into shorter operatingtimes. The Harmonic Scalpel (LCS) adds a subsequent degreeof increased efficiency and diminished risk to the aforementionedtechnologies during complex minimally invasive surgical procedures.The LCS is a highly versatile instrument which cuts, coagulates,retracts, grasps, and bluntly dissects8. Therefore,its versatility diminishes cost in three separate ways: it eliminatesthe need for a variety of other instruments; it diminishes thenumber of instrument exchanges performed during a complex procedure,and it uses ultrasonic energy to cut and coagulate rather thanusing monopolar cautery. The use of the LCS eliminates the needfor endoscopic scissors, endoscopic multiple clip applier, monopolarcautery, cautery line, and grounding pad. Elimination of theseitems reduced direct costs. The reduction in instrument exchangesmaintains the surgeon's focus on the procedure and diminishesthe waste of time and loss of concentration which occurs to theoperating team during instrument exchanges. Lastly, the eliminationof the risk of monopolar cautery when using the LCS may be translatedto decreased cost due to decreased risk. The use of a foot pedal to control the robotic armand the subsequent operative field of view laparoscopically incomplex minimally invasive surgical procedures presents a ratherunique experience. At one extreme, many complex procedures (subtotalcolectomies, gastric resections, trauma cases) require movementof the surgeon from one portion of the torso to another. The necessityof surgeon mobility detracts from the effectiveness and efficiencyof the robotic foot pedal. On the other hand, many long complexminimally invasive procedures are benefited from placing the surgeonin the ergonomically beneficial sitting position which diminishesthe effective use of the foot pedal. Further, most surgeons haveother foot pedals as part of their procedure including eitherthe Harmonic Scalpel foot pedal or the cautery foot pedal. Thepotential for increased complexity involving the robotic footpedal tends to diminish efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore,we have attempted to utilize computerized instrument trackingand voice activation as alternative methods to direct the surgicalfield of view by way of the robotic arm. These experiences havedelineated that the use of a blue color activated tracking systemon the shaft of an instrument accomplishes efficient movementof the field of view to left and right as well as up and down.However, a number of movements are not successfully accomplishedby instrument tracking. First, the "in" and "out"positions require a command other than instrument tracking. Secondly,an additional command is required to de-activate instrument trackingin order for the surgeon to utilize his instrument for a technicaltask while simultaneously holding the field of view steady. Inaddition, once the instrument tracking system has been de-activatedand the surgeon is using his instruments for a technical task,the requirement for a small or moderate alteration in the visualfield to accommodate the surgeon cannot be accomplished by instrumenttracking because the instruments are being used for the surgicaltask. Therefore, an additional command is necessary in this lattercircumstance. The addition of a prototype voice activation systemallows the surgeon to move the field of view inward and outward.It also provides the opportunity to deactivate and reactivatethe instrument tracking system. Finally, the voice activationand voice command may be used to accomplish fine movements whileperforming a delicate surgical task with the instruments. We believethis combination of control devices will further improve efficiencyand versatility of the robotic arm to enhance minimally invasivesurgical procedures. These data delineate that each of the technologiesdescribed improve safety, diminish resource utilization, improveefficiency and versatility for the surgeon, and are clearly usablesynergistically together to maximize the benefits for the patient.The authors strongly believe that further investigations to studythe details of each of these technologies and their respectivebenefits are urgent and necessary.

Printed in U.S.A. Urologists At Work COMPARISON OF ROBOTIC VERSUS HUMAN LAPAROSCOPICCAMERA CONTROL LOUIS R. KAVOUSSI, ROBERT G. MOORE, JOHNB. ADAMS AND ALAN W. PARTIN From the Brady Urological Institute, JohnsHopkins Bayview Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland ABSTRACT Purpose: We investigated the accuracyand use of a robotic surgical arm compared to a human surgicalassistant during urological laparoscopic surgery. Materials and Methods: A total of 11 patients undergoingpelvic laparoscopic procedures that required identical bilateralsurgical manipulations was evaluated. On 1 side a robotic surgicalarm was used to manipulate the laparoscopic camera, while on thecontralateral side the camera was positioned by a human surgicalassistant. The side (left versus right) on which the robot wasused was alternated with each case. Parameters assessed includedoperative time, erroneous camera motions, complications and outcome. Results: All procedures were successfully completedwithout complications. Laparoscopic camera positioning was significantlysteadier with less inadvertent movements when under robotic control(p < 0.0005). Operative times during dissections using therobot or human assistant were not statistically different. Conclusions: A robotic device can more effectivelymanipulate and accurately control the video endoscope than a humanassistant during laparoscopic procedures. KEY WORDS: robotics, laparoscopy, endoscopy,lymph node excision, urinary incontinence Robots have been a growing part of the manufacturingindustry for the last 30 years. Their service has proved the benefitof using an untiring machine to perform precise repetitive tasksin environments that at times may be uncomfortable or dangerousfor humans.1 Computer integrated manufacturing usesrobotic automation to produce quality products that can be easilyupdated through programming changes. Robots can outperform humansin several tasks resulting in a decreased rate at which productsare rejected due to imperfections.2 These characteristicshave demonstrated that robots, in proper applications, have asignificant economic advantage compared to human workers. Recently, robots built specifically for medical applicationshave been introduced. However, little data are available in assessingtheir use compared to standard practice.3-6 One suchcategory includes robots that hold and position the endoscopeduring laparoscopic surgery.4-6 Currently, this taskrequires a dedicated individual for each procedure. A preliminaryassessment was done to compare the performance of a robotic devicewith traditional assistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated 11 patients undergoing a laparoscopicurological operation. Eight men who were at high risk for metastaticprostate cancer (prostate specific antigen more than 20 ng./ml.,Gleason score more than 7) underwent diagnostic laparoscopic pelviclymphadenectomy according to a previously reported technique.7Three women with true stress urinary incontinence underwent laparoscopicBurch bladder suspension according to the technique describedby Polascik et al.8 No patient had undergone priortransperitoneal pelvic surgery. Surgery was performed similarlyon the right and left sides of the pelvis. Accepted for publication August 18, 1995. Assessment of camera control was standardized foreach procedure. For the pelvic lymph node dissection, evaluationwas begun at the incision of the peritoneum overlying the iliacvessels, and was terminated once all nodal tissue was removedand hemostasis was achieved. Any adhesions were incised beforeinitiating assessment and timing. During the bladder suspension,the retropubic space was first completely dissected free and bothCooper's ligaments were exposed before the evaluation. Assessmentwas initiated once the first suture was passed into the abdomenand was completed when the last suture on each side was tied. The laparoscopic camera was controlled by eitherthe operating surgeon using a robot* or by a human surgical assistant.The surgeon controlled the robot via a foot pedal. The surgicalassistant moved the camera independently or based on voice commandsfrom the surgeon. The side (left versus right) in which the roboticarm was used was alternated for each case. All surgical assistantshad experience holding a camera in at least 5 cases. The surgicalteam used the robotic arm in the laboratory and gained experiencewith 3 clinical cases before initiating the study. Camera control was evaluated by 1 blinded individual(L.R.K.) who reviewed videotapes in a random order and completedstandardized data sheets after all 11 procedures had been completed.Parameters assessed included interval to complete each side ofthe procedure, contact of the laparoscopic lens with internalorgans, unintentional camera motions (planar or in and out),unintentional camera rotation, unintentional camera disconnection,complications and outcomes. The operating surgeon completed asurvey to assess subjectively the performance of the robotic armcompared to the surgical assistant. The robotic arm was ratedas worse than, better than or equal to the assistant. To assess any additional time required to set up the robot in the operating room, operating room setup and breakdowntimes were measured. Setup time was defined as the interval fromthe time when the patient entered the operating room until laparoscopycommenced. Breakdown time was the interval from completion ofsurgery to when the patient left the operating room. These timeswere compared to the setup and breakdown times in 8 contemporarypatients undergoing pelvic laparoscopic procedures (lymphadenectomyin 5, bladder suspension in 2 and varix ligation in 1) in whichthe robotic arm was not used. The paired Student t test was usedfor statistical analysis. *AESOP, Computer Motion, Goleta, California. RESULTS All procedures were completed successfully. In noinstance did robotic camera control have to be converted to humanassistant control. There were no intraoperative or early postoperativecomplications. The average number of times that the laparoscopecame under contact with instruments or adjacent organs was statisticallygreater for the assistant (human 2.4 Â± 2.2, range 0 to 8versus robot 0.7 Â± 0.9, range 0 to 3, p < 0.01). Inadvertentmovements of the laparoscope occurred an average of 4 Â± 1times per case when a human operated the camera (range 2 to 5)compared to 1.6 Â± 1.2 times for the robotic controlled side(range 0 to 4, p < 0.0005). Inadvertent rotation of the cameraoccurred 2.2 Â± 1.3 times per case (range 0 to 4) with humancontrol compared to 0.1 Â± 0.3 times per case (range 0 to1) with robotic manipulation (p < 0.0009). The video endoscopedisengaged from the robotic arm once during the 11 cases. The mean surgical time for each side was not significantlydifferent (p > 0.05) for either the bladder neck suspensionsor pelvic lymphadenectomies (human 26.3 Â± 8.4 minutes versusrobot 24.9 Â± 8.2 minutes). When comparing the study patientsto the 8 patients undergoing pelvic laparoscopy without the robot,neither setup time (no robot 48 Â± 12 minutes versus robot42 Â± 12 minutes) nor breakdown time (no robot 9.5 Â±2 minutes versus robot 12.4 Â± 6 minutes) was statisticallydifferent (p > 0.05). Subjective assessment by the operating surgeon revealedthat the robot performed better than the assistant in 6 cases,equal in 4 and worse in 1. The instance in which the robotic armwas rated inferior was during case 2, in which the operating surgeonbelieved that the great difficulty with dissection required frequentmovement of the camera. In the last 5 cases the robotic arm waspreferable to the assistant. DISCUSSION Although often overlooked as a factor in the practiceof surgery, there are diverse physical and psychological abilitiesamong individual physicians.9 Differences exist insteadiness of the hand, agility, rapidity, preferences and surgicalknowledge. Moreover, surgeon performance may vary during the courseof a given procedure, when operating on different patients orduring the professional lifetime. Studies have demonstrated thatsurgical complications decrease with experience but to our knowledgeno data exist to assess the effects of individual differenceson ultimate patient results.10,11 These factors mayaccount for deviations noted when comparing surgical outcome studiesfrom different investigators. A method to help standardize surgical outcomes wouldpotentially be through the use of robotic systems. Many industrieshave realized the advantages of using an untiring, efficient,precise machine.1,2 In surgery, similar automated systemscould be developed to perform surgical tasks or augment physicianskills. As in industry, these systems would be advantageous inperforming maneuvers that require a high degree of accuracy orare repetitive and tedious. Moreover, robotic assistants can give the operating surgeon a greater amountof direct control during a procedure. Surgical stapling devices are an example of successfulintegration of automated systems into clinical practice. Thesetools allow surgeons to create a secure anastomosis while providingless trauma, better precision and greater rapidity than a suturedanastomosis.12-14 Although a learning curve existsfor proficiency in the use of staplers, it is shorter than thatneeded to learn a hand sewn anastomosis. Moreover, devices, suchas the end-to-end anastomosis stapler, extended the limits oflow anterior resection by enabling surgeons to perform reliableanastomoses at lower levels than technically possible with traditionalhand sewn techniques.14 As technology evolves, morecomplex automated devices will be introduced for clinical evaluation. Although the benefits and use of robotic systemshave been demonstrated industry, objective data are lacking toassess the performance in medical applications. Our study wasan initial attempt to evaluate the performance of a robotic devicecompared to traditional surgical assistance during laparoscopicprocedures. Pelvic lymphadenectomy and bladder suspension wereused, since these procedures require duplicate surgical maneuversthat are identical on each side of the pelvis. The robotic armoffered advantages compared to a human camera holder. Our methodology has several limitations. The studywas not completely blinded. Although the reviewer did not knowwhich tape showed the assistant and which showed the robot, themotions of each were readily apparent. Also, the human cameraholder knew that he or she was competing against a robot, whichbiased the study towards the assistant because competitive spiritprompted the assistant to be as effective as possible. Indeed,we subjectively noted a marked improvement in camera holder performanceduring the study. Despite this finding, the robot outperformedthe human based on all examined criteria. Moreover, the cameraassistant varied with each case while a singe robotic arm wasused throughout the study. The use of different assistants iscommon practice at many institutions. The operating surgeon foreach case was also variable but all were relatively inexperiencedwith use of the robotic arm. Several major technical advances are needed beforerobots become common in surgical practice. Appropriate end effectors(that is graspers, scissors and dissectors) must be created tomeet a variety of applications. The robots must be "userfriendly" with transparent robot-to-surgeon interfaces. Automateddevices must be biocompatable to avoid mechanical failure orinjury to the patient. Computer control systems and software mustbe improved to adjust for individual patient variations as wellas moment to moment changes within the surgical field. Some ofthe technology required to meet these goals already exists invarious industrial and military applications. Of greatest importance is the assessment of thesedevices compared to traditional approaches. It must be provedfor each robotic tool that the ability of a surgeon to treat asurgical disease is enhanced. Operative times, surgical results,convalescence and morbidity must all be carefully appraised.Finally, these benefits must be realized in a cost-effective manner. REFERENCES 1. Hunt, V.

Here is a sampling of supportive testimony received from a wide varietyof individuals who use AESOP in their daily practice. John B. Adams, MD, Urologist, Asst. Prof. of Surgery/Urology,Head of Endourology Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia. "I have found that AESOP gives the surgeon more controlof the operative (laparascopic) fields while providing steadyand precise visualization of the area being examined. It cutsthe operative team in laparoscopy to a maximum of two. I alsofind it untiring and it does not complain." Robert W. Bailey, MD, FACS, General Surgeon, Division Headof General Surgery, Greater Baltimore Medical Center, Baltimore,Maryland. "What I most appreciate about AESOP is the steadypicture. Another great advantage is that it allows for more directsurgeon control. The elimination of one assistant in the OR, freeingthem to provide more sophisticated patient services is an addedplus." William A. Barber, MD, FACS, General Surgeon, Chief - GeneralSurgery Service, Chairman Endoscopic Surgery Committee, PiedmontHospital, Atlanta, Georgia. "I consider AESOP to be an important tool in the OperatingRoom because it allows me to use my left hand to operate, holdsthe camera still and allows more room for the surgeon to operateduring a lap nissen. AESOP eliminates the need for an additionalperson in the OR and, over time, it saves money." Howard L. Beaton, MD, FACS, General Surgeon, Chief of Surgery,New York Downtown Hospital, New York, New York. "After in-servicing, we found AESOP easy to set upand use. The image is steady at all times, without the shifting,rotations, etc., that are common when the laparoscope is heldby hand. We have been able to eliminate the need for a secondassistant at the OR table to hold the camera. This means moreroom around the operating table and will result in significantsavings. I think that it is a significant advancement in laparoscopicsurgical technology and I am pleased that it is available to surgeonsat New York Downtown Hospital." Norman B. Halpern, MD, General Surgeon, Professor and Chief,Surgical Endoscopy, University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama. "Robotic technology is probably under-utilized andunder-appreciated by most clinicians. AESOP is a fine exampleof how we can utilize developments and accomplishments in otherdisciplines to enhance activities in our own specialty." Harriman H. Jett, MD, FACS, General Surgeon, Carolina Surgicalclinic of Charlotte, P.A., Charlotte, North Carolina. "I have found the AESOP robotic arm extremely valuablein the performance of my laparoscopic surgical procedures in thatI have complete control over the field of view without havingto verbalize any command to an assistant. The image that is beingvisualized is also perfectly still with the exception of the patient'sheartbeat and rhythmic respirations. This lack of outside-inducedmotion allows much more precision with my surgery. The qualityof what I am seeing also does not vary from case to case inasmuchas I have complete control over the system and variations arenot produced by various human assistants with varying technicalskills. "With the AESOP robotic arm, my laparoscopic surgery requiresonly one sterile assistant to handle the instruments. This isvery important in this era of medicine when "cost savings"have cut down the available staffing in the operating room. Thereis a short learning curve to become familiar with the controlsbut as soon as these skills are acquired, then operation of AESOPbecomes essentially automatic." Ronald Latimer, MD, FACS, General Surgeon, Cottage Hospital,Santa Barbara, California. "The robot frees up the surgeon's hand so he can operatewith it instead of holding the scope. Also, AESOP is very difficultto distract." Duncan Turner, MD, MB, BS, FACOG, Gynecologist, Director ofGynecologic Surgery De La Vina Surgicenter Medical Group, SantaBarbara, California. "I have found AESOP to be a distinctive advantagein the operating room. It frees an arm of the surgeon, or assistant,to enable surgery more easily, the picture is steadier than whenheld by hand, and the programmable positions are very convenient.I do not like having to operate without this wonderful piece oftechnology." Ronald Woodard, MD, Obstetrician/Gynecologist, Verdugo HillsHospital, Glendale, California. "AESOP can also reduce eye strain from having to followa motion picture, since it holds the scope stationary. It alsomay reduce the need for an assistant for some surgeries."

Not only does it hold the camera steady and mount easily onto the bed, but the cost is less than a CST salary. It improves the operating room environment by helping to free up hands." Blanca Elder, RN, Clinical Laser Nurse, Providence Memorial Hospital, El Paso, Texas. "I value the AESOP robot because it increases staff productivity by eliminating the need for a camera holding person. I think we all appreciate the stable video image it maintains." Bob Harding, RN, Director of Surgical Services, San Ramon Regional Medical Center, San Ramon, California. "I anticipate operating a more cost-efficient department with the AESOP. Rather than eliminating full-time employees (FTE's) from the surgical staff, I plan to have my staff focus their attention on other tasks. Based on our current caseload, I estimate the AESOP will save at least 50 hours of nursing care a month on endoscopic cases. "Such cost savings and efficiencies are particularly important issues in the face of healthcare reform. I think we're in a situation with managed care and per-diem rates and capitation that we're going to have to do everything possible to decrease costs on a per-case basis. I think one of the things that will be affected by this is that more and more cases are going to be done without assistant surgeons because they're no longer going to be paid. "I expect it to fall to me to supply a staff member to hold the laparoscope and assist the surgeon, or to find an alternative method of doing that. For me, the AESOP is the logical alternative. It's going to be beneficial to the physician because he's going to be able to control it. It's going to be steady. He can go forward. He can pan the entire abdomen. He can go in for a close shot. He can try a different angle, and he's always got his landmarks because of the memory." Sue Sherman, RN, Director of Surgical Services, Valley Community Hospital, Santa Maria, California. "For me the primary benefit of AESOP is that is frees up the camera holder to do other jobs during procedures such as the lap chole, which is a very labor intensive procedure. It is also beneficial in that it is preparing surgeons and staff to utilize computer assistance for solo-surgery at a time when a first-rate physician will no longer be available. Further it is an excellent PR tool. We can market our facility as having "state-of-the-art" equipment. This heightens public perception of our organization." Kay Stansell, RN, Endoscopy Charge Nurse, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia. "We find AESOP to be a marvelous staffing solution for camera holding during endoscopy. It solved another related problem for us by eliminating multiple staff complaints regarding carpal tunnel syndrome, neck and shoulder pain related to camera holding. Additionally, it eliminates overtime payments for late procedures."

The Voice of the Future Shaun Cleary, Director of US Sales Bronwyn Byron, RN, BSN, CNOR Focus on Laparoscopic Sigmoid Colon Resection Computer Motion Events On the International Front Computer Motion Partnering in MI Cardiac Computer Motion announced the formation of clinical development partnerships with The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Penn State Universityï¿½s Hershey Medical Center and Sarasota Memorial Hospital. These institutions have agreed to help perfect the companyï¿½s robotically assisted microsurgery systems and participate in the studies necessary for the systems to receive FDA clearance. These systems will be used in minimally invasive cardiac surgery procedures such as the Endoscopic Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (E-CABG), to allow multiple vessel coronary artery bypass grafting through holes smaller than the diameter of a pencil. Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United States and most industrialized nations. More than 700,000 coronary artery bypass grafts and 200,000 heart valve replacements are performed annually worldwide. Greater than 99 percent of these procedures are performed as open-heart surgeries as todayï¿½s technology is not capable of supporting the clinical demands of a fully endoscopic surgical approach. Computer Motionï¿½s robotically assisted microsurgical systems enable surgeons to videoscopically perform delicate, precise surgical maneuvers through endoscopic ports. With the assistance of robotics, new procedures such as the E-CABG will be performed safely and with consistent high quality. Dr. Yulun Wang, Computer Motionï¿½s Chief Technical Officer and Founder, believes that "computers and robotics can enhance the surgeonï¿½s dexterity in the same way that the microscope enhances the surgeonï¿½s ability to view the detail of small objects." "We are seeing the proliferation of minimally invasive techniques in all the surgical specialties, including cardiac surgery. The benefits cannot be ignored ï¿½ shorter hospital stays, decreased pain for patients and faster recovery times," said Joseph F. Hahn, MD, Chairman of The Cleveland Clinic Foundationï¿½s Division of Surgery. "However, as we work with smaller incisions and smaller vessels, we test the limits of human physical capabilities and require the assistance of new technology, such as Computer Motionï¿½s robotically assisted microsurgical systems." "With conventional surgical instruments, we are not able to achieve an acceptable method for treating multiple vessel coronary artery disease in an endoscopic fashion," said Ralph J. Damiano, MD, Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Penn State Universityï¿½s Hershey Medical Center. "However, with the advent of computer controlled medical robotics, we now have a platform of technology that will enable us to devise innovative minimally invasive procedures to reduce the morbidity and cost associated with these operations." Thomas M. Krummel, MD, a John W. Oswald Professor and Chairman of the Department of Surgery at Penn State Universityï¿½s Hershey Medical Center commented, "This buildson our long standing commitment to technology development and validation to enhance our missions of patient care, education, research and service." Michael Rowan, Chief Operating Officer of Sarasota Memorial Hospital, stated, "Over the past year we have studied the opportunities for realistic success in minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafts. We believe that robotic surgery offers the best opportunity to marry advanced technology with our surgeonï¿½s skills to make the clinical leap to successful minimally invasive cardiac surgery that can be duplicated in centers around the country." James L. Cox, MD, Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine, said, "I believe that the use of robotically assisted microsurgical systems in minimally invasive cardiac surgery will advance our surgical capabilities far beyond anything that is now possible. Never has the future of cardiac surgery been more promising or exciting, largely because of innovations such as this one by Computer Motion." Return to Top Message from the President Gene Wang As we end 1996, Computer Motion has made considerable progress as a company. We have doubled our size, released a great new product ï¿½ AESOP 2000 with Voice Control ï¿½ and refined our vision for the coming years. Through these changes, our mission remains unchanged ï¿½ to enhance the surgeonï¿½s capabilities, improve outcomes and reduce costs using computers and robotics. In the years ahead, we will expand our product line, while maintaining our focus on leadership in medical robotics. Minimally invasive surgery, Computer Motion's primary target market, has experienced two explosive growth periods within the surgical subspecialties of arthroscopy and laparoscopy. Medical experts agree that the next huge MIS growth opportunity exists in the cardiac surgery market. Computer Motion will enable the next frontier in MI cardiac surgery with robotically assisted microsurgical systems. These systems, code named "ZEUS", will empower surgeons to fully perform cardiac procedures endoscopically via improved anatomical access, enhanced patient-to-surgeon ergonomics and unparalleled dexterity and precision. The Company has partnered with some of the worldï¿½s leading heart institutions (see front page article) to perfect and commercialize these robotic systems. In todayï¿½s managed care environment, OR's must become more efficient and less costly. Computer Motion will help optimize the OR by providing surgeons with an easy way to directly control their OR. The Companyï¿½s Surgeon Control Center, code named "HERMES", will integrate key medical devices in the OR into a network which can be commanded by the surgeonï¿½s voice, mitigating the need for a member of the surgical team to manually control these devices. We are excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead as we evolve into the Operating Room of the Future. We remain committed to serving our customers around the world, and appreciate your continued support. Return to Top Voice Control and the OR of the Future Computer Motion is committed to the development, marketing and support of advanced technologies that are shaping the Operating Room of the future. With AESOP 2000 we have successfully integrated several advanced technologies, including robotic enhancement, audio feedback and voice control. Going forward, we are aggressively developing new robotic and computer enhanced technologies for integration into future products. Our vision for the OR of the future includes the seamless integration of robotic tools to enhance the surgeon's capabilities, an intuitive and responsive surgeon-to-OR interface providing direct surgeon control, and an underlying information network which allows data from all OR devices to be shared. The voice control interface of the AESOP 2000 enables the surgeon to use spoken commands to precisely position a laparoscope. Spoken language is the most natural and efficient form of human communication. Surgeons have overwhelmingly shown their preference for the voice interface and have demonstrated its efficiency in the OR using AESOP 2000. Although voice recognition technology has evolved to the point where a number of non-medical voice recognition products are commercially available, the design criteria for the surgical environment requires a unique combination of rapid recognition speed and reliability. As the first company to obtain clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for its custom OR compatible voice recognition software and hardware, Computer Motion is in fact the leader in this field. Computer Motion is now applying its core technical competencies to develop a complete Surgeon Control Center for the OR of the future. This system will integrate numerous OR devices over the next few years, as part of the surgeon-to-OR interface. Devices that can be effectively integrated into this system include: cameras, light sources, insufflators, room lights, still recorders, video recorders and telephones. The Surgeon Control Center will make it possible to place these devices further from the surgical field, thus reducing clutter in the OR. Control and status information will be provided through a consistent and intuitive user interface and personnel movement within the OR will become more efficient. The introduction of Computer Motionï¿½s Surgeon Control Center will significantly enhance the surgeonï¿½s relationship with the OR and the capabilities of OR devices by establishing a common user interface and information network. This represents an important step in the development of the OR of the Future. Return to Top AESOP 2000... The Voice of the Future AESOP 2000 is the worldï¿½s first FDA cleared, voice controlled surgical robot. It employs state-of-the-art speech recognition technology to raise the surgeon-to-machine interface to an unparalleled level. The voice control interface of AESOP 2000 dramatically decreases the learning curve for this sophisticated technology, placing its empowering benefits within the reach of every endoscopic surgeon. Prior to using AESOP 2000, the surgeon participates in a brief training session to allow the system to adapt to the nuances of the surgeon's voice. The surgeon is prompted by the voice training computer to repeat the words that make up the AESOP command set (the lexicon). The data from this session is then synthesized to create models of the surgeon's voice and saved on a Personal Voice Card (PVC). During use, the surgeon puts the robot in Command Mode by saying "AESOP." Once in Command Mode, the surgeon can verbally direct the laparoscope using one or more of the 25 verbal commands. During minimally invasive procedures, this allows the surgeon to remain focused on the video monitor, while controlling the operative field of view. Through the use of speech recognition technology, Computer Motion has brought the utility of robotics to every surgical suite. AESOP 2000 provides technology to truly enhance the surgeon's capabilities and empower the surgical team of the future. Return to Top Shaun Cleary, Director of US Sales Shaun Cleary, our Director of US Sales, identified his personal mission while in college, "To develop and deliver technology that improves the efficiency and efficacy of healthcare providers." His studies in medicine led him to the realization that there were significant challenges ahead in the healthcare field. He chose to partner with advanced technology to help meet those challenges. To gain a comprehensive grasp of the issues, Shaun studied healthcare economics, public health and hospital administration. After graduating with a BS from the University of California at Berkeley, Shaun worked with American Hospital Supply followed by five exciting years with Pyxis Corporation. Shaun was the very first salesperson at Pyxis and was promoted to General Manager for the western states. It is no surprise that Shaun is such a competent team player. At the University of California at Berkeley, he was an All American water polo player on a team that won two NCAA Championships. Shaun trained and competed with the US Olympic Water Polo Team for four years and helped his team win a Gold Medal at the Pan American Games in Indianapolis. Shaun now leads our sales team at Computer Motion. In his own words, "I am honored to be a part of this great team of talented people. I love the excitement and the problem solving associated with developing new solutions to challenges in healthcare." Shaun's enthusiasm, experience and vision will certainly aid in shaping new technology for the OR of the future. Return to Top Bronwyn Byron, RN, BSN, CNOR Our Clinical Education Specialist for the mid-Atlantic region, Bronwyn (B.B.) Byron, RN, BSN, CNOR, received her BSN from the University of Maryland and began her nursing career in the US Army. She was stationed in Landstuhl, Germany, for three years, as Assistant Head Nurse of a very busy Orthopedic ward. After she completed her active duty, B.B. returned home to Baltimore, Maryland and took her first OR position at Johns Hopkins Hospital, specializing in General Surgery and Urology. From there, she moved on to a smaller community setting where she held positions including Day-Shift Charge Nurse and Service Coordinator for Hand, Trauma and Reconstructive Surgery. In addition, B.B. performed preceptor duties, focusing on nurses without previous OR experience. She found this work particularly rewarding. It was after a life-inspiring experience (a medical mission to Guyana, South America) that B.B. decided to leave the OR to broaden her professional horizons. Later, while she was coordinating a research project at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, B.B. became very interested in robotics and was invited to join the Computer Motion team. Her extensive OR experience and dedication to education have made her a valuable team member. In her own words, "I enjoy working with the surgical staff, being a resource to them and providing quality education for a quality product." Return to Top Focus on Laparoscopic Sigmoid Colon Resection Bronwyn Byron, RN, BSN, CNOR Laparoscopic sigmoid colon resection is one of several laparoscopic bowel procedures being performed by general and colorectal surgeons today. Many laparoscopic techniques, drawn from the laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy, have been expanded and refined to be utilized in this complex procedure. These include intra-corporeal dissection, devascularization and anastomosis. Benefits The benefits of laparoscopic colon procedures are numerous compared to the traditional open colectomy. These include a faster return of bowel function and a rapid advancement towards a normal diet. Post operative pain is markedly decreased and encourages a more rapid return to normal activities. Improved cosmesis of the surgical site is also much appreciated by the patient. Ultimately, patients undergoing laparoscopic sigmoid colon resection have the opportunity to progress towards wellness significantly faster than patients who undergo the traditional open procedures. Setup For the laparoscopic sigmoid colon resection, the patient is in the lithotomy position and AESOP is placed at the left shoulder with a half tilt. Tilting AESOP is always completed prior to performing the Positioning Guide measurement and setting the Lower Limit. Tilting promotes maximum range of motion by increasing the clearance between AESOP's Elbow and the facial structures of the patient. Additional clearance can be attained by asking the anesthesia personnel to lower the profile of the patient's head by either removing (or using a smaller) pillow and turning the patient's head to the side. Once Positioning Guide #1 is aligned over the optic port site and the Lower Limit is set, AESOP is ready for draping. This procedure generally takes from 2 to 4 hours to complete, utilizing a surgical team of surgeon, first assistant, surgical technologist and AESOP. Rarely, the surgeon may reach the mechanical upper limit with AESOP (e.g., with very large patients). If and when this occurs, the solution is easy. Simply loosen the Collar and slide it down the laparoscope approximately 2-4cms. Secure the collar in that location by tightening and then re-connect to AESOP. This will provide the necessary mobility to continue, resulting in a successful case. Return to Top Computer Motion Events The American Academy of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL, September 25-29, Chicago) and American College of Surgeons (ACS, October 7-11, San Francisco) meetings were successful platforms for the introduction of our premier product AESOP 2000. The Computer Motion booth, at both events, was very popular. The in-booth presentations during ACS were so crowded that the audience spilled out into the aisles. Many physicians took the opportunity to record their AESOP 2000 Personal Voice Cards at our Technology Suites which were open during the AAGL and ACS conventions. Managing Todayï¿½s Operating Room Suite meetings (MTORS, September 11-13, Orlando and October 16-18, San Francisco) were also tremendous opportunities for surgical services directors and operating room managers to observe AESOP 2000. This year, for the first time, we attended the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference (ASRM, November 2-6, Boston). We also exhibited at the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons Endo Expo ï¿½96 meeting (SLS, December 5-7, Orlando). In early 1997, Computer Motion will exhibit at the Medicine Meets Virtual Reality Show (MMVR, January 21-25, San Diego) and the American Organization of Nurse Executives Meeting (AONE, February 22-24, Phoenix). Come visit us at one of these events.Return to Top On the International Front 1996 was a year of international growth for Computer Motion. Significant expansion occurred in the European and Asian markets with new market penetration as far south as Australia. AESOP 2000 was featured during live surgical broadcasts at numerous prestigious international congresses. This included the International Meeting on Laparoscopic Surgery in Belgium where Dr. Luc Vanderheyden of Bruges, Belgium lead the world's first telesurgery between two countries. (Dr. Peter Go made the incision on the patient in Nieuwegein, in the Netherlands.) Professor L. Mettler of Kiel, Germany performed live pelviscopy at the Academy of Gynecological Endoscopists (AGE) held in Germany. Live surgery utilizing AESOP 2000 was performed by Dr. Masahiro Ohgami at Keio Hospital and broadcast to the Japanese Society for Endoscopic Surgery (JSES) in Tokyo. Dr. Seigo Kitano of Oita assisted in the surgery from JSES via tele-mentoring using the AESOP Telesurgery system. Many presentations were given at these congresses by members of our Advisory Board and other highly regarded physicians on AESOP, telesurgery and the role of robotic technology in developing the OR of the future. We continue to develop our relationships with several training centers, particularly focusing on the European Institute of Telesurgery (EITS) in Strasbourg, France and the European Surgical Institute (Ethicon) in Norderstedt, Germany. International customers have been inquiring about the voice interface of AESOP 2000. Although the command set (the lexicon) of AESOP 2000 currently exists only in English, the AESOP 2000 system can still be used by our international customers. Our early experience with surgeons from European and Asian countries indicates that AESOP responds accurately to variable accented commands. The speaker dependent configuration of the technology allows for the variance in phonemes that other accents contribute to the commands. Provided that the speech pattern during the voice recording sessions is produced exactly as the surgeon will repeat those commands during surgery, accurate recognition is achievable. Additionally, Computer Motion plans to release foreign language versions of AESOP 2000 in the future.

It is,therefore, the obvious source of advice on a wide range of scientific questions and it is ideally placed toprovide the answers. For over 30 years SCAR has provided such scientific advice to the Antarctic TreatySystem and made numerous recommendations on a variety of matters, most of which have beenincorporated into Antarctic Treaty instruments. Foremost amongst these have been the advice provided forthe many international agreements which provide protection for the ecology and environment of Antarctica. Origins of SCAR The plans for the IGY, the International Geophysical Year, 1957-58, included a major Antarcticcomponent. ICSU set up a Special Committee on Antarctic Research to coordinate the scientific research ofthe twelve nations which were active in Antarctica during this period. The unprecedented success of theIGY led to the establishment of the ICSU Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and thedevelopment of the Antarctic Treaty. Membership of SCARThe membership of SCAR comprises the National Committees of those national scientific academies orresearch councils which are the adhering bodies to ICSU and which are, or plan to be, active in Antarcticresearch, together with the relevant scientific Unions of ICSU. It includes the original twelve nationalmembers and an increasing number of subsequent members. There are two categories of membership: FullMembers, including seven ICSU scientific Unions and countries which have an active researchprogramme in Antarctica, and Associate Members for those countries without an independent researchprogramme as yet or which are planning a research programme in the future. Organization of SCAR SCAR meets every two years to conduct its administrative business at the SCAR Delegates Meeting. At thesemeetings the members of SCAR, through their appointed Delegates, are responsible for approving SCARfinances, and formulating SCAR policy and strategy. They also elect an Executive Committee from amongthemselves which is responsible for the day-to-day administration of SCAR though its Secretariat at theScott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, England. The scientific business of SCAR is conducted by itsWorking Groups which represent the scientific disciplines active in Antarctic research and report to SCAR. Operation of SCAR The members of the SCAR Working Groups are nationally appointed representatives who elect a ChiefOfficer from among themselves. The Working Group is the international forum for discussing nationalplans, progress and achievements in that particular discipline. Free and open discussions allow nationalscientific programmes to be internationally co-ordinated and may lead to proposals for internationalprogrammes to be developed. Such proposals are then submitted to the next biennial SCAR Delegatesmeeting. Groups of Specialists are created by SCAR in response to specific scientific problems. The members of aGroup of Specialists are appointed by SCAR for the experience and expertise they can bring to the Group.Most Groups of Specialists have a limited life-span, normally not more than 10 years, during which timethey will be expected to have completed their appointed task. A Group of Specialists may develop a appointedtask. A Group of Specialists may develop a programme of research which national members of SCAR, asappropriate, will put into effect, co-ordinated by the Group. Some Groups of Specialists, such as those onAntarctic Seals and on Environmental Affairs and Conservation, may have a longer life span to monitor aparticular aspect and to provide advice and make recommendations on a continuing basis. Such advice andrecommendations will normally be passed through SCAR to the appropriate outside bodies, typically theAntarctic Treaty System including the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS) and theConvention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Although funded only by small national contributions, SCAR activities provide the key framework for thevery large expeditions and expenditure involved in the operation of national and multi-national researchprogrammes. SCAR also sponsors major international symposia, conferences and workshops on Antarcticscience which provide additional fora for the presentation of data and results, and for the discussion ofAntarctic science among a wider audience. The proceedings or reports of these meetings are usuallypublished. Future plans SCAR will continue to initiate, promote and co-ordinate Antarctic scientific research and to providescientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty System. It will also continue to provide input to relevantprogrammes of ICSU and other organizations, for example the World Climate Research Programme(WCRP), a joint programme between ICSU and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). SCAR iscurrently planning a major contribution to the ICSU International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme(IGBP) which is concerned with global, particularly climate, change. SCAR is preparing six coreprogrammes to address those aspects of IGBP where the Antarctic region is uniquely placed to providefundamental data on global changes. These include studies of ozone depletion and the associated effects ofincreased ultra-violet radiation, atmosphere and ocean exchanges of greenhouse gases, changes in theAntarctic ice sheet and sea level, the history of climate change recorded in ice cores and ocean sediments. The current trend of Antarctic research is towards large, multi-national programmes which, due to theincreasing complexity and costs of Antarctic logistics, are the only way to address the major scientificproblems in Antarctica. Nevertheless, there is still a vast range of individual topical research projects beingundertaken nationally alongside but outside of the major international research programmes. As its record shows, SCAR is also committed to the conservation of the ecosystems and environment ofAntarctica, and to the freedom to continue to conduct scientific research in the south polar regions.

This CD carries the most up-to-date and completecoastline of the continent in digital form. The ADD can be used to: Generate customized maps for scientific, operational andeducational purposes; Provide the topographic framework for a variety of GIS applications; Facilitate international collaboration by providing a common basefor recording or analysing spatial data. The ADD, covering the area south of latitude 60=B0 South, has been preparedin the United Kingdom by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), the ScottPolar Research Institute (SPRI) and the World Conservation MonitoringCentre (WCMC) under the auspices of the Scientific Committee on AntarcticResearch (SCAR) and its Working Group on Geodesy and GeographicInformation. The database has been compiled from cartographic materialpublished by eleven nations (Argentina, Australia, China, Germany, Japan,New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russia, United Kingdom and United States ofAmerica). The scale of the source material used has ranged from 1:200,000to 1:5,000,000, and the coastline has been up-dated by reference tosatellite imagery at 1:1,000,000 scale. The Antarctic digital topographic database is provided on one compact disc(CD-ROM), and is accessible through PC ArcViewTM, PC ARC/INFO=AE and PCArcCADTM. It is formatted for MS-DOS systems only. The database can beused either directly from the CD or it can be down-loaded on to PCs. TheCD includes several preconstructed views intended for display with ArcView.These views can be used as a tutorial to introduce the user to thedatabase and to illustrate its potential. The Antarctic Digital Database User's Guide and Reference Manual whichaccompanies the CD provides detailed information on the content of thedatabase, its coverages and attributes, and includes lists of all approvedAntarctic conservation areas and active scientific stations. It alsocontains a detailed bibliography of the source material used in thepreparation of the ADD.

Through a rare blend of theoreticallearning and hands-on application, SEA's multidisciplinary curriculumoffers students a unique opportunity to combine onshore classes in marine science and maritime studies with an offshore sailing and research experience. This section of our website explains each of the academic programs we offer at SEA. Our Academic Programs include: SEA Semester (for college undergraduates) SEA Summer Session (for college undergraduates) SEA Experience (for K-12 teachers) Science at SEA (for high school students) Oceanography of the Gulf of Maine (for high school students) Return to the SEA home page. Undergraduate Semester Programs SEA's primary emphasis is the 12-week, full-credit undergraduateprogram, SEA Semester. Credit can betransferred to most colleges. In an interdisciplinary programfocusing on the sea, students undertake coursework ashore followed by a practical component at sea. More than 3,500 undergraduates from collegesand universities across the country have participated in SEA Semester. The SEA Summer Session allows studentsto experience SEA's academic program in a compressed timeframe.This eight-week program provides 12 undergraduate credits. Academic Credit for SEA Semester/SEA Summer Session SEA's undergraduate programs are designed to be a regular partof an undergraduate curriculum. After successfully completingthe program, you receive the equivalent of a full semester's academiccredit. Students from our affiliated institutions receive creditdirectly from their own college. Students from non-affiliatedinstitutions are enrolled by SEA at Boston University and theircredits are earned through that institution. Click here for alist of institutions that have granted credit in recent years for SEA Semester. SEA Seminars for Teachers and High School Students SEA also offers SEA Seminars, shorter programs in marine sciencedesigned for teachers, high school students, and groupsfrom other educational organizations. SEA Experienceis a five-week summer program designed for K-12 teachers. Science at SEA and Oceanography of the Gulf of Maineprograms are three-week summer programs for high school students. SEA's Faculty and Research During the 25 years of providing oceanographic instruction, SEA's distinguished facultyhas developed a number of ongoing oceanographic researchprojects that often form the basis of student projects duringtheir coursework at SEA. There are occasionallyopportunities for Visiting Scientiststo conduct research aboard our oceanographic research vesselsand introduce SEA students to their work. SEA maintains an activerelationship with other oceanographic institutionssuch as the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Marine BiologicalLaboratory and the Shoals Marine Laboratory to keep abreast of current developmentsin oceanographic science.

We're very excited that finallywe have launched ourselves into this world of Cyberspace and cancommunicate with all of you who have been asking and asking "whenwill SEA have a home page on the Internet and an e-mail address?" This page is for you, so it would help us enormously if youwere to tell us just what sort of things you'd like to see. We appreciate the comments we've had so far and are working on incorporating what we can at this time. Meanwhile, we have a few items to share with you. W-114 Homepage The participants of W-114 have launched their own homepage in aneffort to pull their far-flung group together again. We think theidea is great and want to encourage others to join the effort. Check it out at:http://www.tiac.net/users/snm/w114hp.htm 25th Anniversary Alumni Reunion Mark Saturday, June 14, 1997 on your calendar for our 25th Anniversary Alumni Reunion. This event will be for ALL CLASSES, whether it is a reunion year for you or not. Celebrating our 25th year is such an exciting event that we wish to share it with as many alumni as can make it back to Woods Hole for that weekend! Both ships will be in port for daysails on the 14th, and when you are not out on the water you may attend various presentations on campus, visit with friends or explore old haunts. Our barbecue will start at 5:30 p.m., followed by the SEA Memorabilia Auction, and then dancing to the great rhythms of the Atlantic Clarion Steel Band. Invitations with details of all the events will be mailed out late April/early May. In the meantime, if you want to book accommodations ahead of time, call Kate Parker at SEA and she will mail you a list of nearby hotels, B & Bs, campsights, etc. Some classes are already planning their own mini-events for that weekend, so if you wish to initiate anything for your class, Kate would be happy to help you with that in any way she can. Regional Alumni Events During the fall there were a number of regional alumni gatherings. SEA President, Rafe Parker spent two weeks visiting colleges in the western part of the country, and was able to meet up with alumni in Boulder, Colorado Springs and San Francisco. In addition, we had a wonderful event in Boston in November when Elsaesser Fellowship recipient Deborah Harrison (C-108)gave a presentation about her 6 month stay with the waSwahili of coastal East Africa. Our next event, currently in the planning stages, is scheduled for mid-March in the Washington, DC area. We'll have some form of presentation, followed by refreshments and an opportunity for alumni to acquaint and re-acquaint. If you're living in the greater DC area, keep a lookout for a notice of this event in your mail probably late February or early March. And if you are in that area and we don't have your current address, make sure you get that to us. You can always e-mail it to: kparker@sea.edu. There will also be an Alumni Council-sponsored "Spring Social" in April in Boston--no agenda other than to get together at some congenial venue. Alumni Council The semi-annual meeting of the Alumni Council will be held at the Charlestown Navy Yard on Saturday, January 25th. Any alum is welcome to attend. Please contact Kate Parker for details. The Alumni Council is currently focusing its attention on assisting our Admission Office with their enrollment efforts. The Committee on Members is accepting nominations for the position of Alumni Trustee, so if you wish to submit your candidacy or nominate someone, please contact Kate Parker in the Alumni Relations office at SEA. Finally, the Alumni Council Annual Fund Committee wishes to remind alumni that gifts are needed to help close the gap between tuition and expenses. Please consider sending a special contributuion during SEA's 25th anniversary year. We'd like to increase SEA's alumni participation above the current 34% level. Call 800-552-3633 for more information.

SEA Student Journals The student journal entries below have been provided by our SEAAlums. We hope they give you a feeling for what it's like to beout there with us. There are quite a few pictures, so it takes a moment to load this page. We are scientists. We are sailors. Our mission is precise. Itis exact. Most of us have been "prepared" on shore forthis voyage and now it is time to execute...ï¿½Gus I know now what Cory Cramer meant when he said that Westwardis a forgiving ship. She laughs when we bumble through an ineptsail change or overwork her rudder. Her nerves are steady inspite of the strains we impose upon her vital parts. She suffersinsults nobly as we chip away her rust and coat her open woundswith orange paint that soothes our egos as it hides her scars. She is patient when we abandon her to tarnished neglect and clutterher decks with the foul debris of our imprudent assaults on thesea in the name of research. And when the sea rises we curseher violent reactive surges even as we cling, white knuckled,to whichever part of her we choose to grab for support. It'shard to say goodbye to Westward. She knows me too well and Iowe her too much.ï¿½Marion The last three days were incredibly intense, wild, good and bad.We were the first watch ashore on Plana Cay. The water was anincredible aquamarine and you could see the green water breakingon the reef off the beach.ï¿½Cindy We are in the Sargasso Sea where the ocean's productivity is low,but the Issac Kidd Trawl we hauled in was full of bioluminescentlife. The trawl looked like a larger than life reflection ofthe Milky Way as it glowed in the water just before we pulledit up.ï¿½Marion Another day in paradise. Allan took Becky, Julie, Emma and me snorkling.We went to the Blue Grotto where the cliff is so there was lotsto see. I spotted a ray and all sorts of fish and coral. Itwas windy, so it got a little rough on the way back. We went toFort Cay and was the remains of Henry Morgan's cannon placementsand ammunition magazine. Then we went to the wreck and snorkledthere. I collected sand dollars, heart urchins and sea biscuits.ï¿½Cindy Go to the: Top of this document |Next Page |SEA home page If you've seen enough,click hereWT01-B01-233IA097-001044-B044-219http://sea2.sea.edu:80/calendar/caltop.htm 206.33.82.2 19970215105240 text/html 3804HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 10:56:37 GMTServer: Microsoft-Internet-Information-Server/1.0Content-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Wed, 20 Nov 1996 15:54:05 GMTContent-Length: 3604 SEA Program Calendar 1996 - 1997 Sea Education Association College Semester Programs Schedule Semester Number Dates on Campus, Woods Hole, Massachusetts: Shore Component* Dates On Board Ship, Sea Component Sail from...

Yes! SEA Semester is designed to be a regular partof your undergraduate education. After successfully completingthe program, you receive the equivalent of a full semester's academiccredit. Students from our affiliated institutions receive creditdirectly from their own college. Students from non-affiliatedinstitutions are enrolled by SEA at Boston University and theircredits are earned through that institution. Academic credits through Boston University can be transferredto your own college or university by working with your academicadvisor at your college and with SEA's Admission Office. Creditsmay be applied to your major and/or to your general requirementsfor graduation. More than 150 colleges and universities regularlyaccept all or some of these credits. Upon request, SEA will gladlyprovide program syllabi to the appropriate academic officers atyour school. What about Financial Aid? Financial assistance is available for SEA Semester. SEA'sown grants and interest-free loans are awarded based on need.Several special, non-need-based scholarships are also awardedeach year. Determination of need-based financial aid is made afteracceptance; applying for assistance will in no way affect yourchances for admission. We urge you to apply for aid if your personal,family and institutional resources cannot meet the full cost ofan SEA program. Federal aid programs are applicable to SEA. Some collegesallow students to transfer aid packages directly to SEA. Our financial aid office will gladly discuss the resourcesavailable to you, and will work closely with you to try to findways to make SEA Semester a reality for you. We are in frequenttouch with the financial aid offices at many colleges and universities.If you are planning to apply to SEA Semester, you should talkfirst to a financial aid officer at your home institution andfind out what assistance your school can provide. Inform yourofficer that you may be off campus so that federal aid will betransferred properly. If you have any questions about financial aid, call SEA'sOffice of Financial Assistance, toll-free: 1-800-552-3633 Do I Need Sailing Experience? No. Students come to SEA with a broad range of sailingexperiences. Some students have been sailing since they were toddlers.Others have never set foot on a boat before sailing on the Westwardor the Cramer. Still others have never seen the ocean. SEA Semester'sShore Component course in Nautical Science provides you with anunderstanding of the principles of sailing and navigation. Instructioncontinues through the entire Sea Component, when you put intopractice the theories you learned ashore. At sea you have an unrivaledopportunity to gain hands-on experience sailing a tall ship. Do I Need to be a Science Major? No. SEA students represent a wide varietyof majors and previous academic experiences. Students majoringin English, religion and art history join those in biology, geologyand engineering to complement each other's strengths and expertise.Eleven of the seventeen SEA course credits are in the sciences,but eight of these credits are earned during the Sea Component,where coursework is active, practical and engaging in ways verydifferent from traditional science courses on college campuses. The course/credit breakdown is as follows: Shore Component Oceanography (3 credits) Nautical Science (3 credits) Maritime Studies (3 credits) Sea Component Practical Oceanography I (4 credits) Practical Oceanography II (4 credits) In SEA Semester, with the assistance and direction of theChief Scientist, you and each of your classmates design originalresearch projects in some aspect of oceanography that you willcarry out at sea. Your individual research can reflect your levelof science background; for example, the more science you havehad, the more sophisticated your project can be. No matter thetopic, a great deal of faculty guidance and peer support are availableto you throughout the research process. While you work independently on your research, the interdisciplinarynature of ocean sciences requires cooperation and the exchangeof data and ideas with your classmates and the scientific staff.As you gain insight into the scientific process, your projectadds to the body of oceanographic data, long-term SEA studiesand research conducted by associated researchers. Most important,your project enhances your understanding of the waters in whichyou sail.

A 12-weekprogram offered in several sessions throughout the year, SEA Semesteroffers you a unique experience studying off campus -- and offshore,and earns you a full semester of college credit. SEA Semesterintegrates marine science, maritime literature, history and policy,and practical seamanship with deep-water oceanographic research. The six week Shore Component in Woods Hole combineslectures, hands-on workshops, small-group discussions and fieldexcursions in an intensive, focused, interdisciplinary curriculum.Then, during the subsequent SEA Component, you setsail on board one of SEA's sailing research vessels, the Westwardor the Corwith Cramer, and put into practice the knowledgeyou learned ashore. Working in small teams with the crew and fellow students, yousail, navigate and conduct research in the waters of the AtlanticOcean and Carribean Sea and become a vital, contributing memberof the ship's company. As the voyage progresses, you take on moreof the responsibility for the nautical, scientific and day-to-dayoperations of the ship. Your work in oceanography and in the shipboardlab gives you new insights into the scientific process, and anunderstanding of the interrelationships between earth, ocean andatmosphere. By the end of the program, you have completed an originalresearch project and have tested new skills and knowledge in theworld offshore. The Shore Component In the Shore Component, students enroll in three concurrent, three-creditcourses: Oceanography, Nautical Science, and Maritime Studies.These courses are taught in a traditional classroom setting withlectures, discussions, laboratory sessions, workshops, and fieldtrips. Classes are conducted by SEA faculty with occasional visitingscholars from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the MarineBiological Laboratory, and other academic and oceanographic organizations.Students who successfully complete the Shore Component participatein the Sea Component aboard the Westward or CorwithCramer. SEA Semester Course Syllabus. The SEA Semester Shore Component is taught at SEA's five-acrecampus in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The students live in SEA'sfive cottages which can house a total of 50 students and are fullyequipped with cooking facilities. Students attend classesin SEA's James L. Madden Center for Maritime Studieswhich contains a lecture hall, a teaching laboratory, studentstudy areas, a student computer room, a library and offices forfaculty and administrative staff. Students have access to classrooms, library, computer room andstudy areas 24 hours daily. Faculty are available for consultationdaily outside normal class hours. In addition, students receivelibrary cards for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution/MarineBiological Laboratory Library which is widely recognized as oneof the best marine science libraries in the world. The daily schedule contains a long lunch break during which studentscan attend professional seminars frequently offered at the WoodsHole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), Marine Biological Laboratory(MBL), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), U.S. GeologicalSurvey (USGS), Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC), and other institutionsin the area. Shore Component courses are taught by a faculty team which includes:oceanography faculty who sail as Chief Scientists with the students;nautical science faculty who sail as Captains of the ships; andmaritime studies faculty who teach primarily on shore. The closeworking relationships that develop among faculty and studentson shore continue to develop at sea and result in a 12-week, intensive,focused educational experience that is seldom possible in a typicalcampus setting. The Sea Component In the Sea Component, students enroll in two sequential, four-creditcourses: Practical Oceanography I and Practical Oceanography II,each of which lasts three weeks. Each day students spend two hoursin lecture plus an additional four to six hours on watch, involvedin every phase of the ship's scientific research and in the attendantduties of sailing, navigating, and operating an oceanographicresearch vessel. During the Sea Component, students assume increasingresponsibility for the safe and orderly conduct of both scientificactivities and ship operations. Admission Admission to SEA Semester is by competitive selection and is determinedby an Admission Committee. To be admitted, students must be ingood academic standing and must have successfully completed theequivalent of one college-level laboratory science course. SEAadmits students on a rolling admission basis after reviewing highschool and college transcripts, standardized test scores, personalstatements, references, and alumni interviews. Admission decisionsare financially need-blind. More information on Admissions? Financial Aid Financial assistance is available for SEA Semester and SEA SummerSession students. Federal financial aid transfers directly toSEA. Some colleges and universities transfer their own financialaid for their students who are admitted to SEA Semester. SEA alsoawards its own grants and loans. In addition, SEA periodicallyawards a small number of full-tuition, academic-merit scholarships. Return to the top of this document.

As a SEA Summer Session student, you begin to sense the universalhuman fascination with the sea as you delve into maritime historyand literature. In the study of ocean navigation, you gain an appreciationfor the mysteries of the stars, and develop an understanding ofa whole new realm. As you study oceanography, you investigatethe complexities of marine ecosystems, consider the impact ofoceanic pollution, and learn the techniques scientists use tounravel the earth's geological secrets. The eight-week (four-week Shore Component; four-week Sea Component),12-credit program includes the same Shore Component courses asin SEA Semester: Oceanography, Maritime Studies, and NauticalScience. During SEA Summer Session, these courses begin on shorebut are completed at sea. Highlighting the interdisciplinary teaching for which SEA is known,issues and problems from the Contemporary Maritime Affairs sectionof the Maritime Studies course are studied and discussed at sea.Specific topics include the economic, political, and ecologicalproblems of the areas (Georges Bank, the Gulf of Maine, and theScotian Shelf) through which the vessel sails and in which studentsare conducting their oceanographic research.

Throughcombined study ashore and practical experience at sea and conductingoceanographic research, SEA Experience enables teachers to develop: new ideas for field, laboratory and classroom work; multidisciplinary ocean curriculum development ideas; activities that help students discover and understand fundamentalconcepts in science; knowledge of the interrelationships between oceans, atmosphereand land; a professional support network of teachers across the country. The Shore Component is a rigorous and progressive three-week period.Its focus is to introduce concepts in oceanography in lectures,group discussions, laboratories, activities and field excursions.Supplementary lectures and discussions and hands-on workshopscover selected topics in nautical science -- to prepare teachersfor their time at sea handling a research vessel under sail, andin maritime studies -- to provide a historical and literary perspectiveto ocean study. During the ten-day Sea Component, teachers go to sea aboard theSailing School Vessels Westward and Corwith Cramerand test the theories introduced on shore in a hands-on settingwhile conducting oceanographic research projects. In lecturesand daily shipboard laboratory work, teachers are instructed inthe operation of basic oceanographic data, and in the attendantoperations of sailing a research vessel. During the research cruise, a 24-hour watch schedule is maintained.Individual and small group instruction takes place during watchstanding. Each participant stands two watches a day, usually oneon deck and one in the laboratory. The Swedish watch system (twosix hour watches during the day and three four-hour watches atnight) gives each participant the opportunity to perform all tasks,including engine room and galley duty, at various times of theday. Upon completion of the program, teachers are expected to holdtwo in-service workshops using SEA Experience as their base. If they choose to pay the optional $270 fee, participating teachers in SEA Experience earn 5 graduate credits from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. SEA has received generous funding for SEA Experience from theNational Science Foundation (NSF) and The William H. Donner Foundation, Inc.These grants cover tuition and living expenses throughout theprogram for up to 46 teachers.

Coursework focuses on the coastal and offshore marineenvironment around Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Study takes place on shore at SEA's campus in Woods Holeand at sea on board one of SEA's sailing research vessels. Scienceat SEA students explore the marine environment from several perspectives--scientific,historical, literary -- and learn the theories of sailing and navigation.Learning and developing skills in traditional ways, students arecalled upon to put them into practice when they board the shipto live, work at study at sea. Phase I: On Shore at SEA's Woods Hole Campus During the Shore Component, students participate in two courses:Introduction to Oceanography and Introductionto Nautical Science. In addition, seminars are held onmaritime history and literature of the sea. Classes are held Mondaythrough Friday. Through lectures, seminars, laboratory activitiesand field trips, students are introduced to the study of marinescience and navigation in an historic and modern context. In smallgroups, students and instructors work closely to integrate thesetopics and prepare them for the responsibilities they will takeon when they go to sea on board the vessel. Students are expectedto complete homework assignments and take two tests. Grades andevaluations are given. Topics covered on shore: Introduction to Oceanography: Structure ofthe Earth; Marine Geology and Sediments; Wind-Driven Circulation;Thermohaline Circulation; Seawater Chemistry; Biology of MarineOrganisms; Marine Mammals. Introduction to Nautical Science: Pilotingand Chartwork; Charts and the Compass; Ship Handling Under Sail;Life at Sea; Safety and Seamanship; Ship Stability; Aerodyamicsand Hydrodynamics; Radar Plotting. Campus Life: Students live on campus in one of five residential cottages withup to seven other students and closely supervised by an adultresident House Leader. House Leaders also serve as Teaching Assistantson shore and go to sea with the students as instructors duringthe Sea Component. Life in each cottage revolves around its communalkitchen and dining area where students help plan and prepare meals,and share ideas, frustrations and excitement with one another.Every evening, quiet time is reserved for study, using SEA's library,student lounge, computer lab and cottages. Evening and weekend extracurricular activities are led by HouseLeaders, with input from the students. These optional activitiesmany include visits to the Cape Cod National Seashore, day tripsto Martha's Vineyard, musical entertainment, and "movie andpopcorn" nights. Students share outdoor activities such asplaying volleyball, soccer and frisbee and exploring the localbike path and beaches. Phase II: At Sea on the Waters Around Cape Cod Upon successful completion of the shore component, students joineither the SSV Westward (125-foot staysailschooner) or the SSV Corwith Cramer(134-foot brigantine) for the ten-day sea component. Each of SEA's shipsholds 21 students and 14 professional crew and faculty. Dailyactivities aboard the vessel immerse students in all operationsof a modern sailing research vessel -- collecting scientific data,operating the vessel's diesel engine, setting and striking thesails, helping in the ship's galley, and much more. Each afternoon,students participate in lectures and directed activities in bothOceanography and Nautical Science. Watch Activities Each student is assigned to a watch group of eight people withwhom he/she rotates through the 24-hour watch schedule. Whilea student watch group is on duty, each person is assigned to aparticular area of the vessel for the duration of the watch period:in the lab, on deck, in the galley, or in the engine room. During the deck portion of the watch, students participate innavigational exercises led by the mate on duty. These exercisesinclude opportunities to maneuver the vessel, radar plotting,and near-shore piloting with charts and compass. During the lab watch, students participate in special oceanographicactivities led by the scientist on duty. These include deployingoceanographic instruments to determine characteristics of thewater column, the sea floor, and the biological organisms of thearea, and analyzing the data already collected during the cruise. Scientific Data Collection Oceanographic data are collected by students on a regular basisthroughout the 24-hour daily operation of the vessel. These datainclude sea surface temperature, surface salinity, barometricpressure, water depth and weather observations. Scientific stations are conducted each day. A station occurs anytime the vessel is maneuvered to allow oceanographic equipmentto be deployed and recovered. Each watch has the opportunity tohandle the equipment and assist in collecting and analyzing thecruise data. There is a hands-on, practical test at sea as well as group presentations.Each watch group is assigned the task of collecting data at onemajor station. With the help of the scientists, the students analyzeand interpret that information. Then each watch group compilestheir data and creates scientific tables and figures to illustratetheir results. The cruise culminates with a series of oral presentationsfrom each watch/study group given to the ship's complement outliningtheir findings and conclusions. Return to the top of this document.

Oceanography of the Gulf of Maine is an academic seminar for high school juniors and seniors, and non-science college freshmenwho have successfully completed two high school science courses. Oceanography of the Gulf of Maine offers a unique opportunityfor students to experience life on board a sailing vessel andon an island off the coast of New Hampshire, studying oceanicand coastal marine environments. Offered jointly by the Sea EducationAssociation (SEA) and the Shoals Marine Laboratory (SML), thisacademically rigorous program exposes students to the scienceof the sea while earning 4 college credits from Cornell University. At Sea On Board SSV Westward Students board SEA's 125-foot sailing research vessel Westwardand depart from either Woods Hole or Appledore Island on a ten-day oceanographic voyage, on the waters south of Martha's Vineyard, Georges Bank, and the Gulf of Maine. Students are introduced to the basics of nautical science as they participate in the routine operation and navigation of the ship. Working alongside professional scientists, students conduct marine research and collect data which emphasizes the interrelationships of the biological, geological, and physical characteristics of the Gulf of Maine region. Two daily lectures and routine deck and laboratory watch-standing will be part of the student's experience at sea. Two tests and one group presentation are required. Grades are given and transcripts are available after successful completion of the course. Watch Activities Each student is assigned to a watch group of eight people withwhom he/she rotates through the 24-hour watch schedule. Whilea student watch group is on duty, each person is assigned to aparticular area of the vessel for the duration of the watch period:in the lab, on deck, in the galley, or in the engine room.

A station occurs anytime the vessel is maneuvered to allow oceanographic equipmentto be deployed and recovered. Each watch has the opportunity tohandle the equipment and assist in collecting and analyzing thecruise data. On Shore at Shoals Marine Lab The final seven days are spent at the Shoals Marine Laboratory'sfield station on Appledore Island in the Isles of Shoals. Studentsanalyze their oceanographic data in the classroom and laboratory,observe seal and seabird colonies and learn about coastal marinehabitats by exploring Appledore's near-pristine tidepools androcky intertidal zone. This variety of activities provides a solidintroduction to marine sciences through hands-on participation.By living, working and studying together in an atmosphere of cooperation,students achieve common goals, learn more about themselves, andgain new perspectives of the ocean environment. Daily schedules at SML are flexible in order to accommodate predictableevents (e.g. tides) and to take advantage of unforseen opportunitiesto experience the marine environment (e.g. observing the nearbypassage of migrating whales). The Academic Day Mornings: Early morning collecting trips to the intertidal zoneor dawn bird walks; after-breakfast lecture; conducting laboratoryor field work on the island or on board a research vessel. Afternoons: Similar to mornings. Beginning at dark, evening lectures,slide or film presentations are given. Before and after the lecture,students are encouraged to carry on informal discussions withvisiting faculty, work in the labs or study. Island Life Breakfast is served at 7:30; lunch at 12:30. Students have anhour of free time before dinner, during which extensive use canbe made of the island's volleyball court, swimming hole or library. Nights on Appledore Island are commonly brought to a close by impromptujam sessions of student/faculty musicians, ping-pong and boardgames, or other forms of relaxation. SEA's VESSELS The SEA Ships Westward and the Cramer are hands-on ships.After careful instruction both ashore and at sea, students demonstratetheir competence and then use the ship's systems to carry outtheir scientific mission. Two radars, several radio-telephones,a satellite navigation system, LORAN, and depth sounders on eachvessel ensure their navigational safety. Auxiliary machinery includesrefrigeration systems, fire-fighting and pumping equipment, electricalgenerators and air compressors. In the unlikely event of emergency,fully equipped life rafts can accommodate the entire ships' companies. Return to the top of this document. Return to the SEA home page.

These studies provide importantdata on long-term trends and/or changes in water characteristicsand marine resources, and often form the basis for student researchon board Westward and Corwith Cramer. During everySEA Semester cruise, these studies cover topics in all areas ofoceanography-physical, chemical, biological and geological, andinclude both site-specific investigations and those distributedover wide oceanic areas. In addition, SEA takes advantage of newopportunities to investigate different areas of study, and, onoccasion, to collaborate with other scientists or groups interestedin a particular scientific question. SEA's time-series data setsare unique. Few other institutions have the opportunity to samplethe same waters year after year. Since 1988, SEA's shipboard scientific equipment has undergoneseveral major upgrades, beginning with a National Science Foundation(NSF) grant to equip the Cramer with modern, sophisticatedsampling gear. Subsequent NSF funding brought Westward'sequipment into line with Cramer's, and further grants fromNSF and the Crystal Trust in 1993 have allowed SEA to furnishthe Cramer with a sampling rosette and hydraulic J-frame.These improvements have made SEA sampling safer, have contributedto the data quality, and have heightened the caliber of SEA'sacademic programs. The following are highlights from a variety of SEA research projects: Tar Balls Since 1980, SEA has been monitoring the distributionof tar pollutants in the western North Atlantic. Tar is introducedinto the oceanic environment through accidental and/or negligentloss of oil through the operation of tankers. Once oil entersthe water, its volatile elements evaporate leaving behind a floatingresidue of tar that is distributed by wind and surface currents.Dr. Paul Joyce has compiled SEA's data on floating tar collectedfrom 1980 to 1993. Examining a total of 2,143 neuston tow samplestaken from the western North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea,he has found that floating tar distributions were controlled bythe circulation pattern of the North Atlantic gyre. SEA data revealthat concentrations of tar were highest in the Northern SargassoSea. The highest single tows were located near the Windward Passage,an area of high water input into the Caribbean from the SargassoSea, an area of high tanker traffic, and an area of convergence,where large amounts of Sargassum and associated debris,including plastic, are often observed. The lowest concentrationsof tar were found both in North American coastal waters and inthe Caribbean Sea. Unlike earlier studies, in which floating tar in the western northAtlantic and Caribbean Sea has consistently shown increases inconcentration or no significant change over time, SEA's data showa decrease in tar density in the waters studied, particularlyin the Caribbean after 1987. This overall decrease in floatingtar is likely the result of a reduction of input. Although worldwideproduction and shipments into the U.S. have increased, the numberof tankers in service has decreased, probably contributing tothe reduction in the amount of tar released into the AtlanticOcean. Data also suggests that legislation such as MARPOL Annex1, which became effective in 1983, and improved tanker efficiencyand handling methods are showing measurable results in the AtlanticOcean. Halobates, the Marine Water Strider SEA students and scientists continue to show interest in Halobatesmicans, the only marine insect. According to Scientist ChuckLea, SEA's focus has shifted from the simple distribution of Halobatesto age distribution by geographic region. On two cruises everyyear, SEA students and scientists are able to sample Halobatesentering the Caribbean from divergent, tropical, equatorial waters.We would like to contrast these specimens with those which arefound in convergent, subtropical Sargasso Sea waters. Recent work in the Gulf of Mexico has shown seasonality in theoccurrence of Halobates. SEA data may suggest whether seasonalityexists in the open Atlantic as well. What's so special about Soufriere Bay? This deep bay onthe west coast of St. Lucia has consistently yielded large catchesof juvenile tuna. Folklore of the local fishermen offered severalpossible explanations for this phenomenon: mineral run-off froma nearby volcano; corals that thrive on the volcanically-derivedminerals; the moon and the "cleanliness" of the waterin the Bay. During SEA Semester Class 129 on Westward,several SEA students, led by Chief Scientist Ellen Prager, conducteda study under the auspices of St. Lucia's Ministry of Fisheriesin an effort to explain the Bay's large biological productivityrelative to other areas around the island. Data were collectedover a 24-hour period in Soufriere Bay, using CTDs, Niskin bottles,neuston tows and sediment sampling techniques to gain as broada profile of the Bay as possible. While upwelling seemed initiallyto be the likely explanation, data suggested rather that the primarysource of nutrients in the water was runoff from Soufriere River.Daily mixing, possibly caused by a reversing current, may provideadditional nutrients from deeper water. This mixing appeared tobe distributing nutrients in the Bay and making its waters particularlyattractive to fish populations. Cariaco Basin Cariaco Basin is a semi-enclosed, 1,400-footdeep basin just off the northern coast of Venezuela. The firstsamples were collected in this region in 1954 by Val Worthingtonand colleagues at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, whofound that although the surface waters were highly productive,the Basin was anoxic below about 500 meters. Subsequent studiesshowed the deep waters of the Basin to be unusually warm-closeto 18Â° Cinstead of 6Â° observed in waters of similardepth in the nearby Caribbean. Many scientists have proposed differentideas explaining this phenomenon. SEA began sampling there in1991 during cruises W- and C-116, and have found that the watersare continuing to warm. SEA has an outstanding data set from thelast several years of sampling, and these data show a temperatureincrease during this period. Gulf of Maine The 1994 SEA Summer Session (Class 134)aboard the Cramer spent four weeks sailing and samplingin the western North Atlantic and the Gulf of Maine. On boardfor a portion of the cruise was visiting scholar Peter Brickleyfrom the University of Maine, whose research interests includethe flow of subsurface slope water into the Gulf of Maine. Guidedby Brickley and Chief Scientist Rich Malatesta, the students ofC-134 performed a precise, six-station CTD transect across a shallowregion in the Gulf of Maine called the Truxton Swell. Resultsof the students' work showed regions of North Atlantic slope waterupwelling along the western portion of the Truxton Swell. Thisis significant because, in Brickley's words, it "corroboratesprevious observations of 'banking' against the eastern slope ofthe Gulf [of Maine], where German Bank rises up to the southwesttip of the Nova Scotian shoreline." This work adds a pieceto the scientific puzzle that is the Gulf of Maine circulationsystem. Ciguatera, Tropical Fish Poisoning The human neurologicaldisease ciguatera results from the ingestion of toxin-bearingtropical and subtropical reef fish. Feeding on benthic microalgae,these fish may concentrate potent neurotoxins produced in smallquantities by certain attached dinoflagellates. Past scientificstudies determined that these dinoflagellates were associatedonly with certain benthic algas. In collaboration with scientistsat WHOI, SEA students have been investigating these toxin-producingorganisms since 1991. SEA data, in agreement with other more recentstudies, indicate that the dinoflagellates are also associatedwith pelagic Sargassum (floating seaweed). These findingsraise the possibility that the dinoflagellates, using Sargassumas their substrate, are carried considerable distances from tropicaland subtropical regions by wind and surface currents. As a result,the geographic range in which ciguatera can affect humans maybe expanding. SEA students and scientists continue researching numerous topicsin the North Atlantic and Caribbean, ranging from ocean circulationand water mass movements to studies of the abundance and distributionof various species of zooplankton. Additional topics that SEAalumni are familiar with include: Phyllosoma (larvae of the spinylobster), leptocephali (eel larvae), copepods and pteropods; pelagicplastic distribution; Salinity Maximum Water, 18 Water, AntarcticIntermediate Water, Amazon and Orinoco River Water; thermal frontsin the Sargasso Sea: distribution and concentration of pelagicSargassum; and phytoplankton distribution and nutrientavailability. J-Frame and Carousel water sampler The SSV Corwith Cramer and Westward have new looksand new capabilities since the fall 1994 and 1995 yard periodsin Rockland, Maine. Thanks to a National Science Foundation grantwritten by staff scientist Paul Joyce, additional funding fromthe Crystal Trust, and a lot of hard work by many other people(including former science coordinator Gretchen Rollwagen), SEAwas able to purchase and install a new water sampling system-aCTD carousel. The carousel, manufacturedby Sea-Bird Electronics, is a state-of-the-art cylindrical frameof aluminum tubing that holds up to twelve Niskin water samplingbottles. Also attached to the carousel is the CTD, an electronicinstrument which measures the conductivity, temperature, and depthof the seawater as it is lowered into the ocean; the data is storedand later transferred to the lab computer for analysis. Studentscan prepare the carousel for launching while the Crameris still underway to the station location. Once on station, thecarousel is deployed and lowered to the desired water depth, withthe CTD collecting physical oceanographic data on the way down.As the carousel is raised, the Niskin bottles automatically closeat pre-programmed depths. The carousel is recovered, lashed downin its cradle, and water samples extracted from the Niskin bottleson the carousel while the ship gets underway. The J-frame is the new launch and recovery system implementedby consultant Bill Simpson, SEA's port engineer Robbie Laird,and marine superintendent Wallace Stark. It is used not only tolaunch the carousel, but also to deploy all other scientific gearon the hydrowire. The frame has replaced the hydro davit on theCramer, and is a large aluminum structure shaped like aninverted J, mounted on the ship's port rail. Hydraulics pivotthe J-frame in (with the hydrowire sheave attached), allowingstudents and scientists to attach scientific gear-such as planktonnets or the Shipek sediment grab-safely and conveniently. Oncethe gear is attached, the frame pivots back out, keeping the hydrowireand gear away from the hull of the ship. Despite the newness of the system (a few SEA eyebrows were raisedwhen it was discovered we had received serial number 0001!), reportswere positive after its inaugural cruise, C-135, with CaptainGreg Lohse and Chief Scientist Tim Scott. The new system alsosaves station time on deep hydrocasts: a 1,500-meter, 10-bottlehydrocast required the ship to be hove-to for only 75 minutes,about half the time it used to take! Beach Profiles In cooperation with the Falmouth Beach Committee, SEA has beguna beach profiling program to monitor the changing contour, erosionand sand deposition at four local beaches- Surf Drive, Wood Neck,Old Silver and Menauhant. Permanent markers from which sand elevationtransects are taken have been established at each of the fourbeaches. SEA students will monitor the beach profile several timesa year, measuring elevation from the backbeach to the water level.Data collected will determine baseline elevations for each beach.This information will allow Town of Falmouth officials to betterunderstand the seasonal erosion or deposition of sand at eachsite, in addition to having a permanent baseline for mitigationshould major storm damage occur. Classes are typically divided into three groups. The studentslearn how to use the profiling equipment and practice conductingprofiles on one of the beaches. Each group is then assigned oneof the three remaining beaches to profile. Beach profiling beganin the fall with SEA Semester Class 136 students and scientistsas a field activity for SEA's course in oceanography, and willcontinue with each subsequent semester class. Data collected willbe used for comparative purposes in the months and years to come. If you've seen enough,click here Return to the top of the this document.

Students develop proposals for research projects whichwill be conducted at sea. Prerequisite: one semester of a collegelaboratory science or its equivalent. Student grades are based on three written examinations, laboratoryreports and the research project proposal and presentation. In the study of oceanography, students explore and come to understandthe complex characteristics and dynamic processes of the world'soceans. The course covers the four interrelated disciplines-biology,chemistry, geology, and physics-- that make up the science of oceanography. Geological Oceanography covers the structure of theearth, the origin of the oceans and atmosphere, and plate tectonicsthe creation, growth and destruction of ocean basins. Studentsexamine major features of the sea floor, including sediments andthe records they preserve, and regional features, such as carbonatebanks, that are studied firsthand at sea during the Sea Component. In Chemical Oceanography students examine the chemicalcomposition of seawater, salinity, density, vertical structureof the water column, distribution of dissolved gases and nutrients,and the balance between inputs and outputs of dissolved materialsin the oceans. Topics discussed in Physical Oceanography include theEarth's heat budget, vertical, horizontal and global atmosphericcirculation, global warming, waves and tides, air-sea interactions,vertical mixing processes, and the patterns of water circulationwithin ocean basins. In Biological Oceanography students explore factorscontrolling the distribution of primary production, cycling ofnutrients in the oceans, and the structure and dynamics of thefood chain. As students become familiar with the diversity oforganisms that live in the sea, they examine their adaptationsto the requirements of life in the ocean. Students also considerphysical and biological factors that determine the distributionof organizations within the marine environment. Once students develop an understanding of the ocean as a highlyintegrated natural system, they study it as a system modifiedby human activity. As they advance through the course, studentshave the opportunity to discuss the effects of stresses imposedby the human population on ocean and coastal resources, and toexamine the interrelationships between the oceans and the earth'sglobal environment. Classes in oceanography include both lectures on general topicsand more specific discussions tailored to the waters of the particularcruise track. Guest lecturers from the Woods Hole scientific communitypresent the latest results of oceanographic research. With the assistance and direction of the Chief Scientist on shore,each student develops a proposal for an oceanographic researchproject that will be conducted at sea. Student research proposalsinclude: literature review, hypothesis, sampling plan, and proceduresto analyze and interpret data. Individual research projects reflecteach student's level of science background. Students with strongerscience backgrounds can conduct more sophisticated research. Forevery student research project, a great deal of faculty guidanceand peer support is provided throughout the entire research processfrom proposal development on shore through data collection, analysisand final report presentation at sea. Nautical Science (3 credits) Selected scientific theories are applied to the operation of asailing vessel at sea. The concepts of the physics of sailing,navigation (coastal piloting, celestial, and electronic), navalarchitecture, ship construction, and marine engineering systemsare taught from their bases in physics, mathematics, and astronomy. Student grades are based on written examinations and, with somefaculty, a nautical science notebook or journal. This course provides students with the theoretical foundationnecessary to operate the SSV Westward and the SSV Corwith Cramerat sea. In lectures and lab sessions, the faculty introduce theprinciples fundamental to sailing vessel operations. Studentslearn and apply essential concepts in general physics, astronomy,and meteorology. The nautical science content is divided intofour major sections: Piloting/Coastwise Navigation. In this section of the course,students are introduced to the principles of navigating a vesselwithin sight of land. Discussions include the earth's coordinatesystem of latitude and longitude, nautical charts, and the magneticcompass. Using these tools to determine location and direction,students explore the concepts of deduced reckoning, line of position,the navigational fix, and course and speed through the water.Students become familiar with electronic navigation using radar,loran, and the Global Positioning System (GPS). Celestial Navigation.Building on their knowledge in piloting, students learn the practiceof taking sights with a sextant-using the earth, sun, moon, stars,and planets-and reducing them to lines of position to fix theship's position at sea. As they construct the celestial triangle,students come to understand the navigator's view of the universe,and discuss the basis of the idea of time. Ships and their Operation. Topics in this unit revolvearound a series of discussions and demonstrations that have theirroots in basic physics: Archimedes' Principle - ship stability Bernoulli Effect- hydrodynamics and theory of sail Boyle's Law- diesel engine combustion Ohm's Law- production and storage of electricity Newton's Laws and mechanical advantage- blocks, levers, winches,and pulleys. Meteorology The weather has a major influence on life atsea. Classroom lectures and discussions focus on global, regional,and local weather, with special emphasis on the phenomenon ofatmospheric movement-wind. Students develop observational skillsby recording weather data on a regular basis on shore and cometo understand pressure systems, frontal genesis and movement,and forecasting. Hands-on sessions reinforce the students' understanding of nauticalscience theory. They study the forces acting on the ship's hullin the water and on the sails in the air, using a towing tankand a wind simulator to see firsthand the concepts of stability,hydrodynamics, and aerodynamics. In a workshop on diesel power,students dismantle and reassemble a small diesel engine. Theywork on skills and problem-solving in coastal piloting, offshorenavigation, and weather prediction, all of which are fundamentalto the safety of vessels at sea. The exploration of these essentialconcepts provides a foundation for understanding the art and scienceof navigation. Maritime Studies (3 credits) This multidisciplinary study of the history, literature, and artof our maritime heritage concludes with discussions of the politicaland economic problems of contemporary maritime affairs. Student grades are based on class participation, a short paper,a mid-term exam, and final exam. This course introduces students to our American maritime heritageas well as contemporary maritime issues. Maritime history, literatureand maritime resource management comprise the primary contentof this course. The American Maritime Experience. An introduction to therichness and complexity of the American maritime heritage, thefirst part of this course provides students with an historic andliterary context for understanding their own sea experience. To gain an understanding of the role of the sea in the historyof the United States, students explore topics such as the Europeandiscovery of the New World, the early fishing industry of NorthAmerica, the whaling industry of New England, and the importanceof overseas trade in early American commercial development. Representativeselections of sea literature--drawn from the writings of Kipling,Melville, Conrad, London, and Hemingway--introduce students tothe traditions of the literature of the sea voyage. They exploresome of the major themes of maritime literature and are introducedto different forms and styles of authors of voyaging literature.Maritime art and music supplement the readings in history andliterature as students explore what has motivated people to testthemselves at sea and to attempt to explain that experience--indifferent art forms--to those who remained on the shore. Contemporary Maritime Affairs. An introduction to contemporarymaritime affairs, this part of the course provides students withsufficient knowledge with which to formulate informed and intelligentquestions about selected current maritime problems. Students investigatesuch controversial issues as the competition between fisheriesand the oil industry on the U.S. continental shelf; state andfederal government regulation of U.S. fisheries; the role of theU.S. Navy and the direction it is taking in the "Post ColdWar" world; and the "troubled" U.S. merchant marineand shipbuilding industries. Against a background theme of thenationalization of the sea, students address the problem of managingour maritime resources. Sea Component Courses The research programs and the cruise tracks of the SSV Westwardand the SSV Corwith Cramer provide a scientific andeducational experience in oceanography and nautical science. Studentsexamine diverse marine environments that demonstrate regionalvariations as well as local phenomena. In traditional undergraduateinstitutions, it is rare that all students have the opportunityto propose a research project and carry it through data collection,tabulation, analysis, interpretation and conclusion followed bya presentation of their research results to their peers. Thosestudents who do have this opportunity are usually science majorsin specialized programs. At SEA, the opportunity to apply thescientific method to an oceanographic research topic is integralto the entire program and a requirement for science and non-sciencemajors alike. It is through this process that science majors aswell as liberal arts majors develop a fuller understanding ofscience and the scientific approach to problem solving. All studentscome to understand the difficulties of conducting research withinthe constraints of the oceanic environment and weather that they encounterat sea. In addition to completing their research, students maycollect data for on-going SEA faculty research projectsor collaborate on research projects for scientists from otherinstitutions. Practical Oceanography I (4 credits) (SEA Semester only) Theories and problems raised in the Shore Component are testedin the practice of oceanography at sea. During lectures and watchstanding, students learn about: deployment, operation, and retrievalof oceanographic sampling equipment; methods involved in the collection,analysis and interpretation of oceanographic data; and the attendantoperations of sailing an oceanographic research vessel. Student grades are based on written and practical examinationsas well as on-watch performance in the laboratory and on deck. Practical Oceanography I is designed to introduce students tothe oceanic environment and the practice of scientific researchat sea. Students are instructed in the use of oceanographic equipmentand the operation of a research vessel through participation inoceanographic sampling and conducting a research program coordinatedby the Chief Scientist. The SSV Westward and the SSV Corwith Cramer arewell equipped to obtain samples for many types of oceanographicresearch. The following list describes some of the techniquesthat students learn: Deep sea bathymetric profiling ï¿½ operation of a PrecisionDepth Recorder to determine sea-floor topography and sedimentprofile. Hydrostations ï¿½ use of a CTD (Conductivity-Temperature-DepthProbe) for continuous profiling of salinity, temperature, andpressure plus a series of Niskin bottles to obtain water samplesat specific depths. BT stations ï¿½ use of the mechanical bathythermographto measure water temperature changes with depth. Biological tows and trawls - deployment and retrievalof a variety of plankton nets, neuston nets, bottom and midwatertrawls, as well as methods of preserving and analyzing samples. Sediment sampling ï¿½ sampling of sea floor sedimentsusing bottom grabs and/or a gravity core. Samples are typicallyanalyzed for grain size, composition, and benthic fauna. Water analysis ï¿½ measurement of salinity by conductivity,dissolved oxygen by titration (Winkler method), nutrients by spectrophotometry,and chlorophyll a content by fluorometry. Computer-based analysis ï¿½ tabulation, graphical presentation,and data analysis provide ways to organize and present data andresults on board ship. Computers are available on board ship fordata analysis, word processing and preparation of student researchreports. In addition, students assemble a collection of fauna and florafrom a variety of marine environments to familiarize themselveswith the diversity and distribution of life in the ocean. Thiscollection serves as the basis for the study and discussion ofdifferent phyla and taxonomic relationships. The daily lectures serve two functions. First, they introducethe scientific concepts, sampling methodologies, and attendantship operations that the students learn on board. Second, theyprovide the opportunity to review the oceanographic propertiesof the regions being studied, to review the events of the last24 hours with the entire ship's company, and to discuss the continuingscientific activities of the ship. Approximately 75 oceanographic stations are completed during eachSea Component. For each station, accurate navigation guides theship to a predetermined location. A suitable sail configurationmust be selected and set to maintain a fixed position or movethe vessel ahead at the correct speed for the sampling gear. Oceanographicgear is deployed, lowered to a predetermined depth, and retrievedsafely. A new course is then set to the next station and the vesselgets underway. Collected samples are processed and the data isrecorded. During the Sea Component, each student acquires theknowledge and skills needed to take increasing responsibilityfor each of these activities. Practical Oceanography II (4 credits) (SEA Semester only) Building on the experience of Practical Oceanography I, studentsassume increasing responsibility for the performance of the vessel'sentire oceanographic research program while they complete theirindividual research projects. Ultimately, each student is giventhe opportunity to be responsible directly to the Chief Scientistand the Captain for the safe and orderly conduct of the researchactivities and related operations of the vessel during his/herwatch. Student grades are based on written and practical examinations,research performance, and oral and written reports on their individualresearch projects. Practical Oceanography II includes all activities described inPractical Oceanography I, but at a more sophisticated level asstudents take on increasing responsibility for shipboard operations.In addition, they complete the data analysis and interpretationfor their own research project. Station work continues as theSSV Westward and the SSV Corwith Cramer follow theirresearch plans. Individual students, through the Junior ScienceWatch Officer (JSWO) and Junior Watch Officer (JWO) program, takepersonal responsibility to supervise all activities in the laboratoryor on deck during their watches. The success of each ship's scientificmission and the safety of its crew are monitored by the professionalstaff but, during the final phase of this course, the first lineof decision-making rests with the students. In addition, this course includes the completion of research projectsdeveloped by the students during the Shore Component. Studentswrite a scientific paper and present a seminar on the resultsof their research in a format similar to that at professionalconferences. Research project results and presentations play an important role in each student's final evaluation. Practical Oceanographic Research (3 credits) (SEA Summer Sessiononly) Students are guided by the scientific staff from an introductorylearning phase to increasing responsibility in the formulationof scientific questions, station planning, equipment deployment,and data interpretation. This multidisciplinary course examinesthe ocean through an integrated study of such topics as: the variationsin the physical-chemical structure of the water column; the abundanceand diversity of biologic populations; and the geologic characteristicsof the sea floor. Regional comparisons along the cruise trackare often combined with more focused research on local phenomenato obtain an understanding of both large- and small-scale features. Student grades are based on written and practical examinations,research performance, and research projects, including oral andwritten reports. Return to the top of this document.

SEA Student Journals I was on watch as Navigator today. I was pleasantly suprisedhow well everything went: the sunsight was confirmed by LORANC, and the dead reckoning plot was right on the money.ï¿½Lisa Port au Prince (Haiti) is great! They are having a two-day Carnival witha parade and everything. There are bands on trucks followed bygirls in costumes throwing candy. People dance in the streetsand it is so noisy and amazing.ï¿½Cindy Today I was Junior Watch Officer. I was responsible for gettingall the sails up, (Main, Fisherman, Jib and Jib Topsail). Mywatchmates were terrific. It's wonderful to witness the physicaland moral support we have learned to give each other.ï¿½Marion November 26 1991, St. Thomas harbor:ï¿½I am writing this on the port bow of the Westward on a beautifuland peaceful tropical night in the Carribean. Anchored just offshore,I am looking at the lights of the city of St. Thomas sprinkledacross the countryside. St. Thomas is much more attractive bynight. As I write, a cruise ship is pulling out of the harbor.It looks like a piece of the city that decided to break looseand sail away.ï¿½Reid I think while going through it I mostly remember the sleep deprivation,but now it is one of the most exciting things I have ever done.ï¿½Cindy I'm finding the lab work much more interesting than I expected. The first time I use the unfamiliar equipment (setting net tows,operating the winch, running titrations, BT slide, Nansen Bottles,etc.) I worry that I'll screw up and break something or ruin ameasurement. I find that the second time I am much more relaxedand the work goes better. I think I learn especially well whenI have to show someone else how to use the equipment.ï¿½Marion On the 13th I got my sea legs. What a terrific day! I felt soliberated from the queasies that plagued me. We sailed into apod of 50-60 minke whales and I climbed the ratlines and watchedfrom above. The whales banked and rolled under the Westward asthey surfed under the swells. At first they appeared as blackand bright aqua objects, then they surfaced and their white flippersbroke the water. Each approaching group of whales brought a crazedcheer of whoops and squeals as everyone scurried about for a bettervantage point.ï¿½Dan We came into Jamaica yesterday morning and anchored off Port Royal.Jamaica is mountainous and more lush than Haiti. Port Royal isa laid-back town that sank in an earthquake in 1692. We loungedaround all day rust-busting and dancing to Jamaican music.ï¿½Cindy I'm thrilled that I seem to have conquered my fear of heights. I've had whale watch up in the rigging three times now and itseems that having a purpose in going aloft makes all the difference. It was quite windy and exciting up there. We changed tacks whileI was standing on the speaders so that, when it was time to comedown, I had to step out on the yardarm, climb around the foremastand come down the ratlines on the new windward tack. No problem,just a series of single steps. Two months ago I wouldn't havebelieved that I could do it.ï¿½Marion Puerto Plata is the type of place you find in a late night moviewith Humphrey Bogart sitting in the bar beneath the large, slowlyrotating ceiling fan. A steamy jungle and a lively hispanic towncomplete the rest of the scene.ï¿½Dan Go to the: Top of this document |Previous Page | Next Page |SEA home page If you've seen enough,click hereWT01-B01-249IA097-001044-B047-106http://sea2.sea.edu:80/journals/jrtop3.htm 206.33.82.2 19970215110121 text/html 5691HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 11:05:20 GMTServer: Microsoft-Internet-Information-Server/1.0Content-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Fri, 15 Nov 1996 14:35:15 GMTContent-Length: 5491 The SEA Education Association ........ SEA Student Journals I plotted our dead reckoning with a series of fixes and reciprocalbearings on shore lights. To my delight, when we turned on theradar set 45 minutes later, we were exactly where I said we wouldbe!ï¿½Marion I feel that we are a group now and everyone fits in somewhere. At times there are minor hassles, but for all practical purposes,everyone is really for everyone else. I'm really going to missthem.ï¿½Josie While hauling in sails, the cry came from the bow, "Help,the jib's torn!" Pat, Peter and I scrambled out onto thebowsprit. The jib was flailing about like a banshee. Our knucklesburned and our sore, calloused fingers yanked at the coarse, wildlyflapping canvas. The bow thundered as it was buried and we clungwith our toes curled around the bow net. The waves rushed overour bodies, raising us off our feet...ï¿½Dan Ginny, who also just woke up, turned and kissed the hutch goodmorning, then turned to me to explain that she was "disoriented."I'm sure that within a short period that we'll know this place in thedark. I can't wait. I already feel like Westward is partly mine.ï¿½Cindy This is my first night on the ship. Everything seems so unreal...imaginary. The information is coming from all directions. Thisis going to be an interesting trip.ï¿½Reid This is so exciting! It started out this morning as we watchedthe sun come up between oxygen titrations in the lab and our firstsighting of land, the incredibly fertile green steep mountainsof Guadalupe Island. It was so beautiful and unimaginable thatI really did gasp when I walked out of the lab.ï¿½Cindy The water was so beautifully blue and it was really suprisinghow many organisms that could be seen just floating. I saw afantastically beautiful ctenophore about the size of my hand. It was so symmetrically delicate with its tiny combs moving inwaves. Ralph and I tried to put it in a jar, but mangled it inthe process. I could've cried - it was so sad.ï¿½Lisa Everything lately has been more demanding and exciting than Iexpected. I think it's a combination of getting close to portand also having more of a command over the vessel that makes youproud of it.ï¿½Cindy Look out Main Saloon, "C" watch is on dawn cleanup!But this is not your average dawn cleanup, but then again, "C"watch is anything but average. Indiana Jones would be proud ofthe way we fought against nature and against all odds in our never-endingquest for a clean ship...ï¿½Zulu I'm the Engineer now and they just started the winch so I've gotto check the battery level pronto. We're doing an extra deep hydrocasthere in a small basin near Jamaica, trying to see if it's anoxicat the bottom which would mean that the water doesn't circulatedown there. So we're going to test the oxyen right away and ifit's negative, they'll send down a Phleger core, expecting tobring up some of that really ripe smelling black mud.ï¿½Cindy Sitting on the bowsprit with the wind beating on my face, watchingthe shooting stars above (seven of them in one hour!). The peoplebelow are sleeping well because they know that we are on deckoperating the ship. It's a good feeling to be responsible forpeople. There's so much to learn and so many mistakes made, buta real sense of accomplishment when you do something right. It'schallenging and sometimes frustrating, but for the most part, exciting.ï¿½Josie Go to the: Top of this document |Previous Page |SEA home page If you've seen enough,click hereWT01-B01-250IA097-001044-B044-39http://sea2.sea.edu:80/shipinfo/daily.htm 206.33.82.2 19970215105124 text/html 1400HTTP/1.0 200 OKDate: Sat, 15 Feb 1997 10:55:29 GMTServer: Microsoft-Internet-Information-Server/1.0Content-Type: text/htmlLast-Modified: Fri, 14 Feb 1997 16:31:13 GMTContent-Length: 1200 SEA Daily Report This section provides current information on the whereaboutsand activities of our vessels.

We want this to be a valuable resource to your home education efforts. While we have made every effort to include information that is "family safe", we do not certify that every link in our website is totally free of information about which your family may have reservations or personal convictions. For example, in The Library you will find a connection to Carrie, the full-text electronic library at the University of Kansas. This electronic library has a vast collection of classic literary works. It also contains a section entitled "Banned Books Online". It is a historical look at many works which, at one time or another, have been banned from libraries around the world. While there are many high quality works available here, there are also several which should be viewed only with parental discretion.You will be surprised to find that it includes books such as The Bible (banned from the Soviet Union from 1926 to 1956) and Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice. Parents, we suggest that you continue to maintain the same discretion with the Internet that you would use in allowing your children to use television, radio, periodicals, and any other library or information source in our society.

Valuable information on a variety of home education topics. Home schooling resources available here for purchase from HSLDA. Where we have been and where we are going! National Center for Home Education: Assists state home schooling organizations and their leaders. An Overview of HSLDA: Purpose Founding History Purpose Each year home schooling families across America receive unfriendly legal contacts from government officials. Whether those contacts lead to court or not, families who fight their legal battles alone face the threat of staggering legal expenses mostly for attorneys' fees. Rather than pay the price of resisting, many families are intimidated into abandoning home schooling. The purpose of the Home School Legal Defense Association is to bring together a large number of home schooling families so that each can have a low-cost method of obtaining quality legal defense. We give families the freedom to home school without the fear of facing legal threats alone. Founding President Michael P. Farris and Vice-President J. Michael Smith are both attorneys who have home schooled their children for over a decade. Together with Texas businessman Jim Carden, they founded HSLDA in 1983 as a service to the entire home schooling community. The present board of directors includes George Stroh from Arizona, Jeff Ethell from Virginia, Kenneth Johnson from Indiana, and Richard Honaker from Wyoming. These men are home schooling fathers who have held leadership positions in state home schooling organizations. Six staff attorneys and a support staff of more than two dozen currently serve our growing membership. In addition to Michael P. Farris and J. Michael Smith, attorneys Christopher J. Klicka, Dewitt T. Black, III, David Gordon, and Scott W. Somerville make up the remainder of the legal staff. These attorneys are among the country's most experienced practitioners in the area of home school law and all are home schooling fathers. Although HSLDA is a Christian organization with a Christian board and staff, we believe it is our duty to advocate the right of all to home school. Membership with HSLDA is in no way limited by the religious views of prospective members. Since its founding, HSLDA has held the position that its responsibility is to protect the interests of every home schooling member family. History Throughout its history HSLDA has experienced God's abundant blessing in protecting home schooling families. Of course, we have not won the victory we wanted in every battle, and an occasional family has had to pay a fine. By God's grace and to His glory, no member family has been forced by a court to stop home schooling. No member family has gone through a trial that resulted in the removal of their children from their home, and no member parent has ever been sentenced to jail. The vast majority of the legal threats member families face are successfully resolved through our early intervention. For those families who end up in court, HSLDA provides full representation at every stage of legal proceedings at no cost to the family. HSLDA's efforts on behalf of home schoolers go beyond defensive actions. We have taken offensive action in prosecuting a number of federal civil rights actions for members at no additional charge. HSLDA has also been able to assist a number of state home schooling organizations, upon their request, with legislative battles within their home states. Additionally, our presence in the Washington, D.C. area has enabled us to track and become involved in federal legal developments of concern to home schoolers. Each year thousands of member families receive legal consultation by letter and phone, hundreds more are represented through negotiations with local officials, and dozens are represented in court proceedings.

Some families do this within a home-based school setting. Others supplement the education that occurs in public or private schools. This Learn@Home site is for all parents and children. It is a resource that all families can use to enhance whatever schooling approach they have chosen. The information found under Using Learn@Home will be useful to all who want to know more about our site, and will help them find the resources they need within its pages. If your family is choosing to pursue more active home education, the information found within Startup Costs and Expectations will be helpful in following that path. Using Learn@Home Startup Costs Expectations Using Learn@Home Learn@Home is a resource that can be used by parents and children alike. Our Begin at Home section can provide valuable information and guidance for parents who are considering full-time home schooling. There you can find information about the monetary costs of home schooling as well as expectations you should have from students, government, and the community. There are always legal issues to consider, and our Legal Issues section under Begin at home should get you started in the right direction with considerations of who to contact and who gets the paperwork. Our After Class section is mostly for the students. In Club Kids we have included TVKids and a list of other web sites that are interesting and educational. TVKids is a reference for educational and entertaining programming. As with all of Learn@Home this area will be growing and changing often. Other sections to look for here in the future will be Computer Kids (an array of computer information), and Bookland (suggested readings for various ages). We also plan to place our Homework Help section here. This will be a place where children can communicate with tutors through message boards and receive help on a number of topics. Available right away is The Arcade, our area for online and offline games. In The Academy we have located The Library, The Locker Room, and The Arts. The Library can provide you with direct links to some of the best online libraries around the world. You may also find sites from time to time here under more specific topics like history or science. The Locker Room can help your family stay connected to the sports world with information ranging from homeschool sports news (coming soon) to major league reviews. The Arts is your place to delve into art, music, and dance. Learn@Home is also building an area called Academic Advisor, where students looking toward college can find reviews of colleges and universities and links to college web sites. The Community is next on our tour. Here are your connections to the many State Associations and National Organizations which are there to assist your education efforts. We also provide the Open line which contains our Global Connections, the link to worldwide missions, and the Weekly Voice, timely articles on topics that YOU want. The Calendar of Events can provide valuable information on upcoming conferences or classes. Coming soon to this section will be the Home Based Business area, which will be a resource area for people operating, or considering, businesses out of their home. Still under construction are the Teachers Corner and the Supply Closet. With the addition of these we hope to provide more comprehensive help in many areas: reviewing teaching materials, purchasing them online, financial resources, finding help with record keeping and time and household management, and even parent to parent communications. Please remember that you can always send us your comments and suggestions by clicking on any of the ï¿½feedbackï¿½ buttons at the bottom of the pages. Back to top of the page. Startup Costs A thorough consideration of the home school environment would not be complete without attention to the cost of starting. This can vary widely, depending on the ages and needs of the child. Basic supplies include the obvious: paper, pens, and pencils. The cost of a comfortable place to study can also vary with the needs of the child. One may work better at a desk and chair while another learns better with less restrictive surroundings. These costs you will need to determine from your own research. One item that many believe to be indispensable is a small to medium size chalk board or dry erase board. Together with an easel to hold it, They could cost $45 to $80. Posters and other educational charts for your school room could add another $10 to $20. A comprehensive curriculum that contains all the needed subjects for early grades should cost between $300 and $500 new. It is also helpful to have on hand teachersï¿½ resource books such as those by Cathy Duffy or Mary Pride. Plan to add another $40 to $80 depending on which one is chosen. Some curriculums work well with and require purchase of manipulatives, flash cards, and other supporting materials. The additional cost should be $15 to $50. One of the best places to start is your state association's yearly curriculum fair. A list of these events can be found under our Calendar of Events. Be aware, though, that while their is a vast amount of useful material out there, you cannot use it all. Start small. Talk to other home schooling parents to see what has worked best for them. Read a few of the many good books available from the home school community. Remember that your home school can be uniquely your own, suited to your family. Do not forget to include memberships when you add your costs together. Your connection to the Home School Legal Defense Association and state and local support groups is worth everything it costs. For around $150 you can have a yearï¿½s membership in HSLDA and two support groups. As you may expect, you can always chose to purchase used curricula and books and supplies at a much lower cost than new. This can be a good way to try several types of home school materials. We will soon be able to provide message boards in the Learn@Home site to help parents communicate needs such as used supplies they have for sale. In addition, our Supply Closet will be growing soon. We will be bringing a variety of home school suppliers to the Internet to provide you with the best of their materials. Donï¿½t forget to read the other information found under Begin@Home; and check out our state and national associations underThe Community. Back to top of the page. Expectations If your family is choosing to pursue full-time home education, expectations of everyone involved need to be considered. Not only are you interested in what to expect of your students, they are wondering what to expect of you, the parent/teacher. Other areas of consideration will be home life, government, and the community. If your family will be home schooling from the beginning of your childrenï¿½s school years, the students have very little basis on which to make a comparison. Probably their only exposure to formal schooling will be comments from older playmates who have already done kindergarten or first grade. In this case you can usually expect excitement and enthusiasm on their part. There should be less fear and apprehension of the unknown school room because the school setting and faces will already be familiar to them: your home and your family. If, however, you will be making a transition from public or private school to home school, some children may have questions about the new situation. They may think they will not be able to see their old friends, or that they will be ï¿½stuckï¿½ at home for weeks on end. Just the opposite is true, of course. Home educated children often enjoy a greater variety of friendships because they are not relegated to spending the majority of their week interacting with only one age group. Their after-school play can be just as rewarding as that of public school children. Because of the additional flexibility involved in home schooling, there will also be numerous opportunities to get out of the home classroom and participate with others in support group activities and field trips, where children will receive more personal attention than in a group of thirty or more in other school settings. What can you expect of your home life if your family decides to home-educate? Of course, your schedule will change, but not necessarily for the worst. The teaching parent can expect less free time and more scheduled parts of the day. Home educating, however, does not usually take as much of the day as does public and private schooling. You can expect a little more flexibility in making your schedule because you wonï¿½t be coordinating with thirty other families every day. One of the best benefits is more overall family time together. The other parent can expect to be involved more than the public schooling parents, simply because there are more opportunities to do so in home education. Government expectations are another area of consideration. Depending on the laws of your state, home schooled children are often held to a much higher standard than their counterparts in the public schools. By and large, home educated children often greatly exceed these standards. The individual attention that these children can receive is a world of difference from the one-size-fits-all approach of the public school system. The government attitude and requirements vary from state to state and even from county to county. Some local school boards are quite helpful while others are a bit suspicious or even discouraging. The best source of information in this area would be the state home education associations and the local support groups. A listing of these can be found in our Community pages under State Associations. The state and local groups for your area can be a valuable resource, and should be some of the first places to contact if your family is considering home education. Expectations of and from your community and neighborhood can be varied. In general, people are quite curious about home-educating families. Many expect these children to be better behaved, and it is usually the case. Many will be envious of the quality and quantity time that the home school family enjoys together. Sometimes neighbors will be annoyed because their children want to be taught at home as well. Some will wonder if the children will be socially deprived, unable to communicate outside the home. Just the opposite is the case. Home taught children are frequently quite adept at handling a great variety of social situations because their weeks can be filled with more varied activities than in many public schools. These children routinely interact with a wide age range of people, as opposed to public school children who have only their peer age group in which to learn. This discussion is by no means exhaustive. There are several excellent books on the market that can help to clarify all of these expectations. ï¿½Home Grown Kidsï¿½ by Ray and Dorothy Moore is a great place to start. Also, ï¿½A Survivorï¿½s Guide to Home Schoolingï¿½ by Luanne Shackelford and Susan White, can be a valuable resource. These are only two of the numerous books and resources that are available to families considering home education. We hope to include a wide variety of tools such as these in our Supply Closet in the near future. Overall, home education can be an exciting experience for everyone involved. Donï¿½t set your expectations too high; parents and children are human. There will be good days and bad days just like in any other family. Set your expectations high enough to look forward to a positive, family-building, and rewarding experience for everyone involved. Back to top of the page.

Who to contact / Who gets paperwork In our modern world filled with forms and paperwork, home education is not exempt. All states across our country have some requirement of notification and filing for home schooling families. Unfortunately, those requirements can vary from state to state with differing levels of enforcement from county to county. The first place to make contact if your family is considering home schooling should be one of your state associations and/or local support groups. These organizations keep themselves well apprised of the local requirements. They will know who to contact and who gets any required forms and notification. The other contact that should be made is with the Home School Legal Defense Association. All of these groups have a place of their own in our Community section. These contacts are invaluable in keeping up with the legal requirements of home education.

Example of an Alert About National Center for Home Education National Center for Home Education Founded in 1990 by the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), the National Center for Home Education assists state home schooling organizations and their leaders by providing services which are difficult for many organizations to provide for themselves. HSLDA fully funds the National Center and makes its services available free to state home school leaders. First, National Center serves the needs of state organizations by preparing and mailing packets of key information to hundreds of home school leaders throughout the country. Groups then distribute this information through home school support groups or state newsletters. In addition, National Center hosts an annual leadership seminar, which is attended by home school leaders from across the nation. Attendees exchange ideas, learn strategies, and fellowship with other state leaders. National Center also hosts several regional conferences for home school support leaders each year throughout the country. These workshops effectively train support group leaders in the latest legal and legislative developments. In November of 1992, National Center established the Congressional Action Program (CAP) in response to the anti-family agenda of the Clinton administration. CAP is made up of nearly 100 home school parents and teenagers from Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, who have been trained by National Center personnel to lobby for home school-related issues. The second half of CAP is made up of home schoolers in each of the 435 Congressional Districts. These home schoolers are notified by "fax alerts" with necessary information to start phone trees and other "fax alerts" within their congressional districts. This enables National Center to generate calls to congressmen from their own constituents. The CAP system was heavily tested with the H.R.6 scare in February 1994. The amendment which would have required home schoolers and private schools to use certified teachers was defeated by over 1 million calls home schoolers made to Capitol Hill, breaking all records! CAP battles attempts by the federal government to regulate and control children and parents such as mandatory immunization bills, H.R.6, and the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. It also assists in spearheading the passage of positive legislation such as the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act and child welfare system reform. National Center works on special public relations projects, serving as a clearing house of major home school research and other news and resources regarding home schooling. For instance, National Center arranged with Riverside Publishing to compile the test scores of over 16,000 home school children throughout the country. This was the largest survey of the performance of home schoolers' academic acheivement. The results showed that the typical home schooler scored in the top third of the nation. To complement its service to the home school community, National Center produces position papers and analyses of federal issues relevant to home education which it makes available to state leaders, HSLDA members, and the public. Some of the larger information packets are available for a small fee to cover in-house costs.

Teaching specific philosophical or religious values, controlling social interactions, developing close families, and high level academics are the most common reasons for home schooling. One researcher (Knowles, 1988) has linked the life histories (e.g, positive or negative experiences) of parents to their rationales for home educating their own children. Home educators are able to be flexible and tailor the curriculum to the needs of their children. Academics A nationwide study (Ray, 1990), using a random sample of 1,516 families from one organization's membership, found home educated students to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80th percentile in all areas on standardized achievement tests. Note: The national average on standardized achievement tests is the 50th percentile. Wartes (1989) found that home school students in Washington consistently score at the 66th percentile on the Stanford Achievement Test, with their strongest scores in science, listening, vocabulary, and word reading. Home education students in Montana scored at the 72nd percentile on standardized achievement tests (Ray, 1990). The State of Tennessee (1988) reported that the home educated in that state averaged about the 83rd percentile in reading and about the 77th percentile in math on standardized achievement tests. The state of Oregon (1988) found that 73% of the home school students who were tested scored above average. Note: The national average is for 50% to score above average. The research findings are consistent that the home educated do equal to or better than conventional school students on achievement tests. Social and Emotional Adjustment Dr. Johnson (1991) concluded that home educators carefully address the socialization needs of their children in every area studied (i.e., personal identity, personal destiny, values and moral development, autonomy, relationships, sexuality, and social skills). Studying actual observed behavior, Dr. Shyers (1992) found the home educated had significantly lower problem behavior scores than do their conventional school agemates. And the home educated have positive self-concepts. Dr. Taylor (1986) found that the home educated have significantly higher self concepts than those in public schools. The home schooled are well adjusted socially and emotionally like their private school comparison group. The home educated, however, are less peer dependent than the private school students (Delahooke, 1986). Dr. Montgomery (1989) found that home schooled students are just as involved in out-of-school and extracurricular activities that predict leadership in adulthood as are those in the comparison private school (that was comprised of students more involved than those in public schools).

This message is adapted from his remarks to the National Christian Home Educators Leadership Conference on October 7, 1995. It has been slightly revised for presentation to a more general audience. I know that each one of you feels like there is a great tug-of-war going on between your family responsibilities and the other demands of life, and that you are the rope. I want you to know that I feel your pain! When folks find out that I am a pastor and the father of nine, one of the common questions they ask is, "Is it hard to balance the two?" And I can honestly say to this question that it is excruciatingly hard. I feel torn every day. Everything in my life seems to be screaming at me, "I need more of you!" I am pulled in many directions, and there is nothing in my life that I give as much attention to as I feel is necessary to do a really good job. Nothing! Not my health, not my family, not my sermons, not my friendships, not my congregation, not the education of my children, not my marriage, not my parents, not the youth soccer team that I coach, not my yard. Nothing! But I have come to the conclusion that if it were not hard, then that would be a sure sign that I am failing. It must be hard. It is supposed to be hard. There is a certain painful but healthy tension that exists in the lives of those who strive to please God in the balancing of their priorities. I know you feel that pain, and I also feel it. You do not have before you today a man who has mastered this balancing act. Nor do you have a man who always lives up to the very standards he will be setting forth today. But you do have a man who feels the tension. And you are looking at a man who desires very deeply to live according to how God would have him live, as a child of God, as a husband, as a father, as a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The Principle of Priorities I don't really believe that the importance of living by priorities has to be proven to any of you from Scripture. One of the undeniable characteristics of Christianity is that it teaches that some things are more important than others. It is a part of the very fabric of Christianity to teach us what is of first importance and what is of secondary importance, and what is of no importance. Jesus said, "Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness," "First take the plank out of your own eye," "First be reconciled to your brother and then come and lay your gift before the altar," "First clean the inside of the cup and then the outside will be clean as well." He scolded the Pharisees for being preoccupied with the tiny matters of the law and neglecting the weightier matters. Elsewhere He said that the greatest commandment is to love God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength. Clearly God calls us to live by certain priorities, to give some things first attention above other things. I want also to say something about the value of talking about priorities. There are many things that could be said. I will mention only two. The first is that order does not occur spontaneously. It is something we must impose on the creation. If we don't think about priorities, if we don't work on our priorities, we won't live by them. If you just go along with what is demanded of you, you will lead a life of chaos and irresponsibility. God calls us to take dominion over our lives as His servants, not just be slaves of the urgent. The second is that although there is pain involved in living by priorities, the pain of not living by them is many times greater. There is pain involved in saying 'no' to things you would love to buy in order to say 'yes' to the more boring obligations like mortgage payments and car insurance and eggs. But in the long run the pain is far greater if you spend the money which should have been set aside. Priorities are not just a test which a demanding God has set up in order to see if we are really worthy of His favor. Priorities are guidelines given to us by a heavenly Father who loves us enough to show us how to prosper in our lives. He wants us to avoid the traps of our enemy because He is zealous for us to flourish and grow and enjoy all the blessings He has prepared for us in this life and in the life to come. Watching out for Number One Today I am here to talk about the balancing of two priorities in particular: our responsibilities as parents and our ministry as home school leaders. But there is something both of these priorities are dependant on, something without which all of our efforts in family and in every other area of life are futile. After all, we serve God because we are His children, we are not His children because we serve Him. Now the notion of "watching out for number one" might raise red flags in your minds. And Christians rightly react to the idea of watching out for number one (i.e. taking care of me). In one sense it is the epitome of self-centeredness. But there is a degree of truth in this concept. There can be nothing on this earth more important to a man than the care and shepherding of his own soul. For the condition of a man's soul is the most important thing on this earth: making sure our hearts are right, making sure we are rightly relating to God, making sure we are being and thinking and doing what we are supposed to before God. "Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength." This is the greatest commandment. The Great Commission was not given this distinction. Nor was the Golden Rule. Those titles were invented by men who wanted to draw attention to important commands of Jesus. But Jesus Himself said that the greatest commandment is to love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. This must be the first priority of every man. You can do everything else right, but if you miss this one thing, it is all in vain. Jesus said, "What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, but lose or forfeit his own soul?" When a man dies, he leaves everything behind. He leaves his possessions, he leaves his house, his loved ones, his fame. He even leaves his body. He leaves everything, except his soul. His soul appears completely naked before God. I said earlier that my life is filled with demands. And it is that way with most of us. We are virtually drowning in responsibilities. Children, spouse, job, church, friends, relatives, health, finances, house repairs, projects, ministry to others. Many things are screaming for our attention. But there is one thing that does not scream loud enough to compete with all the other voices. It is our souls. Souls do not cry out and say, "Fix me!" or "Feed me!" Oh, sure, we know that we ought to take good care of our souls, we ought to cultivate them and nourish them and rest them. But it's something that can wait until tomorrow, whereas these other things are pressing us for attention today, if not yesterday. And so it is put aside, day after day. And the thorns*the worries and cares of this world*slowly and subtly squeeze the spiritual life out of us. Little by little, Jesus gets squeezed out of our lives, and we don't even realize it. After a while the love of Christ is a distant thing to us, the inner enjoyment of His lovingkindness becomes a mere memory. We become strangers to His tender embrace. At least at first we keep trying to obey God, even though we have stopped enjoying God and feeling God. My friends, no one ever accuses me of being an emotionalistic person, nor of having an emotionalistic theology. But I can tell you that the farther a Christian gets away from the thrill of God's grace, the farther he gets away from spiritual well-being, and the closer he comes to blatant disobedience or even giving up on the faith altogether. If you want to glorify God in your home and in your labors, it is not going to happen apart from a regular, deep, rich drinking of the sweet refreshing nectar of the love of Jesus Christ. Your work and your service are not enough. He wants your heart, He wants your affection. And so over time we grow empty inside, depleted, exhausted, worn out; we feel like we have nothing left to give. And, my friends, God allows us to feel that way. He could keep filling us in spite of our neglect, but He doesn't. When we neglect Him He doesn't want us to feel strong and healthy. He wants us to feel weak and powerless. The soul can be assaulted*when some evil is allowed into our hearts which carries us away into sin in a very short time. But the soul can also die of starvation or disease resulting from malnutrition. When our souls are poorly fed, they are weak. And when they are weak, they are vulnerable, they are not strong enough to endure an attack or an illness. And the problem is never that we give too much, the problem is that we don't receive enough from the Lord. After a long and wearisome day the disciples said to Jesus, "Send them away so that they can get food." But Jesus replied, "You give it to them." Every day you do not fall on your face before God and cry out in desperation for His help you are saying, along with the Laodiceans, "'I am rich, have become wealthy, and have need of nothing' . . . and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked" (Revelation 3:17). We usually think that the reason we don't have good devotional lives is because of a problem with self-discipline or busy-ness or distraction, etc. But really the problem is pride. We think that we don't need Him, we think that we can live without Him, we think we can get through the day without His help. And so we don't fall on our faces each day and cry out for His mercy. How Do We Do It? How does one take care of a soul? It really isn't all that complicated. There is no big secret. It is just doing the things we already know we should be doing. Don't pretend you don't know what to do: that's no excuse. Almost always neglect of the soul happens apart from a conscious choice, but rather as a result of a million little decisions over a long period of time. Jesus has a fabulous feast for us but each day we decide that we are too busy to come. Or He has a wonderful word for us but we are too preoccupied with other things to listen. God is the One who gives bread in the wilderness, who turns the desert into a garden. Jesus is the living water. He is the manna from heaven. God is speaking, God is feeding, God is comforting, but we just aren't tapping into it. And this can happen to those who are up to their eyeballs in Christian ministry. Remember Mary and Martha when Jesus was at their house. Martha was scurrying around preparing the meal while Mary sat at Jesus' feet and listened. After a while Martha spoke to Jesus, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!" Do you remember Christ's response? "Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her." Would Jesus say to us, "You are worried and upset about so many things, but really only one thing is needed"? Let those words reverberate in your mind, tie them around your fingers and write them on the door posts of your life: only one thing is needed!! Remember the letter of Jesus to the church of Ephesus in Revelation 2:I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance, and that you cannot endure evil men, and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and you found them to be false; and you have perseverance and have endured for My name's sake, and have not grown weary. But I have this against you, that you have left your first love. We must never put activity at the center of our lives, even if it is good activity. Trusting Jesus Christ must always be placed at the heart of our lives: making time to talk with God, thanking, meditating, sharing our feelings with Him, preparing and then preaching little mini-sermons to ourselves from Scripture, giving time to real relationships with God's people, taking time to talk with our spouses about the deep things on your mind and heart, taking time to pray with our spouses, taking time to remember Jesus, time to rekindle your first love. It doesn't take a genius to keep a fire going: but it does take attention, it does take consistent watching and feeding and readjusting. Who is tending the fire of your heart? Is it burning strong or is it smoldering? A couple of years ago my wife and I were driving through a posh neighborhood in Potomac, Maryland. The homes were palatial and the yards were magnificent. We were awestruck, until suddenly we came upon one house where the grass was knee-high and the hedges were ungroomed and the house was in disrepair. No one planned it that way. If we had stopped and knocked on the door, they would not have said, "O we prefer the grass that way, and we like the abstract look when it comes to shrubs and hedges." That's just what naturally happens when things are neglected. Likewise, if you don't consciously give time and attention to grow your soul, it just doesn't grow. If we could suddenly see each other's souls, what would yours look like? Overgrown with weeds? Parched with thirst? Cold ashes with no fire? So much attention goes into making sure the outward life looks right, but what about the rightness of the soul? There are many who have a wonderful life on the exterior but are empty inside. They spend no time cultivating the inner life. They won't sit still long enough to step back and look at their lives from a distance, to view the whole picture. They are so caught up in the affairs of the here and now that they neglect the eternal perspective. How about you? Do you ever just stop? Do you ever just be still? Do you ever stop working long enough to enjoy what God has done*or to meditate on who God is? This isn't just the right thing to do for ourselves, it is the right thing to do for our families and for our ministries. The first duty of each of us to our spouse and our children and to everyone else around us is to set before them an example of someone who seeks first the kingdom, who loves God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength. And the thing that your family and your church and your country and the home schooling movement needs most of all is the godliness of your soul. You don't just care for your own soul first because it is the right thing to do, you also do it because how you live is going to have a greater impact on others you want to influence than what you say. You can talk about the importance of the Bible all day long, but if you are not reading it, if you're not letting it pierce your heart and convict your soul and rearrange your life on a daily basis, that is going to speak louder than all your words. We could get the whole world home schooling, but if it is apart from Christ, it is all in vain. What a force the home schooling movement would be, or what a force even the people in this room would be, if each of us lived in close intimacy with Jesus Christ! Now only in that context is it safe to move on to talk about our responsibilities to others. Practicing What We Preach Why have I entitled this section, "Practicing What We Preach"? Well, I am a preacher. I get up in the pulpit each Sunday morning and preach the Word of God to the people. But really all of us are preachers. We send a message, we make a statement by the things we give ourselves to. And home educators, by choosing to serve the Lord in this way, are preaching a message of dedication to family. The most important sermon a pastor preaches is not preached in the pulpit. It is the sermon of his life, the sermon of his example. If I go around fretting all the time, it doesn't matter how powerfully I preach on the peace of Christ, I have communicated to the people that it doesn't work. If I talk about loving your wife but treat my own wife disrespectfully, then I more than undo my witness. The same thing is true for you. You communicate not only by your willingness to be involved in home schooling, nor by the things you say to others. You communicate most of all by what you do with your own children. The best thing you can do for the home education movement (apart from caring for your own soul) is to do a good job raising your own children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. And I would argue that this is also the best thing you can do for our nation as a whole. We cannot hide what we are. And what we are speaks louder than what we say. There are three places in the Scripture that I want to look at in light of this: - 1 - Unless the Lord builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the Lord guards the city, The watchman keeps awake in vain. It is vain for you to rise up early, To retire late, To eat the bread of painful labors; For He gives to His beloved [even in his] sleep. (Psalm 127:1-2) Now being busy is a good thing. Of course, you can be too busy. But God wants us to be busy in the work of the Lord. Jesus was busy, Paul was busy. They had lots to do and they did it. They often worked long days. But this passage makes it clear that God does not want us to live in a frenzy. There are two possible interpretations of the last phrase in this passage. It either means that God gives sleep to His beloved ones (meaning that sleep is a gift of God to be enjoyed by His children). Or it means that He gives to His beloved ones even in their sleep (meaning that even as they sleep God is providing for His own). Whichever is the correct understanding, we can learn several things from this passage. First, there is a tendency to work too hard. In Proverbs 31 and elsewhere we see the virtue of hard work: rising early, retiring late. But here we see that there comes a point where this industriousness becomes counter-productive and unhealthy. It is not done in trusting service of God but out of worry and fear or out of personal ambition. It becomes bitter instead of joyful. Second, we see that overworking is vain. It doesn't work. It doesn't do any good. The key to success is not the amount of time you put in. It is how faithful you are to the Lord in what you do. He can send the devourer to destroy our greatest efforts (e.g. Tower of Babel). He can bless a little given righteously (e.g. the loaves and the fishes). If you are working harder than God wants you to work, then you are actually working against your success. Your labors are in vain. It's possible to get up early and work your head off all day long and go to bed late and it's all in vain, because the Lord is not building the house. The Lord wants us to work in trust*not as if the whole world is dependant on us. "He gives to His loved ones [even in their] sleep." - 2 - [An elder must be] one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity, but if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God? . . . Let deacons be husbands of only one wife, and good managers of their children and their own households. (1 Timothy 3:4, 5, 12) Notice how these verses do not require success in the work place or even ministerial service in the church, but they are very stringent about success at home. Doesn't this say something about how God thinks about the family? He wants that realm secured first, then you can go out and do ministry. - 3 - Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one! And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart; and you shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up. (Deuteronomy 6:4)7) This not only assigns a duty to Christian parents, it also assumes that parents are going to be sitting and teaching their children, that they are going to be sitting around the house talking to them, that they are going to be walking down the street with them, and that they are going to be around when they are going to bed and rising up again in the morning. An essential part of our responsibility towards our children is to give them our time and love. This is not just a matter of giving preeminence to family over ministry. It is a matter of doing the most important part of your ministry before the less important parts. What is the most important duty of a pastor? To care for the souls entrusted to Him by God. Who are the most important souls to watch over? His own and those of his family, of course. So if I fail to care for my family, I am failing in my ministry as well. The same thing is true for you. What is your first duty to others: neighbors, friends, relatives, brothers and sisters in Christ? To be a good example. To show them how to live by living out the life of Christ yourself, before you worry about teaching them formally or whatever else it is you do. Your family is the first part of your ministry, just as is true for my family in my congregation. The Greatest Time Waster of All If it comes to this, I must be more willing to fail as a pastor than as a father. I must prefer the possibility of being seen as a failure as a pastor and being a faithful father, rather than to be a flop as a father but supposedly a success as a pastor. What would you want in a pastor, a man who takes care of his family, even if it means he does less ministry, or one who neglects his family for the sake of the ministry? But it hardly ever comes to this! When we neglect our souls or our families, it usually seems like a time problem or a schedule problem. But the central problem is never around us, it is within us. In the last days of Samuel the Israelites sought a king like the other nations had. They were dissatisfied with the established order when in reality the problem was the condition of their hearts. And it's our tendency also to think that our problem is wrapped up in the established system, in the structure, in the circumstances. Often adjustments do need to be made in the system but, by and large, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll see that the real problem isn't the system, the real problem is us. It is not our schedule, it is not our load of responsibilities. We are the problem. It is our sinful response to busy-ness that is the problem, not the busy-ness itself. It's the impatience. It's the anger. It's the intolerance. We get frustrated and exasperated at work, and we bring it with us when we're with the family. We are short and intolerant and impatient with them. Or perhaps we are so far behind in something that we get anxious and afraid. And that comes out in being distracted and preoccupied, instead of giving real love and attention to our families. And the time we could have invested in loving them and communicating with them and teaching them wisdom instead we are using to damage them. Actually, sin is the biggest time-waster of all. If you feel a need for more time, the best thing to do is just stop sinning. Think about how much time we could free up if we stopped eating what we shouldn't eat and reading what we shouldn't read and watching what we shouldn't watch. And what if we stopped being lazy? How much time do we waste squabbling with our spouses and spending money for things we shouldn't have bought and worrying about things we cannot control and getting ourselves out of all sorts of messes caused by sin? It is often not a problem of not having the time, it is how we are using the time. Paul says in Ephesians 5:15)16, "be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil." Have you ever been rushing somewhere in the car only to look down at your gas gauge to see that it is on empty? You say to yourself, "I don't have time to stop for gas." But then another part of you says, "You think you're late now!" Unlike filling up the gas tank, filling up the love tanks of your family rarely seems urgent. And if we are driven by urgency, we'll never get to it. There will eventually come a time when loving and spending time with your family will seem urgent. Unfortunately, it usually appears urgent only after it is too late. I'm a specialist at: "Wait 'til this project is over, then I'll have more time to spend with the family." But it never seems to come! Tomorrow never occurs (by the time tomorrow comes, it's not tomorrow anymore). There may be times when God puts you in a situation where you must give all your time to it, from early in the morning until late at night. But oh, the danger of that becoming the pattern of your life, so that it is not just one project, but a lifestyle of neglect! We only have our children for a short time; at nine or ten years old it's about half over! This short time is made up of twenty-four hour segments, most of which is used up by necessities (sleep, dressing, eating, brushing, washing). Only a few hours each day are left for us to invest in our children in a focussed way. We only have a certain amount of time, a limited number of opportunities allotted to us here on the earth. It will not last forever. It may not even last past today. We don't have much time!!!! Do you ever hold still long enough to look your kids in the eye and find out how they're doing? Or do you always have work on your mind? These are the good old days: cherish them while you have them! Cherish them before it's too late! Before you know it, they'll be gone and you won't be able to get them back! If you neglect your children in their early years, you may find that your bond with them is weak and there is little to build on as they get older. And when you have to go away or can't come home in time for dinner or can't be there to say goodnight to them, tell them how painful it is to miss those times with them. Call them from wherever you are and tell them how much you are thinking about them and missing them. We need to give our kids layer upon layer upon layer of evidence and proof of our love for them, so much so that, if a time comes when that love is challenged and questioned by peers or by wanting one thing very much which you say no to, there is absolutely no escape for them in the theory that Dad and Mom really don't love me. They can think our thinking is messed up*let them think it. And let them think that we are misunderstanding the situation*that's fine. But don't ever let them think that we don't love them and want the best for them. Say later on your child falls for some guy or gal and you say 'no.' What is it going to be like in that day? If you have left enough of a question in their mind about your love, then your child will be susceptible to the temptation to run off with that person against your wishes, because it is easier to convince himself or herself of that other young person's love than of yours. I would like to end by reading the words of the song by Harry Chapin, "The Cat's in the Cradle." My child arrived just the other day, He came into the world in the usual way But there were planes to catch and bills to pay He learned to walk while I was away And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it And as he grew he'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, Dad, you know I'm gonna be like you." And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, Little boy blue and the man in the moon. "When ya comin' home, Dad?" "I don't know when, But we'll get together then. You know we'll have a good time then." My son turned ten just the other day He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad! Come on let's play! Can you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not today. I got a lot to do." He said, "That's OK." And he walked away, But his smile never dimmed. It said, "I'm gonna be like him. You know I'm gonna be just like him." And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, Little boy blue and the man in the moon. "When ya comin' home, Dad?" "I don't know when, But we'll get together then. You know we'll have a good time then." Well, he came home from college just the other day So much like a man that I just had to say, "Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for awhile?" He shook his head and he said with a smile, "What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys. See you later, can I have them please?" And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, Little boy blue and the man in the moon. "When ya comin' home, Dad?" "I don't know when, But we'll get together then. You know we'll have a good time then." I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, "I'd like to see you, if you don't mind."

Chesterton remarked: "Educational conferences are always interesting, for the simple reason that under the title of Education you can discuss anything whatever that comes into your head." I urge you to remember that general rule, if my talk this evening strays in odd directions. Dr. Allan Carlson is the President of The Rockford Institute. This message is adapted from his keynote address to the National Christian Home Educators Leadership Conference on October 4, 1995. One of the more perceptive American writers is the Kentucky farmer, poet, and novelist Wendell Berry. In an essay written about ten years ago, included in his collection What Are People For?, Mr. Berry describes the now dominant relationship of schooling to family: According to the new norm, the child's destiny is not to succeed the parents, but to outmode them . . . The schools are no longer oriented to a cultural inheritance that it is their duty to pass on unimpaired, but to the career, which is to say the future of the child . . . [H]e or she is educated to leave home . . . School systems innovate as compulsively and as eagerly as factories. It is no wonder that, under these circumstances, educators' tend to look upon parents as bad influences and wish to take the children away from home as early as possible. And many parents, in truth, are now finding their children an encumbrance at home, where there is no useful work for them to do, and are glad enough to turn them over to the state for the use of the future . . . The local schools no longer serve the local community; they serve the government's economy and the economy's government. Part of my purpose this evening will be to explain why these observations by Mr. Berry are generally true. But I am also aware that this audience is very different. Of equal importance is the fact that a gathering of home education leaders, such as this, could not have occurred twenty-five years ago. In 1970, the practice of home education could be found, of course, but mostly among scattered eccentrics, often tied to "the counterculture," or among special cases, such as American families living overseas. For an historian, the obvious question becomes: Why now? Put another way: What historical forces and accidents combined to create a "home school movement" in 1995, one embracing hundreds of thousands of families, and over one million American children? To gain a full answer, I believe, we must reach back 150 years into the American past. Before 1840, let us remember, the vast majority of Americans*over 90 percent*lived on farms or in small villages: the life of the cottage. While many adults had a specialized trade, most households aimed at*and commonly achieved*self sufficiency in food, clothing, and other essentials. Even many so-called "urban" families of the day kept a cow, a few pigs, chickens, and a kitchen garden. American families in the pre-1840 period commonly preserved their own meat and vegetables, and prepared their own meals. They spun and wove their own cloth, and sewed their own clothing. They made the chairs they sat in, the candles that gave them light, and they either walked or rode their own horses and drove their own wagons. As one historian has phrased it, these Americans raised and educated their children to succeed them, not just to succeed. By age five, children were active participants in the work of the household, as were elderly or unmarried kin. Husbands and wives were bound together in a partnership of home-centered work; they specialized in tasks, to be sure, but each needed the other to create the self-sufficient home, which they believed to be essential to their dignity and liberty. Divorce was out of the question. Children were everywhere, with the average family counting seven. Family loyalties rested not only on love and emotional companionship, but also on need: wife and husband, child and parent were functionally intertwined. Phrased another way, these household economies operated on the principle of sharing: from each according to his or her ability, to each according to his or her need. This American world began to change, about 1840, as industrialists harnessed the logic of the division of labor to the steam engine and to finance capital. The results included a considerable increase in productive efficiency, an accelerated output of goods such as wheels, shoes, and clothing, and a sharp lowering of their costs relative to the work of cobblers, tailors, smiths, and other displaced craftsmen. Decentralized, small, family-held enterprises gave way to large, centralized, joint-stock, limited liability firms. What economist Joseph Schumpeter has called "the creative destruction" of modern capitalism had begun its work. The impact on the family was mostly negative. Although families could now purchase an array of cheaper consumer goods, much of this new freedom represented the surrender of productive family functions such as candlemaking, food processing, and weaving to the industrial sphere. It also meant moving the family production of goods, normally uncounted, into a cash nexus, where it would be counted, and transformed into profit (and, later, into taxes as well). In addition, the employer in the factory had no obvious economic reason to consider family ties in labor questions. Some, then as now, felt a moral obligation to pay heads-of-households a so-called "family wage," sufficient to support a normal family at home. But the immediate interest of employers lay in keeping wages low and the pool of potential workers large. In most cases, wives, husbands, and children would compete against each other in the sale of their labor, driving wages toward the level of individual subsistence. In this new order, the home became separated from the factory and the office, a revolutionary shift in human living patterns. People now worked in one place*what we would someday call their "work station"*and slept in another. With mothers and fathers pulled out of the "cottage," the care of children became a social question; again, something altogether new in human affairs. Time for tending the cottage garden or the family cow disappeared, and families were forced to enter the market to buy all of their food. In general terms, the ownership of productive property such as land and tools gave way to a reliance on cash wages and factory-produced goods. Economic loyalties were no longer rooted in family relationships, but increasingly on the employing firm, which was, after all, the source of the cash needed for subsistence. In 1898, the feminist economist Charlotte Perkins Gilman concluded, with glee, that home production had already been reduced in most urban families to but three functions: cleaning, cooking, and early child care. There was reason to believe, she added, that these three functions would also be industrialized in the new 20th century, and she described*in 1898 I repeat*a future world of fast food restaurants, commercialized day care centers, and professional cleaning services that is disturbingly familiar. Over these same years, 1840 to 1940, the modern social welfare state took form as it, too, claimed nurturing functions that had throughout human history belonged to the family. The first and most important of these transferred functions was education. Beginning in the 1840's, in the same time and place as early industrialization, the common school movement, backed by compulsory education laws, took children out of the home for moral and practical training. Established in Massachusetts under the tulelage of Horace Mann, the Movement in its early years aimed at the indoctrination of immigrant Catholic children into the liberal Unitarianism of the Boston elite. After the Civil War, the New England system would be imposed on the defeated South, as a tool of political reconstruction. By 1900, the Movement adopted the sentimental, atheistic socialism of John Dewey and his colleagues at the Columbia Teachers' College. The consistent goal was state control of children. As one turn-of-the-century school inspector in South Carolina explained, "The schools exist primarily for the benefit of the state rather than for the benefit of the individual. The state seeks to make every citizen intelligent and serviceable." More recently, Princeton university sociologist Norman Ryder has described (appropriately enough, in the United Nations Bulletin on Population) the basic challenge posed by state schools to the family. "[State] education of the junior generation is a subversive influence . . . The reinforcement of the [family] control structure is undermined when the young are trained outside the family for specialized roles in which the father has no competence . . . Political organizations, like economic organizations, demand loyalty and attempt to neutralize family particularism. There is a struggle between the family and the state for the minds of the young." In this conflict, Ryder continues, the state school serves as "the chief instrument for teaching citizenship, in a direct appeal to the children over the heads of their parents." The public school also is the medium for communicating a "state morality" and a state mythology to replace those of family and religious faiths. This aggressive social welfare state siezed other family functions as well. For example, the years near 1840 also marked the advent of the American legal concept of parens patriae, or "the parenthood of the state." Twisting ancient English chancery law to new purpose, a Pennsylvania court used the term to justify the siezure and incarceration of children, over the protests of families, when the natural parents were deemed "unequal to the task of education or unworthy of it." Reform schools, the "child saving" movement, the juvenile justice system, and the vast child abuse and neglect apparatus, all built on the parens patriae, representing as it did the family's surrender of its protective functions to the state. Child labor laws, despite their benign appearance, further expanded the modern state's socialization of children's time. Parents' control over the training and future of their children, advocates said, must be subordinated to the higher interests and superior wisdom of the government bureau, and the family retreated again. The creation of state-level pension programs, and ultimately of the national Social Security system, dismantled other basic functions of the family economy: security between the generations and care of the ill and infirm. Until modern times, grown children and other relatives provided security and support to elderly persons without resources. Adults bore an obligation, moral as well as social and legal, to care for their own; and they also knew that their personal security might depend someday on the children they had reared and on the example they had set in giving care to their own aged and infirm parents. New systems of state pensions and health insurance shattered these security bonds between the generations of a family. Indeed, since the state now funded pensions and nursing care through general payroll taxes, the incentives toward children actually reversed. A person would be ahead if he avoided children altogether: "let others raise the children who will support me in my old age," became the new and ruthlessly correct logic. From the 1840's thru the 1930's, then, the modern state and the industrial sector grew side by side, strange allies in constructing a new way of life on the wreckage of a family-centered world. The supposed opposition between industry and government, a theme underlying much of our standard political mythology, was*so far as the family is concerned*mere illusion. Applying a rough metaphor, the state and the factory might better be viewed as two jackals quarreling over the body of the natural family and the scraps of its shattered economy. During those one hundred years, 1840 to 1940, we can also chart a steady decline in the quality of American family life. Divorce*virtually unknown at the beginning of this period*showed a steady increase in frequency. The average age of first marriage, for both men and women, climbed as well, as the practical logic for entering a marital union weakened. Most dramatically, the birthrate steadily declined, from an average of seven children per family to about two by the early 1930's. There is direct evidence here of cause and effect. For example, demographic historians have shown that the spread of state schooling was a principal cause of family shrinkage. U.S. data from 1871 to 1900 reveal a remarkably strong negative relationship between the fertility of white women and an index of public school expansion, a bond evident even in rural districts where children still bore some positive economic value. Indeed, these calculations show that for each additional month that rural children spent in a state school, the average size of affected families declined by .23 children. This is the most direct evidence that I have seen of how state education liberally consumes children. Laments about the crisis of the family were heard in the early twentieth century. A disturbed genius named Ralph Borsodi described the situation in his 1929 book, This Ugly Civilization: The large family is [now] an economically handi-capped family. Every additional child is merely an additional handicap. In the family of today the children, the aged, and the home-staying women are on the liability side of the family balance sheet; only the actual moneymakers are on the asset side. Hence the family of today tends to restrict the number of its children; to shift the responsibility for caring for its aged relatives to public institutions; to drive even the wife and mother out of the home into money-making and to place its infirm and crippled members in hospitals of various kinds. With a keen eye, Borsodi also described how the modern position of children as "economic catastrophes" for families must lead to ever more contraception, abortion, and sterilization. Family renewal, he said, could come only if families became functional again, with the home rebuilt as "an economically creative institution." He even understood that education would be the key to restoring "normal family living" in productive households. But at this critical point in his argument, Borsodi's confidence in the family failed, and he called instead for "superior men" to impose family values by gaining control of existing government schools. Such voices, in any case, had little effect at the time. More characteristic were advocate/scholars such as Arthur Calhoun, who concluded in his influential Social History of the American Family, first published in 1917: "American history consummates the disappearance of the wider familism and the substitution of the parentalism of society . . . [Children now pass] into the custody of community experts who are qualified to perform the complexer functions of parenthood . . . which the [natural] parents have neither the time nor knowledge to perform." Startling all observers, though, family renewal of a sort actually did come in the middle decades of the 20th century, roughly from 1940 to 1965. In light of the accelerating family decline of the prior 100 years, the statistics from the 1940's and 1950's are truly astonishing: The average age of first marriage fell to historic lows (age 20 for women; age 22 for men), while the proportion of adults who were married soared; the divorce rate after World War II declined by 50 percent; and the birth rate surged ahead 60 percent, with average completed family size climbing from 2.3 children in 1940 to nearly 4 children in 1957. It is imperative that we understand what happened in this remarkable period, both the original sources of renewal and the causes of ultimate failure. The first source of family renewal in the 1940-65 period was, I believe, a strengthened "family wage" culture. Since the 1840's, as noted earlier, eccentric business leaders, labor unions, reformers, and religious theorists had struggled to blunt the pressures of industrialism on the home through creation of a "family wage," delivering an industrial income to male heads-of-households adequate to sustain a family. Their proudest achievement was the liberation of many married women from toil in the factory, so that they might care for the home and children and so prevent the full industrialization of human life. To be sure, such a system did rest on intentional job and wage discrimination against women: the widely accepted argument was that women workers deserved only an "individual" wage, since they usually had no dependents or worked only to supplement a husband's wage. It is true that U.S. wartime regulations in 1942 ended direct wage discrimination against women: equal pay for equal work was basically achieved by 1945. But for another 20 years, through 1965, "job segregation by gender" more than compensated for this. Women workers crowded into so-called "women's jobs" such as clerk typist or nursing that invariably paid less than "men's jobs," and the "wage gap" between males and females actually grew. As Nobel-prize winning economist Gary Becker has shown, this sort of change should be associated with more marriages and more births, which is just what occurred. Public policy proved supportive. Tax reforms in 1944 and 1948 created a strongly pro-family U.S. tax code. While marginal tax rates were high, the personal exemption was set at $600 per person, roughly 18% of median household income. In effect, the progressivity of the Federal income tax was being offset by family size. Congress also introduced "income splitting" in 1948, giving a strong incentive to marriage and placing a real financial penalty on divorce. Through these reforms, legal marriage and children became a citizen's most valuable tax shelters. Meanwhile, federal housing subsidies for families grew dramatically. Tax benefits included the exemption of both imputed rent and mortgage interest from income taxation. Subsidized VA and FHA loans were restricted by custom and regulation almost exclusively to young, married-couple families. A third factor was the renewal of family-centered religion. The fertility increase in the late 1940's was largely the consequence of new marriages and a "catching up" on babies deferred during World War II. But something else occurred in the period after 1950: a deliberate return of large families of four or more children. This was particularly true among American Catholics. In 1953, only 10 percent of Catholic adults under age 40 reported having 4 or more children, virtually identical to the 9 percent for U.S. Protestants. By 1958, the Protestant figure was still 9 percent, but the Catholic figure had more than doubled, to 22 percent. More amazingly, these new large families defied a law of sociology: they were concentrated among the better educated, with the greatest increase among Catholic women with college degrees. The fertility increase among Catholics also was positively associated with weekly attendance at Mass. In short, it could be fair to label this real U.S. "Baby Boom" largely a "Catholic event." Fourth, the militarization of society played, I believe, an indirect role in family renewal. Instead of demobilization after victory in World War II, as had happened after all other U.S. wars, Americans entered a "Cold War" and sustained a large peacetime standing military force throughout the 1950's and early 60's, a unique development. For a majority of American males, military service became a common experience, and the conformity and obedience learned there seems to have passed over into conformity in the civilian domain, as so-called "organization men" settled into family life. And fifth, intellectuals lent their support as well. Harvard University's Talcott Parsons, the era's most influential sociologist, celebrated the "upgraded" family system of the 1950's, which he called the "companionate family," focused on the "personality adjustment" of adults in the suburbs. In the field of psychology, John Bowlby set the tone by stressing the importance of a full-time mother for children, particularly infants. And the discipline of Home Economics reached the peak of its influence, in the effort to give content to the title, "household engineer." This reorganized U.S. family of the 1950's*whether in the sociologists' image of "an organization man" married to "a household engineer" in a "companionate marriage" focused on "personality adjustment" in the suburbs or in the alternate image of the large religious family*was a unique, and partially successful effort to restore family living in a modern, industrialized environment. But it also proved to be of very limited duration. Statistics from the 1965-80 or "baby bust" period tell the tale: The marriage rate for women, ages 20)24, fell a stunning 55 percent; the divorce rate soared by 125 percent; meanwhile, the U.S. birth rate tumbled 46 percent. What lay behind this rapid collapse of the "traditional family" of the 1950's? (Or, viewed another way, this return with a vengeance of the long term trends?): The obvious cause was the reversal or collapse of the social forces that had created the sense of family renewal a quarter century earlier. To begin with, the conformist America, rooted in a patriotic militarizing of society, was a casualty on the rice paddies of Vietnam. More importantly, Christianity failed in its family-sustaining tasks. Not only did sermons on "chastity" and "fidelity" disappear from many Protestant pulpits. So-called "Mainline" Protestant leadership actually went on the attack, with a National Council of Churches panel in 1961 labelling marriage an "idolatry" and embracing the "sexual modernist" agenda of opposition to population growth, readily available abortion, and the promotion of contraception. The Roman Catholic laity, meanwhile, grew disoriented in the wake of the Vatican II conference of the mid-1960's, opening divisions on family and sexual issues that have still to be closed. Given the widely publicized disputes among Catholic theologians over sexual issues, it appears that the Catholic laity simply followed the easiest of several contested paths of obedience. Even the large family ideal vanished. In 1967, 28 percent of "devout" Catholics still planned to have five or more children; by 1971, a mere four years later, less than 7 percent did. For a time, American Mormons*or Latter-Day-Saints*seemed to be the religious exception here. While fertility tumbled elsewhere in the U.S. during the "baby bust" of 1965-80, the birth rate actually rose in Mormon-dominated Utah, along with average completed family size. Doctrinal constancy relative to procreation and the desirability of large families appears to have caused this divergence from the U.S. norm. However, after 1980, Mormon fertility began to fall, a shift apparently linked to the flow of wives and mothers into the paid labor force. Large families could no longer be easily sustained on one income, while the two-career family could scarcely accomodate a large number of children. The Catholic and Mormon examples suggest that religious enthusiasm, by itself, can defy modern economic incentives for only a generation or so, before surrendering to material pressures. Public policy changes further eroded the "Fifties family." The addition, as an afterthought, of the word "sex" to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, became by 1970 the chief tool used by the state to eliminate job segregation by gender. This brought to an end the nation's informal "family wage" system and increased the pressures and incentives in favor of the outside employment of married women. From the Tax Reform Act of 1963 through the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress and the Presidency also dismantled the pro-family/pro-marriage tax code created in the late 1940's, sharply increasing the relative tax burden of married-couple families with children. Government welfare programs, in effect, transferred still more income from families based on marriage to families created through "out-of-wedlock births." Payroll taxes rose dramatically, falling with their full regressive weight on younger families. Meanwhile, regulatory changes stripped federal housing subsidies of their pro-marriage/pro-family biases, in favor of "non discrimination." By the early 1980's, the evidence even suggested that Federal housing subsidies were encouraging divorce and discouraging children. A legal revolution commenced in the U.S. Courts, where the "rights" of individuals triumphed almost completely over duties toward family and community, a change summarized by the labels "no fault divorce," "children's rights," "the right to privacy," and "abortion on demand." During the 1960's, the leading intellectuals turned on the recently praised suburban "companionate" family, labelling it "distorted," "sexist," even "fascist." As fear of global overpopulation increased, U.S. political leaders mobilized support for restrictions on fertility. In fact, the 1972 Presidential Commission on Population Growth and the American Future declared an open policy war on the U.S. "three child family system." But there were deeper sources of failure, as well, suggesting that the restored family of the 1940-65 era*what most call "the traditional family"*was in fact a fragile creation, a jury-rigged structure lacking a real foundation. One subterranean force was the mounting sexual revolution. The mobilization of 28 million young men and women for war and factory work in World War II shook traditional restraints on courting and sexual behavior, changes summarized in John Costello's able book, Virtue Under Fire. Alfred Kinsey's infamous volume, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, appeared in 1948, raising pornography to the level of popular science. The first issue of Playboy arrived on the newstands in 1953. American film makers quickly moved from the light portrayal of seduction in The Moon Is Blue (1953) to the extra-marital entertainment of The Apartment (1960). While most statistical measures of family life suggested social renewal, rates of illegitimacy and veneral disease climbed at a startling pace in those supposed "happy days." More important, though, was the failure of this family renewal to return functions or tasks to the family household, in any meaningful way. The field of "home economics," rather than focusing on the restoration of productive tasks in the home, tended instead to emphasize the informed consumption of factory-made goods (as in "whiter than white toilet bowls"). Except among Roman Catholics, public education enjoyed nearly complete triumph in the America of the 1950's, with somewhat healthy local variations progressively snuffed out through school consolidation and bureaucratic controls. Using the new medium of television, advertising lept forward in the 1950's as well, whetting ever more appetites for consumer goods, and by its very nature discouraging all forms of family self sufficiency. The "small farm" sector of American agriculture in the South and Midwest, still alive even if deeply troubled as late as 1940, collapsed in these years, sending a last great stream of economic refugees into the cities and factories. Unleashed sexuality and expanded consumerism: These, rather than the authentic family and the household economy, were the true winners of the 1950's. When fresh ideological challenges to the family arose in the following decade*from feminists, militant atheists, neo-Mathusians, and members of the "New Left"*the "traditional family" cobbled together in the 1950's simply vanished, as smoke in a gust of wind. G.K. Chesterton had diagnosed the deeper linkage of perverse sexuality and consumerism back in 1934, for the brilliant, short lived journal, THE AMERICAN REVIEW. He wrote: "Now the notion of narrowing [household] property to merely enjoying money is exactly like the notion of narrowing love to merely enjoying sex. In both cases an incidental, isolated, servile, and even secretive pleasure is substituted for participation in a great creative process; even in the everlasting Creation of the World." Yet the story does not end there. Despite the corruptions of greed and lust, the wages of sin, the desire to create and live in families cannot be wholly extinguished. To be "familial" is part of the nature of human beings. The urge is planted in our genetic inheritance, in our hormonal systems, and in our souls. Humans can try to deny this aspect of their nature, but the desire still returns, in some way, to each generation, opening again the possibility for renewal. And so, in the 1970's, specific events*Federal efforts to regulate public and parochial education, Supreme Court decisions blessing the sexual revolution, the breakdown of discipline and standards in local schools*inspired a critical mass of Christian pioneers to bring their children home. They soon discovered that home was, indeed, a very good place for the education of their children. These pioneer families also found that the nature of their relationships changed, almost overnight, from being consumers sharing the same roof and television set, to being members of a learning enterprise, who needed each other and who profited*morally and practically*from each other. A key productive function lost to the family over a century ago*education*had come home, and the results were at once remarkable, and predictable. Most of these families began to find ways to bring other functions home as well*gardening, food preservation, or a family business and they began to taste the satisfactions of an independence unknown to several American generations. Home educators created a demand for appropriate books, curricula, and software, and new, family-held, "cottage businesses" blossomed. Families shared with friends and neighbors the fruits of their radical break with the recent past. "Home schooling" communities emerged locally, regionally, and*finally*nationally, which in a sense brings my narrative to this time and place. Allow me to summarize: viewed from the historic angle, home schooling is the most promising effort at family institutional reconstruction undertaken in America during the last 150 years. The family, born to and naturally residing in the symbolic "cottage" but then torn apart to the advantage of factory and state, has found a path back to its true home. But I also give a warning: In shaking free from standardization, statism, and consumerism, and in seeking true liberty and autonomy, home schooling families pose a basic threat to the existing regime. Bringing the children home endangers both the government's economy and the economy's government, to use Mr. Berry's phrases. Indeed, when you bring your children home, not only do school districts lose money; the Gross National Product also goes down, as schooling passes back into the uncounted realm of home production. This joint threat explains the legal obstacles that home education faces in every state, and now in the Federal domain as well. As the number of homeschooled children climbs beyond the "insignificant" category*and it probably now has*the dangers will only grow. These realities explain the vital need for organizations such as the Home School Legal Defense Association and The National Center for Home Education, which provide the legal, political, and intellectual shelters behind which home education might survive during this critical phase of growth. A second, and more subtle, danger lies in what my colleague Thomas Fleming calls the American genius for spoiling something fine and true by transforming it into a standardized, marketable lifestyle. I urge you to resist that temptation. While maintaining high standards, encourage the eccentrics and experimenters among you. Patronize the cottage businesses, even if the short-term price advantage appears to lie with the mega-store. Defend the creative anarchy of home education from all efforts at centralization: whether from state, industry, or homeschoolers themselves. Residing again in the family cottage, it is possible to recover certain philosophical truths. Two hundred years ago, Adam Smith, the philosopher of liberty, wrote: "Domestic [or home] education is the institution of nature*public education is the contrivance of man. It is surely unnecessary to say which is likely to be the wisest." Closer to our time, the leading American sociologist (and co-founder of The Rockford Institute), Robert Nisbet, wrote: We can use the family as an almost infallible touchstone of the material and cultural prosperity of a people. When it is strong, closely linked with private property, treated as the essential context of education in society, and its sanctity recognized by law and custom, the probability is extremely high that we shall find the rest of the social order characterized by that subtle but [powerful] fusion of stability and individual mobility which is the hallmark of great ages. And so a cultural revolution has begun, with home education at its heart, aimed at recovering learning standards, family integrity, and sustainable community. The next five to ten years will be crucial in determining this revolution's success or failure; whether it will be the catalyst for rebuilding a family-centered nation, or merely another passing social oddity, of brilliant but brief duration. Much depends on those in this audience. I urge you to meet your leadership responsibilities with steadiness, wisdom, and courage.

The Impact of Home Education on Learning Disabled Children: A Look at New Research Dr. Steven Duvall Dr. Duvall is a behavioral psychologist, who limits his professional studies to objectively measurable behaviors. The methodology he uses is to identify what can be measured and then manipulate the environment to see how it changes what he can measure. One of the factors in education which can be measured is the amount of time and the kind of interactions which take place in school. This has been shown to make a very significant difference in the educational outcomes of students in traditional classrooms. Dr. Duvall is trying to measure what kind of a difference it makes between home and public schools. Two of the biggest differences between home and public special education classrooms are in the physical arrangement of the room and the amount of academic responses. Home schools had children and teachers sitting side-by-side or face-to-face 43% of the time, while special education classrooms had such an arrangement only 6% of the time. This is an obvious educational advantage for home schools. Public school classrooms used a divided group approach most (67%) of the time, and only placed children with special needs in a full group setting 25% of the time. Home schools, by contrast, used the divided group approach only a fraction of the time (11%) and were much more likely to include the special child in a full group experience (43%). Home schools therefore provide special children with more one-on-one attention and more full participation than public school special education classrooms do. Dr. Duvall's most important findings centered on the amount of academic responding on the part of each child with special needs. As a behavioral psychologist, Dr. Duvall is familiar with a large body of research that proves that education is function of the amount of time a child spends in educational interactions, as opposed to the time the child spends merely sitting in class. In this respect, home schools have an enormous advantage over public special education classrooms. Children in public school special education classrooms spent 74.9% of their time with no academic responses. Home-schooled children only spent 40.7% in this mode. (See Figure 1, detailing the amount of time in various academic modes.) Dr. Duvall's methodology was very objective, involving a research technique that has been perfected over the last twenty years. Using a laptop computer, he sat in on teaching sessions and took an observation every 20 seconds, creating tens of thousands of data points that were then fed into a statistical analysis package. His research frequently included a second observer, who double-checked Dr. Duvall's readings to ensure that the observations were truly objective. At the end of the school year, Dr. Duvall measured the children's academic progress. He found a strong correlation between increased academic interaction and increased academic results, demonstrating that home schooling really works for children with special needs. Dr. Duvall concluded with suggestions on how home schoolers could be even more effective in helping children with reading difficulties. His research, which targeted the method of instruction, did not differentiate between different kinds of content. He has a booklet on "Parents as Reading Teachers" which can help parents achieve even better results.

Government voucher programs would be funded the same way public schools are: by forcing all Americans to pay for the education of a few. For many years, home schoolers, along with private schoolers have been fighting this unfair taxation system. Vouchers would give private and home schooled students the same opportunity as the public schools to "feed from the public trough." Should we participate in the same system that has for so long abused our rights? Vouchers would cause a drastic increase in taxes. There are over 5.5 million children who do not attend public schools in this country. If these children suddenly began using money from the state's treasury, taxes would have to be raised in order to compensate the loss. It is highly unlikely that public schools would take a cut in their budgets in order to provide funds for private schools. Edd Doerr, Executive Director of Americans for Religious Liberty, predicts that vouchers would cost Americans 33 billion dollars annually in increased taxes. Today, non-public school parents are being double taxed they pay for public school children and their own. With vouchers, these parents would be triple taxed. In addition to their own children, they would pay for the public school students and the private school students who accepted vouchers. Government money always comes with strings and should. Our government has the responsibility to spend our money frugally. For the government to"just give" vouchers to home schoolers would be irresponsible and pointless. If no strings wereattached to vouchers, why waste the time and money sending tax dollars through a complicatedbureaucracy only to be returned to the parents? Americans are appalled when they hear of how the government seems to give money away to agencies such as the National Endowment for the Arts, which sponsors pornographic material. Home schoolers would be double minded if they wanted "their money" to come with no strings, but wanted strict regulation applied to the NEA's money. Many voucher proponents have conceded that regulation would follow vouchers, but it would not be "excessive." Vouchers would cause private schools to become "public." Supporters argue that vouchers would cause public and private schools to compete againstone another for students, therefore improving education. Why will schools compete for students?Because students bring government money with them. So private and public schools would compete for government money. What makes a private school "private" is that the "public" is not involved. Private schools have consumers; public schools have constituents. When private schools accept government money, they become obligated not to their consumers, but to their constituents. The obligation towards constituents is defined in our nation's laws. Private schools, therefore, would be obligated to comply with government mandates concerning hiring quotas, curriculum standards, etc. In other words, private schools become "public." Top education officials have warned against vouchers. "A public school would become any school that receives students who brought with thempublic monies...."[Lamar Alexander, Secretary of Education under President Bush] "There is no doubt in my mind that there will be some new regulations with voucherplans." [Chester Finn Jr., former assistant secretary of education under Ronald Reagan] Our current Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, has strong reservations againstvouchers. His reason for opposing vouchers is mainly to protect the current public school system, but he has some interesting warnings for private schools: You have to be accountable with public tax dollars...When it comes to taking federal tax dollars and giving those to parents and then having the absence of accountability as far as their children's education, [you] have all kinds of schools in the world come up. People are going around in an entrepreneur way starting schools and dealing with vouchers. If you have accountability, then you lose the private and parochial nature of those schools...It's bad, we think, for private schools and parochial schools. It takes away from them the private and parochial strength which is being totally free from any federal regulations...Any way you look at it, it's harmful to public schools...and I think it's bad for private and parochial schools too.

Ever since Goals 2000 was introduced, national educators have been pushing the idea that if students with specific career interests were allowed to directly participate in those fields (through internships or part-time employment), the students would learn more and have a better chance to get a job when they graduate. When the student completed this program, he or she would receive a "certificate of mastery," showing that the student is thoroughly versed in the specified job, thus giving the graduate an edge when applying for work. Home schooling parents are concerned that the government will mandate that all job applicants have "certificates of mastery" in their field before applying for a job. The federal government has already introduced a bill, H.R. 1617, which includes language referring to "certificates of mastery." Many home schoolers were concerned about H.R. 1617 and its implications. They feared it would be the first step toward the implementation of mandatory skills certificates which all students would need to secure a job. While H.R. 1617 does not mandate either of these elements, the structure is there. The bill establishes local workforce development boards and geographical workforce development areas, along with numerous references to skill certificates, skill standards, and a national skills standards board. The goal of the bill is to eliminate fifty federal education and training programs. Another hundred of these duplicated federal programs were consolidated into four categorical block grants. Because it reduces the size of government programs (it kills the School-to-Work Act passed last year) and is far more efficient than the existing hodgepodge of federal programs, conservatives and Republicans backed this bill. As a result, the vote on September 19, 1995 came down with 345 in favor of passing the bill and 79 against. Of the 79 congressmen against H.R. 1617, only one was a Republican. We have carefully monitored the progress of H.R. 1617 since its introduction. We reviewed the act for any implications to home schoolers and concluded that there is no requirement that all students, including home schoolers, achieve a mastery or skills certificate in order to secure a job. Nor were there mandates for employers to hire only students who had passed a skills certificate test or achieved certain skill standards dictated by the federal government. However, in order to take an extra precautionary step, we contacted several key congressmen and endorsed key amendments prepared by the Family Research Council. We contacted representatives Dave Weldon (R-FL), Curt Weldon (R-PA), Andrea Seastrand (R-CA), and Sam Johnson (R-TX). The most important amendment we highlighted in our letter stated, "nothing in this Act shall mandate any individual to meet federally funded or endorsed industry-recognized skill standards or attain federally funded or endorsed skill certificates." This amendment prohibits the careers Act from being misapplied in the states by mandating that all students obtain skill certificates in order to secure a job. Congressman Weldon's office (FL) promised to circulate our letter and the amendments to other conservative Republicans. Congressman Wayne Allard's (R-CO) office contacted us and also wanted a copy of our letter. They wanted to know what requisite protections home schoolers wanted in H.R. 1617 to alleviate their concerns. Of course we expressed our overall opposition to H.R. 1617 and informed them that we do not feel this is a legitimate role of the federal government. However, for purposes of damage control, we endorsed these amendments. The bill we have prepared and are seeking to have introduced, the Restoring Local Schools Act, would completely wipe out $60 billion worth of programs and end the federal role in education, including many aspects of H.R. 1617 and any other educational programs. In the meantime, it is necessary to affect certain changes in other bills being voted on. These congressmen and other conservatives, contacted by the Family Research Council and other lobbying groups, met with the Chairman of the House Education Committee, convincing him to introduce the most important amendment. As a result, on the floor of the House on September 19, Congressman Goodling from Pennsylvania introduced the amendment and asked for unanimous consent for its immediate consideration-out of order of all the other amendments being considered that day. He was granted permission to introduce the amendment, and it was passed by unanimous consent. H.R. 1617 now states in section 112 and 211(d): Nothing in this Act shall mandate that any individual, particularly youth served under Title II of this Act, be required to choose a specific career path or major, or to meet federally funded or endorsed industry-recognized skill standards or obtain federally funded or endorsed skill certificates. We praise God for this protection and the work of these congressmen in adding the amendment. On October 11, 1995, the Senate voted 97-2 to pass the Senate version of H.R. 1617 (S. 243). The Senate's bill is very similar to H.R. 1617. However, it does not include the amendments the National Center for Home Education endorsed in spite of our attempts to do so. Now both the Senate and House versions of the careers Act are in conference committee in order to reconcile the differences. We have been in weekly contact with the key staff members on the conference committee. They have assured us that our House amendments cited below will remain during the reconciliation process. Neither side has any desire to alter our endorsed provisions. Therefore, we believe home schoolers will be protected. In the highly unlikely event the House amendments are not included in the final version of the bill, we will send out a nationwide alert. Excerpts from H.R. 1617 Section 211. National and State Funding(d) PROVISO.-None of the funds made available under this title shall be used to compel any youth to pursue a specific career or to attain a federally funded or endorsed skill certificate. Youth participating in programs under this title shall be eligible to change their course of study and training. SEC. 112. General ProvisionNothing in this Act shall mandate that any individual, particularly youth served under title II of this act, be required to choose a specific career path or major or to meet federally funded or endorsed industry-recognized skill standards or attain federally funded or endorsed skill certificates.

Only families who are more than 70 miles from the nearest school and have state-certified teaching qualifications are allowed to home school. Even then, a child must be sent to a registered school upon entering fourth grade. According to our latest report from South African home schoolers, three families have been ordered by the Education Department to stop home schooling their children, enroll them in registered schools, or be prosecuted. South Africa needs our help. The U.S. Effected the Release of the Mientjies On December 14, 1993, Andre and Bokkie Mientjies were sentenced to prison for home schooling their children. Mr. Mientjies received a one-year prison sentence, and Mrs. Mientjies received a two-year prison sentence. Their children, who refused to attend the government schools, were put into a children's home by the child welfare department. An Alert to Action was sent throughout the country and distributed at state conferences. Thanks to U.S. home schoolers who bombarded the South African Embassy in Washington, D.C. with protests, the Mientjies were both released from prison after a few months. In a recent letter to Chris Klicka, the South African home schoolers state, "The help of the American people who contacted the South African Embassy for the Mientjies release was probably the most significant step in the achievement of this objective." Your calls to the South African Embassy can make a difference. The Mientjies are out of prison as a direct result of the calls to the South African embassy. New Government Will Not Recognize Home Schooling Despite assistance by Home School Legal Defense Association Senior Counsel Chris Klicka and South African Christian home school leaders in drafting a proposal to legalize home schooling and recognize the right of parents to control the education of their children, President Nelson Mandela's government issued its preliminary recommendations on education and training-and the proposal does not include legalizing home schooling. The "white paper," the first stage before drafting a bill, was released March 15, 1995 and proposed compulsory attendance for all children, compulsory birth registration, and the licensure of all teachers. The proposal even gave the government the power, if deemed necessary and in the best interest of the child, to remove the child from the home for educational reasons. In August 1995, the government issued an equally negative report. The Home School Legal Defense Association sprang into action and circulated an Alert throughout the U.S. asking people to write the South African Embassy. Pressure from the U.S. Works! The result of our letter writing campaign in the U.S. for South Africa was quite extraordinary. The Ministry of Education reversed its position in favor of recognizing home schooling. It also now wants to study home schooling laws in other nations to determine which should be used in South Africa. Now more than ever, we need to step up the pressure in order to convince South Africa to recognize a legal right for parents to home school their children. Leendert van Oostrum, one of the home school leaders in South Africa, comments on the recent breakthrough in a letter to HSLDA: This is, indeed, an historic breakthrough. Not that we should be deceived. It is evidence that the intention is to restrain home schooling as much as they can get away with. This is because they are not making these concessions of their own volition . . . The only reason I can find for the change of tune is the international pressure that has been brought to bear on them on the initiative of HSLDA . . . The tide is turning, but is very far from going out yet. A Plea for Help Dr. van Oostrum ends with this plea: Sustained pressure from the members of HSLDA and other persons in the U.S. is of crucial importance at this stage . . . Most of all, we need the prayers of Christians that we may be able to sustain our efforts for the remainder of the war. A Call To Action The whole family should be involved in writing letters to the South African Embassy. This project can be a great educational opportunity for your children as they learn the importance of the freedoms we have in the United States and how easily they can be taken away. When writing to the embassy, include information on the success of home schooling. Your letter should include an explanation that home schooling is a protected right in all fifty states in America and that more than one million children are being successfully taught at home. Home school children are, on average, scoring twenty to thirty percentage points above public school children on standardized achievement tests. If South Africa is to be a truly free nation, its leaders need to recognize the right of parents to educate their children at home. No doubt many of you were involved in writing letters on behalf of the Mientjies as well as in campaigns to get Christians released from Communist prison camps around the world. Letters from Americans have a tremendous impact on nations seeking aid and support from America. Pass the word! Write to the South African Ambassador and request that his country both recognize the right of parents to educate their children at home, apart from the state schools, and that the parliament would specifically enact legislation to guarantee the right to home school with minimal restrictions. Contact the South African Embassy at: Ambassador Franklin Sonn Embassy of the Republic of South Africa 3051 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20008 (202) 232-4400 The impact we have on the South African Embassy will be reported directly to the National Parliament. The influence will no doubt be felt in each of the nine provincial parliaments as well.

CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD by Christopher J. Klicka, Esq. On February 14, 1995, the Clinton Administration through Hillary Clinton declared war on parents' rights in America. On that day, Hillary Clinton announced that the United States would sign the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and send it to the U.S. Senate for ratification. Hillary Clinton described the Convention as advancing a "noble cause, to promote the well-being and protect the basic rights of children throughout the world." (John Harris, "U.S. to Sign U.N. Pacts on Child's Rights," Washington Post, February 11, 1995, A3) On February 23, U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright signed the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child for the President. Commenting on the move by the President, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey stood up that same day in the U.S. Senate and declared, This marks a small, but long overdue step toward improving the lot of the world's children. I urge the President to take a much larger, and equally overdue step, and submit the Convention at once to the Senate for advice and consent to ratification( The lives of children are at stake until we ratify this Convention, we will be unable to exert the leadership necessary to make a difference in the lives of the world's children. President Clinton has done the right thing by instructing Ambassador Albright to sign the Convention. He should now submit it to the Senate and we should ratify it without delay. (Congressional Record, page S-292, 55 lines). The pressure is on. The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child was unanimously adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on November 20, 1989. The Convention drafting process spanned ten years, during which the United States was an active participant. The year 1995 was targeted by UNICEF for universal ratification. At this point, 176 nations including the Vatican and virtually every major industrialized nation are signatories to the Convention. The United States is one of the last nations who have not ratified this Treaty. President Clinton is embarrassed and is being subjected to extraordinary international pressure from the child's rights organizations. In fact over 150 groups have indicated their support for the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and are urging Clinton to send it to the Senate. These include the National Education Association, the National Council of Churches, the Children's Defense Fund, American Council for Social Services, the National Committee for the Rights of the Child, the National Council for Child's Rights, Planned Parenthood, International School of Psychology Association, the National School Board Association, the American Bar Association, the International Council on Social Welfare, and more. In fact, one of the groups urging passage of the Treaty is the American Academy of Pediatrics, which represents 40,000 pediatricians. They wrote to President Clinton stating, Opponents of the Convention, many of whom oppose the portions of the Treaty banning corporal punishment for minors and home schooling have been contacting Senate offices. Therefore, it is critical that the Senators and the President hear that there is broad-based, grassroots support for the treaty. Fellows are encouraged to contact their Senators and the President in expressing support for the Convention( The path is set and the push has begun for the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child to be ratified by the U.S. Senate. The timing of exactly when the President will send the Treaty to the Senate is not known. At a moment's notice, however, we have to be ready to fight to prevent the U.N. Treaty from being ratified by the U.S. Senate. What Difference Does the Treaty Make in Affecting our Parental Rights in America? According to the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, a treaty directly applies to all citizens in the United States. Article VI, Section 2 states: All treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution of the laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. Therefore, otherwise valid state laws pertaining to education and parents' rights throughout the states which conflict with the provisions of the Treaty will be nullified by our own U.S. Constitution. In Missouri v. Holland (252 U.S. 416), the Supreme Court held that a treaty made by the President of the United States with the required concurrence of two-thirds the Senate, is under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, Section 2, and becomes part of the supreme law which takes precedent over contrary state laws. In other words, if the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child is sent to the U.S. Senate and ratified by two-thirds of the senators, the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child becomes the supreme law of the land. Therefore when aspects of the Treaty conflict with present federal precedence on parents' rights, it will be up to the courts to balance and resolve a conflict. The state laws, however, will simply be superseded. Why is the Convention on the Rights of the Child so Dangerous? In compliance with the Treaty, the United States will be obligated to "ensure" various rights of children. Howard Davidson, Director of the American Bar Association Center on Children and Law, and Cynthia Price Cohen, member of the Ad Hoc Non-Governmental Group on the Drafting of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, have written a treatise, which was published by the American Bar Association in 1990. The book is entitled, "Children's Rights in America: U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child Compared with United States Law." On page 35 of the book, Davidson and Cohen comment on the meaning of the word "ensure" and how it binds signatory nations: In the accepted hierarchy of treaty terminology, a State Party's promise to "ensure" a right denotes the highest degree of obligation. The word "ensure" requires more than mere non-interference with the exercise of a right; it requires a state party to take positive measures, legislative and otherwise, to make sure that the right can be effectively exercised. The authors mention that the word "ensure" is used 32 times in the substantive portion of the Convention and that "its frequency reflects the degree of seriousness and commitment that delegates gave to the rights of the child" (p. 36). If the United States ratifies the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, the U.S. government will be obligated to "ensure" the following: That every child shall be registered by the government immediately after birth (Article 7.1) Government tracking of all children will be required. That every child shall receive the highest attainable level of health care services (Article 24.1) In Chapter 11 of the American Bar Association book by Davidson and Cohen, they state that this provision indicates that a mandatory federal health insurance plan would be necessary to comply with the Treaty. That no child is subjected to corporal punishment. Article 28.2 states that all schools must be prohibited from using corporal punishment. In Article 19.1, and in Article 37 (a), it not only prohibits school authorities from administering corporal discipline, but it also applies it to "parents, legal guardians, or any other person who has care of the child." This Treaty will essentially outlaw spanking. In fact, Canada, one of the signatories of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, is presently reviewing their criminal code to see if parents can legally spank their children. According to Justice Minister, Alan Rock, "As a signatory to that Convention, Canada became obligated to review its own domestic laws to ensure that they reflect that international principle of basic decency." Canada is presently on course of attempting to ban spanking as a result of its attempts to implement the U.N. Treaty. (Rapid City Reporter, "Senators Question Wisdom of Children Rights Treaty," August 2, 1994, quoting a press release from the Evangelical Press Association). Who says this Treaty is cosmetic? Under the U.N. Treaty, the United States will be required to ensure that children are vested with "freedom of expression." Section 1 states that a child has a right to "seek, receive and impart information of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child's choice." This essentially gives children the right to listen to rock music, watch television, and even have access to pornography. Furthermore, children are guaranteed the "freedom of thought, conscience, and religion." This will give children the right to object to their parents' religious training and participate in religious services of other cults. The child under the Treaty would have the "right to freedom of association." Parents would be prevented from prohibiting their children from associating with certain other children or gangs. A child will be given a "right of privacy," which of course would open the door for children to get access to abortion over their parents' objection. This would virtually invalidate all parental notification laws concerning abortion. Public education for the first time would be a "right" to all children of the United States under the U.N. Convention. Parents interfering with the child's right to choose public education would be violating his rights and could be subject to prosecution. In Article 29, the American Bar Association treatise by Cohen and Davidson indicates this Article would force the public schools of America to adopt "federally prescribed curriculum content" (p.177). Furthermore, the curriculum would "prescribe certain values which the State Parties agree to transmit the children through education." Each child would be required to be prepared to be a responsible citizen by having "the spirit of understanding, peace, toleration, equity of sexes, and friendship for all peoples, ethnic, national and religious groups of indigenous origin." (Article 29) Cohen and Davidson further comment, "It is conceivable that the Court could someday move toward prescribing some values content in private school curriculum" (p.182). They assert that private schools "must conform to certain standards, specifically those enumerated in Article 29 and such minimum standards may be laid down by the state" (p. 180). They specifically criticize curriculum used by Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) and the teaching in Bethany Baptist Academy in Illinois since their teachings of Christianity as the only true religion "flies in the face of Articles 29.1(b), (c), (d)" (p. 182). Under the Treaty, governments must enforce the right of the child to "freely participate in cultural life and arts." Cohen and Davidson in the American Bar Association treatise indicate that Article 27 would require the United States to increase massive social welfare programs for children. They state: the Convention should be required as requiring the U.S. to move progressively toward child support, social insurance, parental support and income maintenance policies and practices that ensure that every child in the U.S. has in the words of Article 27, 'a standard of living adequate for the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral, and social development.' The U.S. Congress and the President must in this decade attack the problem of child poverty with the same vigor as their predecessors attacked the problem of elderly poverty... Improvements in the minimum wage, the availability in the amount of tax credits, education, job training, and job creation efforts, social insurance programs and benefits and safety net programs are all necessary. (p. 214) The cost of the ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and its subsequent implementation would be staggering. It is clear from these few examples above that this Treaty would virtually undermine parents' rights as we know it in the United States. Parents no longer would have the basic right to control what their children watch on TV, whom they associate with, and what church they attend. Parents could be prosecuted and children be taken away simply because they spank their children or refuse to honor the various rights that the children are guaranteed as cited above. There is no doubt that this Treaty is completely devastating to the traditional parents' rights which our nation was founded upon. The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child is the perfect vehicle to fulfill all the goals of the child's rights organizations and bureaucrats that have presently surrounded Clinton, and are working for an agenda that would eradicate parents' rights. The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child makes it clear that a new standard will prevail as to determining whether or not action taken for or against the child is proper. In Article 3, Section 1, the provision gives the state the power to make all decisions regarding the welfare of the child by divesting parents' of their right to determine what is in the best interest of the child and transferring this right to government. The Treaty states, "In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interest of the child will be a primary consideration." The best interest of the child is a completely subjective standard which will be determined by social workers and not parents. The Juvenile Officers Association of Michigan, Ontario enacted a joint resolution on July 14, 1994 condemning the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child since it has the potential of wreaking havoc in the administration of juvenile justice. In part they state, Whereas the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child presumes that a parental responsibility exists only in so far as parents are willing to further the independent choice of the child; Whereas the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child though in part but in acceptance of its entirety, undermines parental rights and the autonomy; Whereas the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child subverts the role of the parent and diminishes the role of law enforcement, police juvenile officers and juvenile court personnel and other representative professionals, all of whom through cooperation and partnership guide, direct, and counsel and protect the child under the laws of the state of Michigan in the United States of America. The executive board and board of directors of the Juvenile Officers Association of Michigan, Ontario resolved, in representation of its members, to oppose the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. Even the juvenile officers which include sheriff departments, police departments and juvenile courts understand the utter devastation the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child will bring upon the ability of law enforcement officials to punish juvenile offenders. Will This Treaty Actually be Enforced in the United States? In Article 4 of the Treaty, it makes it clear that the signatory nations are bound to "undertake all appropriate all appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures for the implementation of the rights" specified in the Convention. Furthermore, the Convention would require the United States, if it ratifies the Convention, to "undertake measures to the maximum extent of available resources(within the framework of international cooperation" to revamp our present structure to the specified child's rights. In Article 43, an international committee of ten experts has been established to oversee the progress of the implementation of the Treaty. Davidson and Cohen state: ultimately, no law, whether it is local, national, or international can be understood until it has been interpreted and applied to a given set of circumstances by some authoritative source( In the case of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, that authoritative source would be the Committee on the Rights of the Child. The Committee will be made up of ten experts of high moral standing and recognized competence in the field covered by the Convention." (p. 33). For the first time, America will have its domestic policy subjected to foreign control through the arbitrary whims of this Committee of Ten. It drastically subverts the sovereignty of our nation. An example of the Committee's oversight of the various nations that have ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, is a recent report by the Committee in its eighth session dated January 1995. The report is called, "Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child Concerning United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland." The Committee heavily criticizes Britain for not implementing many aspects of the Treaty. The Committee states, In relation to the possibility for parents in England and Wales to withdraw their children from parts of the sex education programs in schools, the Committee is concerned that this and other decisions, including exclusion from school [this could include home schooling] the right of the child to express his or her opinion is not solicited. Thereby the opinion of the child may not be given due weight and taken into account as required under Article 12 of the Convention. This seems to be a direct attack on parents' rights to choose the form of education and content of education for their children. It also implies that some parents are excluding their children from school, which would impact those families who choose not to send their children to school and teach them at home instead. Furthermore, the report by the Committee of Ten states, (the Committee is deeply worried about the information brought to its attention regarding judicial interpretations of the present law permitting the reasonable chastisement in case of physical abuse of children within the family context. Thus the Committee is concerned that legislative and other measures relating to the physical integrity of children do not appear compatible with the provisions and principles of the Convention, including those of its Articles 3, 19, and 37. The Committee is equally concerned that privately funded and managed schools are still permitted to administer corporal punishment to children. Essentially the Committee is pointing out that spanking is still allowed in Britain, which is a violation of the U.N. Treaty. Furthermore, the Committee found, "In this connection the Committee observes in particular that the principal for the best interest of the child appears not to be reflected in legislation in such areas as health, education, and social security, which have a bearing on the respect for the rights of the child." The power and scrutiny of this foreign Committee of Ten to criticize other nations is very dangerous and attacks the sovereignty of that nation. The result of any nation who does not follow the recommendations of the Committee of Ten could easily result in the United Nations enacting some type of sanctions on that nation. The other way the Committee of Ten's critique could affect Britain is if Britain's government feels obligated along with its court system to implement these changes by legislation or court decisions. Who says this U.N. Treaty is harmless? In the United States, since the Treaty is the supreme law of the land, the authorities, in the government and the courts have an obligation to apply correctly the provisions of the Treaty and will thus be forced into following recommendations of the Committee. Can the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child be Amended by the United States? The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child can only be amended through an eight step process. First at least one-third of the nations must favor a conference even to discuss an amendment. Once a conference is convened, a majority of the nations present at the conference must vote to adopt the amendment. Then it must be submitted to the full General Assembly for approval. If the amendment is approved by the General Assembly, it must be then be accepted by two-thirds of the participating nations. The great difficulty in amending this Treaty is unthinkable. To bind ourselves with such a treaty dictating domestic policy by foreign powers would simply weaken our own national sovereignty while creating no benefits whatsoever for our nations and its citizens. Doesn't the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the ChildPromote the Primacy of Parents in the Life of the Child? Senator Bill Bradley, when proposing that the Senate immediately ratify the U.N. Convention, indicated that the Convention is explicit on the primacy of the parents and in the life of the child. He quoted Article 5, which states "State Parties shall respect the responsibilities, the rights and duties of parents(to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate in the direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention." A close look at this Article and other examples of the U.N. Treaty referring to the primacy of the parents indicates that it is nothing more than "lip service." In other words, although the terminology is used, in actuality, the parents' rights are subservient to "the evolving capacities of the child" and exercising conjunction with "the rights recognized in the present Convention." The Convention so undermines the rights of parents their rights are already taken away. The fact that the parents' rights are still recognized in their limited capacity has no relation to the present capacity of parents' rights in America today. Under the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, a parent's right to control the religion, health, and training of his child is virtually nonexistent. Social workers will play the key role in determining the best interest of the child. Conclusion The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child clearly gives children the fundamental rights of freedom of association, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, the right to choose their education, the right of access to media materials, the right to abortion, the right to be free from spanking, the right to health care and many more rights which do not presently exist. Furthermore the Treaty would put Christian schools at risk since they teach a curriculum that would be outside the requirements of the Treaty. The Treaty makes it clear that infringement on a child's rights in any of these areas could cause the parents to be prosecuted with the possibility of having the child removed from the home. This Treaty, if it becomes the law of the land in the United States, once it is ratified by the U.S. Senate, will have to be balanced by the federal courts and will be used to empower child's rights advocates in our already uncontrollable welfare system. The rights which the Treaty gives children are in direct opposition to those of those parents' rights and will only wreak havoc by causing untold litigation in our country. The bottom line is that we do not need the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child in the United States. We already have a massive child welfare system in place throughout the country. In a few areas, the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits such things as slave labor of children. To be sure, this is of great significance in lesser developed nations, where child slave labor may be prevalent, but in the United States it is not relevant! We do not need to sign this Treaty to maintain our position as a world power, nor is our signing of this Treaty necessary to influence other nations to clean up their human rights records for both adults and children. To sign the Treaty for this purpose is completely illogical, especially when it poses such a terrible risk to the parental rights and freedoms of U.S. citizens. Since the United States takes treaties seriously, we will have to implement these aspects of the Treaty by the mandates of our own constitution under the Supremacy Clause. The Treaty is better designed for nations like China and Iraq. In fact, China willingly signed on to the Treaty. However, it means nothing to China since China does not have any provisions in its constitution which makes treaties the supreme law of the land. It is purely cosmetic. Entering into a treaty of this type is virtually irrelevant for all those nations that most need to protect children in at least as far as we already do in the United States. Call to Action Home schoolers and parents throughout the United States must sound the alarm to everyone. This Treaty will devastate our nation in many ways. We must educate our neighbors. Pass out fact sheets exposing the dangers of this Treaty and continually call your U.S. Senators. Even if this Treaty is defeated this year, it will never die. Treaties can be brought up indefinitely in subsequent years for as long as the Treaty exists. This effort for all of us is a continuing effort from which we can never rest. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. Particularly in this instance. We as home schoolers, as parents and as lovers of freedom, must not be ambivalent or apathetic concerning the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. This Treaty must be opposed and it must be stopped. Call your U.S. Senator. We need to get his written commitment to oppose this Treaty. It only takes 34 U.S. Senators to block the ratification of this Treaty and that is possible. Senator Dole on February 24, 1995, stood before the Senate and condemned the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. Thousands of phone calls is what got him on his feet! He stated, Mr. President, in the past several days, I have received thousands of calls from all over the country in opposition to this Convention. My office has not received one call for it. These contacts have raised many serious problems that need to be examined. They have raised questions about Articles 13, 14, and 15, which grand children the freedom of speech, thought, conscience, religion, association, and assembly. Could these articles be interpreted to limit the ability of parents to decide for themselves how best to raise their children? Should U.S. citizens be subject to some sort of international committee that enforces compliance with Article 28(2) which states: "State Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that school discipline is administered in a manner consistent with the child's human dignity and in conformity with the present Convention?" Under Article VI of the Constitution, Senate ratification of this Treaty would make it the supreme law of the land. Would the Convention then supersede Federal and State laws? What would the effect of the convention be on the Tenth Amendment? Is the Convention merely a symbolic exercise, or will it actually require the United States to take actions? These are sincere questions from sincere people. They deserve answers( (I also believe we in the United States have made significant progress in protecting the rights of the child through Federal, State, and local laws. These laws are better equipped to deal with the varying challenges posed by the issue of child rights. If there is one thing this election taught us, it is the need to get excessive government out of people's lives. This applies to the Federal government, and it certainly applies to the multilateral, quasi-government that is, the U.N. (Congressional Record, page S-3081) Dole's response is proof we can make a difference! Thousands of calls and letters also prompted Senators Lott and Helms to introduce Senate Resolution 133 on June 15, 1995. This Resolution (S.R. 133) specifically condemns the treaty and asks President Clinton not to send it to the Senate for ratification. S.R. 133, in its entirety, states: Expressing the sense of the Senate that the primary safeguard for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President should not sign and transmit it to the Senate. Whereas the Senate affirms the commitment of the United States to work with other nations to enhance the protection of children, the advancement of education, the eradication of disease, and the protection of human rights; Whereas the Constitution and laws of the United States are the best guarantees against mistreatment of children in our country; Whereas the laws and traditions of the United States affirm the right of parents to raise their children and to transmit to them their values and religious beliefs; Whereas the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, if ratified, would become the Supreme Law of the land, taking precedence over State and Federal laws regarding family life; Whereas that Convention establishes a "universal standard" which must be met by all parties to the Convention, thereby inhibiting the rights of the States and the federal government to enact child protection and support laws inconsistent with that standard; Whereas the Convention's intrusion into national sovereignty was manifested by the Convention's 1995 committee report faulting the United Kingdom for permitting parents to make decisions for their children without consulting those children; Now therefore be it Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that: The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child is incompatible with the God-given right and responsibility of parents to raise their children; and that The Convention has the potential to severely restrict States and the federal government in their efforts to protect children and to enhance family life; and that The U.S. Constitution is the ultimate guarantor of rights and privileges to every American, including children; and that The President should not sign and transmit to the Senate that fundamentally flawed Convention. Therefore, call your U.S. senators now and let them know that this Convention is unacceptable in any form and must not be ratified by the U.S. Senate. Ask them to sign Senate Resolution 133 now in order to protect your rights as parents. As of June 28, 1995, 32 U.S. senators have signed S.R. 133 or committed in writing to oppose the treaty. We still need at least two more to block ratification. You can contact your U.S. Senator by calling the Capitol switchboard (202) 224-3121 or by writing to your U.S. Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510. To do nothing is not an option. The freedom of the family is at risk. The stakes could not be any higher. Act now before it is too late! Most of all, pray! God alone can give us the victory!

Eighteen other Senators feel the same way about the proposed treaty called "The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child." In addition to the Senator from North Carolina, other cosponsors are Senators Lott, Abraham, Ashcroft, Coats, Craig, DeWine, Faircloth, Frist, Gramm, Grams, Hatch, Kempthorne, McConnell, Murkowski, Nickles, Santorum, Smith and Thurmond. I am honored to stand with such a distinguished group of Senators who feel, as I do, that President Clinton -- indeed no President -- should sign and transmit such a document to the U.S. Senate. If the President does attempt to push this unwise proposal through the Senate, I want him to know, and I want the Senate to know, that I intend to do everything possible to make sure that he is not successful. Mr. President, more than 5,000 letters from across this country have poured into my office in opposition to the so-called "Convention on the Rights of the Child." I have received only one letter in support of this proposed treaty. The consensus is so evident in this mass of letters. It is stated, as a matter of fact, by Ron Christensen, of Fullerton, Nebraska, who put it this way: "Every facet of our life is already being regulated by some 'politically correct' do-gooder. Our freedom is gradually being eroded under the pretext of 'protecting us.' This Convention, if ratified, would give children rights and privileges that they are not mature enough to handle, and would make any guidance and discipline from parents extremely difficult." That was Ron Christensen of Fullerton, Nebraska. Mr. President, the truth is, the American people are just not buying this bag of worms. This proposed treaty is yet another attempt, in a growing list of United Nations ill-conceived efforts, to chip away at the U.S. Constitution. If ratified, this treaty would leave the United States open to hostile attacks on several fronts, particularly for any reservations to the treaty placed to try to safeguard U.S. Constitutional liberties. And from whom would those attacks come? From such gentle souls as Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro, and other tyrants, who are just some of the parties who are signatories to that treaty. Mr. President, let me state just one example. Recently, a United Nations committee -- established under another human rights treaty, the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights -- issued a document that would rewrite international law by reserving for itself the right to approve reservations to treaties approved by the U.S. Senate. As the saying goes, "how do you like them apples?" General Comment No. 24 issued by the United Nations committee arrogantly states, It necessarily falls to the United Nations committee to determine whether a specific reservation is compatible with the object and purpose of the covenant. This is in part because it is an inappropriate task for States parties in relation to human rights treaties, and in part because it is a task that the Committee cannot avoid in the performance of its functions. It goes on to say, The normal consequence of an unacceptable reservation is not that the covenant will not be in effect at all for a reserving party. Rather, such a reservation will generally be severable, in the sense that the covenant will be operative for the reserving party without the benefit of the reservation. Bullfeathers, Mr. President. These reservations attached to treaties by the U.S. Senate are put there to protect the rights of the American citizens and protect the meaning of the U.S. Constitution. Yet, the United Nations claims for itself the right to strip U.S. reservations to any treaty, and nevertheless hold the U.S. bound to all of the obligations of the treaty. This attempt by the United Nations undermines the U.S. Constitution and is an outrage. I cannot believe any Senator is naï¿½ve enough to subscribe to such nonsense. Anybody wanting to know why Americans are becoming increasingly fed up with the United Nations need only consider the words of one U.N. official who said, regarding the U.S. human rights report to the United Nations, "The United States Constitution was not sacrosanct and had required some amendment over the years. The judiciary must be made aware of the evolving legal standards coming out of the application of the Covenant." So, Mr. President, the United Nations' view of the U.S. Constitution and the U.S. Senate reservations to human rights treaties is quite clear. The United Nations, not the U.S. Senate, claims to know what is best for Americans. To which the majority of Americans will reply, and I say again: "Bullfeathers." In light of these statements and this insane interpretation of international law, any Senate reservation to the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child regarding, say, the death penalty, or routine protections of the constitutional liberties, very well could unilaterally be discarded by the United Nations, leaving the United States open to attack for failing to "comply" with the treaty. This treaty must be rejected on its merits, or lack thereof. The United Nations' absurd posture regarding the Senate reservations to treaties is enough to dismiss any possibility of U.S. ratification of any United Nations human rights treaty. I will say parenthetically, Mr. President, as long as I am chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, it is going to be very difficult for this treaty even to be given a hearing. As for specifics of this treaty, Mr. President, Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that States Parties "shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child." What on earth does this mean? Will the U.S. be censured because a parent did not leave it to a child to choose which school to attend? Will the U.S. be censured because a parent did not allow a child to decide whether to accompany the family to church? Will the U.S. be censured because a parent did not consult a child before requiring that he or she complete family chores? These are not Jesse Helms' hypothetical questions. A report by a Committee, established under the Convention, indicates that failure to consult a child in the previously mentioned areas are potential violations of the Convention. That report stated: In relation to the possibility for parents in England and Wales to withdraw their children from parts of the sex education programs in schools, the Committee is concerned that in this and other decisions, including exclusion from school, the right of the child to express his or her opinion is not solicited. Thereby the opinion of the child may not be given due weight and taken into account as required under Article 12 of the Convention. Does this mean, Mr. President, that American parents will be forced to allow their children to attend sex education classes? The constituent whom I quoted when I began these remarks lamented the possibility of more politically correct do-gooders regulating every facet of our lives. The American people do not need yet another body determining what is in the best interest of U.S. families. And the Senate should not inflict one on them. The U.N. Convention is incompatible with God-given rights and responsibilities of parents to raise their children. It is grotesque even to imagine handing this important privilege over to U.N. bureaucrats. The laws and traditions of the United States affirm the right of parents to raise their children and to transmit to them their values and religious beliefs. Mr. President, the United States Senate must not dignify this strange document by allowing the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child to be considered. That is why my distinguished colleagues and I are pleased to offer this Resolution requesting that the President refrain from any temptation to submit this proposed treaty to the Senate.
